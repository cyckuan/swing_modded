STATE BEGINS MANDATORY SUPERVISED DIVING FOR TEENS

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
   GARDNER, Kan. _ Whenever a car leaves the driveway at the Trigg
house in rural Gardner, chances are 15-year-old Whitney Trigg will
be behind the wheel. Either her mother or father will be in the
passenger seat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Whitney wants to drive by herself when she turns 16 in
September, that's the way it has to be.
</P>
<P>
   Effective July 1, Kansas law requires that 16- and 17-year-olds
have at least 50 hours of adult-supervised driving experience to
qualify for an unrestricted license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much anywhere we go, she drives,'' said Julie Trigg,
Whitney's mother. ``I think the 50 hours is a terrific idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A parent or guardian must sign an affidavit certifying that the
50 hours have been completed. At least 10 of the 50 hours must be
at night. Time spent behind the wheel in driver education classes
counts toward the 50 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed during this year's legislative session and was
signed by Gov. Bill Graves, putting Kansas in company with 33 other
states that have graduated driver's license laws, according to the
AAA Automobile Club of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age drivers in Kansas are eligible for instructional or
farm permits at age 14, restricted licenses at 15 and unrestricted
licenses at 16, provided requirements are met.
</P>
<P>
   In another new facet of Kansas law, any person younger than 16
with a restricted license who is convicted of two or more moving
violations will remain restricted until age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers with farm permits or restricted licenses may not
transport nonsibling minor passengers unless accompanied by a
parent. Doing so will be considered a moving violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can stress this point, we hope it will curb the careless
driving you sometimes see in young people,'' said Sgt. John
Eichkorn of the Kansas Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is one of three states that have graduated driver's
license bills awaiting governors' signatures to become law. Chris
Sifford, chief of staff for Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, said the
governor is still reviewing the bill and has not decided whether he
will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would raise the age for an unrestricted license to
18 but would allow 16- and 17-year-olds who have met requirements
to drive alone, except from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., when a parent or
guardian would have to be present.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind the graduated driver's license laws is
safety. In Kentucky, which was among the first states to adopt a
graduated driver's license law in 1995, vehicle fatalities among
16-year-olds have dropped 88 percent, said Lori Haskett of AAA
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, teen-agers made up just 8.5 percent of drivers in
1997, but were involved in 14.3 percent of wrecks, according to
state Department of Transportation statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Kansas, including AAA, wanted to see the minimum age for
an unrestricted license go up to 17. However, opposition from rural
areas and some urban areas kept such a proposal from advancing in
the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good compromise,'' said state Rep. John Ballou
of Gardner, vice chairman of the House Transportation Committee.
``It still allows them to get a license (at age 16), but most
importantly to get some experience before they're out on their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents who have provided chauffeur service for years
appreciate the convenience of their children being able to drive to
and from school.
</P>
<P>
   Ballou acknowledges that some parents will fudge on the 50-hour
requirement, but still believes that any additional time behind the
wheel will help young drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope parents take the 50-hour requirement seriously,'' said
state Sen. Karin Brownlee of Olathe. ``I've had people say to me
it's just another way to lie to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballou and Brownlee both said they've received almost entirely
positive feedback from constituents about the new law. However,
they've also gotten several calls from people with questions.
</P>
<P>
   While her family is abiding by the requirement, Julie Trigg
wonders whether others will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run into so many different types of parents,'' she said.
``Some don't like to be told what they have to do. They think
they're a good judge of their kids' abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-March, the Triggs have been keeping a log of Whitney's
driving time. She's at about 35 hours, but it's taken more days
than she expected to reach that point.
</P>
<P>
   Will the 50 hours make Whitney a safer driver?
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't think I'll be a whole lot better, but it's
just a confidence issue,'' she said. ``Knowing I have 50 hours with
my parents is better than having 15 hours with my parents.''

 CNET TURNS TO ADVERTISING  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Cnet has seen the enemy, and it is ... your geek
friend Joe.
<P>
   The San Francisco provider of computer-oriented Web sites and TV
shows is launching its first major ad campaign over the next few
days, the initial round in a $100 million, 12- to 18-month blitz.
But unlike most advertising, which is designed to steal business
from corporate rivals, Cnet believes that its main competitors are
the friends, co-workers and family members whom even computer
enthusiasts turn to first for tech advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main place people get their technology advice is from
tech-savvy people they know,'' said Annie Williams, Cnet vice
president of marketing. Magazines are another key source, she said.
``But there's a huge amount of frustration'' since those sources
don't always have a full range of information.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet (www.cnet.com), which features news articles and reviews of
hardware, software and other techie products, wants to be the first
place people think of when shopping for tech products or
information.
</P>
<P>
   It targets information technology professionals, only 53 percent
of whom currently turn to the Web first for tech advice; corporate
bean counters who sign off on their companies' tech budgets but
don't necessarily understand them; and computer enthusiasts who
want to learn about the latest gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   If those core groups are won over to Cnet's
``one-stop-shopping'' model, they will influence others to check it
out, said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The television spots feature a young man asking for tech
information from traditional advisers _ a doctor and a professor _
who are unable to answer questions about RAM, modem speed and DSL.
A narrator intones, ``Looking for computer information? There's
really only one place to go.'' The spots finish with the Cnet logo
and tagline, ``The source for computers and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cnet attracts more visitors than any other
computer-oriented site _ it is ranked 17th among all digital
properties by Media Metrix _ only 4 percent of regular Web users
know its name. Cnet archrival ZDNet is ranked 19th.
</P>
<P>
   Halsey Minor, Cnet's chairman and chief executive, hopes the
campaign will boost awareness to at least 10 percent of regular Web
users by the end of the year. The goal is to cement the site's
position as the leader in its niche, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minor expects the campaign to generate enough revenue to pay for
itself in 2000, and to add to profits in 2001. Seven-year-old Cnet
has $700 million in cash and stock on its balance sheet, so it
won't have to scrape to pay for the ads.
</P>
<P>
   By waiting until its seventh year to launch consumer
advertising, Cnet is starting quite late compared to, for example,
Amazon.com, the online bookstore. Amazon consistently posts losses
because it spends so much of its revenues on marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arguably, they should have done this earlier, but they wanted
to have some profitable quarters first,'' said Patrick Keane, a
senior analyst with Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   But Cnet doesn't appear to have been hurt by the late entry,
Keane added. ``If there's a firmly entrenched winner in this
category, it's Cnet, so they can only grow the audience they
already have. It's not like they're AltaVista, trying to get from
fifth to first and coming from absolutely nowhere.``
</P>
<P>
   Cnet's print and outdoor ads feature slogans such as ``Friends
don't let friends give tech advice'' with Cnet's signature yellow
and green colors.
</P>
<P>
   Web banner ads, the only type of consumer advertising Cnet has
done in the past, will constitute about 10 percent of the new
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marks the start of the blitz with radio spots and a
full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. Next week consumers in the
country's 10 ``most wired'' markets will start to see ads on
network television shows like David Letterman and the X Files.
Magazine and additional newspaper ads will begin running next week
and billboards will go up in August.
</P>
<P>
   Williams expects the TV spots, which feature somewhat adolescent
humor, to offend some viewers, especially women.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, for example, a biology professor who cannot answer
a question about modem speed advises his student to look for
answers in ``nature'' and hands him a fetal pig in a jar. The
student is then shown holding the dripping, dead piglet and looking
at it quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   In the second spot, a doctor who cannot answer a question about
RAM decides to perform an anal exam on the patient instead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said focus groups of men in their 40s and 50s loved the
spots. But Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group,
said the ads could hurt the Cnet brand. ``When you're providing
advice, you need to be considered a trusted source. `Wild and
crazy' doesn't go with `trusted' very well,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Williamsburg, N.Y., my neighbors were all European
immigrants. Most were Jewish survivors of the death camps of World
War II. They knew little English and kept to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   American holidays were not celebrated as they had no idea of
national holidays. They were still recuperating from their tragic
and painful European experience.
</P>
<P>
   However, one holiday that did ring a bell was the Fourth of
July. My friends would speak about their good mazal -- luck -- in
being in a free country.
</P>
<P>
   They may have not known the president's name or how the Congress
worked, but they knew that being free in America was the most
cherished gift a person could receive. Little American flags would
mysteriously appear.
</P>
<P>
   I had a friend who possessed an American flag that his father, a
survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, had kept. It was given to him
by an American G.I. during the liberation of the camp. It was his
most cherished possession.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was found in almost every Jewish house of worship. It
would be displayed next to the Ark containing the Torah, the holy
scroll. The message was to revere the flag and respect your
country.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite photo was the American Marines raising the flag on
Iwo Jima.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, supporters of the flag submitted a request to Congress
calling for a constitutional amendment to safeguard the flag. Much
debate is taking place on this issue. The amendment issue makes me
question our society.
</P>
<P>
   What is so disturbing to me is not whether we will pass the
constitutional amendment, but that there is even a need to debate
it. We should always respect our noble flag. It is the right thing
for an American to do.
</P>
<P>
   How did we ever come to this shameful level?
</P>
<P>
   When Patrick Henry said, ``Give me liberty or give me death,''
he never dreamed his words would be used as an excuse to desecrate
the flag.
</P>
<P>
   During the British assault on Fort McHenry, Francis Scott Key
saw the American flag flying triumphantly over the battlements and
was moved to write the Star Spangled Banner. The song later became
the official National Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   It concludes: ``Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: `In God is our trust,' And the star-spangled
banner in triumph shall wave, O'er the land of the free and the
home of the brave!''
</P>
<P>
   During the 4th of July celebrations my family and I will give
respect to our great country by attending a service.
</P>
<P>
   It will give me great pride to recite the Pledge of Allegiance
to the flag.
</P>
<P>
   That is the least I can do for our great country. Maybe you can
include that in your 4th of July celebration.

 WELLS FARGO SETS UP NEW INTERNET UNIT  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Wells Fargo has created a new Internet unit and
named one of its top executives to run it, signaling the central
role that online services will play in the bank's future.
<P>
   In an internal announcement last week, the San Francisco bank
said Group Executive Vice President Clyde Ostler will head the
unit, called the Internet Services Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ostler is charged with making sure that every business unit in
the bank has an Internet plan and a staff to implement it. He will
supervise all Internet and online operations throughout the bank,
as well as other electronic commerce activities still to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense to give one person an overview of such
an important area,'' said John Wilson, a San Francisco executive
recruiter with Korn/Ferry International.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce experts say the Internet rapidly is becoming a key
channel for consumers to buy financial products and services. And
competition is heating up.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few weeks, E-Trade of Palo Alto, Calif., the No.
2 online broker, agreed to buy Telebanc, an Internet banking
company, and Chicago's Bank One unveiled an all-Internet subsidiary
called WingspanBank.com separate from its other operations.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo set up an online financial services division four
years ago to manage computer banking for consumers. It is now the
nation's largest Internet bank, with some 900,000 retail customers
registered to use its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But business units such as retail brokerage, small business and
corporate banking lag in building a presence on the Web. Those
units don't have separate organizations to manage Internet
operations, and some haven't yet developed coherent Internet plans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ostler said his job was to make sure that each
business unit had a full-time staff to take charge of Internet
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had great success with our retail online-services
organization,'' Ostler said. ``I want to make sure that we have
equally dedicated and focused groups for every line of business.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo probably won't build a separate Web-based bank the
way Bank One did, Ostler said. Instead, the bank will emphasize
that it offers customers the choice of branches, automated tellers
and telephone service in addition to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer online banking chief Sharon Osberg, recently promoted
to executive vice president, will report to Ostler. He also will
supervise Internet managers in the bank's other business units, who
still are being selected.
</P>
<P>
   Ostler, who previously reported to President Leslie Biller, now
will work directly for chief executive Richard Kovacevich. ``It's a
signal of the commitment from the very top,'' Ostler said.

MARLINS TOP METS, 4-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The New York Mets had their chances to pull within two
games of the Atlanta Braves. But the Marlins' Mark Kotsay ruined
the Mets' night when he drove a fastball from Armando Benitez over
the right-field fence in the 10th inning for a game-winning home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay's two-out homer on a 3-1 count gave Florida a 4-3 victory
and dropped Benitez to 0-2 on the season. The Braves, meanwhile,
were beaten once again by the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was a little redemption for the Marlins' right
fielder, who had been thrown out twice trying to steal on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kotsay's at-bat, Benitez had retired all 22 Marlin
hitters he had faced this season.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine went over to console
Benitez, who was watching television on a couch, icing his arm and
drinking a beer. Benitez reassured Valentine that he was all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the right attitude,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a good pitch because he hit the ball,'' Benitez
said of the 98-mile-an-hour fastball that Kotsay hit. ``I tried to
throw it inside and it stayed in the middle. I'm fine. It's no big
deal. It's a normal game. Somebody has to win, somebody has to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit a homer, I give him a hat. We play again tomorrow. If I
have to pitch again, I'll pitch again.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez won't pitch again. ``It was his third day in a row,''
Valentine said. ``He was one pitch away from having a day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay's homer came an inning after Roger Cedeno had run the
Mets out of a ninth-inning rally. But the hustling Cedeno was
hardly at fault; it took a tremendous throw from foul territory and
across the infield to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno had drawn a leadoff walk from Matt Mantei. The situation
begged for a stolen base. Mantei was well aware of that. But he
skipped a pickoff attempt past first baseman Kevin Millar. And
Cedeno took off and did not stop.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a little too aggressive of a move. Cedeno,
the major league leader in stolen bases _ he got his 42d tonight _
was trying for third. But Luis Castillo's peg from a retaining wall
that lines the right-field seats was perfect. And Cedeno, who had
slipped rounding second, was an easy out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have made third,'' Cedeno said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets again threatened in the 10th, and again they could not
score. Edgardo Alfonzo led off against Antonio Alfonseca with a
single and was sacrificed to second by Melvin Mora. Mike Piazza
then drilled a pitch to deep right field. But it is 385 feet to the
power alley at Pro Player Stadium, and Kotsay ran the ball down at
the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura was given an intentional walk, but Brian McRae
eventually ended the rally by taking a third strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, trailing by 2-0, tied the score in the top of the
sixth inning on Matt Franco's single, Mike Piazza's double (there
might have been a play at second, but no one bothered to cover the
base), Robin Ventura's rbi groundout and Brian McRae's run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' starter Rick Reed, who had pitched well after
surrendering a two-run homer to Millar in the second, fell behind
again.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lowell, who had come on to play third in the fifth after
Kevin Orie injured his left quadriceps muscle, led off with a
single. Lowell advanced to second on Preston Wilson's one-out
groundout and then scored on Millar's line single past Robin
Ventura as Rickey Henderson bobbled the ball in left.
</P>
<P>
   Millar was having some game. The second-inning home run, a
wallop over the scoreboard in left, was the second homer of the
season for the 27-year-old rookie first baseman, who was a teammate
of Rey Ordonez with the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern
League in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first homer Millar had hit out of the park. His first
major league home run was inside the park at Wrigley Field with two
outs and two strikes in the top of the ninth to beat the Cubs on
May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who allowed three runs and seven hits in five and
two-thirds innings, came out of the game after allowing Millar's
run-scoring single. But the lead was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Henderson drew a two-out walk against Braden
Looper, who had relieved Alex Fernandez (6 innings, 5 hits, 2
runs). Henderson then stole second easily on Looper's first pitch
to Edgardo Alfonzo. And when Alfonzo slapped a single between
Millar and the first base bag, Henderson came home.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the top of the
seventh, and Olerud came on to play first base in the bottom of the
inning.

scroll. The message was to revere the flag and respect your
country.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite photo was the American Marines raising the flag on
Iwo Jima.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, supporters of the flag submitted a request to Congress
calling for a constitutional amendment to safeguard the flag. Much
debate is taking place on this issue. The amendment issue makes me
question our society.
</P>
<P>
   What is so disturbing to me is not whether we will pass the
constitutional amendment, but that there is even a need to debate
it. We should always respect our noble flag. It is the right thing
for an American to do.
</P>
<P>
   How did we ever come to this shameful level?
</P>
<P>
   When Patrick Henry said, ``Give me liberty or give me death,''
he never dreamed his words would be used as an excuse to desecrate
the flag.
</P>
<P>
   During the British assault on Fort McHenry, Francis Scott Key
saw the American flag flying triumphantly over the battlements and
was moved to write the Star Spangled Banner. The song later became
the official National Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   It concludes: ``Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: `In God is our trust,' And the star-spangled
banner in triumph shall wave, O'er the land of the free and the
home of the brave!''
</P>
<P>
   During the 4th of July celebrations my family and I will give
respect to our great country by attending a service.
</P>
<P>
   It will give me great pride to recite the Pledge of Allegiance
to the flag.
</P>
<P>
   That is the least I can do for our great country. Maybe you can
include that in your 4th of July celebration.
</P>

 SECRET CODES MAKE CHEATING PAY OFF FOR GAMERS  &HT;     By JEFF GREEN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- Forget everything you ever heard about
cheating.
<P>
   Cheating is good _ at least in the world of video-console and
computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Once a novelty feature in some games, ``cheat codes'' now are an
inherent, expected part of the video gaming experience. Almost all
games _ whether for Sony Playstation, Nintendo 64, GameBoy or
personal computer _ come with an array of cheat codes built in,
while an ever-growing number of magazines, guidebooks, and
commercial and amateur Web sites provide gamers with those precious
codes.
</P>
<P>
   A cheat code typically is just a series of button presses (on
console games) or keystrokes (on PCs) that players can invoke to
alter a game to their advantage. Codes can allow players to skip
levels, gain additional lives in an action games or become
invincible to attacks from enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``cheats'' are routinely built into every game by
programmers so that they easily can access all areas of the game
for testing and tweaking without having to play it themselves every
time they want to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   Originally secretive about such codes, game publishers now
realize that they are an attractive resource for consumers. Many
gamers simply don't have the time, skills or attention span to slog
through games _ many of which can take literally hundreds of hours
to complete _ without some kind of artificial aid . Now, if a
player finds a particular area of a game too difficult or boring,
he or she simply can plug in a cheat code to move on rather than
having to give up on the game.
</P>
<P>
   This can be useful especially to consumers who rent games at
stores like Blockbuster, where they are under a time constraint to
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll use cheats on the games I rent,'' said a gamer going by
the name of ``Dilbert'' in an informal poll on a Nintendo newsgroup
recently. ``I just want to see as much of the game as possible. On
games I care enough about to buy, like Zelda or Banjo-Kazooie, I
will try to play with absolutely no help at all until I'm
absolutely stuck.``
</P>
<P>
   Besides enabling players to move more quickly through a game,
cheat codes are a huge source of goodies and extra features not
available in the normal course of a game. Plugging in certain codes
in Electronic Arts' Need For Speed: High Stakes racing game, for
example, lets players race in vehicles other than those officially
listed on the box _ as well as a helicopter. In a game like
Midway's NFL Blitz, cheat codes can be invoked to (among other
things) give all your players giant heads, tiny heads or no heads.
</P>
<P>
   Al Amaloo of the Video Game Strategies Web site at About.com,
believes that codes can enhance a player's experience, thus making
the game more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some codes reward gamers with extra bonuses and features and
add more value to their purchase,'' he said. For example, San
Francisco Rush, a Nintendo 64 game, includes a bonus track of The
Rock. Gamers were able to unlock this well-hidden secret some time
after the game's initial release to extend the longevity of the
game, Amaloo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other codes are more like rewards and don't offer the cheap
thrill of immediately spoiling the game,'' he added. ``The cheat
system in GoldenEye 007 comes to mind, where the gamer is rewarded
with the ability to enable cheats based on their performance during
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Game publishers, savvy to this attitude, now actively encourage
their programmers to fill their games with hidden ``extras,'' so
that gamers will keep coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use cheats after I've either beaten a game or it has totally
lost my interest,'' said a gamer with the moniker ``Paladin.'' ``A
nifty code can breathe new life into a game I haven't touched in
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Further enhancing the current cheat-code fever is the popularity
of a third-party hardware add-on called the GameShark, originally
developed by Datel Design and Development in the United Kingdom and
now distributed by Interact Accessories Inc. of Hunt Valley, Md.
The GameShark (and its various clones) plugs into a port on a
Playstation, Saturn, GameBoy or Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, part of a console system's memory is used to hold
certain information about a game in progress, such as how many
``lives'' a player has left or how much ammunition or shields the
player has. The GameShark essentially allows players to override
these values to make the games easier to play. It's especially
advantageous in games that don't have cheat codes built in.
</P>
<P>
   Such devices are neither licensed nor supported by the
console-makers themselves, but they are not actively discouraged
because, again, there's a growing awareness that such codes only
increase gamers' often-obsessive loyalty to certain titles.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, hundreds of Web sites _ both independent fan
sites and commercial ones _ have sprouted up where gamers post and
swap cheat codes, as well as general strategies and tips for
beating the games. Competition for attention is intense, so the
people running sites frantically will hunt down codes and
strategies and strive to get them up as soon as possible, often
before a game even ships. For PC titles (which also have cheat
codes but have less of a fervent subculture surrounding them), Web
sites actively compete to post hint guides and walk-throughs as
fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   For the gamer, it's an embarrassment of riches. A player who is
stuck can log onto the Internet and get the information in seconds.
Mini online communities form and swell with every new game release,
giving players instant free access to cheats, tips, codes and
strategies. The recently released PC role-playing game Might and
Magic VII from 3DO is a typical example, generating hundreds of
posts on Internet newsgroups within the first two days of its
release.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that free information online, sales of magazines
devoted to cheats and strategies are still strong. Some of the
leading titles in console-game magazines include Expert Gamer,
Electronic Gaming Monthly and Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,
all published by Ziff-Davis; GamePro from IDG; PSM from Imagine;
and Tips &AMP; Tricks from Larry Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   Game guidebooks from book publishers like Sybex and Prima also
are in demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people expected strategy-guide demand to go down with
the rise of the Web,'' said Dan Brodnitz, acquisitions and
publications manager of game books at Sybex Computer Books of
Alameda, Calif., ``but sales are still strong across the board.
Even Internet-centric games like Everquest and Ultima Online have
spawned successful books. There's a basic convenience to having the
book open while you're in the game that's hard to beat.''

 DAZZLING DEBUTS BY LOCAL IPOS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- The performance of Bay Area initial public
offerings in the first half of this year was as stunning as any
stunt performed at the X Games.
<P>
   Forty-two local companies, nearly all of them Internet stars or
startups, went public in the past six months, with an average gain
of 138 percent, according to IPO Monitor in Los Angeles. By
contrast, the 41 Bay Area companies that launched IPOs in 1998 saw
an average gain over 12 months of 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area contingent accounted for 20 percent of the 211 U.S.
companies that went public in the past six months. The average gain
for the local companies was more than double the 67 percent
nationwide average.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same six-month period, the Nasdaq composite jumped 22.4
percent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.5 percent and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was up 11.6 percent. The local IPO results in
the past quarter are even more remarkable when one considers that
half the companies have been trading for less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Bay Area IPO gainer was Healtheon Corp., which went
public February 10 at $8 per share and closed Wednesday at $77, up
862.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara, Calif., company, started by repeat entrepreneur
Jim Clark, who previously led Netscape, provides health care
information and services over the Internet. The well-publicized
company, which was an instant hit when it went public, received
another financial boost in May when it agreed to merge with rival
WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Although Healtheon lost $54 million on $49 million revenues last
year, it now has a market value of nearly $5.5 billion. That's on a
par with Golden West Financial, the S&AMP;L in Oakland, Calif., that
earned $434 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The only other newly minted local IPO worth more than Healtheon
is Juniper Networks. This Mountain View, Calif., maker of Internet
networking gear jumped $33.50 to $149 yesterday on growing
enthusiasm about its next-generation routers. The company, now
worth more than $7.3 billion, lost $32 million on $3.8 million
sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   The combined market value of all 42 new local IPOs tops $56
billion but it is hard to find a moneymaker in the bunch. The 10
companies worth the most all lost money last year _ a combined $241
million.
</P>
<P>
   Profits are not what drives pricing of IPOs, especially the
so-called dot-com companies that promise to transform the way we do
business and buy products in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of IPOS01 (76172 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``The public appetite for these stocks is astronomical,'' said
Bob Emery, president of BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``Investors
are paying for the future value of Internet-related stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying a multiple of last year's earnings or
estimated earnings for the current year, buyers of Internet stocks
are paying 10 or 20 times anticipated revenues two or three years
from now, Emery said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said companies like Amazon.com, Yahoo and eBay win even
greater valuations (perhaps as much as four times higher) because
they are the first to market or have the the dominant brand in
their niche.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, BancBoston Robertson Stephens was lead
manager of several local IPOs such as Critical Path and Mpath
Interactive. It also handled six of the nine largest Internet
mergers and acquisitions, including Healtheon-WebMD, ExciteAtHome,
E-Trade-Telebanc and CMGI-Alta Vista.
</P>
<P>
   Emery believes ``some of the valuations will be warranted over
time; others will not.''
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the Bay Area's 42 IPOs in the first half closed
below their offering prices Wednesday. The worst performer was
NetObject Inc., which went public May 7 at $12 per share and closed
yesterday at $8.063, down 32.8 percent. The Redwood City, Calif.,
company, in which IBM holds a majority stake, makes e-commerce
software.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the underwriter with the best IPO performance has
been Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, according to IPO Monitor. It was
lead manager for the three top-performing local IPOs so far this
year: Healtheon, Brocade Communications Systems and Redback
Networks. Since January 1998, Morgan Stanley has managed 36 IPOs
that have gained an average of 140 percent in value since their
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs came in second with an average gain of 90 percent,
followed by Lehman Brothers, 85 percent; Merrill Lynch, 62 percent;
and BancBoston Robertson Stephens, 58 percent. IPOs managed by San
Francisco's Hambrecht &AMP; Quist gained an average of 32 percent
during the past year and a half, while those managed by NationsBanc
Montgomery Securities (now Banc of America Securities) lost an
average of 30 percent.

 PUC URGED TO CONTINUE PG&AMP;E PROBE  &HT;     By REBECCA SMITH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne
is exhorting the state Public Utilities Commission not to drop its
investigation of last December's big PG&AMP;E blackout.
<P>
   Quitting now, Renne says, would amount to dereliction of duty by
the PUC following its dustup, earlier in the year, with a key state
legislator over who has jurisdiction to investigate major power
outages _ the 88-year-old PUC or the state's electric grid
operator, the 15-month-old Independent System Operator in Folsom.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is being taken up next Thursday when the five-member
PUC will consider the separate recommendations of two Republican
commissioners, both of whom want the PUC to terminate its
investigation into the blackout that afflicted more than two
million Bay Area residents, and leave any remedial action to the
ISO.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO previously fined PG&AMP;E $440,000 for the blackout, using
authority conveyed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Renne sent a letter to the commission last week urging it to
continue its probe. It was followed by written comments this week
stating that the record provides no basis for the PUC to delegate
its public-protection duties to the quasi-public ISO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to us like the commission is rolling over in the face
of political pressure,'' said Theresa Mueller, the deputy city
attorney assigned to the case and a former attorney for the
consumer group, The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ``If
they quit now, nothing has been accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Public advocates want the PUC to stay the course for two
reasons. First, they say the PUC _ not the ISO _ has the authority
to subpoena utility records and compel testimony under oath. And
they argue that the PUC, alone, adheres to decades-old rules of due
process that give the public equal access to the regulatory
process.
</P>
<P>
   They fear that ``capitulation'' now would set a dangerous
precedent for the investigation of future outages.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO is a ``nonprofit public benefit corporation'' created by
the Legislature 15 months ago to run the state's electric grid. It
has no power to subpoena utility records and is not subject to the
state's open meeting law or public records act, both laws that
guarantee public access. The ISO doesn't hold public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow suicide for the PUC not to do its duty,'' says Emy
Youngsmith, a PUC staff attorney representing the agency's
enforcement division. ``The people deserve to have the PUC uphold
its authority and act as a public forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the proposals of commissioners Richard Bilas and
Josiah Neeper to close the investigation raise troubling questions
about how adequately the public's right to safe and reliable
service will be defended in the deregulated era.
</P>
<P>
   PUC President Bilas says deregulation means a change in
regulatory structure not just for utilities, but for regulators,
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in transition from where the PUC was the sole authority
over outage investigations to where it no longer is,'' said Bilas.
``That's hard for some people to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations that the agency drop its probe, however,
follows a lashing that the PUC took for allegedly overstepping its
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's 1996 electric deregulation law, the ISO has
responsibility to investigate major ``transmission'' failures that
involve the high-voltage power lines that connect generating plants
with major substations.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC was stripped of that duty but retains jurisdiction over
outages happening on the lower-voltage ``distribution'' system that
connects smaller substations with homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Because blackouts like the one that happened December 8 involve
both transmission and distribution systems, both agencies initially
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the PUC's enforcement division issued its findings in a
controversial report stating that PG&AMP;E had an ``error-prone'' work
culture that contributed to the December outage, which began when
PG&AMP;E employees made several bone-headed mistakes while working at
the utility's San Mateo substation.
</P>
<P>
   That report _ and the $300,000 paid to consultants to prepare it
_ aroused the ire of a powerful legislator, California Senator
Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, the architect of the state's
deregulation plan that created the ISO.
</P>
<P>
   Peace held a hearing of the budget committee, which he chairs,
to probe the PUC's actions and the expenditure. In that hearing, he
lambasted the head of the PUC's enforcement division and said the
PUC's action was ``stupid'' and wasteful because it duplicated some
of the ISO's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of the PUC investigation say it was proper for the
PUC to take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there was some redundancy, so what?'' says Mueller of
the City Attorney's Office. ``The risk is that no one will do a
good job investigating events like this, not that too many people
will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, PG&AMP;E complained to state officials that it was
being double-teamed by the ISO and PUC. PG&AMP;E chief executive Gordon
Smith said the PUC's staff was acting ``irresponsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, ISO chief Terry Winter met with Mayor Willie
Brown to explain what his organization is doing to protect San
Francisco electric reliability. On Tuesday, Winter sent a letter to
the PUC's Bilas commending him for recognizing that ``no further
investigation ... is required.''

 MICROSOFT, INTEL ARE UNITED ON ONE FRONT  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Microsoft and Intel may have bitter differences on some issues, but
they're united in their determination to keep pushing into high-end
territory once dominated by Unix workstations.
<P>
   The two companies rolled out their biggest guns _ Microsoft CEO
Bill Gates and his Intel counterpart, Craig Barrett _ to keynote
Wednesday's opening session of the Workstation Leadership Forum in
Burlingame, Calif. The conference, which the two companies jointly
sponsored, brought together some 600 corporate customers and
software developers in such fields as mechanical and electrical
design, financial services, animation and multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Workstations, which start at about $5,000 but typically cost
upward of $15,000, are high-performance computers used for tasks
too demanding for ordinary PCs. Instead of Intel's chips and
Microsoft's Windows software, they've traditionally used the Unix
operating system and specialized chips based on a principle known
as RISC (reduced instruction set computing). Even though they add
up to a low-volume market compared with ordinary PCs, it's one
that's attractive to the Wintel duopoly because it offers higher
profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between the two companies that surfaced during the
Microsoft antitrust trial were nowhere in evidence Wednesday as the
two leaders assessed _ and celebrated _ their progress in these
markets.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GATES01 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Barrett cited recent research by International Data Corp.
predicting that sales of ``Intel Architecture'' workstations
between 1998 and 2003 will grow 20 percent a year, while sales of
traditional workstations will decline by 5 percent annually during
the same period. Personally, he added, he considers those figures
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel Architecture'' workstations use higher-performance
versions of the same Intel chips that power ordinary PCs. They
typically run Microsoft's Windows NT operating system software.
</P>
<P>
   During the next year, each company will release major new
products targeted in part at the workstation world: Microsoft's
Windows 2000 is due out by the end of this year, and around the
middle of next year, Intel should be shipping a chip code-named
Merced, the first in a family of advanced chips that will run both
today's ``32-bit'' software and new ``64-bit'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Even after it delivers Merced, Intel will continue to develop
new additions to its  &LR; c,12p2  &LR; 32-bit Pentium family (now known as
IA-32) for mainstream markets. Barrett said a 1-gigahertz
(1,000-megahertz) IA-32 chip will reach the market by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moore's law will continue for at least another 15 years or
so,'' he said, citing the computer-industry axiom that chip
capabilities double every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of GATES01 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Most of yesterday's opening session was taken up by
demonstrations of programs that previously that were available only
for traditional workstations but now run on Intel chips and Windows
NT.
</P>
<P>
   Dassault Systems of France, for example, showed its new Windows
version of Catia, a software package widely used for product design
in the aircraft and automobile industries.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Foster, pony-tailed senior vice president for multimedia
at Sony Pictures Imageworks in Culver City, showed previews of
``Stuart Little,'' a Columbia Pictures movie slated for release
around Thanksgiving. Its star, a pet mouse, was created digitally,
then combined with conventional film of the family that adopts him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone in Hollywood has moved to IA/NT (Intel
Architecture workstations running Windows NT) or is trying to
figure out how to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Copeland, an analyst at International Data Corp. who helped
prepare the report Barrett cited, said animation and other
``digital content creation'' applications, as well as financial
services, are the market segments where Intel and Microsoft have
had the clearest success in displacing RISC workstations. He
cautioned, though, that in heavy-duty applications, such as design
of cars, planes, and microprocessors, most major manufacturers
still rely mainly on non-Intel workstations running Unix.

   Woolf, whose films won 13 Oscars, trusted his instincts so
resolutely that he put up half the money for ``The African Queen''
even though a friend, the director Sir Alexander Korda, warned him
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Korda is reported to have cautioned: ``Two old people going up
and down an African river . . . who's going to be interested in
that? You'll be bankrupt!''
</P>
<P>
   The 1951 movie, which starred Humphrey Bogart and Katharine
Hepburn, became a hit at the box office and a movie classic. Bogart
won an Oscar as best actor and Miss Hepburn was nominated for best
actress.
</P>
<P>
   Born on March 15, 1913, in Cricklewood, North London, John Woolf
attended Eton College and Institut Montana in Switzerland. He said
he learned about making films from his father, C.M. Woolf, who made
his fortune by financing, distributing and exhibiting films after
World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, Woolf's father formed General Film
Distributions after resigning from the Gaumont British Picture
Corp. in 1937. He is credited with bringing the producer J. Arthur
Rank into the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf became a managing director after his father died in 1942.
He and his brother, James, formed the successful independent
production company Romulus Films in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``The African Queen,'' Romulus Films produced
such popular movies as ``Richard III'' (1956), a co-production with
Korda that Laurence Olivier directed and starred in; ``Moulin
Rouge'' (1952) and ``Beat the Devil'' (1954); an adaptation of John
Braine's novel ``Room at the Top'' (1959), and the Oscar-winning
musical ``Oliver!'' (1968). In all, Woolf's films won 13 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Woolf extended his reach into television. He
founded Anglia Television, which produced more than 100 plays and
internationally broadcast series like ``Orson Welles' Great
Mysteries'' and ``Tales of the Unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolf was knighted in 1975 for his work in the British film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ann, and a son.
</P>
<P>
   James Bernard Boskey, a children's rights advocate and an expert
on alternatives to the courts for resolving disputes, died on June
14 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. He was 57 and lived in North
Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Seton Hall
University. Boskey was a professor of family law at Seton Hall's
Newark, N.J., law campus.
</P>
<P>
   His skill in settling disputes out of court, like mediating
divorce cases, led him to create The Alternative Newsletter, a
dispute resolution guide for lawyers and mediators that is now in
its 10th year of publication.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote extensively on workers' compensation and the
rights of children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He edited the ``Manual on Child Abuse and Neglect,'' published
by the New Jersey State Bar Association in 1980. He was a founder
of the association's Children's Rights Committee and he helped
shape state legislation intended to protect the children of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Boskey was born in Alexandria, La.. He graduated in 1964 from
Princeton University, where he studied sociology and anthropology.
He received law degrees from the University of Michigan in 1967 and
the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Seton Hall faculty as an assistant professor in
1971. He advanced to full professor in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 29 years, Adele Ludin Boskey, and
their daughter, Elizabeth Boskey of Baltimore.

EDITORIAL: THE FED MAKES A MINIMAL MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   William McChesney Martin Jr., the chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board during the great economic expansion of the 1950s and
1960s, once said that the role of the Fed was ``to take away the
punch bowl just when the party gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the current Fed chairman, on Wednesday served
notice that he does not want to spoil the fun. While the Fed did
raise an important interest rate by a quarter of a percentage
point, as had been widely expected, it also said its policy was now
neutral, rather than biased in favor of a further increase. Wall
Street celebrated by sending the Dow Jones industrial average up
200 points in the first 15 minutes after the Fed announcement.
Greenspan and his colleagues seem to be betting that the economy
will cool down without much action by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been expecting the American economy to slow for the
past three years, but the willingness of consumers to spend rather
than save has kept the economy roaring ahead. Now, with the
manufacturing sector strengthening as overseas economies rebound,
signs of inflation have appeared, as Greenspan noted in testimony
before the Joint Economic Committee two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market had expected the Fed to take stronger action on
Wednesday _ or at least not signal that it would probably forgo
another rate increase _ and the yield on long-term government bonds
slipped below 6 percent after the announcement. But that rate is up
from 4.8 percent late last year, a fact that has pushed mortgage
interest rates up and slightly slowed the strong housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Even with rates rising, however, consumer confidence has climbed
to a 30-year high. That suggests that neither the economy nor
consumer spending is likely to slow soon. If the American economy
continues to grow at the recent rate of above 4 percent, there are
substantial risks that inflation will accelerate and that, with the
record trade deficit continuing to expand, the dollar will
eventually come under heavy pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Those risks will be intensified if the White House and Congress
choose to ease fiscal policy now, either through large new spending
programs or by a big tax decrease. Should that happen, Greenspan
may have no choice but to push interest rates up again later this
year.

EDITORIAL: A NEW COALITION IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   Israel's next prime minister, Ehud Barak, is a career soldier
relatively new to civilian political deal making. But he has shown
great skill in stitching together a cabinet coalition. His
government will be broad based and generally united in support of
negotiating peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements with some parties still need to be completed. But it
now looks as though Barak's government could command at least 75
out of the 120 votes in Israel's parliament and be able to count on
another 10 votes from Arab parties outside the government. That is
more solid backing than any recent Israeli prime minister has
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Barak should use his first months in office to rebuild lost
momentum for peace. Arab leaders, including Syria's president,
Hafez al-Assad, have welcomed Barak's election and signaled their
desire to work with him. Syria's intentions should be tested, not
only by an early resumption of talks on returning the Golan
Heights, but also by seeking Damascus' cooperation in assuring a
peaceful Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has wisely indicated that he intends to treat the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, as a partner, not an adversary.
That was the approach followed by Yitzhak Rabin. Barak is prepared
to carry out Israel's commitments under last fall's Wye River
agreement, and then proceed to the difficult issues of Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements, water, refugees and possible Palestinian
statehood. Resolving these will require good will between the two
leaders and now is the time to build it.
</P>
<P>
   While all the coalition parties promise to support Barak on
peacemaking, they differ on domestic issues like the role of
religion in national life and draft exemptions for yeshiva
students. Barak has deferred several of those issues and opted for
compromise on others. He has allocated some of the cabinet's
religiously sensitive posts to ultra-Orthodox allies while
reserving others for resolutely secular politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Israel's voters gave Barak a strong personal
mandate for peacemaking and reuniting a politically fractured
society. The broad coalition he has now assembled gives him a good
chance for success on both fronts. &QL;

 EDITORIAL: MR. McCAIN'S CHALLENGE TO MR. BUSH  
(sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain has delivered a critical challenge to his
fellow candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.
Speaking Wednesday in New Hampshire, he declared that any candidate
who promises to reform anything _ from education to the military to
the tax code _ must begin by fixing campaign finance. The current
system, he said, is ``nothing less than an elaborate
influence-peddling scheme in which both parties conspire to stay in
office by selling the country to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain picked a good day to take his stand. He had barely
finished his speech when George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner, announced that having raised more than $35 million,
he will probably bypass the federal system under which candidates
agree to abide by spending limits in return for matching
contributions. This is a serious mistake for a candidate who
promises to practice a new and better brand of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush adheres to the Republican congressional mantra that the
defects in the present system can be cured with fuller and faster
disclosure of donations. But we know that neither party can be
embarrassed into forswearing special-interest money. Indeed, the
stunning totals Bush is amassing could goad Vice President Al Gore
into copying President Clinton's reckless methods. Both parties are
already gearing up to make record-breaking demands for the
virtually unregulated ``soft money'' donations that are the most
noxious feature of current campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's challenge inserts a hard note of truth into a
Republican campaign that has recently become a long-running
coronation tour for Bush. He is playing to the differences between
himself and Bush. But the Arizonan was pushing for campaign finance
reform before he became a presidential candidate in need of a
defining issue. When the Senate returns after its recess, McCain
and Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin plan to renew their attempts
to force a vote on their bill banning soft money.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate and House held fair votes on campaign finance
reform, a bill would become law in time to keep the 2000
presidential election from becoming yet another embarrassing
spectacle of money-grubbing. But the GOP leaders in both chambers
are determined to prevent such a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could make the difference. His standing as the leader in
the presidential polls gives him the clout to shove his party's
leaders in Congress toward a fair and open vote on McCain's
legislation. If he chooses not to do so, voters will have a right
to question whether his brand of conservatism offers its compassion
first and foremost to big-money special interests.

 &HT;    Feds to Atlanta Olympic official: Give up papers
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Congressional leaders, frustrated by stonewalling from
Atlanta Olympic officials, have threatened to issue a federal
subpoena for records if the local organization continues to refuse
to turn them over.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House Commerce Committee is demanding unrestricted
access to eight boxes of documents that Billy Payne's Georgia
Amateur Athletics Federation contends are personal and private.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Payne, after receiving word of the committee's
demands, said Wednesday a subpoena would not be necessary. ``We are
going to fully cooperate with the committee's wishes regarding the
access to these few boxes of documents,'' spokesman Lee Echols
said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators say the documents are not personal
but are ``official corporate records'' relevant to their
investigation into improprieties in the Atlanta organization's
campaign to persuade the International Olympic Committee to stage
the 1996 Summer Games here.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the documents are ``relevant to the giving or soliciting
of gifts to or by IOC members and /or their families,'' according
to a harshly worded letter sent Tuesday to Payne by Rep. Tom Bliley
(R- Va.), chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Rep. Fred Upton
(R-Mich.), chairman of its subcommittee on oversight and
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attorneys' suggestion that these records are somehow
personal documents ... is simply unfounded,'' the congressmen
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   They also demanded that investigators be allowed to copy any
papers they deem necessary without identifying the documents for
Payne's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cannot agree to such terms,'' Bliley and Upton warned,
``we will consider all lawful means to secure the entire contents
of these eight boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne's attorneys had requested investigators identify any
record they believe is relevant and provide an explanation for that
relevance. The lawyers also said they would object if investigators
wanted to copy more than a handful of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictions would slow the process, the congressmen said,
and undermine the committee's fact-gathering efforts by providing
Olympic officials with a blueprint of the direction of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The copying of the documents,'' Echols said, ``was an issue we
were simply trying to resolve in a balanced manner. However, we
will cooperate with the decision made by the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The House committee, which started its investigation of the
Atlanta bid effort in early May, intends to conduct interviews and
possibly hearings in early August.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen denied Payne's request for a meeting, saying
their letter would suffice in explaining their position. They also
denied Payne's attorneys' request for reimbursement for the cost of
copying documents.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with King &AMP; Spalding of Atlanta are representing Payne
and the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation in regard to the the
congressional probe. The same attorneys are handling litigation
involving The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Georgia Attorney
General Thurbert Baker, who want the Olympic bid records opened to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   King &AMP; Spalding also is representing several of its own partners
in the Olympic records dispute. Several lawyers in the firm were
active participants in the bid team, including Horace Sibley, who
headed up the team's international relations effort and compiled
dossiers on IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's papers are believed to be among the records Payne and
the firm want to keep secret.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the eight boxes of disputed papers, the
congressmen demanded that Payne produce by July 9 some 30 complete
boxes of documents located at the Atlanta History Center and at the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games headquarters at the
Inforum.
</P>
<P>
   They asked for 20 boxes of files at ACOG offices already
assembled by Payne's attorneys and which contain written summaries
of IOC member gifts and travel; copies of checks, payment requests
and invoices; and correspondence and information about IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also specifically requested 10 boxes of documents
archived at the History Center that include correspondence written
by Payne, bid team official Ginger Watkins and Doug Gatlin, former
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young's close aide and the paid executive
director of the bid team.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen warned Payne not to destroy any documents
related to the Olympic effort, whether stored at the History Center
or elsewhere.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 1:
</P>
<P>
   The American Women's World Cup soccer team has burst into
national prominence in the last several weeks, selling out stadiums
and drawing the largest audience in the history of women's team
athletics at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. They will face off
against Germany this evening in the quarterfinals outside
Washington, with millions of new fans hoping they advance to the
semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   The success of this charismatic team heralds a new era for
women's sports. Even though the United States won the first Women's
World Cup in 1991, the team has only now gained a mass following.
When the American squad took the gold medal in the 1996 Olympic
Games, NBC aired a mere 10 minutes of highlights. But this year
ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 are jointly covering all of the World Cup, and
the ratings have not disappointed. As the American team swept
through the preliminary games, one broadcast on ESPN drew more
households than the cable channel's typical major league baseball
game.
</P>
<P>
   The players are a new breed of athletes, born and trained under
Title IX, the 1972 federal statute that bars sex discrimination in
education. The women on the soccer team and in the WNBA are
products of competitive college sports programs that did not exist
before the law. Girls can now dream of a professional career in
athletics, something that seemed unattainable even five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup has also breathed a new freshness into a
sport that too often in international men's competition has been
marred by fan violence. In the women's tournament, sportsmanship
seems paramount and the grandstands are filled with exuberant fans.
The star American forward, Mia Hamm, reigns as the leading scorer
in international soccer history. Her photographs grace dozens of
young girls' Internet sites, where she is venerated as a hero. Hamm
even has a generous endorsement deal from Gatorade and appears in
an advertisement with Michael Jordan bearing the slogan ``Anything
you can do, I can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   More must be done to create real equity between men's and
women's college athletics, and the prize money for the Women's
World Cup is a fraction of what the men would make. But the
unfolding competition holds the promise of what women in America
can achieve in sports. &QL;

 &HT;    Collapsing bullpen folds again
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A position of strength is a sudden liability. There
is something afire in the Braves' bullpen and the smoke is
consuming the team.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive night, the Braves handed their relief
corps a late three-run lead and for the second consecutive night,
the Montreal Expos ripped out the club's hair by the roots, batting
through the order in a five-run eighth in a 7-5 comeback win
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The episode spoiled impressive work by starter Odalis Perez (two
runs in 6 2/3 innings), and catcher Eddie Perez, whose three-run
homer off a speaker in left field gave Atlanta a 5-2 lead. But also
in the past two nights, the bullpen has given up 10 runs on 10 hits
in just 1 2/3 innings, losing both games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``You couldn't
do that if you went out there and put it on a tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kevin McGlinchy, who got out of a bases-loaded jam in
relief of Perez in the seventh, gave up three consecutive singles
to open the eighth, Vladimir Guerrero singling in Jose Vidro to
close the lead to 5-3. After Fernando Seguignol walked, loading the
bases, Rudy Seanez relieved McGlinchy and gave up a two-run double
to Orlando Cabrera, Seguignol also scoring on Brian Jordan's error.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Seanez had stranded all but three of his 21
inherited runners.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mordecai followed with a bloop single to right, bringing in
Cabrera for a 7-5 lead. Russ Springer then retired the side but the
devastation was complete. McGlinchy (4-3) took the loss, Seanez had
his second blown save of the season, and after John Rocker's
five-run ninth-inning meltdown the night before, this is an
official crisis of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discouraging,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not getting the job done,'' Jordan said. ``That's
the bottom line. When it counts most late in the game, we're not
coming through.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss blotted out Perez's three-run homer in the fourth, just
the third ever struck off one of the speakers hanging from the
ceiling around the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully (today) we can come back to do the same thing to
them,'' Seanez said. ``You can't take too much away from those guys
but you can't give them too much credit either.

 &HT;    Glover has prayers answered by Hawks
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dion Glover wanted to be far, far away from the
maddening NBA draft gathering in Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stay home and find something to do to relieve the
anxiety,'' said Glover, declining to join other first-round
prospects at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   He found it on bended knees.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, the 6-foot-5 shooting guard who made waves as a Georgia
Tech freshman, then declared for the draft even though he missed
last season with a knee injury, spent the evening in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the 20th pick in the first round, the Atlanta Hawks
answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and surprised,'' Glover said. ``I felt confident
I would go in the first round, but I did not know I would go with
the 20th pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Lord works in mysterious ways. Considering I was hurt
and missed all of last season, it was a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover, 20, had an All-America career at Cedar Grove High while
leading his school to a state title, then averaged 18.4 points a
game as a Tech freshman. But he tore both ligaments in his left
knee on the first day of practice last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scare,'' Dion's father, the Rev. Franklin Glover,
said. ``After an injury like that, sometimes when you're young,
things can be overwhelming and you can get down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we started this (draft) process because he was blessed to
be healed (through surgery), and the option was there.''
</P>
<P>
   By going in the first round, Glover _ who did not work out for
teams, stayed academically eligible and maintained his option to
return to Tech until the last minute _ will earn a guaranteed,
million-dollar contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any second thoughts (about going pro),'' Glover
said. ``I knew in my mind and heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to show people that, yes, you can do it the right
way,'' Franklin Glover said. ``I like to practice what I preach.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Atlanta's ultimate homeboy stays put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with that,'' Dion Glover said. ``Everybody here
knows me. I'll still be around my friends. And I can still see Mom
and Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks say they will keep Glover, at least for now. They have
indicated not all draft picks will be retained.

 &HT;    Changing of the guard
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They wanted to get younger and faster for their
inaugural season at Philips Arena. And, with one swift move, the
Hawks did that Wednesday night, taking Jason Terry, a blazingly
fast point guard from Arizona, with the 10th pick of the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   After disappointing fans attending the team's draft party at CNN
Center with a player they didn't know at No. 17 _ center Cal
Bowdler of Old Dominion _ the Hawks pleased them by taking Georgia
Tech guard Dion Glover with the 20th pick. They made a point of
saying they will be patient and bring him along very slowly. Glover
missed last season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as an act of mercy, the Hawks took a distraught Jumaine
Jones from Georgia with pick No. 27. The last player in the green
room at the draft site in Washington, he greeted the news
tearfully. The Hawks then traded him to Philadelphia for a future
first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   The final pick on a busy night for the Hawks was guard Roberto
Bergersen of Boise State at 52nd, but he was sent to Portland for
cash.
</P>
<P>
   There were nearly 2,000 people in the CNN Center atrium and,
when Terry was chosen, some roared approval. That reception marked
a first for a Hawks draft pick since Stacey Augmon was taken with
the ninth pick in 1991. Coincidentally, Augmon, like Terry, was
taken with a pick acquired for a steady point guard. Eight years
ago, it was Doc Rivers who left town.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Mookie Blaylock took the hit. The longtime starter
was sent to Golden State on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said he wasn't surprised with
the reaction to Bowdler, however. ``I think they would boo if we
drafted Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouding all of draft work is the insistence by team president
Stan Kasten that there is the very real chance of a major deal that
cannot be completed before Aug. 1 because of league rules.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the night, the rumor swirled that shooting guard
Steve Smith would be the next Hawks starter to go, with Portland a
potential new home. Babcock said he would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the Hawks could look at their first-round picks
as a measure of their efforts to put a faster, more athletic and
more entertaining team on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks vice president Arthur Triche noted moments after the
selection that ``every young guy in Atlanta will be playing in high
socks before you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 10 pick, who wears his socks to his knees, then gave his
new town a glimpse of the future on the big TV screen when he
rolled down one of his dark socks and showed a glimpse of a white
athletic sock underneath, bearing the name CATS (for Arizona
Wildcats).
</P>
<P>
   Terry said he may leave his tall socks behind, however, ``to
show off my nice legs.'' Then he said he wants to put on 10 pounds
of upper body muscle so he can play in the rugged NBA Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said on the eve of the draft he would be happy with any
of the five top-rated point guards. When Andre Miller went to
Cleveland, Terry was there for the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   And while Miller is bigger, more mature physically and two years
older, Terry is capable of brilliance. The Cavaliers may have
soured on Terry when he refused at the last moment to participate
in a head-to-head workout against Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The twosome had done just that for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Seattle, Terry said he welcomed the chance to come
to Atlanta and play for Lenny Wilkens. ``I know all about him,'' he
said. ``I know he likes defense. I'm a defensive player.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said, ``Being a Seattle guy, he knows how we like to
play. He will help us. He's a fine young player.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Harrick was at UCLA when he scouted Terry,
first seeing him at a track meet. He said Terry is a terrific
choice for the Hawks. ``He has blazing speed. He gets to the
basket. He makes everybody better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowdler, a 6-10, 250-pounder from Old Dominion, is a good
shooter and athletic. He would back up Dikembe Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, at No. 20, was surprising in a different way. In his one
season at Tech, he showed little concept of team play and
inconsistent shooting. Clearly, he is not a player who is ready to
step in.
</P>
<P>
   Although Glover passed a physical with a glowing report on his
surgical knee, Babcock tried to talk him into staying in school.
The Glover family was adamant, however, though he refused to work
out for any NBA team.

 &HT;    Waiting ordeal pains Jones, watchers alike
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ First-year Georgia coach Jim Harrick vigorously
lobbied Jumaine Jones to remain in school one more year and warned
the Bulldogs' star forward of the possible scenario that unfolded
Wednesday night as he dropped to the 27th pick of the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, though, Harrick wasn't saying I told you so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful for me to watch,'' said Harrick, who attended
the Hawks' draft party at the CNN Center and served as a radio
broadcast analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and an entourage that included his mother, an aunt and a
childhood friend from Camilla sat uncomfortably in the green room
of the MCI Center in Washington as pick after pick was announced
before him. Finally, the Atlanta Hawks selected the 6-foot-7
forward two picks shy of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks quickly traded Jones to the Philadelphia 76ers for
future considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' goals of becoming an NBA lottery pick or even a top 20
selection went unrealized. But, like it or not, he insisted he
wouldn't change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like if I had to make the decision again, I would still
leave Georgia,'' said Jones, tears flowing down his face in a
television interview. ``God does things for a reason and he's
testing me now.... I've just got to go in there and work hard and
get some playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you go into the draft as a young player, it's a
gamble,'' Harrick said. ``I really disagree with the rules now that
say he can't come back if you've hired an agent. Rules are supposed
to help people and this doesn't help Jumaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope for the best for Jumaine because he's really a
good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the SEC's leading scorer last year (18.8 points per game)
and the Bulldogs' leading rebounder (8.7), was projected to go as
high as seventh and few analysts expected him to last past the
first 15 selections. But there were questions about Jones'
ballhandling and defensive skills and his ability to handle the
transition from power forward to small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Those uncertainties contributed to Jones slipping, as did some
surprise early picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kid who is contemplating leaving school early should
have looked at the expression on that kid's face,'' TV commentator
John Thompson said of the tearful Jones. ``Stay in school.

 &HT;    Bulls take Brand with 1st pick
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For all the questions about his height, or lack
thereof, and all the concerns about his judgment after being the
first player to bolt Duke before his senior season, it all came
back to Elton Brand's skill. It was undeniable to the meticulous
Jerry Krause, general manager of the rebuilding Chicago Bulls, who
made Brand the first pick in Wednesday night's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, speculation was that Krause wavered among
Brand; Steve Francis, who went No. 2 to Vancouver, and
multi-talented Lamar Odom, who worked out for the Bulls on the eve
of the draft and emerged confident he would be their choice.
</P>
<P>
   But Krause went for the 6-foot-8 Brand, last season's NCAA
consensus player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough decision. But we came to a decision that
Elton Brand is an outstanding player,'' Krause said. ``A lot of
players wanted to come here. But young Mr. Brand is tough with
great character and he works very hard. He plays a lot larger than
6-8 in that he has long arms and strong hands. . . And we feel very
good about him as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brand: ``I'm blessed. I didn't have the slightest idea (I'd
go No. 1). It'll be a lot of pressure in Chicago, especially being
the No. 1 pick. But I just have to face it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the unpredictable draft took shape after Brand.
Point guard Francis went to the Grizzlies, even though Vancouver
has Mike Bibby running the club. That left open speculation that
Francis would be traded for veteran help _ or that the 6-foot-3
Francis would play alongside 6-1 Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the high-flying Francis had one thing in mind:
``I want to do some of the things I did in college that made me a
great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom, whose stock my have been affected by his indecision to
stay in the draft, went to the Los Angeles Clippers with the fourth
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Odom did not seem concerned about where he landed _ or by his
actions in recent weeks. He fired an agent and tried to get
reinstated at Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it happened,'' he said. ``The situation
got chaotic. But it's over now and I'm looking forward to a great
year. I can't wait to get to L.A. and get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Many trades rumored before the draft did not materialize. There
was countless deal talk, but none of any magnitude that were
consummated. The big speculation was Indiana sending reserve
forward Antonio Davis to Toronto for the fifth selection, which
still may happen. The Raptors took high-schooler Jonathan Bender
from Picayne, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The first college senior taken in the draft went next. Wally
Szczerbiak of Miami (Ohio) was taken by Minnesota, where he wowed
the Timberwolves staff with his overall skill and shooting ability.
And they wowed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had a home there when I worked out there,''
Szczerbiak said. ``I want to be a winner, and I'm going to a
winner. Hopefully, I can bring them to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard Richard Hamilton of national champion UConn went
to Washington at No. 7, followed by point guard Andre Miller, whom
the Hawks had an eye on, to Cleveland. When Phoenix took small
forward Shawn Marion from UNLV at No. 9, that left another highly
rated point guard, Jason Terry of Arizona, for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   An early surprise was Duke guard Trajan Langdon at No. 11 to
Cleveland. When Blue Devils teammates Corey Maggette went to
Seattle at 13 and William Avery to Minnesota at 14, Duke became the
first college to produce four first-rounders _ and the round was
not halfway over.
</P>
<P>
   The first foreign player was center Aleksander Radojevic, 12th
to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He played one season at Barton County (Kan.) Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Another center, Frederic Weis of France, was the second player
from overseas. He went No. 15 to the New York Knicks, whose
starting center, Patrick Ewing, missed most of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could have chosen local star Ron Artest of St.
John's, who went to the Bulls on the next choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat did go local, choosing University of Miami forward Tim
James with the 25th pick. The most obscure player was the Lakers
selecting Division III standout Devean George of Augsburg (Minn.)
College.

 &HT;    Seat belts on school buses among laws taking effect today
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida joins New York and New Jersey today
as the only states to require seat belts on school buses, a move
driven by a deadly Vero Beach crash and last-minute political
deals.
</P>
<P>
   The law's effective date is today, though its impact will be
spread over the next decade: Lap belts or other federally approved
restraints must be on new buses purchased after Dec. 31, 2000. Up
to 10 percent of the state's 18,000 buses are replaced each year.
Elementary schools will take priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd required seat belts on all buses right away it
wouldn't have passed,'' said David Cullen, a Florida PTA regional
representative in Sarasota and a leading advocate for the law. ``I
think it did pass this year because of increasing awareness, and
that had a lot to do with what happened in Vero Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Also effective today, police can stop an adult and give a ticket
if a child is not buckled up in a car. Previously, the law was not
clear and many law enforcement agencies gave tickets only if the
driver was stopped for something else.
</P>
<P>
   Tougher sentencing under ``Three Strikes'' and ``10-20-Life''
legislation takes effect today as well, though a parental
notice-of-abortion law will not be enforced until July 15 at the
earliest while a legal challenge plays out.
</P>
<P>
   Seat belt activists like Cullen had been trying for years to get
belts on school buses, but many lawmakers were reluctant to dictate
to districts that they must spend more. Lap belts cost $1,200 to
$2,200 to order on a new bus, and three to five times that to add
to an old bus. The cost of retrofitting the state's whole fleet
might run to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In January, two months before the spring legislative session, a
school bus crash in Indian River County killed two and injured 14
when the bus driver ran a stop sign and collided with a truck. Seat
belts may not have eliminated all loss of life and injury, but they
probably would have greatly reduced injuries when students were
thrown violently around the inside of the vehicle as it rolled,
Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
   The horror of that crash helped keep alive the bill until the
final week of the session, but the Senate version remained stuck in
committee. Sen. Jim Sebesta, R-St. Petersburg, agreed to accept the
bus legislation as an amendment to his bill saying adults can be
ticketed if children aren't buckled up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Cynthia Chestnut, D-Gainesville, bartered to
save the bill in the House, according to legislative staffers in
both parties. Chestnut switched her vote to bring the parental
notice-of-abortion bill to the floor, earning her a ``chit'' with
the Republican leadership, which she used to move the bus bill up
the priority list, staffers said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker John Thrasher's aides do not recall it happening that
way, because ``he does not do quid pro quo,'' a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the bill passed despite misgivings in larger
districts, according to Cullen. The big districts feared they were
getting into a political minefield of deciding which neighborhoods
got seat belts first.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Hargrett, D-Tampa, who represents a largely black
district, expressed those worries on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, when there's a short end of the stick, some of
my constituents end up getting it,'' Hargrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County is ready to move ahead and spend up to $2,200
per bus on some 60 to 80 buses a year, said Bob Riley, director of
transportation for the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a real plus,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, bus drivers say they welcome anything that keeps
kids safely seated, though they worry about one more added
responsibility _ to make sure kids are actually strapped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good idea if the kids are going to do it,'' said Sharon
Munley, trustee for Local 1227 of the National Conference of
Firemen and Oilers, which represents about 600 drivers in Palm
Beach County. ``But how will the driver know?''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he will not expect drivers to leave their seats and
walk down the aisle checking seat belts. But it may be that if the
driver sees a student standing, and obviously not wearing a belt,
that the driver can write up the violation for administrators to
handle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The law says that neither the school nor the driver can be held
liable for an injury solely caused by a student's failure to wear a
seat belt. If past lawsuits are any indication, though, that
probably won't let schools off the hook for taking ``reasonable
care'' that kids are buckled in.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1997, nearly 6,000 students were injured in school
bus accidents in Florida, with 242 of those injuries
incapacitating.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen admits seat belts cannot prevent all fatal accidents,
such as the tire that came loose from a vehicle in Miami-Dade
County in 1991 and smashed through a bus window, killing three. But
a properly fastened belt could have prevented, for example, a
Broward County girl from falling to her death out the emergency
door in the back of a bus in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has materially improved the safety of all Florida kids
riding on school buses,'' Cullen said. ``And it reinforces the
message of `buckle up' every time the child gets on the bus.''

JACKSON WANTS BULLS, NOT ROOKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Nothing resembling a Michael Jordan clone was
available to the low-drafting Lakers on Wednesday, but new coach
Phil Jackson had his mind on the original.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers begin retooling under Jackson, the former Bulls
coach admitted he'd like MJ to help the transition to the triangle
offense. Or, at the least, Scottie Pippen, Jud Buechler or B.J.
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson doesn't believe in playing rookies, so Laker draftees
Devean George of Augsburg College and John Celestand of Villanova
could be nonfactors this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson does believe the herd of ex-Bulls roaming the league
could greatly benefit a Lakers team that has no experience playing
the Bulls' system. They might pursue some in that herd today, when
teams begin speaking with free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest I've discussed everybody, including Michael
Jordan,'' Jackson said prior to the draft. ``You just discuss that
kind of stuff.... I don't think there's ever a chance of Michael
coming back, but I think everybody wants to know, even from the top
on down, is there a possibility you envision.''
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic possibility would be signing someone like
Buechler, the former Bulls forward who is a free agent after
playing in Detroit last season. And though the Lakers adamantly
deny trade rumors involving Pippen, Jackson has kicked his name
around too _ ``My options are wide open on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'd be very important for this team to have a couple
guys on it that really know how to function inside the (triangle)
offense, so... they can learn by just following, copycatting on the
floor,'' Jackson said. Getting such a player ``would be a luxury.
Whether that's going to happen or not, I can't tell you. I just can
tell you we're staying in tune to it.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA teams cannot consummate trades or sign free agents until
Aug. 1, but the negotiating period opens today. Jackson's top
priority is a power forward, and he's strongly interested in
Toronto free agent Charles Oakley, who could sign here for the $2
million salary exception.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley could command millions more from the Raptors but has said
he's willing to take less to play for the Lakers. And Toronto has
prepared for his departure, reportedly trading for Indiana's
Antonio Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time comes for us to be able to pursue Charles
Oakley, I'm sure we're going to have our hats in the ring,''
Jackson said. ``Charles Oakley will definitely fill a gap. He's a
player who gives you some power, gives you rebounds and is a Dennis
Rodman-type role player.''
</P>
<P>
   Buechler could give the Lakers depth at small forward and
shooting guard, and ``is a favorite player of mine,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   With Rick Fox probably returning, the Lakers will already be
deep at small forward, unless they trade Glen Rice _ whose
one-year, $7.1 million option they picked up Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a free agent who has earned his early-Bird rights with
the Lakers, making him a good bet to re-sign. He's eligible for a
starting salary of $3.08 million and a six-year deal for $24.25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Rice would be ``a great player'' in his system and
that Fox is ``a luxury player, a starter that's been able to adapt
to the bench. He's a very important part of this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Also becoming free agents today are J.R. Reid, Derek Fisher and
Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made it clear he wants an upgrade over the inconsistent
Reid, and he was noncommittal on Fisher, last season's starting
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   The little-known newcomers, rookies George and Celestand, will
have a challenge just finding minutes. George provides depth at
shooting guard and small forward, Celestand at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those old-school guys that say rookies have to sit
on the bench and learn,'' Jackson said, ``especially when they're
coming into the NBA and playing on a team that's as good as this
one is.''

SEC INVESTIGATING HOW MICROSOFT CLASSIFIES ITS RESERVE REVENUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A federal agency is investigating whether Microsoft
has been setting aside revenues in flush quarters to shore up
earnings reports in lean quarters, the Redmond company's chief
financial officer disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called news conference, Greg Maffei said the
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission began
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the SEC would neither confirm nor deny that an
investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei speculated that the investigation was triggered by a Jan.
14 story in The Wall Street Journal. That story related allegations
by Charles Pancerzewski, a former Microsoft internal auditor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Journal story, Pancerzewski charged in a 1997
wrongful-discharge suit that Microsoft manipulated revenue reserves
totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to make its profits appear
more stable.
</P>
<P>
   The story says the suit alleges Microsoft put aside revenue in
healthy quarters to cover costs like future product returns and
promotional rebates, and added them back in during leaner quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Pancerzewski was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached.
His lawyer, Pete Vial, said Pancerzewski had been in Washington,
D.C., but said he could not confirm whether his client had spoken
with the SEC because of a confidentiality agreement in the
settlement of his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is (the investigation is) related to
reserves and reserve policies,'' Maffei said Wednesday. ``Reviewing
the financial records of every company is certainly within the
SEC's practice. I wouldn't claim to know how common investigations
or inquiries into reserves and reserves policies are.''
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said this is the first time the SEC has
investigated Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of reserves is to reflect a company's true revenues
_ how much it will actually end up collecting in a given period if
customers return merchandise or fail to pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   But these accounting practices do ``open up the door to earnings
management, if not done right,'' said Jack Ciesielski, who writes
the Analyst's Accounting Observer, a Baltimore newsletter on
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's case, the company may have reserved too much,
which would mean that it may have understated its actual profits.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has set aside about $4 billion in what it calls
``unearned revenues'' as a result of the way it sells both its
Windows operating system products and its Office suite of software
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei said he didn't know how long the investigation would last
and declined to provide further details. He said he believes the
investigation will have no material effect on Microsoft's business
or financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy with the current pace of business,'' he told
the conference call of analysts and reporters. ``I'm comfortable
that we're at least going to make analysts' estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   William Epifanio, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, agreed.
``I'm not too worried about it yet,'' he said. ``They have a good
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock closed Wednesday at $90.19, up $2.19.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has been aiming to eliminate corporate manipulation of
earnings at least since last fall. In November 1998, the SEC's
chief accountant, Lynn Turner, told an accounting industry group
that the agency's division of corporation finance had formed an
earnings-management task force to coordinate and focus the SEC's
filing reviews on abusive reporting practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The division of enforcement has also stepped up their focus on
earnings management,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   One financial analyst expressed surprise upon hearing of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has been extremely conservative in its earnings
estimates _ based on what I know about them, it's hard to
believe,'' said Greg Bailes, an audit partner with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Seattle. ``Anything done to smooth
earnings is not only unacceptable to the SEC but isn't even within
generally accepted accounting principles.''
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's news conference, Maffei disclosed the SEC
investigation after a lengthy recital of two changes being made to
accounting procedures at Microsoft. He denied the changes are
related to the SEC investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those changes, Microsoft will reclassify how it
reports revenues and costs for four items: product support,
consulting services, training and certification of system
integrators, and fees for accessing the MSN Web site. Henceforth,
the customer receipts will be dealt with as revenue, and costs that
vary directly with revenue will be classified as cost of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the costs of the first three items were reported as
sales and marketing activities, and customer receipts were reported
as cost recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The reclassification causes revenue to be 5.1 percent higher for
fiscal 1997, 5.4 percent higher for fiscal 1998, and 5.8 percent
higher for fiscal 1999 year to date than it would have been under
the prior model. Revenue from each of the four areas ranges from
$150 million to $300 million annually. In total, revenue for the
first three quarters of fiscal 1999 will be about $761 million
higher because of the reclassification, Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   The second procedural change relates to accounting for unearned
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with a recent change in accounting rules, Maffei said
Microsoft will change the initial earned and unearned revenue
percentages and the timing of revenue recognition for its Windows
operating system software and Office productivity suite.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, both of which have been reviewed by the SEC,
together will create 1 cent of additional revenue during the
current quarter and the same additional amount in fiscal 2000,
Maffei said.
</P>
<P>

Bloomberg News.

HORNETS CLIP DAVIS' DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets take rejection well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by Baron Davis' refusal to work out for them before the
NBA draft, the Hornets selected Davis with the third pick Wednesday
evening and instantaneously shattered his Clipper dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his agent, Arn Tellem, had hoped that rejecting
Charlotte's workout invitation would serve as a turnoff. Instead,
the Hornets, desperate for a point guard, stuck to their plan and
made Davis the highest UCLA player drafted since David Greenwood
went second to Chicago in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great opportunity,'' Davis said. ``I'm on a
team that made a tremendous (but unsuccessful) run to the playoffs
last season. They have a lot of seasoned veterans. I think with me
coming in, I can bring a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets favored Duke power forward Elton Brand and Maryland
point guard Steve Francis; both filled needs and had high name
recognition in ACC territory. When Brand and Francis went first and
second, respectively, the Hornets turned to Davis, a 6-foot-2,
210-pound playmaker who left UCLA after his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   After his union with the Charlotte became official, Davis
sidestepped the earlier rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workouts I had were scheduled all over the place, so I
could never fit (the Hornets) solid in my schedule until last week,
when I got hurt,'' said Davis, who twisted his ankle. ``I really
didn't think they'd be interested in me, that's why I didn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was disappointed to not be playing for the Clippers,
Davis said: ``No, not at all. I was going to be happy anywhere I
went. I'll make the most of my opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis will compete with veteran David Wesley for the starting
point guard job alongside former Lakers wing man Eddie Jones, who
joined the Hornets in the Glen Rice trade last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's sweet,'' Davis said. ``Eddie played for the Lakers
and he played (pick-up games) at UCLA. We were in the backcourt a
couple times. Now, it's going to be permanent.''

LAKERS EXERCISE OPTION ON RICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Lakers exercised their one-year option on Glen
Rice on Wednesday, preventing him from becoming a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who had sought a new multiyear contract that would pay $12
million to $14 million, will earn $7.1 million next season. The
Lakers knew Rice might be unhappy with a lesser deal, but they were
not allowed to negotiate with him until today and could not be sure
a long-term agreement would be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the awkward part of it for us is we can't negotiate
with anyone (until July 1),'' Lakers executive vice president Jerry
West said. ``We really value Glen a lot, and we were in a position
where if we put him out there as a free agent, we might not get him
back. But I think our intent is to have him finish his career here
in Los Angeles.... We gave up a lot (Eddie Jones and Elden
Campbell) to get him.'' &QL;

RUSSIAN BOMBERS FACE OFF AGAINST AMERICAN FIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russian bombers flew close enough to Iceland and
Norway last week to cause the United States and Norway to scramble
fighter planes as a precaution, a National Security Council
official said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said the eyebrow-raising incident, reminiscent of the kind of
Kremlin muscle-flexing that was common during the cold war,
occurred as part of Russia's largest military exercises since the
breakup of the Soviet Union. The exercises, named West '99,
involved up to 50,000 troops, more than 30 ships and Russian air
force and naval aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Early last Friday, two long-range Bear bombers flew near
Iceland, prompting the U.S. military to send up four F-15 fighters
and a patrol plane to escort the Russian craft in a clockwise route
around the island and back toward Russian territory. The incident
was first reported in Thursday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   At about the time the Bear bombers were near Iceland, two
Russian Blackjack bombers flew along the Norwegian coastline.
Norway, like Iceland and the United States a member of NATO, sent
up interceptor jets, but Russian reports said they failed to reach
the bombers before the bombers turned for home.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Council official said there was apparently
no violation of Iceland's or Norway's air space by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what might have motivated the Russians to fly close to the
two NATO countries, he said, ``They reminded us that they're a
force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Council official said that American
officials have no doubt that the incident was linked to the recent
tensions over Russia's early intervention in Kosovo and the debates
over what part Russia would play in the peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post quoted Moscow officials as saying the
flights near Iceland and Norway had been planned in advance.
``Nothing more, nothing less,'' said Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov,
commander of the Russian air force.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Council official said he was sure the
Russian bombers were not carrying nuclear weapons, though they are
capable of carrying them into U.S. territory. ``They, like us, do
not exercise with live ordnance like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the incident was regarded in Washington as a
military matter, not a diplomatic one. American government
officials have no plans to protest to the Kremlin, he said.

 &HT;    SWT's Foster winds up with Pacers
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He wasn't included in very many mock NBA drafts.
And national talk radio shows rarely mentioned his name. Jeff
Foster just figured he knew something that wasn't obvious to
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Call the former Southwest Texas State star clairvoyant. Judging
by the number of teams that appeared interested in him, Foster
believed he would be selected somewhere between picks No. 19 and
25.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State used the 21st pick of the first round to select
Foster, the still-growing SWT center who was recently measured at
just a smidgen under 7 feet. Foster, aside from becoming an instant
millionaire, also made school history Wednesday when he became the
first Bobcat to be selected in the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't saying anything to anybody, but I knew where I'd be
going,'' Foster said from his parents' home in San Antonio minutes
after he was selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody mentioned me because I was a player who wasn't well
known to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris Clack, the former University of Texas standout, waited
longer to hear his name. Ten minutes before the draft ended, the
Boston Celtics selected him with the 55th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Clack had been forecast as a late first-round pick, but his
stock plummeted because scouts feared that his shot was too
inconsistent to be an effective shooting guard in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, despite playing for a low-profile school, was well-known
in NBA circles.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Commissioner David Stearn called his name,
Foster's San Francisco-based agent called to tell him he'd been
traded to Indiana. But the trade wasn't announced for another hour.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire Foster, Indiana sent Pittsburgh guard Vonteego
Cummings, whom they had selected with the 26th pick, and a future
first-round draft pick to Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   The trade wasn't that surprising to Foster, given that he had
spent most of Wednesday in Indianapolis, working out for the second
time for Pacers Coach Larry Bird. Foster made it back to San
Antonio about two hours before the draft started.
</P>
<P>
   He was told that Indiana made the trade, rather than waiting to
select him five picks later, because the Pacers feared Houston
would draft him at No. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the draft, Indiana made room for Foster by trading
reserve center Antonio Davis to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's draft position guaranteed that he will be paid a total
of $2.3 million over the next three years, with salaries of
$714,800, $768,400 and $822,000.
</P>
<P>
   Teams tended to shy away from shooting guards such as Clack on
Wednesday night. But big men were at a premium, which gave Foster a
huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams are constantly in search of an agile 7-footer who can
at least rebound and block shots. The past six drafts have produced
only nine starting centers. And only 10 starting centers still
remain with the team that drafted them.

 &HT;    Spurs save money by trading 1st-round pick
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ NBA teams are not allowed to say ``pass'' when
their turn comes during the annual draft, so the San Antonio Spurs
did the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, drafting 29th _ last _ in the first round, did not
believe anyone available was likely to earn a spot on their team,
not to mention the three-year guaranteed contract all first-round
players receive. To circumvent having to pay the $1.8 million for
three years, the Spurs drafted 6-foot-10-inch Leon Smith of Martin
Luther King High School in Chicago and traded him to Dallas for two
second-round picks. Second-round picks do not receive guaranteed
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want it. We were thrilled to be able to get rid of
it,'' Spurs coach and general manager Gregg Popovich said of his
first-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had questions about whether we wanted to make a three-year
commitment to someone picked 29th,'' said Sam Schuler, the Spurs
director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Rockets, picking 22nd, drafted Kenny Thomas, a power
forward from New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas did not have a first-round pick. The Mavs traded that
pick to Phoenix in a deal that brought point guard Steve Nash to
Dallas this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs receive Gordon Giricek, a guard from Croatia whom
Dallas picked at No. 40 in the second round. Giricek, 22, can
continue playing in Europe and sign with the Spurs in the future.
The Spurs also will receive a future second-round pick. The Spurs
used their own second -round pick for 6-6 Emmanuel Ginobili from
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' primary goal is to keep the championship team intact
as best they can. Three Spurs are free agents _ reserves Will
Perdue, Malik Rose and Jaren Jackson. Perdue, a center, is the most
likely to leave. He said this week there is a 50 percent he will
re-sign. The Spurs, who paid Perdue $4.2 million last season, might
not want to spend that much again for someone whose playing time
was taken by Rose in the NBA Finals against New York. As scarce as
competent centers are in the NBA, Perdue is likely to receive
offers from several teams.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who will receive an opportunity to make the team
next season are 6-9 Gerard King, who spent much of the season as
the Spurs' 12th man; guard Brandon Williams, who spent most of the
season as a practice player assigned to the injured list; and guard
Derrick Dial, a second-round draft pick in 1998 who played in
Europe this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are over the NBA's salary cap. Should they want, or
need, to add veteran players, the the Spurs are likely to have
three exceptions to the salary cap available _ $2 million, $1.2
million and $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were thin along the front line last season because
of injuries. Thin is not a word associated with the 260-pound
Thomas. Listed at 6-8 in college, Thomas measured only 6-6 1/2
without his shoes at the pre-draft camp in Chicago. Thomas, wo
averaged 17.8 points and 9.9 rebounds last season, will move into a
rotation that includes Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Othella
Harrington, if Barkley, a free agent, re-signs.
</P>
<P>
   With their second-round pick, No. 44 overall, the Rockets picked
6-9 Tyrone Washington from Mississippi State. Six picks later, the
Rockets took 6-8 Venson Hamilton of Nebraska, the Big 12 player of
the year last season.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is whether the Rockets will make a blockbuster
trade. The Los Angeles Lakers have offered Glen Rice and former
Rocket Robert Horry in exchange for Scottie Pippen. Since a trade
was not completed by midnight today, the Rockets and Lakers must
wait until Aug. 1 to make a deal. No trades are allowed between
July 1 and Aug. 1. Houston has already decided not to trade Hakeem
Olajuwon to Toronto.

RELIEF WORKER ENCOUNTERS VAST DESTRUCTION, SUFFERING IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The finger was charred to the bone, but still wearing a gold
wedding band.
</P>
<P>
   American relief worker Kevin Cook calls it the saddest thing he
saw since returning to Kosovo on June 14 as communications director
for World Vision, an international Christian aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who graduated from Mesa High School and attended Arizona
State University, has seen more than his share of horror in 13
trips to the troubled region over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to sit down and weep,'' Cook, 41, said by
telephone Friday from World Vision offices in the Kosovo capital of
Pristina. ``I've stopped trying to understand why it happened, how
individuals are capable of doing this to other people _ the evil. I
become worn out physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cook left Kosovo and returned to World Vision
regional headquarters in Vienna, where his wife and two young
children were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   After a much-needed vacation, they will head for their next
posting in San Jose, Costa Rica, to work on a community development
project.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tragedies he has witnessed, Cook departed
war-ravaged Kosovo reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very sad to leave this place,'' he said. ``It's an
extraordinary place. I will come back, I just don't know how
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   World Vision first dispatched relief workers to Kosovo when the
conflict erupted there in February 1998. President Slobodan
Milosevic had begun a campaign to drive ethnic Albanians out of the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who finished his bachelor's degree in journalism at Kansas
State University and earned a master's degree in developmental
studies from the School for International Training in Vermont, was
one of the first three workers to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the last two to leave last March when NATO forces
advised all agencies to evacuate just days before NATO airstrikes
began.
</P>
<P>
   When the bombs stopped three months later, about a dozen
agencies returned, this time to clean up the aftermath of a war
that had displaced 80 percent of the 1.8 million Kosovars and left
the region in ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Like other relief agencies targeted by the Serbs, World Vision
offices had been attacked. The agency's building in Pristina was
partly burned and looted of its computers and furniture, sold on a
thriving black market.
</P>
<P>
   Before workers could resume their duties, bomb specialists swept
the building for booby traps and land mines, which remain a danger.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Cook had visited a 9-year-old boy hospitalized
when a land mine nearly blew off his leg. The boy's family had
recently returned to Kosovo after fleeing months before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so tragic,'' Cook said, his voice weary.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's anger is directed toward Milosevic, whom he calls an evil
man who exploited ethnic hatred for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cook said, ``his Greater Serbia is a country in ruins, a
blighted landscape of unemployment and despair, mass graves,
corpses, dead livestock, blocks of old shops and homes reduced to
rubble, wells poisoned by human bodies, mosques burned.''
</P>
<P>
   And although NATO bombs may have done some good, Cook said,
non-violent efforts to resolve the conflict should have been
started a decade ago when Milosevic came to power and foretold his
campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem got way out of hand,'' Cook said, ``and became a
humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook, whose job is to comfort the afflicted, sometimes needs
comforting himself. Since returning to postwar Kosovo, he has been
overwhelmed by the sight of mass graves and flattened
neighborhoods, the horror stories told by refugees, reports of
friends and colleagues missing or feared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's more than Cook can endure. He recently e-mailed
his father, who was pastor of Central Christian Church in Mesa for
10 years, acknowledging ``compassion fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook calls his father ``my principal mentor and best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook is semiretired and now lives with Kevin's mother,
Barbara, a retired speech pathologist, in Baltimore. They winter in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Through his work with the international Christian Missionary
Fellowship, the elder Cook can empathize with his son's despair and
has tried to help him reconcile his faith with the brutality
visited upon the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragedy is a reality of life,'' the Rev. Cook said from
Baltimore, sharing the advice he gave his son. ``It's not an
intentional part of God's plan. The faithful and the faithless
experience it. It's part of God allowing us freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his son a man of ``high moral and ethical values'' who
has ``a compassion for human need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of him and what he's been able to accomplish,''
he said. ``I didn't want him to leave (Kosovo) before he was ready.
I think he is now. He's seen this come full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Cook sounds less satisfied with his accomplishments.
Although World Vision and more than a dozen other agencies have
banded to assist the needy of Kosovo, Cook is overwhelmed by the
magnitude of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done a lot of good, but the amount of evil and
violence has far outweighed any good we've done,'' he said. ``Now
it's a country totally wrecked.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook also worries that ethnic Albanians flooding back into the
country, protected by NATO-led peacekeepers, will exact revenge
against their former tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for Albanian Kosovars to get their
vengeance,'' he said. ``Some of them will not be peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vast majority of them can restrain themselves, there is
a hope for peace. I've said they can't live ``under'' the Serbs,
but they can live ``with'' them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook's memories of Kosovo, a region of lush, rolling countryside
that resembles Kentucky, are not all grim. He will remember acts of
kindness by the Kosovar people he calls intelligent and good,
people he came to love.
</P>
<P>
   He will remember nights sleeping in the woods with refugees who
had no food but found a way to bring Cook a cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the Albanian rescued by a Serb who, in turn,
promised to protect the Serb after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's most joyful moments have been discovering friends thought
dead but found alive. His closest friend was reported to have been
gunned down by Serbs at a Kosovar funeral. Cook was thrilled to see
the man on CNN, alive and well and meeting with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair in London.
</P>
<P>
   After Costa Rica, Cook would like to return to Arizona, which he
still considers home. He recently bought a house in Mesa. His wife,
Teresa, who is from Puerto Rico, feels at home with the Hispanic
flavor of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   But he will return often to Kosovo, he said, a province and a
people who have profoundly affected his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I come back, I hope to find a democracy here, where people
can live in peace and freedom, in the society they deserve,'' he
said. ``That's what I want to see. I pray I'll see it.'' &QL;

HEALTH PROBLEMS PERSIST FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ They are like two ships passing, or stalled, in the
night. Todd Hollandsworth goes one way. Devon White goes the other.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth's health is in question after he experienced
swelling in his left tricep. The Dodgers think it's the result of a
ball he dived for during the weekend series with San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   White, who missed the last two games with stiffness in his neck,
returned to center field, where Hollandsworth spent the last two
games. But White said he could have returned after missing just
Sunday's game in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to go (Tuesday),'' White said before Wednesday's
game at San Diego. ``I was fine. I'm the only one that knows if I
can play or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said White wasn't ready to play
Tuesday. He said White still had trouble turning his head enough to
get a good read on the pitchers. Johnson said he wouldn't put White
out there unless the center fielder was 100 percent, though White
pinch-hit in the 11th inning Tuesday and remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no beef (with Johnson),'' White said. ``I'm here. When
I'm called, I go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a season of nagging injuries for White, who missed
seven games with a hamstring injury in May and three games in early
June with a groin injury. At least that's what the club says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I look up, someone's saying I'm hurt, and I'm
not,'' said White, one of the premier defensive center fielders.
``If they're giving me a day off, then give me a day off. There's
been some nagging things, the hamstring and groin.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, neither Johnson nor Dodgers physical therapist Pat
Screnar said they knew to what extent Hollandsworth would be out.
What it does, though, is offset Johnson's plan to use
Hollandsworth's left-handed bat to split up the righty-dominated
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he can swing the bat,'' Johnson said. ``I hope
he's going to get looked at Friday. They're trying to get the
swelling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hollandsworth's last stint on the disabled list began
as a day-to-day injury. It lasted three weeks and was finally
diagnosed as a strained oblique muscle. He began the season on the
disabled list with a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Back in a groove: Maybe nearly two weeks of Camp Dempsey were
enough to turn Todd Hundley back into the catcher he used to be
with the Mets. At the least, he's back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hit a two-run homer Tuesday against San Diego, but more
impressive _ and more encouraging to the Dodgers _ were a pair of
throws he made to second base. He caught one runner trying to steal
and would have had the second one, but Jose Vizcaino dropped the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I figured it out,'' Hundley said. ``I was trying to
throw the ball too hard. Then it happened. No stress on the arm, no
nothing. I've been trying to throw the ball too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even though Hundley made two strong throws against a
team that stole nine bases the previous day, Johnson still pulled
him in favor of Angel Pena when the speedy Reggie Sanders walked
with one out in the 11th. Sanders still stole second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey knows what he's doing,'' Hundley said. ``I'm cool with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he made the move partially because Hundley was
slated to catch Wednesday and if he continued to go longer, it
would have jeopardized that.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Injured right-hander Antonio Osuna is
scheduled to throw another bullpen session today and Johnson said
he could be shipped out for a rehab assignment soon after. Also,
Mark Grudzielanek took grounders at shortstop and could be ready
for a rehab stint as well.... Vern Troyer, who played Mini-Me in
``Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' threw out the ceremonial
first pitch.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They passed up on the risk and potential of Lamar
Odom, the explosiveness of Steve Francis and an open invitation to
Wally Szczerbiak's world. In the end, the Chicago Bulls went
straight to the low post to rebuild their franchise, taking the
burly Duke University forward Elton Brand with the No. 1 pick in
tonight's National Basketball Association draft.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of speculation over who would emerge first from
this year's class, Bulls General Manager Jerry Krause went the
conservative route in picking the 6-foot-8-inch, 260-pound college
player of the year before a nearly sold-out crowd at the MCI
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who would go one,'' Brand said after his
selection, echoing the sentiment of most NBA observers. ``Lamar
Odom, Steve Francis, Wally Szczerbiak, they're all great players,
so I didn't know exactly where I would fit in this draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore became one of four Blue Devils picked in the first
round. The others were Trajan Langdon, taken 11th by Cleveland;
Corey Maggette, taken 13th by Seattle, and William Avery, taken
14th by Minnesota. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the only big deal, made late in the evening, the SuperSonics
sent Maggette, Billy Owens, Dale Ellis and Don MacLean to Orlando
for Horace Grant and two future second-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver picked a disheartened Francis, the skywalking Maryland
junior, with the second pick, and Charlotte nabbed UCLA point guard
Baron Davis with the third pick. Odom, out of the University of
Rhode Island, was the draft's biggest enigma and was taken fourth
by the Los Angeles Clippers. Five point guards were among the first
14 selections.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the night involved the Toronto Raptors ignoring
Szczerbiak, the Miami of Ohio all-American, and plucking
18-year-old Jonathan Bender out of Picayune (Miss.) High School.
Bender, Raptor officials said, was reportedly headed to Indiana in
a trade for Antonio Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Raptors need to clear salary-cap room before the
deal is complete, the transaction may not be made before Aug. 1.
Still, their intention to acquire the 6-10, 205-pound Bender said a
lot about Indiana's desire to get younger and more athletic in a
changing Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Coach Larry Bird and the Lakers' team president, Jerry
West, tabbed Bender as the best athlete in the draft, and
apparently Bird became fixed on drafting the first high school
player taken.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak, the first senior taken, was drafted sixth by the
Minnesota Timberwolves. There was speculation that Cleveland might
try to make a deal to acquire Szczerbiak, whom the Cavaliers wanted
all along, in part because of his popularity in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   There was an absence of blockbuster trades, but the feeling
among many team officials is that with Aug. 1 the first date that
teams can sign free agents, more deals involving drafted players
would be made over the next month.
</P>
<P>
   The host Wizards had the seventh pick, and their selection of
the Connecticut swingman Richard Hamilton nearly brought the house
down. The only similar decibel level came when Francis raised his
arms as he walked up to the podium to shake the hand of
Commissioner David Stern; in one scintillating year at Maryland, he
had become a D.C. area favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Francis sounded too thrilled about going to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he planned to remain a Grizzly, he said: ``As
soon as I can get this hat off. I hear it's cold, rainy, far away
from here and they take all your money,'' an apparent reference to
Canada's tax system. Mike Bibby expressed the same discontent a
year ago as Vancouver's No. 2 pick, but eventually settled in.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Cavaliers took Utah's Andre Miller with the eighth
pick. The Phoenix Suns took the University of Nevada-Las Vegas
forward Shawn Marion with the ninth and the Atlanta Hawks, one day
after moving Mookie Blaylock to Golden State for Bimbo Coles, Duane
Ferrell and their No. 21 pick, took Arizona's Jason Terry with the
10th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Terry was one of five point guards taken in the first 14 picks
along with Francis, Davis, Avery and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks, with the fifteenth pick, passed on the
local player, Ron Artest of St. John's, and chose Frederic Weis, a
7-2 center from France.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, the first Duke player to ever be taken No. 1, seemed like
the logical pick, given his production last season and that the
Bulls' starting center was Dickey Simpkins. Frontcourt help was
clearly needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of pressure playing for the Bulls, with the
heritage and the championships,'' Brand said. ``I am looking
forward to meeting that challenge. I don't know what my role is
going to be yet, but I'm ready to get out there and find out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Odom created the most stir before the draft, especially after
his whirlwind interview tour on Tuesday. Working out in Miami in
the morning for Heat Coach Pat Riley, who was contemplating trading
up for Vancouver's second pick, Odom showed up at a Washington
hotel in midafternoon before catching a late flight to Chicago to
meet with Krause and Bulls Coach Tim Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been hectic for the 19-year-old sophomore, but it
was the only way he could push his value up after two weeks of
skipping scheduled workouts, missing the league's mandated
physical, firing his agent and briefly entertaining the idea of
returning to Rhode Island _ a notion that was scuttled by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association and by the school. ``Some
of the decisions I made might not have been the best decisions for
me at that time,'' Odom said. ``But hey, I'm 19 years old. It's a
good thing I didn't make those mistakes when I was 29.'' &QL;

REFUGEE FAMILY IN ARIZONA READY FOR RETURN TO KOSOVO

<P>
   Naim Berisha is going home.
</P>
<P>
   Home to a land he and his family were forced at gunpoint to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   To a land patrolled by armies, to a city rocked by bombs and
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Home to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how much I'd like to be in Pristina at this
moment,'' he said Monday night, tears welling in his eyes as he
thought of the capital city. ``I'd like to be in my job, in my
office, in my home, with my people.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Berisha and his family _ wife Besa, 35; son Dardan, 15;
and daughter Diana, 7 _ will fly home from the Valley. The Kosovar
refugees were on the run for two months in the Balkans before
spending the past month with relatives in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, I said, `We'll never go back to Kosovo.' I never
believed in three months we can go back to a free Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Berisha knows there may be mines in quiet fields. A calm street
scene could become chaos at any moment. His Pristina home was
looted, gutted of his family's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors may be dead.
</P>
<P>
   But, to Naim, it's time to go back.
</P>
<P>
   When the NATO bombing strikes began March 24, the family of four
moved to a relative's nearby home. Naim, a 46-year-old city
employee in Pristina, says police were placing bombs in the
neighborhoods to try to trick citizens. They would say the damage
from the bombs was the work of the Kosovo Liberation Army or NATO.
When police placed a car bomb nearby, he said, the Berishas fled to
the other side of the city.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed for days with 18 people in a two-bedroom apartment,
locked inside during the day and hiding in the basement at times at
night.
</P>
<P>
   They also watched through a window as police stopped a man in a
small car on the street below, asked him some questions and then
sprayed the car with machine-gun fire. Moments later, they shot the
man in the head with a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Police toting machine guns and wearing black masks went
apartment to apartment forcing people out. The Berishas climbed in
their car and joined others headed for the border of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The drive normally would take about an hour. It took five days.
As they waited in the colony of cars trying to cross the border,
they had no food, slept in the car and could not leave the road.
They were afraid and humiliated, Besa says.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived at the Macedonian border April 5, where ethnic
Albanians they did not know took them in until they left for the
United States. The family arrived in Tempe in late May, getting a
taste of American life, but still with a thirst to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Home for Naim and his family was a second-floor apartment near
Arizona Mills. They would walk in the mall in the evenings. Dardan
tried tennis for the first time and walked around in Nike shoes.
Diana learned to say colors in English.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't take long for them to realize that the apartment
complex's swimming pool is a nice answer to 105 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Naim even talked of how once the Phoenix Suns almost beat the
Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls to the NBA title. At times, they
almost seemed Americanized.
</P>
<P>
   But burning beneath the surface was a need to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sleep, I can't sleep,'' Naim said recently. ``I want
to go back to help my people. I have a `home, sweet home,' '' he
added after pausing for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Pristina home is a two-bedroom, one-bathroom house with a
front yard and a patio. Naim has a large garden where he worked for
hours, tending potatoes, tomatoes and more. It was part of life in
Pristina, a small but densely populated city with a few hundred
thousand residents.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives in Pristina have told the Berishas by phone that their
house appears fine structurally, but has been gutted. All the
kitchen appliances are gone. So is the television and other
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' Naim said.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to return to reclaim his home, save the keepsakes that
may remain, and help the city rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The Berishas were brought to Tempe through the International
Rescue Committee, which resettles refugees. They likely could have
returned home for free if they had waited until procedures were in
place to get them home.
</P>
<P>
   Such procedures could be set in the coming weeks, local refugee
agencies said. Others said the delays were tied to the region still
being unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Naim Berisha couldn't wait.
</P>
<P>
   He worked through a New York travel agency to buy the tickets
home. Relatives said he paid $730 for each of the one-way tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The plans to return were set late last week, and the family
members prepared to go home. They began packing. Young Diana is
having a tough time leaving her relative, a newly found playmate,
in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Dardan says he feels ``very safe to go back'' because the Serbs
are no longer in control; Naim says as long as NATO is there, ``we
will feel free and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Besa isn't so sure, telling her brother-in-law that she is
``really, really nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The family may be met at the Macedonian airport by friends, or
may have to hire a driver. The Berishas have a car that they left
in Macedonia; it may or may not still be there.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, the family walked out of the Tempe apartment
they called home for the past month. They went to Naim's brother's
house and spent their last night in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They will leave Phoenix Thursday, though they will not arrive in
Macedonia until Friday about noon. When they board the airplane,
they will be heading home. But they know the journey is just
beginning. &QL;

YOUTHS DODGE RULES TO SEE R-RATED `SOUTH   PARK' 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At first, Rich Stone and Danny Berwick tried the
direct approach: The 15-year-olds walked up to the box office
Wednesday and asked for two tickets to the R-rated ``South Park:
Bigger, Longer and Uncut.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Like many theaters across Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, the
Fallbrook General Cinema upheld an industry agreement with
President Clinton to keep kids 17 and younger out of R-rated movies
unless accompanied by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going to R-rated movies since I was 13, and this is
the most hassle I've ever had getting in,'' said Stone of Woodland
Hills. ``I don't want the government to be my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Other underage patrons had better luck.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Edward and Don Marshall, both 16, used a common tactic at
the Pacific Theatres at the Northridge Fashion Center: They bought
tickets to ``Austin Powers.'' Once inside, they worked their way
into the 3:25 showing of ``South Park'' amid the bustle of popcorn
sales and restroom crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to stop us from seeing it,'' Edward said.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers and theater officials said there's no way to fully
enforce the policy because you can't check everyone, and youthful
resolve will eventually prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been carding since 1968, when the MPAA guidelines came
out, but it doesn't always work,'' said Brian Callaghan, director
of communications for General Cinema. ``The ushers and ticket
clerks do all they can, but there are R-rated films like `South
Park' and `Scream' that kids want to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they will find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The June 8 agreement between theater owners and Clinton came
after the Colorado school massacre and a long-running national
debate about the effect of violence in the media on children.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on `South Park'' is its bathroom humor and vulgar
deeds. The film itself thumbs its nose at the movie rating system:
It features a group of animated third-graders who sneak into a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with raunchy sex jokes, juvenile displays of gross bodily
functions and wholesale profanity, ``South Park'' had to go through
several edits to get it down from from an NC-17 to an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the teen and young adult target audience balk at the
notion that ``South Park'' is bad for their brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that TV and films are the only influence on youth
that shapes our actions is insulting. The real issues are lack of
gun control and parenting,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the attraction?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just funny as hell,'' said 17-year-old Christopher
Hussain.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stone and Berwick, after a parent bought them tickets,
they made it to the 12:45 p.m. show along with 16 other youths
high-fiving each other in victory.
</P>
<P>
   The duo had a second close brush with the sidewalk, narrowly
escaping an usher who noticed them in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just ridiculous,'' Berwick mumbled.

LITTON PLEADS GUILTY TO FELONIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In one of the largest settlements of its kind
ever, Litton Industries Inc. on Wednesday pleaded guilty to federal
felony charges and agreed to pay $18.5 million in penalties for
concealing commissions paid to foreign consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The plea by two units of the Woodland Hills-based defense
contractor had been rumored for several weeks and concludes an
eight-year federal investigation into deals with Taiwan and Greece
valued at about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's Applied Technology Division of San Jose pleaded guilty
to one count of conspiring to defraud the government. Litton
Systems Canada, Ltd., of Toronto also entered a guilty plea to that
charge and one count each of mail fraud and causing a false
statement to be made to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The company must make restitution in five business days.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Belote, Litton's spokesman, said that settling was the
most expeditious course for the company to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action allows the company to put this matter behind us
and focus on serving our customers and shareholders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also claimed that the case was not about making illegal
payments to foreign government officials but rather about financial
reporting and accounting inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been recent press reports that said Litton engaged
in making illegal commission payments to foreign consultants and or
bribing foreign government officials and that is not the case,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, federal prosecutors disputed Litton's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guilty pleas demonstrate that this is not a technical
violation. This is not a gray area. . . . This is a calculated,
long-range conspiracy to defraud agencies of the government,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia A. Beaman.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's plea was unsealed in U.S. District Judge Richard A.
Paez's courtroom Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for the government of Taiwan to receive $737,000.
</P>
<P>
   Litton also agreed to a compliance plan, which puts in place
guidelines for the company to follow in regard to training
employees in regulations governing dealings for foreign military
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor is paying $16.5 million in criminal fines plus $2
million in restitution and investigative costs.
</P>
<P>
   The case focused on $16 million in commissions Litton paid to
agents who helped the company win Greek and Taiwanese contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Beaman said that Litton paid in excess of $12 million to four
Greek agents who helped the company get about $150 million worth of
aircraft electronics business. And the company paid about $4
million to Yu-Ming Hei, also known as Richard M. Hei, a former
Taiwanese Air Force pilot who worked securing three contracts worth
about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   After he was prosecuted in the United States on tax evasion
charges Hei aided the government in its case against Litton.
</P>
<P>
   Hei said he was paid commissions ranging between 5 percent and
10 percent on business he secured for Litton. He said his largest
take was $3.2 million for a $32 million contract that Litton won to
upgrade Taiwan's anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's Belote declined to explain why the company did what it
did or whether the individuals involved still work at the company
or were disciplined.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Despite a modest offensive output that led to a victory Tuesday,
the Astros' attack was still on the most wanted list of local fans.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call off the posse.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects were popping up everywhere after an 11-3 victory over
the St. Louis Cardinals before 42,475 witnesses Wednesday at the
Astrodome. Almost everyone in the lineup was guilty of first-degree
slumping over the past two weeks, but perhaps Wednesday's 13-hit
outburst will be enough to overturn that verdict.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Astros' highest hit total since June 14, when they
got 13 hits against Atlanta. Four Astros had multiple-hit games,
including shortstop Ricky Gutierrez, who was 2-for-4 with three
RBIs and his first home run since last July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell was the only member of the starting lineup who did
not drive in at least one run.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored four runs in the first inning and four in the
fifth to make it a lopsided game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the type of game we needed,'' said third baseman
Bill Spiers, who had three hits to break out of an 0-for-17 slump.
``I just hope we can keep it going. Any time you're struggling as a
team, you hear about it, and you can't help but think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize that you're going to go through stretches like
that, but it's discouraging. If it doesn't discourage you, you're
not a competitor. Personally, I've been about to drive myself
crazy. It can put you in a bad mood. I hope this was a sign that
we're about to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most runs the Astros have scored since beating
Montreal by the same score June 20. The support was plenty for Mike
Hampton, who cruised to his 10th victory, scattering eight hits
over eight innings and allowing three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who has a 2.45 ERA over his last five starts, joined
Jose Lima as the staff's double-figure winners. Shane Reynolds has
nine wins and one in waiting (a three-run lead with an inning to
play) as a result of the suspended game of June 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give credit where credit is due,'' Cardinals manager Tony La
Russa said. ``He's the best in the league, and he deserved the win.
Hampton didn't make one or two mistakes like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams struck out two of the three batters he faced and
extended his scoreless-innings streak to 8 by pitching a perfect
ninth inning to close out the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won their second in a row after four consecutive
losses to the Reds, who moved into first place in the National
League Central Division by a percentage point Sunday. Wednesday's
victory enabled the Astros to keep pace with the Reds, who beat
Arizona 2-0 for their ninth win in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an all-around good effort,'' Astros interim manager
Matt Galante said. ``It feels nice to get back-to-back wins after
what we've gone through. Hopefully, we're out of the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Jose Jimenez had pitched a no-hitter in his
previous outing, but he lived on the opposite end of the spectrum
Wednesday, when just getting an out seemed like an accomplishment.
Jimenez allowed seven runs on seven hits and couldn't make it out
of the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have too much control,'' said Gutierrez, who had
gone two weeks without an RBI. ``He had pretty good control the
last time we faced him, but (Wednesday) he wasn't hitting his
spots, and that's what got him into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering how the Astros have struggled to score in recent
games, it almost seemed like a scoreboard malfunction when they
erupted for four runs in the first inning, equaling their biggest
first-inning output of the season. The Astros scored four runs in
the opening inning at Milwaukee on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some guys like it better when the game is tight, but I
like pitching with a big lead because I feel like I can settle down
and relax,'' Hampton (10-3) said. ``I was changing speeds and
getting ahead in the count. I felt like I got better later in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in games, I have a little more gas and my pitches don't
seem to move as much.''
</P>
<P>
   The first three batters reached against Jimenez, whose first of
two wild pitches allowed Craig Biggio to score the game's first
run. Carl Everett drove in a run with a sacrifice fly, and Spiers
and Richard Hidalgo each had RBI doubles in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a team gets a lead like that early and they sit on
it,'' Galante said. ``I was glad to see that we kept pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals third baseman Fernando Tatis led off the second with a
double and scored on Edgar Renteria's double to left. Placido
Polanco singled home Renteria to cut the Astros' lead to two.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added a run in the third on Paul Bako's sacrifice fly
and four more in the fifth on Gutierrez's two-run infield single,
Hampton's sacrifice fly and Biggio's single up the middle. Solo
home runs by Gutierrez in the seventh and Jeff Bagwell in the
eighth closed out the Astros' scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, everyone knew we were going to snap out of
it,'' Bako said. ``You're going to have stretches like we had, but
over the course of a long season, the best team will prevail.''

NEW CAR DESIGNS WILL MAKE WORLD DEBUTS AT L.A. AUTO SHOW

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The world's carmakers will be taking the wraps off
at least a dozen new models at the 2000 Greater Los Angeles Auto
Show, the most world previews ever at the local trade exhibit,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The January show, themed ``California Dreamin' 2000,'' will
feature the debuts of at least four concept vehicles, said Andy
Fuzesi, the show's general manager, from four different automakers:
DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   The show's title reflects the fact California lifestyles and
attitudes affect the ways people around the world perceive and use
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers recognize that California is not only a huge
marketplace, but also a trend-setter for new ideas and products.
Consequently, they regard the L.A. Auto Show as an important part
of their strategic plans,'' Fuzesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the manufacturers probably will debut more than one
concept vehicle, Fuzesi said. However, they are keeping the details
sketchy for competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The show will run Jan. 8-16 &UR;  &LR; at the Los Angeles Convention
Center.

BRAND TOPS DEVIL OF A DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it came to their massive reconstruction project, the
Chicago Bulls decided Wednesday night that it's better to be safe
than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Passing on Rhode Island forward Lamar Odom, the Bulls made Duke
power forward Elton Brand the No. 1 overall pick in the NBA draft
and backed him up by taking St. John's small forward Ron Artest
with the 16h pick.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, 19, whose stock fell in recent weeks as he tried to
withdraw from the draft and re-enroll in school, dropped to No. 4
to the Los Angeles Clippers, Maryland guard Steve Francis went No.
2 to the Vancouver Grizzlies, and UCLA guard Baron Davis No. 3 to
the Charlotte Hornets. Odom spent yesterday at Washington's MCI
Center telling anyone who would listen that the Bulls were going to
draft him, but Chicago GM Jerry Krause selected Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamar's a great player, but it came to a decision of Elton's
outstanding character and work ethic,'' Krause said. ``He's got
long arms, big hands and we feel very, very strongly about him as a
person. I envision him being a double-double (points and rebounds)
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Odom, ``My situation got a little chaotic, but hopefully
I'll be Rookie of the Year and prove a lot of people wrong about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   After forcing the departures of coach Phil Jackson and stars
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the Bulls fell to 13-37 last
season and were the lowest-scoring team in NBA history at just over
80 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at both Lamar and Elton without fault,'' coach Tim
Floyd said. ``But combining (Brand) with Artest gives us two steps
toward where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft had a shade of Blue Devil as Brand was the first Duke
player to go No. 1 and the school had an unprecedented four players
taken in the first 14 picks. The Cleveland Cavaliers began their
draft by taking guard Trajan Langdon at No. 11, followed by
freshman sixth man Corey Maggette going No. 13 to Seattle and then
traded to Orlando, and point guard William Avery going No. 14 to
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-8 and with the wing span of a 7-footer, Brand is
expected to start at power forward despite his underdeveloped
face-up game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea I'd go first,'' said Brand, who was also leery
of Odom's presence. ``There's a lot of pressure being the top pick,
but I've got to face it. The Bulls say they needed a lot of things,
and a rebounder and solid defender in the low post was one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft didn't produce a flurry of major trades.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest one involved the Indiana Pacers trading veteran
power forward Antonio Davis to the Toronto Raptors for the fifth
pick and selecting 6-foot-11 Mississippi high-schooler Jonathan
Bender. The 18-year-old prospect gained national acclaim when he
broke Jordan's scoring record with 31 points in the McDonald's
All-American game last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bender, whom many compare to Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, joined
Garnett in '95 as the highest-drafted high-school player at No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we think a lot of this kid to trade away Antonio,''
said Pacers coach Larry Bird, who last year selected high-school
player Al Harrington with the 26th pick. ``He makes us younger,
more athletic and his potential is unlimited, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Magic coach Doc Rivers also pulled off a late deal,
acquiring Maggette and veterans Billy Owens, Dale Ellis and Don
MacLean from Seattle for power forward Horace Grant and two future
second-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mavericks traded up to take Chicago high-school center
Leon Smith at No. 29 and then drafted 7-foot-1 center Wang Zhizhi
at No. 36, TCU star Lee Nailon dropped to the Hornets at No. 43.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the Bulls had the best draft by nabbing two
potential starters. The Cavaliers, despite owning picks No. 8 and
11, drafted guards backups Andre Miller and Langdon. Miller, not
considered a good long-distance shooter, will back up the similarly
skilled Brevin Knight. Langdon will vie for playing time behind
Wesley Person and Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Shawn (Kemp) and Zydrunas (Ilgauskus) inside we wanted to
stretch defenses with some shooters,'' GM Jim Paxson said. ``We've
got a little bit of a logjam in the backcourt, but you can never
have enough shooters.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIKE Hampton usually celebrates crucial strikeouts the way Jose
Lima might fall into a deep, dark depression.
</P>
<P>
   He looks to the ground, shrugs his shoulders and looks almost
inconsolable. He tugs on the sleeve of his jersey and walks around
the mound with that deliberate, slow stroll of his, as if he just
got called to the principal's office and everyone knows he's
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings, he'll walk to the dugout staring at his feet,
then carefully set his cap and glove on the bench next to him, fold
his hands in his lap and just sit there staring at the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as flamboyant (as Lima),'' Astros interim manager
Matt Galante said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is so much the anti-Lima. He is No Way Jose.
</P>
<P>
   But every time you look up, there has been Hampton this season,
making as quiet an All-Star Game statement as Lima has made a loud
one: Yes, way.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Lima has jiggled and slide-stepped his way to a big
win _ blaring merengue music in the clubhouse afterward _ Hampton
has marched methodically right with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night's 11-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals
might have been the perfect picture of how this guy with the
all-business approach somehow always has been left holding Lima's
drink, while Lima dances into the nation's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was precise, strong, sometimes even overwhelming on the
way to his 10th victory of the season. But even if he proved to be
the best player on the field and improved on numbers that in many
ways are better than Lima's, Hampton might have been hard to
notice.
</P>
<P>
   So many other stars and sideshows came to the Astrodome on
Wednesday night, it might have been difficult for the 42,475 fans
to realize there was an All-Star pitcher standing in the middle of
the field.
</P>
<P>
   There was Mark McGwire, the home-run king, slamming shot after
shot into the upper deck during batting practice as the crowd oohed
and aahed. But once the game began, Big Mac mostly slapped a bunch
of McNuggets on a 1-for-4 night.
</P>
<P>
   There was Cards starter Jose Jimenez, the guy whose last outing
was a no-hitter against Arizona's Randy Johnson. But once the game
began, Hampton quietly put up the big numbers while Jimenez's
no-hit bid this time fell 27 outs short, when Craig Biggio opened
the onslaught with a single.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the Astros' bats, living la vida loca and putting
on the kind of display that always steals the headlines. The
Astros' 13 hits and 11 runs, including a pair of doubles and a pair
of homers, were enough to overshadow anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But this guy with the serious stare and the fierce game face no
longer can be considered just another anyone.
</P>
<P>
   His eight-inning effort Wednesday moved Hampton to 10-3 for the
year, just behind Lima's 11 wins. His ERA of 3.04 is better than
Lima's 3.13 and second-best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   His innings pitched (118) are identical to Lima's. His
strikeouts (83) are more than Lima's 80. He has given up fewer
hits, fewer earned runs and fewer home runs than Lima. And
Hampton's victory Wednesday _ anonymous as it might have seemed _
was his fifth in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   If San Diego Padres manager Bruce Bochy chooses Lima for the
All-Star team, he also should choose Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have an opportunity,'' Hampton said. ``But it's
rare to get two guys from the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton does it so differently from how Lima does it, but this
is the first time since 1969 the Astros have had a pair of
double-digit winners this early in the season. Both should get the
call.
</P>
<P>
   Lima dances; Hampton walks around the mound. Lima slide-steps;
Hampton stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to do it with a lot of antics,'' Hampton said.
``That's (Lima's) personality, but that's not me. I just want to
pitch. I always want to respect everybody, and the last thing I
want to do is show people up. I just have the attitude of `go do
your job and give yourself a chance to win.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lima shows up at the park smiling at everybody and talking a
blue streak. Hampton shows up with a focus that makes his teammates
keep their distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys used to tell me, `Man, you're such (a jerk) on the
days you pitch,''' Hampton said. ``But it was just a lot of focus
and concentration. It used to be an all-day thing. My wife would
throw me out of the house. But now, I'm more laid-back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the Astros' clubhouse after his 10th win of the year,
there was no blaring music, no merengue beat. Hampton quietly
talked with teammates and reporters and tried to deflect all the
talk about All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just have to keep pitching and see what happens,'' he
said. ``It'd be nice, but I'm not going to make a big deal about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He never does. He just keeps winning.

PADRES ROUT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ This is Dodgers baseball?
</P>
<P>
   The two games the Dodgers won in San Francisco last weekend to
harbor hope turned out to be nothing but an aberration because they
turned around and continued to do what they've done all season _
lose.
</P>
<P>
   A dubious month of Dodgers baseball ended with a dubious
distinction in a disastrous way.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown lost again to the San Diego Padres, getting pounded
for nine earned runs on 11 hits in an 11-2 loss Wednesday at
Qualcomm Stadium. The Dodgers concluded their worst month of
baseball in 20 years while the Padres are in the middle of their
best.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second-most earned runs Brown's allowed. He gave up 10
in 31/3 innings at Toronto on April 19, 1994. Brown's ERA went from
an NL-leading 2.92 to 3.43 and he fell to 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego won its club-record 12th straight game. They've beaten
the Dodgers six straight times and have won seven of eight against
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the they went 7-20 in June 1979 have the Dodgers had
as poor a June as the one that ended a few hours ago. The Dodgers'
third straight loss left them 8-17, and it is a glowing example of
why they remain in last place in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Even the one supposed given _ Brown _ couldn't accomplish
anything and didn't record an out in the seventh, though he did
give up four runs in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown gave up a season-high nine runs. Back in April, he was
yanked after 61/3 innings and three runs in a loss to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Brown pitched here he was greeted with venom from
nearly 50,000 fans and music designed to point toward the fact he
left San Diego for seven years and $105 million of security. This
time he was only booed (and cheered when he was pulled from the
game) as the Padres shellacked him.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dodgers won only six games in August 1995 and began
last season 8-15 in April, their .320 winning percentage for June
is the lowest since their .259 winning percentage in June 1979.
</P>
<P>
   It brings up the question of whether it's been the toughest
month of Dodgers manager Davey Johnson's career. ``It's been a
tough !ital!three!off! months for me because I really want to be
able to make things easier on them and I really haven't been able
to do anything, and that makes it tough on me,'' Johnson said.
``It's more frustrating for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the perception sometimes is complacency. There's no
complacency on this ballclub. We're good enough defensively and we
should be good enough offensively. We haven't found the right key,
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the Dodgers (34-41) haven't found anything. They
continue to reside in the division cellar, the pitching hasn't
performed to expectations and the offense relies too heavily on the
home run.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Boehringer (5-1) allowed two runs in five innings for the
win. Reggie Sanders hit two homers and drove in five runs.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't start out poorly for the Dodgers. They led 1-0 on Eric
Karros' first-inning double and Brown struck out three of the first
four Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the second, and trouble for Brown after Damian
Jackson's two-run triple gave the Padres a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who doubled in a run in his first at-bat and singled in
his second, hit a solo homer to left in the fifth to tie it 2-2
before all heck broke loose.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres answered Karros' homer with a three in the bottom of
the inning. George Arias singled with one out and scored on Quilvio
Veras' triple to right-center. Eric Owens followed with a single to
score Veras. Owen stole second and scored on John Vander Wal's
double to give the Padres a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was laboring, allowed a leadoff singles to Arias,
Veras and Owens in the seventh as San Diego built a 6-2 lead.
Reggie Sanders then struck the most damaging blow, a three-run
homer to left for a 9-2 lead.

<P>
   Safe to say, no one is selling Elton Brand short any longer.
</P>
<P>
   The inch-count debate on Duke's talented power forward was
settled at the NBA predraft camp last month, and when the yardstick
jury rested _ declaring him a healthy 6-foot-8, not 6-6 _ Elton was
branded a legitimate top prospect.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left was for the rebuilding Chicago Bulls to do the
rest, drafting Brand with the first selection in Wednesday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   After all the intrigue surrounding the Bulls' first-ever No. 1
pick _ Trade it? Gamble on Lamar Odom? Grab Steve Francis? _ they
settled on the best available big man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered trade offers in several directions,'' said Bulls
general manager Jerry Krause. ``What we didn't want to do is get in
a situation where we lost Elton. He's got the makeup and physical
ability to be a building block for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand, 20, the first Duke grad selected first overall, averaged
16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds last season, leading the Blue Devils
to the NCAA championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know where I was going to fit in this draft. I did
want to be the No. 1 pick,'' he said. ``I feel I am the best player
and I can improve a lot. I think I can be the cornerstone in their
rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   And he comes without the question marks hovering over Odom, the
Rhode Island sophomore widely considered the best talent in the
draft. Odom could have been the top pick but his unavailability for
workouts and last-minute waffling on entering the draft caused him
to slip to No. 4, where the Clippers, denied a chance to draft
Davis, leapt at him.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively weak draft made for an immense amount of trade
speculation, but most of the deals made were minor ones, the top
nine drafting teams kept their picks and proceeded in a
semipredictable fashion, with no real surprises.
</P>
<P>
   And while the festivities started with a big man, the draft will
probably be remembered for its class of point guards. The fab five
were all drafted in the top 14 _ Maryland's Steve Francis by
Vancouver at No. 2, UCLA's Baron Davis by Charlotte at No. 3,
Utah's Andre Miller by Cleveland at No. 8, Arizona's Jason Terry by
Atlanta at No. 10 and Duke's William Avery by Minnesota at No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Avery made history. Duke became the first
school to have four players selected in the first round _ Avery,
Brand, Trajan Langdon (11th, Cleveland) and Corey Maggette (13th,
Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics later shipped Maggette to Orlando in a multiplayer
deal to get Horace Grant. The Magic also gave up two future
second-round picks and will also get Sonics Dale Ellis, Billy Owens
and Don MacLean.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the draft action portended other moves to come.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 5, Toronto drafted Jonathan Bender, a 6-11 project from
Picayune Memorial High School in Mississippi. But they are
reportedly sending him to Indiana for Antonio Davis in anticipation
of losing Charles Oakley to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took shooting ace Wally Szczerbiak, the first senior
taken, with the No. 5 selection and can pair him with Kevin Garnett
to form one of the more talented young tandems in the league. The
Timberwolves selected again at 14, taking Avery as insurance
against the departure of Terrell Brandon, a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, worried that Mitch Richmond might leave via free
agency, drafted national champion UConn's hero, Richard ``Rip'''
Hamilton, at No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   And the Atlanta Hawks, who shipped Mookie Blaylock to Golden
State for the No. 10 pick, used the selection to replace him with
Terry.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Marion, a 6-7 forward from UNLV, went ninth overall to the
Phoenix Suns, who acquired the pick from Dallas a year ago in the
Steve Nash trade.
</P>
<P>
   The glum face of the night belonged to Francis, the draft's
top-rated point guard. Taken by the Grizzlies, he buried his face
in his hands. Francis could be converted to shooting guard to play
alongside Mike Bibby, drafted at No. 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, when I wake up tomorrow, I'll be happy,'' said
Francis, who has never been to Canada. ``I feel relieved now more
than happy.''

SONICS DISPOSE OF JUNK, BRING IN HEAVY EQUIPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It wasn't draft day at Sonics headquarters Wednesday
night. It was a house cleaning and, boy, don't those sorts of
things feel good?
</P>
<P>
   Out with all the junk, clutter and used parts.
</P>
<P>
   In with a solid piece of heavy equipment that can still get the
job done inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a too-young, too-unpolished NBA draft, the
Sonics sent grumbly forward Don MacLean, 3-point artist Dale Ellis,
eating guard Billy Owens and their teenage No. 13 pick Corey
Maggette to the Magic for power forward Horace Grant and two future
second-round selections.
</P>
<P>
   The best news about the deal is that popular Hersey Hawkins gets
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the deal was four players for one, and now there's a
little extra room on the Sonics bench, especially with Owens gone.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that Wally Walker got rid of the evidence of
poor judgment when he traded Jim McIlvaine to the Nets last season,
Walker is off the hook now for Owens, too.
</P>
<P>
   Owens was supposed to be the answer for giving the Sonics more
scoring and ballhandling but he wound up being too out of shape and
too injured to contribute anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   And not only is Owens gone, but MacLean is, too, meaning the
last vestiges of McIlvaine have been eliminated from the Sonics
roster.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics need more muscle and scoring, does this mean Shawn
Kemp can come back now?
</P>
<P>
   Some things can't be undone, but maybe the specter of low- and
no-impact players such as Olden Polynice and Owens cast a spell on
Walker and Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the idea of repeating the disaster of 1999 proved too
alarming for the Sonics' president and head coach, who know they
must do better in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there wasn't any way Walker was going to risk having
All-Star guard Gary Payton doubt the Sonics' commitment to winning
right now.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Sonics' off-season has begun with a demonstration
that the club has some sense of urgency to make something happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do something drastic with our roster,'' Walker said
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   You wanted the Sonics to do something, and they did it.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics made a deal that turned some heads _ only this can't
be the end of the retooling.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief but nightmarish 1999 season in which the Sonics
failed to make the playoffs for the first time in a decade,
anything less than a high-visibility deal would have been
disastrous, or at least the wrong signal.
</P>
<P>
   What this NBA city needed was a sign.
</P>
<P>
   What this franchise needs is a kick-start toward putting a
tougher, more consistent team on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And, with an instant boost in height, rebounding and
credibility, the Sonics are also likely to be able to keep Detlef
Schrempf, too, who will be more likely to sign on for a last run
with a team that will win.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he was happy to be heading to a ``contender.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, he used that word, because Grant said it is his
assessment that what happened to the Sonics this year was an
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   That statement demands that Baker reverts to All-Star form _ a
turnaround everyone is eagerly awaiting since Baker's almost
unfathomable disappearance last season.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said that in speaking with Westphal and Walker, he has
been told that the Sonics will sign Baker. That is why Grant was
not dismayed about moving cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play power forward and I know with a guy like Vin Baker and
his offensive talent and with my defensive ability, I think we're
going to be a great combination,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   This draft-day trade could be the thing that starts to move the
Sonics back to within the realm of respectablility _ not that the
Sonics had any room to do anything less.
</P>
<P>
   Grant won three championship rings during his tenure in Chicago.
He then opted to head to Orlando, where the Magic went to the
Finals in 1995 and the expectation was to win.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question arises: What else will the Sonics do?
</P>
<P>
   Grant is only a one-time All-Star, and that was in 1994, when he
was running with Michael Jordan and the Bulls. He is about to turn
34. There was a question that his knee was bothering him, but Grant
said that diagnosis was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problems,'' he said, adding that his seven
rebounds and 8.9 points per game this lockout-shortened season will
get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was because of the short season. I think if you
play 82 games and we're making the playoffs, you'll see my numbers
back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant even talked about wanting to go up against San Antonio's
Tim Duncan, who was nothing less than the Finals MVP. You have to
like that mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Grant, though, the Sonics need more help. A slasher. A
scorer. A backcourt guy who can handle the ball for Payton at
times. There are needs yet to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   But the upside of this cleaning-house day is there is room the
breathe now. Owens is gone. The Sonics did not have any intention
of keeping another 18-year-old draft pick on their roster.
</P>
<P>
   They are for the moment done with rookies and used parts and
their motto is something about ``getting back in the saddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ride 'em, Sonics.

CLIPPERS TURN TO ODOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks of acting like a dodger have turned Lamar Odom into a
Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief,'' said Odom, who can encourage officials from
his new team to exhale by showing up for today's getting-acquainted
press conference at the Convention Center. ``The situation got a
little chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   This only proves the versatile 6-foot-10 ``small'' forward is
understated, if not underrated.
</P>
<P>
   After initiating a rip tide of ink for attempting to avoid the
NBA Draft, the shifty Rhode Island star was penciled in by the
Clippers with Wednesday night's fourth overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clippers, it represents another positive (not to mention
gutsy) move in what looks suspiciously like a perception-defying
draft roll. Two years after plucking power forward Maurice Taylor
at No. 14, and one year after landing 7-foot center Michael
Olowokandi, they select the player many hoop sharpies consider the
monster talent of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid can do it all,'' Clippers coach Chris Ford said. ``He
has star potential.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has stare potential. His recent itinerary of pre-draft
no-shows almost transformed the versatile Odom into urban myth. One
NBA scout who attended an impromptu audition Monday night in Rhode
Island joked that he was attending to see if Lamar Odom really
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, in reality, is an impressive gathering of hoop molecules,
and the questions about his erratic behavior enabled his name to
exist past the first three picks on the draft board.
</P>
<P>
   If confined to basketball, the resume rocks.
</P>
<P>
   After posting national high school player of the year
credentials in 1997, the Odom odyssey rolled through an aborted
flirtation with UNLV, and an academic-hurdle-clearing redshirt year
for Rhode Island's first-year head coach Jim Harrick.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game for the Rams, Odom was a single dime away from
a posting a triple-double. His 19-point, 14-rebound and 9-assist
effort resulted in a victory over TCU. Four months later, his
buzzer-beating 3-pointer won the Atlantic 10 Conference tournament,
putting Rhode Island into the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Odom finished his only college season with averages of 17 points
and 9 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   After watching that near-triple-double vs. TCU, Jeff Weltman,
the Clips' director of player personnel, was socializing with a few
scouting peers and speculating on Odom and his anticipated impact
on '99 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy turned to me and said, `OK, who's going No. 2?'''
</P>
<P>
   After declaring for the draft and signing with an agent, Odom
decided to return to Rhode Island. That didn't fly, either, so he
slouched back into the draft as more suspect than prospect.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't slip too far.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers had expected UCLA's Baron Davis, their target for
their point-guard vacancy, to be chosen third by Charlotte. When
Hornets general manager Bob Bass sort of shocked the basketball
world by actually drafting Davis as he threatened to, the Clippers
zeroed in on Odom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think he's the best talent in the draft,'' Ford
said. ``A lot of players you can look at in the draft have question
marks.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Clippers are banking on the belief that ``Lamar'' and
``Odom'' aren't anagrams for ``Alarm'' and ``Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they aren't, the Clips also realize Odom will provide
plenty of angst for the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the court, he will create numerous problems for the
opposition,'' Ford said. ``What intrigues me is that he really can
pass the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, the team's vice president of basketball
operations, decided Odom's vast basketball skills greatly
outweighed the attendant risk. After a phone chat with Odom on
Wednesday morning, the Clippers were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels all this is behind him,'' Baylor said of Odom's
erratic off-court behavior. ``We think he's heading in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if he boards the proper flight, that direction will be
west.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) With their second-pick, the 31st overall, the Clippers
selected former Illinois State swingman Rico Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who grew up in Chicago and is considered a poor-man's Mark
Aguirre, was the Missouri Valley Conference's Player of the Year
two seasons ago. He didn't return for his senior year, and spent
the past season playing professionally in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a rare feel for the game,'' Weltman said. ``He has
heart and he has character.''

YOUTH NOT SERVING STERN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern thinks he has just the right
medicine for what ails the NBA. He's prescribing a minimum draft
age of 20. He might as well be trying to get his constituents to
swallow castor oil.
</P>
<P>
   If Wednesday's draft proved anything, it's that the NBA front
offices aren't going to take their medicine unless it's shoved down
their throats.
</P>
<P>
   In Stern's world, Andre Miller and Jason Terry would have been
the first two point guards selected. The first forward picked would
have been Wally Szczerbiak. Evan Eschmeyer, Trajan Langdon, Todd
MacCulloch, Scott Padgett, James Posey, Tim James and Calvin Booth
would have rounded out the top-10. Seniors and seasoned players,
all.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a B.A. or B.S. degree to recognize that if you
want to discourage underclassmen from entering the draft, then save
your lottery picks for players who stayed in school long enough to
develop their minds and their games. The best way to produce
patience, after all, is to reward it.
</P>
<P>
   That said, what transpired at the MCI Center in Washington D.C.
was nothing to phone home about. Potential and athleticism were the
Harlem Globetrotters; poise and maturity, the Washington Generals;
the results, utterly predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The five first picks sported a combined six years of major
college experience. To a man their first professional contracts are
guaranteed to last longer than did their college commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago used the No. 1 overall pick on power forward Elton
Brand, a sophomore from Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, picking next, selected Steve Francis, a point guard
who played two years of junior college ball and one year at
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte chose point guard Baron Davis, who graced Pauley
Pavilion for two years, which was like an eternity to him. Asked
after he donned a Charlotte cap about the knee injury that ended
his freshman season, Davis said with a perfectly straight face,
``It gave me a lot of patience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, selecting fourth, snatched forward Lamar Odom, who
put in one season at Rhode Island. Give Odom his due; he spent two
years in college (his first as a redshirt player) when he easily
could have jumped to the NBA straight out of high school, like
Jonathan Bender.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took Bender, a spindly center out of Picayune (Miss.)
High, at No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The chronic youth movement was interrupted - but only for a
moment - by Minnesota, which selected Szczerbiak at No. 6. Miller
(eighth, to Cleveland) was the only other college senior to crack
the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was neatly summed up by Seattle, which used the 13th
overall pick to take a sixth man, Duke freshman Corey Maggette.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the minimum draft age that Stern is pushing isn't
really about saving teen-age phenoms from themselves. It's about
saving his constituents from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Stern isn't the only one disturbed by the league's increasing
youthfulness. The talking heads watched the first round unfurl with
furrowed brows.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Georgetown coach John Thompson used his podium to pontificate
about staying in school, never mind this year's NCAA scoring
champion, Allen Iverson, was a Hoya for a whole two years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to lock the gate after the thoroughbreds have
been let out, the people bemoaning the impatience and impertinence
of today's NBA would do well to take a good look around.
</P>
<P>
   What they'd see is a lot of twentysomethings getting mighty
rich, mighty quick without the benefits of size or soft hands or a
sweet shot.
</P>
<P>
   The nouveau riche aren't just post-adolescent athletes, they're
day traders and Internet entrepreneurs and white-collar workers
with sizzling stock options. A lot of people evidently have found a
shortcut to the pot of gold their parents found, if at all, only
after years of sweat and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the stock market _ or a knee _ could buckle and just
like that the nouveau riche could be fingering fool's gold. That's
when poise and maturity will matter.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, the 19-year-old Clippers draftee, sounds like he already
has had to grow up faster than he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from the world I loved (in college) to one where I
didn't know who to trust,'' he said by way of explaining his
erratic behavior in the weeks leading to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Odom at one point fired his agent and tried to re-enroll at
Rhode Island. After that plan fell through, he then missed more
than one pre-draft workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation got a little chaotic,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, that's what No. 1 draft choices usually say on their way
out of Clipperland, not on their way in.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, it's a whole new world. Someone should tell Stern today
the teens and twentysomethings own today. The rest of us are just
tenants. &QL;

SONICS SWAP DRAFTEE, THREE VETS FOR MAGIC'S GRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Sonics promised an active offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they hope their busy work makes them better.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Wally Walker's idea of retooling a team that
missed the playoffs for the first time in nine seasons did not
include the 13th pick of Wednesday's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Walker orchestrated a five-player trade that landed the
Sonics veteran power forward Horace Grant from the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics drafted Duke forward Corey Maggette, then immediately
shipped his rights to Orlando along with guard/forward Billy Owens,
guard Dale Ellis and forward Don MacLean.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Sonics also received Orlando's second-round
draft picks in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had to do something pretty dramatic with our
roster,'' Walker said, who added, ``Keeping the 13th pick was Plan
E.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who turns 34 on Sunday, gives the Sonics a proven
rebounder and toughness inside. He is also a rugged post defender.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Grant can also get between 10 and 15 points when
left alone. Grant believes he will work well with Vin Baker, who
becomes a free agent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Grant and Baker are interchangeable, meaning they can play power
forward or center.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard from (Sonics coach) Paul Westphal, they
will sign Vin Baker back,'' said Grant, who has two years remaining
on his contract worth $6.5 million in 1999-2000 and $7 million the
following season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to come to an established team and
play with guys like Gary Payton and Vin Baker. At his point in my
career, I'd like to go to a contender. ... The Sonics were just
lacking a couple of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant told Westphal he has ``four or five years left'' to play
defense and rebound with force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them playing together a lot,'' Westphal said of Baker
and Grant. ``I see Horace guarding the (other team's) best low post
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite averaging 8.9 points and seven rebounds last season with
the Magic, Grant is an experienced warrior. He was a big part of
the Chicago Bulls' first three-peat from 1991 to 1993. Grant again
played in the NBA Finals in 1995 _ his first season with the Magic.
He was unsure why Orlando wanted to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was just one of those things they couldn't pass
up,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics struck the deal with the Magic just after Toronto
selected 12th. Orlando wanted to make sure it could get Maggette,
and instructed the Sonics to make the pick.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he had other trades in the works if that deal fell
through. There were a number of deals for Hersey Hawkins on the
table, but Walker said he didn't feel comfortable moving the
veteran guard.
</P>
<P>
   Including Ellis in Wednesday's transaction was apparently tough
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big loss to lose Dale and we didn't do that lightly,''
Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   By trading Owens, the team admitted signing him last year to a
three-year contract was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Owens came into last season overweight and injuries mostly
rendered him ineffective. The Sonics never wanted the little-used
MacLean, and Ellis' salary made him expendable.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts of Ellis _ who turns 39 on Aug. 9 _ Owens, MacLean
and Maggette's expected earnings equaled Grant's $7.8 million
contract within the league requirement of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we ready to rebuild? No, we're looking to get back on the
saddle and go to war,'' said Billy McKinney, the Sonics' executive
vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected the Sonics would not retain the rights to their
13th pick. Even though they finished 25-25 and ninth in the Western
Conference, the Sonics are a veteran team with a goal of winning
now.
</P>
<P>
   They already have three young players _ Jelani McCoy, Rashard
Lewis and Vladimir Stepania _ whom they drafted last year. Adding
another prospect did not figure into the Sonics' immediate plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics still need a backup point guard to play alongside and
relieve Payton. They also want to acquire a player who can create
his own shot, and defend the shooting guard and small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's roster is still without a true center. The Sonics
hope to add another front-line player.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible NBA players officially became free agents Thursday.
While discussions can be held, no team can sign players until Aug.
1. The Sonics are expected to have $3.5 million under the salary
cap to pursue another impact player.
</P>
<P>
   They now have six players under contract, including Grant,
Payton, Lewis, Stepania, Hawkins, and James Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Their free agents are Baker, McCoy, Detlef Schrempf, Olden
Polynice, John Crotty, Aaron Williams and Drew Barry. The Sonics
anticipate re-signing Baker, McCoy and Schrempf. They are expected
to renounce rights to Polynice, Barry, Crotty and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have enough room under the cap to be a player in free
agency,'' Walker said. ``For now, we think we've satisfied one of
our needs.''

SCHEDULES ALIGN FOR ZIMMERMAN, REUNION RESET FOR TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The schedule-makers must be big fans of Jordan
Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners' left-hander was sent down to Class AAA Tacoma
on June 18, he had a whole support group there to greet him the
next morning. The Class AA New Haven Ravens were playing in Akron,
Ohio, that weekend, and several of Zimmerman's former teammates met
him at the Mariners' Cleveland hotel for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The following weekend, the M's hosted the Texas Rangers, a
matchup Zimmerman had been anticipating for weeks. He would meet
his brother Jeff, a Texas reliever, for the first time since both
made the majors, and 30-40 family members and friends would be in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was playing for Tacoma, Jordan didn't have to
miss the reunion, because the Rainiers were also home. Further,
since the M's and Rangers played a day game Saturday, Jeff
Zimmerman even got to take in one of Jordan's games that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to dinner, and he told me, `Stay positive, you'll be
back,''' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   It was good advice, since Zimmerman returned to the M's Monday
when the club released Allen Watson. And the schedule had one more
treat: the M's and Rangers meet again in Texas Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'm still here for that,'' said Zimmerman, who has
learned the first rule of life in the majors _ it's easier to get
there than it is to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down there and thought about my job up here,''
Zimmerman said. ``I'm a lot more relaxed than what I was, and a lot
more confident. I have a better feel for everything _ knowing your
way around, the guys on the team. When you don't, you're going to
be nervous, and nervousness leads to loss of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's promotion of Damaso Marte from Tacoma (right-hander
Melvin Bunch was optioned back) gave the M's two left-handed
options in the bullpen, Marte for long relief and Zimmerman for
short.
</P>
<P>
   When the M's optioned Zimmerman, who had a 6.75 earned run
average in 10 games, they asked him to work on his slider. He
wasn't down long enough to change much, but barring a trade for a
veteran, he seems likely to stick around longer this time.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, 24, hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just depressed when I went down there,'' he said. ``It's
a good bunch of guys, but the only place to play is up here. When I
was down there, I was into it, but I just wanted to be up here so
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   HE'S BACK ... SORT OF: Shortstop Alex Rodriguez has had no
problem advancing on the bases since his return from knee surgery
nearly seven weeks ago. Going into Wednesday night's game,
Rodriguez had scored 50 runs in 44 games, an unheard-of ratio.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not stealing bases like he used to, with just six
swipes in 10 attempts. He feels all the way back as a hitter and a
fielder, but not as a baserunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speed is the only thing that's not there _ out of the box
and my first two or three steps from the base,'' Rodriguez said.
``I'm not the runner I was last year. You just don't want to run
into outs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez still couldn't believe the ball he dropped Tuesday,
when a would-be game-ending pop-up to short twisted in the wind and
fell for an error. The M's won the game, but Rodriguez was
smarting: ``That was the most frustrating play I've ever had in my
career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NO HANG-UP OVER SET-UP: Don't expect any complaints from Paul
Abbott about losing his starting role after one outing. The veteran
right-hander was a closer for Class AAA Las Vegas in 1996 and also
relieved extensively for Iowa in '95. The job, he said, is
essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching's pitching,'' Abbott said. ``You've got to make your
pitches whether you're a starter or a reliever. Just because it's
the first or second run of the game doesn't mean the runs aren't as
important as they are in the seventh or eighth (inning). Basically
it's the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right there, so whatever's best for the team is what's
going to help us take over Texas. That's the most important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Abbott succeeds in the set-up relief role, he'll fill an
opening the Mariners have had since Mark Leiter went down in the
spring. The way manager Lou Piniella sees it, Abbott and Frankie
Rodriguez can be used as set-up relievers in tandem with Jose
Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott's really a good starter,'' Piniella said. ``I just need
him in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella prefers veterans in relief and young pitchers starting,
and when Gil Meche becomes the third rookie in the rotation next
week, that's roughly what the M's will have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get stronger as the game progresses, as opposed to
falling off,'' Piniella said.

OAKLAND UNLOADS ON M'S PITCHING; FASSERO VICTIMIZED EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The Mariners used four pitchers against the
Oakland Athletics Wednesday night, and each had a different
pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   The first was an old reliable, the next a returning rookie, the
third an old phenom and the last a rookie making his major league
debut.
</P>
<P>
   All had the same result: disaster. Oakland crushed Seattle 14-5
before 17,224 fans at the Coliseum. The Mariners, who were shut out
for seven innings by Oakland rookie Tim Hudson, fell to 5{ games
behind the division-leading Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer ignominy, Damaso Marte's effort stands out. The
left-hander, who became Seattle's 22nd pitcher this season, allowed
a homer on his first major league pitch, an opposite-field shot by
veteran John Jaha in the eighth inning. Three batters later, Marte
gave up another homer _ the first of Oakland rookie Ramon
Hernandez's career.
</P>
<P>
   The more important struggles Wednesday were Jeff Fassero's. The
old demons came back to visit the Mariners starter, and they got
there in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander, who seemed to have solved some problems after
three outings in the bullpen and one solid start, allowed four runs
in the first inning. Though he improved thereafter, the ugly
beginning and an uglier seventh inning doomed the M's to the loss.
</P>
<P>
   After Tony Phillips singled to start the game, Fassero (3-8) got
ahead of shortstop Miguel Tejada, 1-and-2. He threw a fastball low
and inside, and Tejada belted it over the left-field scoreboard for
his eighth homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 27th long ball Fassero has allowed this year _ nine
more than Anaheim's Tim Belcher, who is second in the American
League in that category. But it was not the only way Fassero
faltered in the first.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, the A's loaded the bases on two singles and a
hit-by-pitch. Then Fassero issued four straight balls to Hernandez,
walking in the third run. Another scored on a sacrifice fly by Ryan
Christenson before Jorge Velandia's force out ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson brought in the Athletics' fifth run two innings
later. After consecutive singles by Jason Giambi and Hernandez, the
light-hitting center fielder singled up the middle, just under the
glove of diving second baseman David Bell, bringing Giambi home.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last baserunner Fassero allowed until the seventh _
when everything unraveled for the Mariners. They made three errors
in the inning, more than they'd made in any game this season, and
three pitchers allowed six runs on five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada led off with a sharp bouncer just inside the third base
line. John Mabry got a glove on it, but it caromed into the vast
Coliseum foul territory, and Tejada raced to second on what was
ruled a two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines followed with a run-scoring double to the gap in
left-center, making it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   After a walk to Jaha, Fassero was replaced by Jordan Zimmerman,
back with the M's after a 10-day stay at Class AAA Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Olmedo Saenz greeted him with a smash down the left-field line _
Mabry had no shot this time _ to bring home another run, and an
error by Bell made it 8-0 Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   More trouble followed when Ken Cloude entered the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez crushed Cloude's first pitch to the same spot as
Raines' double, and this one gave the A's a 9-0 lead. The A's were
up 10-0 after Christenson made the first out of the inning, an RBI
sacrifice fly, and they added their final run on an infield single
by Tejada, who advanced to second when Bell threw wildly to first.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (3-1) hardly needed the support. The A's right-hander,
who started the year in Class AA, came into the game with a 3.60
earned-run average, despite allowing 28 hits and 11 walks in 25
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings, the M's had seven hits and three walks _
but no runs, because they had left nine runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   They finally rallied when the game was out of hand in the
eighth, getting back-to-back doubles from Mabry and pinch-hitter
Charles Gipson, then reaching on back-to-back Oakland errors,
leading to four runs.

CELTICS HOPE CLACK WILL CLICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Leo Papile and Rick Pitino had a ``gentleman's
bet'' on Wayne Turner's draft position Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. Papile
thought the point guard from Mission Hill would be available to the
Celtics in the second round; Pitino thought he would be gone.
Papile was right. Turner, who played for Pitino at the University
of Kentucky, was there when the Celtics picked 55th.
</P>
<P>
   And since the coach lost his bet, he and his staff drafted . . .
</P>
<P>
   Kris Clack, a 6-foot-4-inch swingman from the University of
Texas. At the beginning of the night, Clack was not in the Celtics'
plans, although he had a solid career for the Longhorns. Celtics
general manager Chris Wallace had him projected ``as a late
first-rounder.'' But when Clack began to slip, Wallace phoned
Clack's agent, who was watching the draft in an Austin hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it got to 50, I called (Randy Bowman) and asked if there
was something we needed to know,'' Wallace said. The agent told
Wallace that there was nothing to fear, so the team went ahead with
a pick that, Wallace said, ``was a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Clack will fit in with the Celtics is a mystery. Playing
him at forward is a near impossibility, even though he plays big
for his size and is a gifted jumper. You don't see too many 6-4
small forwards in the NBA. And when you do, those forwards have to
at least make their 20-footers consistently. For his career, Clack
made 30 percent of his shots from 20 feet and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a streaky shooter,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Clack averaged 14.2 points and 6.4 rebounds per
game for the Longhorns. He was the first player in school history
to accumulate 200 career steals and 100 blocks. Wallace said the
team will get Clack involved in its summer leagues here and in Los
Angeles. He also anticipates inviting Clack to training camp.
</P>
<P>
   As for Turner, Wallace said the team thought about the point
guard at No. 55, but gambled that he would go undrafted when Clack
became available. ``We're going to invite Wayne to our summer
camps,'' the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, not being drafted helps Turner. As a free agent, he
can pick a situation that he believes is best for him. The Celtics
would like to add depth at point guard since they are unsure about
the durability of Kenny Anderson; have discussed veteran Dana
Barros in trades; and would need to re-sign free agent Damon Jones.
It is also known that Turner is a Pitino favorite. Most teams
respect Turner's defense and playmaking, but have questioned his
jump shot.

ANGELS ROUTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- At least the Angels are saving some money on their
Edison Field electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   When the Angels lose, particularly when they lose big, the two
60-inch screen televisions and the stereo system in the clubhouse
are turned off.
</P>
<P>
   They've been turned off for the past three nights, including
Wednesday night after the Texas Rangers embarrassed the Angels with
an 18-4 thrashing, completing a three-game sweep and dropping the
Angels 9 1/2 games back in the A.L. West.
</P>
<P>
   While they're at it, they might as well turn off the stadium
lights. That way, (ital) both (end ital) teams would flail
helplessly at the plate. It would have saved the 23,450 in
attendance Wednesday night the chore of watching the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, it's just the Angels who are helpless at the plate.
Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Between Darin Erstad's two-out walk in the third inning Tuesday
night and Matt Walbeck's one-out walk in the third inning
Wednesday, Rangers pitchers retired 26 Angel batters in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's leadoff single in the fourth snapped a string of nine
innings without a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Before scoring two runs in the sixth inning Wednesday, the
Angels had scored one run in their previous 30 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the three games, the Rangers outscored the Angels, 32-5, and
have now outscored the Angels 57-8 in winning the last six games at
Edison Field, including the three-game sweep last September.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels pitchers, who have performed well most of the season,
finally fell to the level of the offense Wednesday, giving up the
most runs by an Angels staff in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   Things are so bad for the Angels it's making Mo Vaughn sick.
Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had to leave the game after four innings with flu-like
symptoms. He went 0-for-8 with five strikeouts in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins, peppered with questions after the
game much like his pitchers were peppered by the Rangers hitters,
finally lost his patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three games! he said. ``Three games ago we were in the
race. We got our butts kicked for the last three games. That
doesn't mean anything. We win 10 in a row and all of a sudden,
we're back in it. Every time something goes bad the season's over.
I'm tired of it. We have to regroup and take (today) off. Get our
bullpen some rest and hopefully the starters are OK. Let's move on.
End of story.
</P>
<P>
   Things aren't necessarily OK with the starters. Ken Hill, who
was pitching for the first time after elbow problems forced him out
of his last start June 23, gave up eight runs on eight hits in 3
1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After the game Hill said his sore right elbow might keep him out
of his next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to get better unless I rest, he said. ``It's
not a matter of if I want to rest. I need the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't stop battering the Angels pitchers after Hill
left. Nearly every time a Rangers hitter made contact, the impact
sounded like a cannon shot. They finished with 20 hits and their 18
runs was a season-high and the most against the Angels in nearly
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile had four hits, tying a career-best, and the Rangers
had at least one baserunner in 25 of their 27 innings in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pitchers have enjoyed the Angels' futility the past few
days. Mike Morgan entered Monday's game with an ERA over five, but
threw a complete-game and came within one out of his first shutout
in six years.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett allowed only one hit in seven shutout innings on
Tuesday despite a 7.20 ERA entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, it was Ryan Glynn's turn. Glynn, 1-2 with a 7.46 ERA
entering the game, didn't allow a hit until the fourth and didn't
allow any runs until Reggie Williams' RBI triple and Garret
Anderson's RBI single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Collins tried to shake things up before the game, putting Randy
Velarde in the cleanup spot. Seemed like a good idea, considering
the batters hitting cleanup for the Angels had driven in six runs
total during the month of June. And Velarde, hitting .296 going in,
was one Angel that had been hitting lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my most consistent hitter and put him in the middle of
the lineup, Collins explained.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde said he had never hit cleanup in his life before
Wednesday, including little league, and didn't particularly like
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassment, really, he said before the Angels were
embarrassed on the field. ``It speaks for how our team is doing.
It's an embarrassment. ... I take it as an embarrassment they need
to rely on me. I don't belong up there.

RED SOX FINALLY RELENT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At worst, it looked like an infield single, good enough
to tie the score yet again and send this messy sprawl of a game
even deeper into the night. At best, it scoots through and the Red
Sox go home winners.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to Nomar Garciaparra, who already had scored the
tying run in the bottom of the ninth while keeping his 15-game
hitting streak alive, or Aaron Ledesma, the backup Tampa Bay third
baseman with the staples in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Put it like that, and no one on Yawkey Way was headed for the
exits just yet.
</P>
<P>
   But moments later, Garciaparra was giving a two-handed slam to
his helmet and Fenway Park was abandoned to the rats and pigeons.
With a play as sublime as the rest of the evening was sloppy,
Ledesma, a latecomer to this nearly four-hour exercise,
short-circuited one last Sox bid for a comeback to salvage an
11-10, 10-inning win for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Ledesma was a ninth-inning defensive replacement for Wade Boggs,
the 41-year-old antique who will soon be on display in Cooperstown
but Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night hit his first home run in 10 months as the
Devil Rays built leads of 5-0 and 9-5. With runners on second and
third, Ledesma snatched Garciaparra's smash on a tough hop, then
threw across the diamond to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a great play by Ledesma to close us down,'' said Sox
third baseman Lou Merloni, whose inability to turn a play in the
top of the 10th resulted in a throwing error that led to two Devil
Ray runs, breaking a 9-9 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a helluva pick, got rid of it quick, and made a strong
throw. He threw his hands at the ball, and not only made the catch,
he got rid of it quick. A great play.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay closer Roberto Hernandez already had blown just his
third save of the season in the ninth, when Garciaparra singled,
took second when first baseman Fred McGriff bobbled Troy O'Leary's
bouncer, and scored on Mike Stanley's two-out single, beating Bubba
Trammell's high throw to the plate from short right field.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th took on an even more ominous cast for the Devil Rays
when Hernandez walked the bottom two hitters in the order, Merloni
and Trot Nixon, and then bungled Darren Lewis's bunt attempt,
loading the bases with none out. Jose Offerman's sacrifice fly made
it 11-10, and when Hernandez bounced a pitch in front of the plate,
the runners moved into scoring position for Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   But the Belleville Basher, who had doubled in a run in a
three-run seventh, when the Sox closed from 9-5 to 9-8, went down
swinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuse for striking out like that,'' Daubach said. ``I've
got to get the job done there. I take total responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra could have taken Daubach off the hook, while also
sparing John Wasdin (7-1) his first loss of the season, but Ledesma
had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an in-between hop and I was just trying to knock it
down at first, and it ended up going into the glove,'' said
Ledesma, who last month missed four games with a lacerated left
knee, which required staples. ``So I just turned around and made
the throw to (Fred) McGriff.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni, playing third in place of John Valentin, who Wednesday
went on the 15-day disabled list with a bruise on the front of his
brain, was charged with an error when he pulled Garciaparra off
second base on an attempted force play after fielding Winn's bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``No reason to second-guess the play,'' said Merloni, who felt
TV replays supported his belief that Garciaparra's foot was still
on the bag when he received the throw. ``Right instinct, right
play, but it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Cairo, the next Tampa hitter, singled home the
tie-breaking run off Wasdin, and an infield out made it 11-9.
</P>
<P>
   The error was Merloni's sixth in 12 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bang-bang play, and it didn't go our way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox came into the game winners of 11 of their last 15 games
and three of their last four, but have had their hands full with
the Devil Rays, who have beaten the Sox five of eight times this
season, including four of five in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox roared back from a 5-0 deficit by scoring five times in
the fourth inning, the third time in the last four games they've
batted around the order in one at-bat. But after sparing Mark
Portugal _ 3 1/3 innings, seven hits, five runs, including home
runs by Boggs and Bubba Trammell _ an unseemly defeat, the Sox put
themselves again in a 9-5 hole in the sixth, when left fielder Troy
O'Leary played Kevin Stocker's sinking liner into a bad-hop triple
and Nixon overran McGriff's single into a two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox climbed back into it again with three runs in the bottom
of the seventh, on doubles by Lewis, Daubach and O'Leary, who has
knocked in a dozen runs during an eight-game hitting streak that
has closed out one of the most productive months of his career.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, who had two doubles, a single, scored a run and drove
in two, represented the tying run after his hit brought home Lewis
and Daubach. But reliever Norm Charlton struck out Stanley, whose
two-run homer in the fourth had triggered the Sox' first comeback,
and after walking Jason Varitek, Charlton retired Merloni on a
ground ball to preserve the one-run advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Portugal, Sox manager Jimy Williams said: ``That
happened a long time ago. In an 11-10 game, things like that
happen.''

DEALING OFF TOP OF THE DECK 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The Toronto Raptors sent out a strong message
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night that they are tired of waiting. The Indiana Pacers
sent out an equally strong one that they are also tired of waiting.
Each team had what the other one wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, coming off their disappointing _ some would say
humiliating _ playoff loss to the Knicks, started their rebuilding
program by dealing longtime strongman Antonio Davis to the Raptors
for high-schooler Jonathan Bender, a 6-foot-11-inch small forward
who was chosen with the No. 5 pick in Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's NBA draft
and had several teams, including the Celtics, drooling about his
upside. He has even drawn comparisons to Kevin Garnett. Asked if he
had made any serious inquiries about Bender, Celtics coach Rick
Pitino said, ``Not really. No.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's deal won't be made official until
Aug. 1 for salary cap reasons, the Davis trade was a sign from the
Pacers that what they have isn't enough in a league that is leaning
more and more toward athleticism. They found that out in their
stunning loss to the Knicks. Antonio Davis, who makes $4.2 million,
became expendable when Dale Davis decided not to exercise an out
clause in his already substantial contract.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Davis was soon joined by Serbian center Aleksandar
Radojevic, taken by Toronto with the 12th pick. The Raptors still
don't have the point guard they want, but still may be able to do
something with their cap space, although Davis eats away at some of
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a message to our veteran players that we
want to win,'' said Toronto coach Butch Carter.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting is the Pacers' decision not to stand pat and
see their loss to the Knicks as an aberration. President Donnie
Walsh has long been seeking more athletic players, particularly at
small forward, which is where most NBA scouts say Bender will
eventually play.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have now added first-round high school players each
of the last two years, having taken Al Harrington last season.
Bender's stock had risen steadily as draft time approached and the
Lakers were trying to trade up to No. 2 to get him.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana-Toronto deal was the only one that impacted the top
half of the draft. Another biggie game later: the Magic sent Horace
Grant to Seattle for the rights to Duke's Corey Maggette, taken
13th, along with Billy Owens, Dale Ellis, and Don MacLean. Orlando
is rebuilding under new coach Doc Rivers and the Sonics need
toughness, inside players, and rebounders, a lot of which Grant
provides. The others were added largely for salary cap reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, who didn't have a choice until No. 55, selected
Texas guard Kris Clack, whom the team had projected as a late
first-rounder. Kentucky guard Wayne Turner of Boston will be
invited to participate on the team's summer league clubs.
Meanwhile, Paul Pierce was working out at the club's facility
during the draft, under the eye of Pitino, who was on the
treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino also said there had not been any ``serious'' offers for
Ron Mercer, nor had the team made any. ``There's nothing in the
works right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls, meanwhile, were sitting on No. 1 and kept
everyone guessing to the end, finally settling on Duke's Elton
Brand. Ever-secretive general manager Jerry Krause said the
decision was a tough one, but added Brand has long arms and big
hands, a plus in any system.
</P>
<P>
   Brand was as much of a consensus No. 1 as possible in this
chaotic draft, but said, ``I didn't have the slightest idea,'' when
asked if he thought he'd be taken by the Bulls. He will play power
forward and will be joined along the front line by St. John's Ron
Artest, who was taken 16th. The Bulls added Lari Ketner of UMass in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shocker in the first round was Cleveland's selection
of Duke's Trajan Langdon at No. 11. The Cavs had taken Andre Miller
at No. 8, the pick they got from Boston in the Vitaly
Potapenko-Andrew DeClercq trade. Langdon was not thought to be a
lottery pick _ he went ahead of more heralded college teammates
William Avery and Maggette _ and wasn't even present at the MCI
Center, where the top draftees were assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette's selection by Seattle marked the first time since the
lottery was instituted in 1985 that one school had three lottery
picks. In addition, Avery went 14th to the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   The saga of Lamar Odom, thought by many to be the most talented
player in the draft, ended rather quickly when he went fourth to
the Clippers. Odom had been rated No. 1 by many scouts, but saw his
stock drop in the last two weeks when he missed several workouts,
saw his agent resign, then toyed briefly with the idea of trying to
return to the University of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   This was a draft heavy in point guards and the top five were all
gone by the 14th pick. Steve Francis went immediately after Brand
to Vancouver and didn't look all that thrilled about it. The
Grizzlies rebuffed countless offers for the pick, and may
eventually deal Francis for the veteran power forward they feel
they need. Antonio Davis would have fit in nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis of UCLA (No. 3 to Charlotte), Miller, Jason Terry
(No. 10 to Atlanta), and Avery were scooped up quickly. Radojevic
was the first center followed by another foreigner, Frederic Weis
of France, who went to the Knicks at No. 15.

WASDIN LACKS PERFECT ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WASDIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From Buzzards Bay to the Back Bay, the unmistakable
sound of flapping wings could be heard when John Wasdin emerged
from Boston's bullpen and swooped down on what appeared to be yet
another easy kill. With the Red Sox trailing, 9-8, Wasdin knew all
he needed was to put a stiff-arm on the Bedeviling Rays of Tampa
Bay, get some run support from his hot-hitting teammates, and _
voila _ he'd vulture his way to another win, No. 8 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   But not Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays shot down Wasdin, the bird of prey of Boston's
bullpen, by pinning him with his first loss of the season when they
scored two runs in the 10th to break a 9-9 tie and staved off a
last-gasp comeback by the Red Sox to score an 11-10 victory before
a Fenway Park crowd of 27,961.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right there, the opportunity was there for another
one,'' said Wasdin, whose perfect 7-0 record suffered its first
blemish as he went one-plus inning, allowing two runs on one hit
and a walk, a costly walk at that. ``But it's not going to happen
all year long. It's something to go undefeated or to be that lucky,
but, yeah, it came to an end and now there's a good chance to start
it all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin felt culpable for the collapse when he issued a leadoff
walk in the 10th to Tampa Bay right fielder Bubba Trammell. It
wound up haunting him when the next batter, Randy Winn, laid down a
bunt that was pounced on by third baseman Lou Merloni.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni scooped up the ball, threw across his body to second,
where Nomar Garciaparra fielded the throw for an apparent out.
However, second base umpire Lazaro Diaz declared Trammell safe when
he ruled Merloni's throw had drawn Garciaparra off the bag. Error
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was out, but I don't know, of course,'' Wasdin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The play wound up costing the Sox when Miguel Cairo rapped a
fake-bunt single up the middle that scored Trammell to make it
10-9. But Wasdin felt none of it would have occurred had he not
walked Trammell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially on a leadoff walk to start off an inning when
you're tied and you want to go up there and put up a quick
inning,'' lamented Wasdin, who wound up handing it over to Mark
Guthrie after Cairo's single. ``But he had a good at-bat. I threw
him some really good curveballs and, usually, that's what my pitch
is. But I walked him and they bunted over and all of a sudden boom,
boom, boom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were staring at an 11-9 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin, amazingly, almost got off the hook when the Sox pushed
across a run in the bottom of the inning and threatened to score
more when Garciaparra came to the plate with two out and runners on
second and third. But Garciaparra wound up grounding to third to
end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome, they never quit from the get-go,'' Wasdin said
of his teammates. ``We put up a five-run inning tonight (to tie it
in the fourth) and we battled tonight. We battled hard. It just
seemed that we'd get there and they'd get ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But, coming out of the bullpen, Wasdin had to have visions of
snatching another win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the making, but, again, I don't think there's anyone
that lucky,'' he said. ``It was bound to happen, and it did.''

LONG NIGHT FOR DODGERS, BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ This is Dodgers baseball? Yuck!
</P>
<P>
   The two games the Dodgers won last weekend in San Francisco to
harbor hope were an aberration because they turned around and
continued to do what they've done all season _ lose.
</P>
<P>
   And a dubious month ends in a disastrous, deliciously ironic
way.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown lost again to the San Diego Padres, getting pounded
for nine earned runs on 11 hits in a 11-2 loss Wednesday night at
Qualcomm Stadium, concluding the Dodgers' worst month of baseball
in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second-most earned runs Brown has allowed in his
career. He gave up 10 in 31/3 innings at Toronto on April 19, 1994.
Brown's ERA went from an NL-leading 2.92 to 3.43 and he fell to
9-5.
</P>
<P>
   The insult added to the Dodgers' injury is that the Padres are
in the midst of their best run in history. San Diego won its
club-record 12th straight game. The Padres have beaten the Dodgers
six straight times and have won seven of eight against Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to tell you,'' Dodgers center fielder Devon
White said. ``We got our (butts) kicked with one of our better
pitchers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Dodgers went 7-20 in June 1979 have they had a
month like the one that ended a few hours ago. The Dodgers' third
straight loss left them 8-17 for the month and wallowing in last
place.
</P>
<P>
   Even the one supposed given _ Brown _ couldn't accomplish
anything and didn't record an out in the seventh, though he did
give up four runs in the inning. He was pulled after Reggie Sanders
hit a three-run homer to give the Padres a 9-2 lead. It was the
first of two Sanders home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Brown was yanked after 61/3 innings and three runs in
a loss to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Brown,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``I talked to him in the fifth and he said he just made a couple of
bad pitches (in the Padres' three-run fifth). I was hoping he could
keep us in there until the seventh. I hate to leave my ace in there
to give up nine runs.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nearly vacant clubhouse after the game, Brown wasn't around
to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's in the cards, so all we can do is ride it
out and not cause us to put our heads down,'' White said. ``Things
like (Brown's outing) happen. I don't care how good you are. The
aces get their butts whipped sometimes. That happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Brown pitched here he was greeted with music that
pointed toward the fact he left San Diego for seven years and $105
million of security. This time he was only booed (and cheered when
he was pulled from the game) as the Padres shellacked him to end a
disastrous 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dodgers won only six games in August 1995 and began
last season 8-15 in April, the .320 winning percentage this June is
the lowest since a .259 winning percentage in June 1979.
</P>
<P>
   It brings up the question of whether it's been the toughest
month of Johnson's career. ``It's been a tough (begin
ital)three(end ital) months for me because I really want to be able
to make things easier on them and I really haven't been able to do
anything, and that makes it tough on me,'' he said. ``It's more
frustrating for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the perception sometimes is complacency. There's no
complacency on this ballclub. We're good enough defensively and we
should be good enough offensively. We haven't found the right key,
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the Dodgers (34-41) haven't found anything. They
continue to reside in last place in the NL West, the pitching
hasn't performed to expectations and the offense relies too heavily
on the home run.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Boehringer (5-1) allowed two runs in five innings for the
win. Along with his two homers, Sanders drove in five runs.

HAPPY 4TH: ODOM CHOSEN BY CLIPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-ODOM-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ University of Rhode Island forward Lamar Odom
wondered aloud on Monday if his recent indecision about staying in
school or entering the NBA would hurt his stock in
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's draft at the MCI Center. Early on, it appeared
it had. The Chicago Bulls, which worked out Odom as late as Tuesday
evening, chose Duke's Elton Brand, and Vancouver, the first team to
work out Odom, selected Steve Francis of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   When Charlotte chose UCLA guard Baron Davis with the third pick,
many at the MCI Center wondered how far Odom, who was once
projected as the No. 1 pick, would fall.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Los Angeles Clippers ended the speculation when they
selected Odom with the fourth pick. The Clippers were one of four
teams that worked out Odom at URI on Monday, and apparently they
liked what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of let me know if I was around they would pick me
up,'' said Odom, who became the ninth lottery pick for the
Clippers. He will try to lead the team to a consistent level,
something others _ including Danny Manning and Danny Ferry _ could
not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you have to start somewhere. Hopefully it will start with
me,'' said Odom. ``They have a lot of talent on the team. Hopefully
I can come in and add something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling and blinking his eyes to hold back tears, Odom said
being selected by the Clippers makes up for a most tumultuous
postseason. He committed to the NBA draft, signed with an agent,
then parted ways with his agent and expressed interest in returning
to school. He also skipped a workout with the Chicago Bulls and
failed to show up at the pre-draft camp.
</P>
<P>
   Odom's waverings _ and failure to show up for workouts _ soured
many NBA officials. URI held a workout Monday that was attended by
four NBA teams, but several teams previously interested in Odom
opted not to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Some interest still remained. Odom worked out in Miami Tuesday
morning after the Heat attended Monday's workout. After flying to
Washington Tuesday afternoon, Odom flew to Chicago for a workout
Tuesday night. In Chicago, Odom was quoted as saying he had a gut
feeling he would be selected by the Bulls as the first pick.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who grew up playing with Brand in the New York City area,
said he wasn't discouraged when he wasn't chosen by the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been 50th,'' he said. ``This is the NBA. It
really didn't matter. I might have been a little disappointed (if
he slipped further) but by the next morning, I would have been all
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Bulls picked (Michael) Jordan, they weren't the best
team in the NBA, either. I think you have to make the most of the
situation, play hard, be devoted to your team and the coach, and
everything will work out fine. They have a great new arena and I'm
going to be living in the city of Los Angeles playing basketball.
If you ask for more than that you are being greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom did not shoot well at his Monday workout, but Clippers
officials were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good prospect,'' said Clippers scout Jim Mitchell. ``He
has size, speed, and quickness. As for his position, we're at a
point where we could play him in a number of places.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom said he will put the waverings and other issues he endured
at the amateur level behind him. However, he did blame himself for
any ill perceptions he may have prompted among NBA officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, some decisions I had to make may not have been
the best decisions I could have made at the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would have done differently, Odom said, ``Some of
the decisions I made would have been different so that my ride
would have been a little smoother. But you make mistakes and I know
that. I just want to put it behind me and play in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   At URI, the 6-foot-10-inch Odom played every position but
center, and was named Atlantic 10 Conference Rookie of the Year,
averaging 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game. It
was his only year of college ball.
</P>
<P>
   His skills are best suited for the perimeter, but Odom says he
does not have a preference. He added, however, that he hoped to
build his strength to improve his post game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play in the post and I think if I can play in the
post, I can create some mismatches for other teams because of how
well I handle the ball. But it doesn't matter if I play the four,
the five, the six, seven, eight, or the coach's pet.''

BUSH COLLECTS $36 MILLION FOR CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and ROBERT B. GUNNISON  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Buoyed by a record $36.3 million in
contributions to his presidential campaign, Republican George W.
Bush began showing off his conservative credentials Wednesday as he
declared his opposition to abortion and gay marriage.
<P>
   On the second day of his trip to California, Bush appeared
amazed at the amount he has raised so far _ nearly 10 times as much
as his closest Republican rival and twice as much as Vice President
Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by the response,'' said. ``I am amazed at the
outpouring of support.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will announce in July whether he will accept matching
federal funds for his campaign _ a move that would limit his
contributions. But he hinted that his windfall would mean he would
decline them, saying ``it makes the decision easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor added to his bounty last night in San
Francisco with a money-raising dinner. He addressed an overflow
crowd of 1,100 at a $1,000-a-plate dinner at the St. Francis Hotel.
After his Silicon Valley fund-raiser Thursday morning, Bush's Bay
Area take from the two events is expected to hit $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending were Charles Schwab, the stock market
heavyweight; Don Fischer, chairman of the Gap clothing company; and
Halsey Minor, head of the internet firm Cnet and a major financial
supporter of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest contributions figures were announced, the
wealth of the Bush campaign gave it the flavor of a full-bore
presidential trip, although the California primary is still eight
months away.
</P>
<P>
   And he provided the scent of victory for California Republicans
shell-shocked by two Democratic presidential victories in
California since 1992 and the crushing defeat of Dan Lungren last
year in the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous feeling, an energy even among independents
and Democrats,'' said Secretary of State Bill Jones, the state's
highest-ranking Republican. ``It's such a tremendous difference
between this year and last.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his schedule is packed with fund-raising opportunities
at every traditional mealtime, Bush began to define his positions
on a number of issues critical to California voters at press
conferences in Los Angeles and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   About abortion, Bush said, ``I've been a pro-life governor since
I got elected. I believe the goal of America ought to be to (have)
every unborn child welcome in life and protected by law. That's an
ideal world, and we don't live in an ideal world.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would rule out a running mate who supported abortion
rights, Bush said, ``I take nobody off the table.''`
</P>
<P>
   About gay marriage _ a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriages
is on the state's March 2000 ballot _ Bush said, ``I don't believe
in gay marriage,'' but he added, ``I'm not going to support any
initiative in any state, but I believe marriage is between a man
and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said pleasant words about former California Gov. Pete
Wilson, even though he has previously disparaged two of Wilson's
favored ballot initiatives, Propositions 187 and 209.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should distance myself from Gov. Wilson,''
Bush said Wednesday. ``He's a friend. I hope he gets me elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took a page from Wilson's playbook, stating his
opposition to oil drilling off the California coast _ a position
that won Wilson favor among environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush dismissed the idea that a Republican can antagonize
voters by embracing Wilson's opposition to government benefits for
illegal immigrants and affirmative action. ``Maybe the state is not
as liberal as you think,'' Bush told reporters. ``This is a state
that Ronald Reagan built a great political machine in.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wilson himself is not involved in the Bush campaign yet, many
of his closest aides and associates already are. His former chief
of staff, Bob White, sat in the front row at the Sacramento
luncheon. In the audience were many former Wilson aides and
lobbyists with close ties to the former governor.
</P>
<P>
   Between fund-raising events, Bush managed a few traditional
public campaign stops _ at a teachers' symposium in Los Angeles and
with youngsters at a football camp in Sacramento, where he shared
the stage with Oakland Raiders receiver Tim Brown, also a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   In the 102-degree heat, Bush tossed a few wobbly football passes
and bantered with young boys before heading for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's skillful campaign techniques ``send a shiver down the
spines of a lot of Democrats,'' said political analyst and former
White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Myers pronounced Bush's campaign already ``at the White House
level,'' employing all ``the feeling'' _ rope lines, security men
with special lapel pins, press corraling _ of a presidential
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has even made a play for Clinton's core supporters in
Hollywood, meeting in the Bel Air home of Warner CEO Terry Semple
with such Democratic heavy hitters as actor Warren Beatty and
Paramount executive Sherry Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to appeal to people from all parts of society, to
call on all of us to do our part to usher in the responsibility
era,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shows an easy, relaxed manner much of the time, masking his
relative inexperience as a candidate for national office.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked by a reporter what he is doing to ensure that
he is ready for the job, Bush said: ``I'm going to listen and
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I happen to mispronounce the name of a country
doesn't mean that I don't understand how to lead,'' he said. Bush
recently called Kosovars ``Kosovarians'' and Greeks ``Grecians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters,'' Bush said, ``is do I know how to set clear
goals? Do I know how to lead? Do I shoot straight? And that's all I
know to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will travel to Silicon Valley Thursday, where he is
expected to raise $300,000 at a breakfast for technology
supporters. He then travels to Fresno for a fund-raising lunch
expected to raise $150,000.

 THE WORLD'S A PAWN FOR KASPAROV  &HT;     By STEVE RUBENSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entire world, which may not know what it's doing, voted to
move its queen's knight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was sensible decision, but it may not be enough against the
world's opponent, chess champion Garry Kasparov.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several months, Kasparov is playing perhaps the
world's most unusual chess match _ a game via the Internet against
every player on Earth who wants to play. Each side gets one day to
make its next move and, when it is the world's turn to play, the
move chosen by the most players is the one made against the champ.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 million computer users have logged onto the site
(www.zone.com/kasparov) to view the match, and about 10,000 players
are actually casting votes for the moves, a match spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been five moves on each side. Wednesday, the
world moved its queen's knight to the c6 square and hoped for the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going OK so far,'' said Chronicle chess editor George
Koltanowski. ``The world is holding its own. For how much longer,
it's hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The world will probably lose, Koltanowski said, because average
players play like average players _ alone or together _ while
Kasparov plays like Kasparov.
</P>
<P>
   The match began last week when the 35-year-old world champion,
who is playing the white pieces, advanced his king's pawn two
squares forward. The world pondered, then voted to advance its
queen's bishop pawn two squares, an opening known as the Sicilian
Defense. (The moves so far: 1 e4 c5; 2 Nf3 d6; 3 Bb5+ Bd7; 4 Bxd7+
Qxd7; 5 c4 Nc6).
</P>
<P>
   The match is being sponsored by Kasparov, an Internet gaming
site and a bank that provides a steady stream of online ads for its
credit card while players are trying to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make the right move,'' say the ads, ``and receive a free chess
set with your card.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasparov, who has soundly beaten his mortal foes, suffered his
most crushing loss two years ago in a six-game match against IBM
supercomputer Deep Blue and is clearly still smarting from the
defeat. In an online chat with players before the current match,
the champ grumbled that IBM has still refused to publish
information about the computer's workings, so that the scientific
value of the match was zero.
</P>
<P>
   As to his chances in the current match, Kasparov, not known for
his modesty, said there was a ``chance I could lose, but it's
highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the world is having its problems with sportsmanship,
too. In the chat rooms, players are griping about how lousy the
average Internet player is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to take into account that the vast majority of
chess players are beginners,'' wrote a player calling himself
Timber Wolf. ``Seems expected that eventually the wrong move will
be voted, after which Kasparov will clean house. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the world's players debated their choice of move via
chat room messages, politely at times. About 72 percent favored the
Nc6 move that was selected, while 11 percent wanted to move the
other knight, 4 percent wanted to advance the king's pawn and 3
percent wanted to try a bold, risky assault with the queen.
</P>
<P>
   Koltanowski, the 95-year-old grandmaster whose daily column has
appeared in The Chronicle since 1947, called the online match a
``gimmick, but a good gimmick.'' He himself tried a similar stunt
against Chronicle readers in the 1940s _ tallying moves by
postcards instead of computers _ and polished off the competition
with no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does Kasparov have to be afraid of?'' he said. ``If you
have 2 million opponents and most of them play like schmoes, then
it's not really so tough, is it?''
</P>

 CIVIL-RIGHTS SUITS AGAINST SAIPAN GARMENT FIRM  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beefing up its offensive against what it says are rampant labor
abuses in the U.S. territory of Saipan, the federal government
filed two civil-rights lawsuits Wednesday against one of the
Pacific island's largest garment manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed the suits in
the U.S. court in Saipan against Sako Corp., a South Korean-owned
firm that produces clothes for San Francisco-based Gap.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits charge that Sako discriminated against several
pregnant workers by refusing to allow them their mandatory
pregnancy benefits and that the firm tried to fire Carmencita Abad,
a worker who tried to organize a union at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Marks, a spokesman for the Gap, declined to comment on the
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Abad, who worked for Sako until January and is now a San
Francisco-based campaigner for reform in Saipan, said the lawsuits
should set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy that there finally may be justice for all the
present and future workers,'' she said. ``Maybe this will also send
a signal to other factories that they can't mistreat their
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Saipan is part of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S.
commonwealth in the Western Pacific. The islands are exempt from
federal immigration, customs and wage-and-hours laws. As a result,
a billion-dollar garment manufacturing industry has sprung up on
Saipan, using indentured Asian workers in conditions that a wide
variety of federal government agencies say amount to illegal
sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   In January, human-rights groups led by Global Exchange in San
Francisco and Sweatshop Watch in Oakland filed a class-action
lawsuit against Sako, other Saipan garment firms and their U.S.
clients, including Gap, Nordstrom, J. Crew, Tommy Hilfiger and
Burlingame's Gymboree.
</P>
<P>
   The National Labor Relations Board also has filed two complaints
about labor abuses in Saipan that are now pending in administrative
law courts.
</P>
<P>
   Several bills have been proposed in Congress to remove the legal
loopholes used by employers in the Northern Marianas, but they face
fierce opposition from conservative Republicans. Similar
legislation was blocked last year by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, who calls the Saipan garment industry a sign of
``free-market success.''

 ALTERNATIVE SOURCE FOR HEPATITIS C DRUG ON WAY  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tiny mail-order pharmacy in Pennsylvania is preparing to do
battle against drug giant Schering-Plough Corp. for a stake in the
burgeoning market for hepatitis C treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh has
announced plans to fill prescriptions nationwide for the anti-viral
drug ribavirin, used by growing numbers of hepatitis C patients in
combination with the drug interferon.
</P>
<P>
   The hepatitis C virus, or HCV, is typically spread through
contact with contaminated blood and now infects an estimated 4
million Americans, although only about 1 million have been
diagnosed. Chronic carriers often go decades without symptoms but
may eventually develop severe liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   The ribavirin-interferon combination generates a lasting
response in fewer than half of those who try it, often at the cost
of serious side effects. Still, the combination is considered the
best treatment now available for most patients.
</P>
<P>
   Schering reported worldwide sales of $719 million for the two
drugs last year, reflecting both a growing demand among HCV
patients as well as some use for treating cancer and other
conditions. The company claims more than 80 percent of the HCV drug
market.
</P>
<P>
   But along with that success, the New Jersey-based drugmaker has
also generated complaints of high prices and overly aggressive
marketing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Schering-Plough has been the sole source
of ribavirin, sold only as part of a kit that also include's the
company's proprietary brand of interferon, called Intron A.
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of interferon are available from different
manufacturers. Some patient advocates charge that Schering's
bundling strategy has made it difficult for people to experiment
with different drug combinations and dosages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's anticompetitive,'' said Brian Klein, a San Francisco
leader of a national patients group called the Hepatitis C Action
and Advocacy Coalition. ``It's delaying research and hurts
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The group issued nationwide e-mail alerts this week announcing
the new source of ribavirin, complete with the Pittsburgh
pharmacy's toll-free phone number (888-347-3416) and Web site
(www.spsdrug.com).
</P>
<P>
   Schering's spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said the company is
convinced that its package is the safest, most convenient way to
make the drugs available. Special ``compassionate use''
arrangements can be worked out for patients who need ribavirin
alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The HCV drug kit was specifically approved only as a combination
product by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. By contrast,
European authorities have banned such practices, forcing Schering
to seek approval to market each product individually. That
application was approved by European regulators just last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh pharmacy said it holds all the necessary licenses
to fill mail-order prescriptions as a so-called ``compounding''
pharmacy, referring to the specialized practice of preparing
individual drug orders.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Stein, one of three pharmacists at Fisher's, would not
disclose her supplier of ribavirin, other than to say it is
imported from abroad. She said the product has been tested and
found to be pure.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacy plans to fill capsules as individual prescription
orders are received starting after midnight July 8, when certain
U.S. patent rights Schering holds will expire.
</P>
<P>
   The mail-order pharmacy is offering the anti-viral drug at $1.25
per 200-mg capsule. That works out to about one-fifth the cost of
the same drug obtained in the Schering-Plough combination kit.
</P>
<P>
   Consalvo said the drugmaker has no plans to change its marketing
practices or prices. He also said that patients need to be wary of
the possibility that other sources of ribavirin may not meet the
manufacturer's standards for purity and other chemical factors.

A PLUS IS NOT A MINUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charity Shields, a young single mother, was shopping in a Kansas
City store when she was mistaken for another person _ a model. At
size 18, Shields was a bit taken aback, but the idea so intrigued
her that she went searching for a modeling agency.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later she is working regularly for such clients as
Wal-Mart, Lane Bryant Stores and the Jones Store in addition to
holding down a job as a workers' compensation claims adjuster and
caring for her 5-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Shields is among a growing number of models caught up in the
explosive energy of a profession that used to stigmatize large
women.
</P>
<P>
   Mauria Stonestreet, size 14 and a special education teacher in
Lawrence, decided to investigate modeling at the urging of her
brother, Los Angeles actor Eric Stonestreet. She has been so
successful in the Kansas City area that in September she will move
to Chicago to pursue a full-time career.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Smith answered a classified ad for a plus-size model
two years ago. Now Julie Wolf, owner of the Agency, a Kansas City
modeling representative, says, ``I wish I could clone her.'' And
Kim Hoffman, owner of Hoffman Models in Overland Park, says she is
actively scouting for plus-size talent, encouraging people at
weight-loss centers to watch for potential models.
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been so. Christine Alt, a celebrity plus-size
model and frequent spokeswoman, says when she started as a model in
1981, ``there was no such thing as a plus size.''
</P>
<P>
   When she gained weight and moved into large sizes in 1986, there
were only ``two or three agencies and a handful of models.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are hundreds out there, instead of just a hundred,''
says Alt who appears on the July//August cover of BBW (Big
Beautiful Woman) magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The plus-size model field probably has quadrupled in most major
cities in recent years, says Catherine Lippincott, director of
public relations for Lane Bryant, the Limited's retail chain that
specializes in large sizes. ``Now you can find just any look you
need,'' in any size, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Plus-size images are gaining prominence. Emme, the stylish blond
model, appears on the cable channel E's ``Fashion Emergency.'' The
high visibility of such celebrities as ABC Television's Star Jones,
Rosie O'Donnell, Cybill Shepherd and Kate Winslet is providing
positive ego reinforcement for many women.
</P>
<P>
   Mode magazine, a publication devoted to large women is in its
third year of publication and added Girl for teens earlier this
year. BBW magazine relaunched on the West Coast earlier this
summer. Anjellika recently was the first plus-size model voted to
an international models' association hall of fame, notes Gary
Dakin, a plus-size model booker for the Ford Agency in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The field of large-size modeling has grown ``beyond my own
dreams,'' says Susan Georget, the founder and director of
Willhelmina Models' Plus Size division, which is now getting
requests from major European fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, credit in part goes to the apparel industry. Designers
and manufacturers have suddenly awakened to a massive untapped
market of fashion-conscious consumers who until recently had
limited choices beyond pull-on pants and tunics. More and more name
designers including Emanuel Ungaro, Gianfranco Ferre, Givenchy and
Giorgio Armani have added plus-size collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a growth area for us,'' says Tina Hodak, the
St. Louis-based fashion director for Kansas City's Jones Store Co.
The store will debut Lauren by Ralph Lauren in large sizes this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Alt says the clothing industry boom is also a result of
consumers raising their voices. ``The reason it happened is because
of the women,'' she said. ``They wrote letters. They complained.
They let them know they were sick of stretch green polyester pants.
They were heard.''
</P>
<P>
   And manufacturers are responding in a big way. Lane Bryant has
launched a major promotional effort to address a young, hip
customer. The company contracted with Camryn Manheim of
television's ``The Practice'' to be a celebrity model and broadcast
a New York fashion show on the Web last week.
</P>
<P>
   Today's fashion essentials such Capri pants, drawstring pants
and skirts, cargo pockets and camisole sweater sets are now
flooding stores in all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, plus-size models did not always enjoy the same
glamorous image as other models. They didn't get paid as much,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Alt says that in her early days, some photographers simply
refused to shoot plus-size models. And smaller models made a point
to ignore them on jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has changed dramatically now and ``the industry is
one big happy family,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the stigma has mostly disappeared. Rates have almost
closed ranks, says Ford's Dakin, and discrepancies in treatment
have dropped if not totally disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica La Voie, a young Kansas City area woman, is working
quite happily as a size 14 with New York's Wilhelmina Agency. But
she recalls her move there two years ago, when no budget was
provided to help her find housing, unlike with other models. She
found herself living in a rodent-infested hotel for a time.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ford agency, Dakin says all the models, regardless of
size, are ``handled with kid gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, requirements for plus-size models are comparable to
those of other models. They must be at least 5 feet 9 inches tall
and well-proportioned. (Most work out to stay toned.)
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, larger sizes such as 16 and 18 seem to be most
in demand. ``Julie encouraged me to gain weight,'' says Elizabeth
Smith of her agent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, size 14 may be the most prevalent, but Lane
Bryant's Lippincott says the company uses most sizes in their
shows, and 14 to 16 for shoots because those are the sample sizes.
Mode tends to use models size 12, 14 and 16, says Nancy LeWinter,
publication director.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond size, all models should have ``an inviting personality,''
as Kim Hoffman calls it, or ``a certain energy,'' says LeWinter.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush manufactures a fight over sex ed
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the run-up to his presidency _ for he seems to regard his
election in 2000 as a gimme _ George W. Bush has promised to spend
as much of the federal budget to promote sexual abstinence as is
spent promoting contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   As sops to the religious and cultural right go, this one is
fairly benign, but even so Bush is making up a fight where none
need exist. He is buying the conservative charge that sex education
is ``Do it!'' education.
</P>
<P>
   It is not. Sex education courses routinely emphasize the obvious
fact that abstinence is the only sure-fire pregnancy prevention,
and an independent study presented to the conservative American
Enterprise Institute a few years ago confirmed that sex education
does not excite sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says, too, that he wants to fund a study to determine the
effectiveness of abstinence education, but we already know the
answer. Repeated studies have shown that the most effective
education combines abstinence and contraceptive information with
tutoring on how to resist social pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still being briefed on issues, trying to crank what he
knows up to speed with what he says, and here the lag is apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Teen pregnancies have declined nearly 20 percent in the '90s,
but the rate is still nearly double the rate of European teens, who
are at least as sexually active as American teens _ evidence that
Europe's easy openness about sexuality pays off in a sharply lower
rate of unwanted pregnancies. We muddle along with an incoherent
combination of smirky sexual titillation and prissy ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans beat ourselves up uniquely over sex, not least
because we don't know our own history. We imagine a past of Edenic
innocence, but we have never been especially chaste.
</P>
<P>
   A study of family-bible marriage and birth dates found that
about a third of the brides in early Colonial times were pregnant.
A 1953 study showed that 47 percent of men born between 1900 and
1919, and 23 percent of women, had had sexual intercourse before
marriage. Today, only 10 percent of adult men and 22 percent of
women have had their first sexual experience with their spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The abstinence education Bush is touting tries to scold and
frighten the young out of all sexual activity before marriage, but
the age of puberty has dropped by about two years for boys and
girls in this century, and to accommodate extended education and
career starts, marriage has been delayed by several years.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there was only a short gap between the hormonal
tsunami and its legalization, long years now stretch. To suppose
the young are properly prepared for that by being limited to
abstinence is simply silly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself openly admits to a wastrel past and seems only
officially chagrined about it. A little humility, born of his own
experience, might lead our putative president to save us the $73
million he proposes to spend to treat abstinence and sex education
as cultural enemies rather than as the natural allies they are.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GAUGE THE EBBING POLITICAL TIDE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release Sunday, July 4.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal campaign finance laws call for the
taxpayers to pick up virtually the entire tab for next summer's
national political conventions. If the presidential nominees are
known in advance, as has been more or less the case since 1952, the
national TV networks will virtually ignore these events.
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, even the cable networks that specialize in
political news intend to duck gavel-to-gavel coverage, seeking to
outflank their rivals by offering their own branded reports. These
coverage decisions reflect two trends as similar as peas in a pod:
falling public interest in the political process and falling public
confidence in government.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington is not a pea plant. As Elizabeth Drew notes in
her new book, ``The Corruption of American Politics,'' this is the
place where ``law and policy are made on taxes, medical care, the
quality of our air and water, Social Security, the national
defense, foreign involvements, the safety of airplanes, abortion,
securities regulations, the release of new drugs, gun control, the
soundness of our banks, disaster relief, continuing education and
training, to name just some.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, fewer and fewer Americans have any real say over
such key policy decisions. If you define insiders as those who
regularly contribute $250 or more to political campaigns at any
level, then you're talking about roughly one-half of 1 percent of
the adult population.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the 1996 presidential election, by far the most
costly in U.S. history, registered the lowest percentage turnout in
72 years. In the 1998 midterm elections, with presidential
impeachment in the wind, the overall turnout fell to 36 percent.
That was the lowest participation since 1942, which came in the
midst of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Those dreary statistics are reflected as well in the number of
taxpayers who choose to fund presidential campaigns through their
annual returns. Since 1980, the downward trend in participation
remains unbroken. It now hovers at around 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since the check-off plan draws scarcely any favorable publicity
from its intended beneficiaries, it's little wonder that some tax
filers wrongly believe they're opting out of an extra $3 payment,
rather electing not to earmark their money.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission estimates that the $200 million
diverted through check-offs between 1997 and 1999 will be
sufficient to cover next year's conventions and general election.
But, for the first time, it projects a shortfall in matching funds
for the presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner, is currently weighing whether to waive federal
campaign matching funds, a step that would allow the Texas governor
to shun spending limits in primary states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's legitimate,'' Bush said a few months ago. In the
same vein, Vice President Al Gore, Bush's presumed Democratic
rival, might note that there's no controlling legal authority that
compels him to accept a federal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Bush and Gore campaigns overflow with cash, the
moral tide continues to ebb.

US' LOPSIDED RECORD AGAINST GERMANS DECEIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ They're playing a rival they've lost to once in
six years, a rival that sweated to get here and struggled to stay
here. And yet, the US women's soccer team knows that if they don't
lace up and get after Germany from the first tick of the clock in
Thursday's World Cup quarterfinal at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, they
could be watching Sunday's semis on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've beaten them and beaten them, but it's not like we go out
there and sashay around them,'' said keeper Briana Scurry. ``This
isn't a team where you can rely on past performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Americans are 8-3-1 against the Germans, the
Frauen-Mannschaft has won or drawn two of the last four meetings.
``This is the equivalent of a final,'' said US coach Tony DiCicco.
``Both teams are good enough to be in the final if the brackets had
fallen differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans were runners-up to Norway last time and placed third
in 1991, but they've been pedestrian here so far. They drew with
the Italians, who've already gone home. And after leading Brazil in
added time, the Germans failed to clear a loose ball in the area,
gave up the tying goal, and failed to win their group.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we face the US team earlier than we wanted,'' said coach
Christina Theune-Meyer. ``And I think earlier than they wanted,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks wouldn't have minded getting the fast-and-loose
Brazilians instead of the Germans, who present the same sort of
challenge their nemesis Norwegians do. They're disciplined. They're
physical. They're solid in the back, strong in the midfield, and
worrisome up front. ``They're an outstanding team,'' said DiCicco,
``with a lot of personalities all over the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without captain Martina Voss, who tore her hamstring
against the Brazilians, the Germans have multiple weapons _ keeper
Silke Rottenberg, defenders Steffi Jones and Doris Fitschen,
midfielders Sandra Smisek and Bettina Wiegmann, and strikers Inka
Grings and Birgit Prinz. ``We are ready to play to the limit,''
said Theune-Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be playing a US squad that has lost one match on home
soil in three years, has outscored its opponents, 13-1, in three
Cup matches, and is riding a tsunami of star-spangled euphoria.
``The US is on a wave of success right now and they are highly
motivated in their home country,'' conceded Voss. ``But first they
have to play 90 minutes against us.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be no goalfest giggler and the Yanks acknowledge that.
``We've got to come ready from the first whistle and earn
everything we can,'' said forward Tiffeny Milbrett. ``A full,
tough, 90-minute game.''
</P>
<P>
   The US hasn't had, or needed, one of those yet. The Danes didn't
threaten them after the first few minutes. The Nigerians were six
goals _ and 6 feet _ under by halftime. The Koreans just went into
the bunker and tried to save face. The Germans won't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very good attacking soccer team,'' said DiCicco.
``We've got to anticipate that the Germans will come at us at the
start of the game. We've got to play an upbeat, aggressive defense
to control them.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco wasn't saying what formation he'd use _ he was leaning
toward a 3-5-2 to provide depth and flexibility in the midfield.
But there was no doubt that he'd have his first team back on the
field after giving some of his players a breather against the
Koreans. That means Michelle Akers and Julie Foudy in the midfield,
Kate Sobrero at defender, and Milbrett at forward.
</P>
<P>
   This is go-on-or-go-home time and if the Yanks can't at least
get to their Independence Day semifinal with the Brazil-Nigeria
victor, David Letterman will dump them in his out basket and
America will click off the Cup faster than you can say summer
rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to bring it to the field,'' said Scurry.
``Otherwise, we'll be bringing it home.''

AFTER SHAKY START, SOBRERO IS ANCHOR FOR US DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, VA._ Kate Sobrero has no trouble admitting the truth.
</P>
<P>
   When her big moment with the United States women's soccer team
came, she fainted and remained unconscious for half an hour. The
eighth wind sprint in a routine fitness test at her first US team
training camp proved an unimaginable setback. It knocked her out
and effectively removed her from the pool of potential national
team players.
</P>
<P>
   By her own recounting, Sobrero needed three years to recover
from the humiliation suffered before a squad of her soccer idols.
She turned down invitations to play for the national team, excusing
herself with nagging injuries. She lacked the maturity and
confidence to play with the big girls. She thought contentment
would come with a college degree and career.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the talent-rich state of American women's soccer,
Sobrero was not forgotten. Just two years ago, US coach Tony
DiCicco repeatedly penciled in her name on potential team rosters.
Another offer to attend training camp with the senior US squad came
after Sobrero finished her final season at Notre Dame. She
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday against Germany in the 1999 Women's World Cup
quarterfinal, Sobrero will start on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am with all the people that I worshipped and I pass out
in front of them,'' she said. ``That really effected me a lot
harder than it should have. Once I got over that hump and started
playing and feeling confident at this level, that's when I realized
it was so much fun. I was not ready to give the whole team concept
up because there's nothing like being on a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobrero, 23, now ranks among the best one-on-one defenders in
the world. While nursing a sprained ankle in a first-round match
against Nigeria, she was tireless covering the first-half rushes
from opposing forwards.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25th minute, her patient defense was textbook. Crouched
low, her eyes focused on the feet of the speedy Super Falcons,
Sobrero criss-crossed the penalty area, backpedaled, and slowed the
attack of Rita Nwadike. The Nigerian forward had no room to turn,
shoot, or pass. With Nwadike contained, US midfielder Julie Foudy
came back and stripped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sobrero's success as a national team starter has been sudden as
compared with the lengthier careers of her teammates. Her playing
resume lists less than two years experience with the US. The
defender debuted against Argentina last April, started for the
first time against Japan in May, and finished 1998 with 13
appearances (nine starts). Leading to the World Cup, Sobrero
started all 12 US tuneups and logged more than 1,000 minutes
playing time. Only the ankle sprain has slowed her progress,
forcing the fullback to miss the Americans' final first-round
contest against North Korea at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kate Sobrero can become the best defender in the
world,'' said DiCicco. ``I don't have a long list right now of
defenders that are better than her. She's fast. She's tenacious.
She's courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach's praise comes after Sobrero proved herself on the US
Under-20 National Team and fought through a broken jaw. When
Sobrero reentered the developmental pool, she spent time as an
overage player on the under-20 squad. The team, which prepares
players for the senior level, and coach Lauren Gregg restored
Sobrero's confidence, bridging the gap between her college career
and top-flight international play.
</P>
<P>
   At Notre Dame, Sobrero started all 96 games of her career and
earned All-American honors three times. She led the Fighting Irish
to the 1995 NCAA championship, collected defensive MVP honors at
the Final Four, and was featured on the cover of Soccer America
after the title run. But until her senior year, Sobrero's memories
of the national team remained linked to her fainting first
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd had a tough start with the women and she's someone who
as a young player I thought had world-class dimensions,'' said
Gregg. ``So we brought her in as an overage player. What I loved
about her is every time she came in a month apart, she was a better
player. I said, `Tony, this girl is evolving by leaps and bounds
before our eyes.' In that environment, she was allowed to make
mistakes and grow.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sobrero made the unprecedented transition from
overage player to national team starter. She has achieved her most
recent success despite returning to the national team training camp
in January 1998 and suffering a second physical setback. But this
time it did not affect her confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Having just scored a goal in a scrimmage, Sobrero got the notion
that she might be a scorer. A ball was served just in front of
Sobrero inside the penalty area. Attempting to reach the ball, she
slid and her jaw hit the knee of backup goalie Tracy Ducar. She
lost a tooth and was bleeding from her mouth and nose after the
collision. Her head was cradled by her idol Michelle Akers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up, I was out of it,'' said Sobrero. ``She's
holding my head and I'm like, `Oh wow! Hi.' '' I was kind of
delirious. All of a sudden, I go in for X-rays and they're like,
`Oh, (the jaw is) broken.' They wheeled me off to surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Teased Foudy: ``She's a little demented. She's not all there.
She's a few feathers short of a duck. She's like one of those
really smart people who's pretty dingy. She's always tripping into
things. She's a total clutz. That's like a common joke on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   After her jaw was wired shut for six weeks, Sobrero returned to
play in the Goodwill Games and start all three games at the US
Women's Cup last year. Returning from the broken jaw, she displayed
the toughness gained as the youngest child in a family with three
older brothers. When she was 14, her brother Tim broke her leg
during a soccer game in the backyard of their Bloomfield Hills,
Mich., home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for good insurance,'' she joked. ``Otherwise my
parents would have taken me out of sports years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Her most recent injury _ the ankle sprain _ has drawn
considerably more attention and sympathy than her broken leg.
Sobrero finally understood the scope of the World Cup when
interview requests concerned her injury more than her play. Then in
Chicago, her college teammate Julie Maund gathered a cheering
section in the Soldier Field parking lot and sent well wishes from
via a cell phone held above the crowd. According to Maund, a father
offered her money to talk directly with Sobrero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a journal to keep track of all this,'' said Sobrero.
``I seriously write 10 pages a day. But I really can't even put it
into words. I just never believed it could happen. I'm pretty much
surprised (at starting). There's all these great players and I just
got lucky. He put me in the starting lineup and let me work on it
and gain my confidence. I don't know if I should still be starting
now, but I'm comfortable with where I'm at. I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   When her next big moment with the women's national team comes,
Sobrero has made sure she will be standing proudly.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Clinton's refugee policy still a work in progress
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 4, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - The TV news program showed a single-engine plane towing
a banner that read: ``Iraqi Soldiers Were Treated Better.'' The
evening before, professional-looking signs that called the Coast
Guard ``Murderers'' waved from a bridge opposite the U.S. Coast
Guard station here.
</P>
<P>
   They were boorish and divisive gestures toward our most passive
branch of service, in a day when there were so many other boorish
and divisive gestures that the Miami area, once again, was required
to show its political colors. Those colors were Cuban flags waving
in ire at the Coast Guard base earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   What brought this was about was the Coast Guard interception of
six Cubans in an 18-foot rowboat attempting to illegally enter the
United States just off Miami Beach. That's where Bill Clinton's
floating rules and regulations came into place. If the refugees
touched U.S. soil, they would be admitted. If they never got their
feet dry, were kept offshore, they would be sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Two touched, four didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Activities such as this take place every day but usually out of
sight of people on the beach. This one did, about 100 yards off the
beach. The tourists gathered to watch the drama unfold, to welcome
the two who made it to shore, and to harass the police who took
them into custody.
</P>
<P>
   The hours-long scene was played out live for camera helicopters
of the three principal local TV stations. Had TV not been there,
and the interdiction taken place further out to sea, no one would
have known anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   But they did. The treatment of illegal refugees is a passionate
subject in Miami because so many Miamians _ including the leading
politicians _ were illegal refugees themselves (now legitimized) or
are the children of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   What horrified most, even those who favor a stricter immigration
policy toward Cuban rafters, was the use of pepper spray on some
the Cubans in the water. The Coast Guard, under heavy pressure from
the Cuban-American community and media, admitted they made a
mistake in the pepper spray, although I have no idea why they issue
pepper spray if they can't use it.
</P>
<P>
   What other resources have they? Guns? Can you imagine if they
used guns? What does a Coast Guardsman, under orders to prevent
refugees from reaching shore, do about refugees swimming toward the
beach?
</P>
<P>
   Not a simple answer anywhere, other than don't use pepper spray,
or a gun. Maybe a big fish net will do it.
</P>
<P>
   The furor of the Cuban-American community spread throughout the
Miami area, blocking causeways and expressways, and infuriating
people who were trying to go anywhere in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong to use pepper spray, wrong to block highways.
</P>
<P>
   But this all comes back to U.S. policy toward Cuban refugees,
begun in Lyndon Johnson's administration as an open door policy,
later amended to fend off the flood of illegal aliens floating
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Clinton administration that, in 1995, made a deal with
Fidel Castro. We keep whomever makes it to shore, you get back
those who don't. Left wide open is interpretation of this
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Coast Guard supposed to physically prevent rafters from
touching shore, and what exactly is ``shore?'' Doesn't ``shore''
differ with the tides? Is ``shore'' reached when you can stand in
the water?
</P>
<P>
   The White House, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and
the U.S. Coast Guard need to get on the same page. Define ``shore''
and define to what extent the Coast Guard should go to prevent the
rafters from reaching it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the angry protesters won their day, with word coming
from high up that the four who didn't make it to shore be released
as well. U.S. immigration policy, therefore, is malleable _
depending upon how angry is the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   There remains questions of the six escaping Cubans. When they
were intercepted, they were wearing bathing suits or shorts and
were using paddle-sized oars to row in the ocean. All the way from
Cuba? How about a smuggler ship taking then to within a couple of
miles, then placing them in the rowboat? Happens every day around
here, has become a cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   I have a problem with one of the two who made it to shore. The
guy's a commuter! It was his third sea journey to Florida. He
admitted that he lived in the Florida Keys for a year, returning to
Cuba voluntarily to be with his ill mother. Now he wants to come
back, doesn't take the legal immigration route, challenges the
Coast Guard, claims he got hit with the pepper spray, and becomes
some sort of folk hero on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Is the U.S. a country without borders? It would seem so. This
not to protest Cubans fleeing Castro's Cuba. But there's got to be
a semblance of order and understanding by all factions. We need to
control our borders and not have it run by angry mobs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``dry feet-wet feet'' policy is a mixed bag of piffle
that creates rather than solves the problem.

 &HT;    Identity theft crimes drive shredder sales
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Add this to the list of American family values,
somewhere after the kids, the mortgage and the family pet:
</P>
<P>
   The family paper shredder.
</P>
<P>
   On a Monday afternoon at Office Depot in Atlanta's Lindbergh
Plaza, Dana Harrison, 36, is trying to decide which model to buy.
She scans an assortment of shredders, from the simple $24.99
Fellowes Shredstik to the $199.99 Fellowes PS75 that destroys
staples and paper clips, as well as paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a victim of identity theft,'' she says. ``But,
it seems like not too much to spend for peace of mind. I used to
just tear my bank statements into pieces. This seems safer.''
</P>
<P>
   She buys the Shredstik, joining a burgeoning group of American
shedder-users.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 9 million shredders were sold in America last year.
That's up from about 100,000 at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in sales of shredders _ a piece of equipment once
mainly associated with covert government operations _ is attributed
to the increased number of people with home offices, and fear of
``identity theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Thieves take important personal numbers, including date of birth
and Social Security numbers, and other financial information tossed
into the trash, and use it to defraud banks and credit card
companies _ in the victim's name.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an unreasonable fear, says Beth Givens, head of the San
Diego-based nonprofit organization Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft isn't new,'' says Givens. ``But in the last
five years it has exploded, and there are a lot of reasons why.
It's lucrative, and because it's a nonviolent crime, even if the
criminals are caught, they get light sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicts Givens: ``The day is going to come when home shredders
are as common as the microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   Office product makers and retailers are doing their part to
fulfill that prophecy. For three months this year Office Depot
pitched shredders on Atlanta TV. The spot showed an older couple on
a sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam and Margaret are living a comfortable retirement,'' said
the announcer, ``and it's all because you left your credit card
statement in the garbage and they stole your name.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sam Ambrose, manager of advertising communications
for Office Depot, the shredder market is still virtually untapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 1 percent of homes own one,'' he says. ``And there are 94
million households in America.''

 &HT;    EMS never knows what a call will bring
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Note to readers: Last week, I gave you a glimpse of Austin as
seen through the eyes of then Sr. Patrol Officer Wayne Vincent.
This week, we're going for a ride with Dr. Ed Racht of Emergency
Medical Services.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was close to 2 a.m. when Dr. Ed Racht decided
things were so slow, he was going to call this Friday a night. It's
abnormally quiet for a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to EMS statistics, the program had four units and
would run about 50 calls on a busy day in 1976 when the system
became active. Today, EMS has 20 ground units on the streets along
with a helicopter, and call volume in last the few months has often
exceeded 200 a day.
</P>
<P>
   This is one business where that kind of volume increase is not
good news. So, the crews will take a slow night anytime one
presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   The medical director of EMS was winding up a long day at the
office and a relatively short night cruising the city in his sports
utility vehicle festooned with the appropriate decals and
equipment, and sporting a souped-up engine, emergency lights and
siren.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cruisin' machine that beats anything those Friday-night
heroes put on the streets. But Racht isn't in it to show off. He
cruises on Friday nights because he likes it, and it shows the EMS
team that even a big wheel can roll on an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   And roll he does. I accompanied the doctor on his rounds
recently and quickly discovered that the hardest calls don't
necessarily involve bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after we hit the streets a little after 6 p.m., Racht
responded to a psychiatric call at a downtown hotel. Security there
had reported a woman threatening to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived with the paramedics and were greeted by the two
police officers who had also been dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   Everything appeared fine, though. ``I couldn't find my rosary
and I got excited. I started screaming ... Well, I did tell the
security agent that I was going to kill myself if I couldn't find
my rosary, but that's just an expression,'' the woman explained.
</P>
<P>
   It all made a semblance of sense on the surface, but Racht kept
asking questions. Something about her wasn't right. ``As long as
we're here, why don't you let us take your blood pressure and
pulse? Just to make sure everything is all right,'' Racht asked.
</P>
<P>
   The woman wanted to know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my blood pressure checked. Don't you have better
things to do? Aren't there people out there who need your help more
than I do? What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything wrong. I want
to know what I did wrong,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   Racht would try to reply and she would dive headlong into a vat
of redundancies, sounding like one of those old vinyl records with
a huge scratch in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did I do wrong? I want to have my meal. I don't know what
I did wrong. I'm not going to kill myself. My mother killed
herself, but I'm not. I can't kick out the window. I can't hang
myself in the bathroom ... `` she told Racht in earnest and
continued to catalog the possible ways she could do herself in but
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   She was literally talking herself into the system.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were fruitless. The woman became adamant even
after intervention by an Austin Police Department's crisis team.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Racht had an ultimatum: You're going to the hospital to
be examined. You'll either walk out with the paramedics or be
carried out on the stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   She relented and climbed on the stretcher clutching a stuffed
bunny. She was quiet all the way down to the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the SUV, Racht said those kinds of calls are the
toughest.
</P>
<P>
   The woman wasn't stabbed, burned or bleeding, but she was
hurting. The path of least resistance might have been to leave the
woman to her rosary, room-service meal, television and her torment.
</P>
<P>
   Racht just wanted to be sure she was all right.
</P>
<P>
   He was on that call for two hours and we were about to eat
dinner at a place in Hancock Center when he got the radio call
about the three-vehicle, multiple-injury wreck on East William
Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Flying down Interstate 35 with lights flashing and sirens
blaring is an experience. It's exhilarating without a doubt, but
the creepers and the drivers who won't move out of the way make it
a little scary _ or hairy to borrow the word we used when I was
cruisin' in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   We get there and Racht springs into action. The scene is a mess
_ the air smells of anti-freeze and gasoline. Police, EMS and
firefighters break up the task of cleaning up the accident scene
into their respective specialities.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles are a mess as well. Broken plastic, metal and glass
all over the place. The people inside those vehicles fared only
marginally better. StarFlight takes off with the most seriously
injured. The rest are taken away by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   This call was much easier. There was no doubt about what needed
to be done, no ambiguity. If it weren't for the human suffering,
you might even say that it was a relief after the encounter with
the anxious woman in the hotel room.

 &HT;    Timing is everything when it comes to taxes
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ During all the hoopla surrounding Gov. George W.
Bush's presidential campaign, he'd be wise to remember that
incredible luck and timing are worth a lot _ more than $22 billion
in his case.
</P>
<P>
   George W. gave serious consideration to running for governor in
1990, but finally decided not to. The reasons had more to do with
the fact his dad was president, and the ages of his twin daughters,
than any lack of ambition.
</P>
<P>
   But had he run, and won, instead of Democrat Ann Richards, he'd
have faced something quite different from the relatively ho-hum
agenda of the three legislative sessions since he took office in
1995. He'd have been plunged into a money crisis in his first days
on the job. He might even have had to raise taxes, not cut them.
</P>
<P>
   He owes Richards a lot, because she bit the bullet, dealt with
problems and left her successor a revenue stream that provided a
cushion that will leave Texas more than $22 billion richer by the
end of the coming two-year spending period than it might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Problems facing Texas in 1991 included:
</P>
<P>
   _ A budget shortfall of several billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _ A court mandate to fund school districts equally.
</P>
<P>
   _ Crowded prisons that led to early releases to avoid running
afoul of a federal court order.
</P>
<P>
   _ The fratricidal bloodbath of legislative and congressional
redistricting that followed the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   _ Public clamor to change the Texas Constitution to permit a
state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Not a happy time. The economic downturn in Texas in the
mid-1980s caused enough special sessions that some years the Texas
Legislature, normally limited to meeting 140 days in odd-numbered
years, actually met more days than the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Responses in 1991 by Richards and the Legislature included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing taxes to generate an additional $1 billion-plus per
year. And that was after the comptroller's office instituted the
Texas Performance Review, which sought to find ways the state could
save money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Imposing a new school finance law, known by opponents as
``Robin Hood'' and supporters as ``share-the-wealth'' because it
required some property-rich school districts to share their local
tax revenues with property-poor districts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Embarking on a prison-building binge that roughly doubled the
number of Texas prison beds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arguing over and finally approving the lottery. Richards was
convinced that Texans wouldn't pay significant attention to
education spending or other budget needs until the lottery issue
was resolved. So she cajoled, pressured and twisted arms to get the
100 votes in the Texas House necessary to put the matter before
voters. They happily added it to the Texas revenue package.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was eager for the Legislature to cut taxes in 1999,
and it did so, he owes Richards and the 1991 Legislature thanks.
Without the Texas Performance Review savings, plus the additional
taxes that continued in later years, plus the lottery revenues,
Bush might well have faced a budget shortfall this year.
</P>
<P>
   Additional taxes passed in 1991 will produce an estimated $10.4
billion through the 1999 budget year that ends Aug. 31. The
lottery, since it began in 1992, produced almost $6.9 billion
through May 17. That's a total of $17.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming two-year spending period that starts Sept. 1,
those 1991 taxes will produce an estimated $3.1 billion. The
lottery will produce another $2.2 billion. That's $5.3 billion _
just $1.2 billion less than the so-called budget surplus of $6.5
billion Bush and the legislators spent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Had Richards and the legislators not already put those revenue
generators on line, the $1.7 billion teacher pay hike, and $1.8
billion tax cut, wouldn't have been possible. The state would have
been $2.3 billion short.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father pledged in 1988 that if Congress asked him to
raise taxes, he'd say ``Read my lips: no new taxes.'' Two years
later, he allowed a tax hike, some say contributed to his defeat in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   A second President Bush, already talking about cutting federal
taxes, could see the economy, and his luck, turn downward _ just
like Dad's. What then? Conservatism? Or compassion?
</P>
<P>
   Will he refuse to raise taxes _ even if it means cutting
necessary services? Or raise taxes, to make sure no one is left
behind?
</P>
<P>
   As with much about the Texas governor-who-would-be-president,
time and circumstances will tell.

 &HT;    Medcast to join WebMD deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD Inc. and Healtheon Corp., which are slated to
merge in September, Thursday announced an agreement to buy
Atlanta-based Greenberg News Networks and its Medcast subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said their plans call for purchasing Medcast
with Healtheon stock, completing the acquisition in September as
soon as the WebMD-Healtheon union is complete. At Wednesday's stock
price, the deal is worth about $215 million, and for Healtheon and
WebMD, the purchase is a potential breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The two plan to link complementary businesses: Healtheon, based
in Santa Clara, Calif., can provide big institutions with an online
way to do millions of transactions now done on paper. Atlanta-based
WebMD offers a gateway for physicians and consumers. The two
companies have racked up impressive stock values and scored a
series of big-name partners while taking criticism for overselling
themselves. For instance, WebMD is seen as merely an
``aggregator,'' a gatherer of data from others. That is apparently
about to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not an aggregator,'' said Medcast founder, Chairman and
Chief Executive Alan N. Greenberg. ``We are the source.''
</P>
<P>
   Medcast is one of the Internet's premier providers of health
care information. The well-heeled company functions like a wire
service and has plans to syndicate stories, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   To get rolling, Medcast has inhaled about $22 million in venture
capital, including a hefty chunk from Noro-Mosely Partners.
Greenberg has been relatively low-key about the venture, but he is
not new to high-profile business. His resume includes Esquire,
where he was publisher, and Whittle Communications, where he was
vice chairman. The company has a staff of 230, including
biostatisticians, medical illustrators, 11 doctors and 70
reporters, many with solid journalistic backgrounds and training in
health care. Medcast's managing editor is Marjorie Martin, formerly
of CNN. That staff churns out a daily dosage of stories _ many
based on original reporting, others pegged to medical articles
published that day.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a medical advisory board that includes the
chairman of cardiology at Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the chief of
internal medicine at Boston City Hospital and Louis Sullivan,
president of the Morehouse School of Medicine and a former Cabinet
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We add authority, credibility and daily content,'' Greenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Medcast is pitched at doctors, but the company plans to launch a
consumer service. It's also not a Web company _ not yet. Stories
are delivered to computers overnight.
</P>
<P>
   However, Medcast now plans to reshape itself so that its
software, as well as some stories, can be downloaded from the Web.
The price _ only $10 a month now _ will also rise to match the $30
a month that WebMD charges doctors to subscribe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medcast now has just 2,200 doctors on its network, but 6,000
more have signed contracts and, even before today's expected deal,
it believes it will have 50,000 customers by year's end, Greenberg
said. With its acquisition, Medcast hopes to add tens of thousands
of others _ and its staff can provide enough data for millions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nan-Kirsten Forte, president of Medcast programming and
development, said the idea is to offer doctors a way to mesh with
patients, who increasingly arrive with up-to-date, if not always
reliable, information gleaned online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are saying that the biggest problem with the Internet
is that 'we are the last to know,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between WebMD and Medcast started several months ago.
However, Greenberg said he had not founded the company to sell it.
He had explored an initial public offering of stock, only to
discard other plans after talks with WebMD grew serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model when we began was to go it alone,'' Greenberg said.
``We basically made a business decision that this was a better
thing for our shareholders and our employees. This is as good a fit
as you can expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the Healtheon-WebMD merger fall through, there is a
``blowup'' clause that would see Medcast sold to WebMD, whose stock
is still privately held, according to Jeffrey Arnold, WebMD's
founder and chief executive. ``But that won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said he is not surprised to find 1-year-old WebMD in this
position, hefting a multibillion valuation and swallowing the likes
of Medcast. ``We have high expectations. We believe in the vision,
and we believe we can convince others that this is the right
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold ticks off five keys to succeeding on the Net: forging a
brand name, having top technology, cementing powerful partnerships,
constructing channels to distribute your product and having content
that will lure users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every deal we make fits into one of those five buckets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although fewer than 10,000 physicians are online with WebMD,
Arnold dismissed concerns about finances. He cited commitments from
DuPont, Microsoft and others to pay for doctor subscriptions as
they sign up. The company has also notched deals that will provide
$140 million worth of advertising, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a number of questions have been flung at WebMD. Skeptical
analysts have granted WebMD its skill at closing deals, its
expertise at public relations and self-promotion. But mostly, they
ponder the notion that the company's value has far outpaced its
product.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnold argues that the company has only been racing to keep
abreast of competition in a sector _ the Net _ where change occurs
at stunning speeds. Analysts admit that the Healtheon deal has
handed WebMD a multibillion currency that can perhaps buy the
missing pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Like content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take care of the partnerships and distribution,'' Arnold
said. ``Healtheon can take care of the office transactions. Alan
and Nan can take care of the content.''

 &HT;    Bills on flag, commandments couldn't be more un-American
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If the political symbol were the swastika and the
religious document came from ``Mein Kampf,'' more Americans would
see the two wrongs the U.S. House of Representatives has committed.
</P>
<P>
   That the symbol in question is the U.S. flag and the document is
the Ten Commandments makes the House no less wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A government that orders its citizens how to behave around a
graphic political symbol _ an image printed on cloth, paper, name
your medium _ is not one based on symbolic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   A government that can decree religious commandments _ be they
translations of Muhammad, Mao or Moses _ can call itself just, and
moral, and God-empowered, but it cannot call itself free.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people in the middle rationalize such mischief, along
with theoretical kin like organized school prayer, with ``What harm
would it do?''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty. Say it. These proposals are fundamentally wrong. Most of
all, they are fundamentally un-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? Wrong to punish people for vandalizing the symbol of
America?''
</P>
<P>
   America has laws against vandalism. Against theft. Against
arson. Against inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   What the House of Representatives has proposed is an amendment
to prohibit the defacing of a political idea. An idea is all the
flag is, something abstract sketched on something concrete. Someone
burn the flag? We make another. The idea remains. The idea never
left. The concrete thing (made of cloth in these beholders' eyes) a
constitutional amendment would protect is no more real than fog on
the mirror. We make one. We make millions. It means what our minds
say, just like the symbols on this paper, these Xs, Ys, and Os. Is
our government in the business of telling you how to perceive them?
</P>
<P>
   The most insidious thing about the anti-flag-desecration
amendment is that it is such an easy sell, striking back at
something so repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   But to the Supreme Court the public affront this amendment would
forbid is nearly sacred: It is political speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some speech is not protected. Child porn, for instance. Some
speech can be prohibited because it is obscene and has no socially
redeeming value. But here the issue is speaking symbolically about
our government and how it works. When that's the case, the Supreme
Court says government cannot tell critics, ``Knock off the
symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler could. Mussolini could. Khomeini could. Saddam Hussein
can. Slobodan Milosevic can.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives, by a disgraceful 305-124,
asserts, ``We want to join the club.''
</P>
<P>
   For the totalitarian club the posting of religious commandments
would help you keep your franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote to allow schools to post Judeo-Christian
commandments is quite possibly the most grievous assault against
religious liberty on these shores in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to try to sneak state-established religion into
the classroom with ``voluntary'' school prayer and a silent moment
meant for group prayer. Here the House has sanctioned the posting
of ``thou shalt have no other Gods before me'' and ``remember the
Sabbath day to keep it holy'' (which will confuse some Jewish
students who'll assume it means the state has declared Friday-night
football blasphemy).
</P>
<P>
   And what will have been accomplished? By government decree, the
Ten Commandments will be elevated to the stature of the ``Exit''
sign, the door jamb and the label you don't tear off the mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after we first planted the American flag on the
moon, the U.S. House of Representatives has launched two of the
world's most meaningful emblems on a mission to the Sea of
Triviality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must pray to the Almighty not to refuse His blessing to
this change and not to abandon our people in the times to come.''
_Hitler, ``Mein Kampf.''

 &HT;    Akers rations energy, adjusts to a new role for U.S. team
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No Women's World Cup Barbie dolls bear Michelle Akers'
likeness, and no clever commercials feature her as a glamorous
soccer star.
</P>
<P>
   On a U.S. team basking in the limelight of newfound sports
celebrity during the Women's World Cup, Akers does not personify
any of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the 33-year-old defensive midfielder _ kept together with
the help of daily intravenous injections, a less stressful role on
the field and an abiding religious faith, as she nears the end of a
glorious 14-year career _ helped create what is swirling around her
and her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, 5 feet 10 with bushy blonde hair, a craggy face and
occasional slowness of step, is aware of the ``warhorse''
description that follows her. She even uses the term when talking
about herself. But for a woman who lives with chronic fatigue
syndrome and has endured no fewer than a dozen knee operations, she
insists that she never has felt better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good right now,'' she said. ``The only job I
have is to play. Day to day, I have a handle on it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, Brandi Chastain and
others make the media rounds, Akers spends time in the training
room, replenishing her body with nutrients, or by herself at the
team hotel, bundling up energy for the next practice session or
game.
</P>
<P>
   Akers has been well-rested the past week, scoring a goal and
playing the first half in a 7-1 romp over Nigeria and sitting out
Sunday's 3-0 win over North Korea. Her physical ability could prove
to be critical for Thursday's quarterfinal with Germany in
Landover, Md., in what could be the most rugged encounter for the
Americans. And that's what has kept her value high after being
switched from a primary role as a powerful scorer for the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that in every game she's going to leave everything
she has on the field,'' Foudy said. ``That's what you love about
her, that's what you love about playing next to her. We have to
have her out there.''
</P>
<P>
   After starring for the U.S. team in the first Women's World Cup
in 1991, where she scored 10 goals, Akers became the heart, soul
and persona of women's soccer. She grew to be a prominent sports
figure in Sweden, where she played professionally for three
seasons. Her goal last week was the 103rd of her career, putting
her fifth on the all-time international list, a feat lost among the
clamor over Hamm, who recently took over the lead with 111.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle may not be getting the commercials, but when you're
looking for someone to point to as where this all started, she was
the pioneer,'' said Bill Barker, the University of Georgia women's
soccer coach, who coached Akers at Central Florida in the
mid-1980s. ``For some reason, she's been chosen to be the player
who stepped up for women's soccer when a lot of people weren't
paying much attention at all.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned to Sweden with the U.S. team for the 1995
World Cup, however, her abundance of energy was gone. She couldn't
force herself off the sofa after what were becoming longer and more
frequent naps, and it took her hours to cook, do laundry, run
errands. When a series of different diets didn't work, Akers, on
the verge of desperation, went to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Norway ousted the Americans in the semifinals, as Akers tried
gamely to recover from a broken bone she suffered near her eye
earlier in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my playing career was over,'' Akers said. ``I just
couldn't do anything, on or off the field. It looked like it was
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the diagnosis was in, the crazy diets stopped. Painstaking
detail to nutrition, exercise and outside activities were hard for
Akers to accept at first, but they have prolonged her career.
</P>
<P>
   While teammates were parading around the Sanford Stadium field
in July 1996, draped in the American flag and accepting their
Olympic gold medals, Akers was in the locker room hooked up to an
IV. She missed most of 1997 recovering from the Olympics and
plunged into a vocal role as a born-again Christian, finding it
impossible to separate her needs for physical and spiritual
sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything's been ripped out of your life, you become
very introspective,'' she said. ``I saw that God needs to be the
primary focus in my life and the foundation of who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers has hinted that next summer's Olympics probably will bring
down the curtain on her career, but she is savoring every moment
while strictly observing the habits that have gotten her this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been years of paying attention to very minute details and
then stepping out on the field and seeing what's there,'' she said.
``That's the part you never really know about from day to day, but
I think I'm holding up pretty well.''

   TRAVEL-ITALY _ BOLOGNA, Italy _ Beyond the gondolas and leaning

Italy that your travel agent probably never told you about. And yet
Emilia-Romagna is where food-loving pilgrims go to find the true
holy trinity of Italy: the pork products of Parma and Bolgna, the
fine balsamic vinegars of Modena and the world's best cheese
(parmigiano-reggiano). On his fourth Italian sojourn, a writer
surveys the bounty of the region known as the belly of Italy, with
ample forays into the churches, museum, shops, plus a final jaunt
down to the Tuscan wine towns of Montepulciano, Montalcino and

package on the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-KEYS _ KEY WEST, Fla. _ It's hard to keep up with what's
new in the Keys. Legendary hotels and restaurants change hands and
before you know it, your favorite hangout is now a trendy French
cafe with an adorable name and an expensive menu. But there's one
change that is just the opposite _ a landmark inn on Duval Street
has returned. (Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   KEYS-HISTORY _ KEY WEST, Fla. _ The cast of characters who came
through this harbor couldn't be better if you made them up. And
Ernest Hemingway tried. First, there were the Spaniards who wrecked
offshore and made a few treasure hunters very wealthy 400 years
later. Then there were salvagers who made fortunes in the 1800s
stripping the vessels wrecked on nearby shallow reefs. And the
spongers who came from Greece, and were run off to Tampa when they
became too successful here. And the shrimpers who sought ``pink
gold.'' And, of course, Henry Flagler, who brought the railroad,
and the moneyed passengers from the north. They took the Key West
ferries docked in Key West to Cuba. The ferries stopped when
Americans quit going to Cuba and Key West's seaport became an ugly
working port most tourists avoided. But with the completion of a
five-year, $5.4 million revitalization, Key West's Historic Seaport
is now bringing back tourists. (Palm Beach Post). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KEYS-INNS _ KEY WEST _ Curiously, this island city is not known
for its waterfront inns. It's famous for the historic inns in Old
Town that are within easy walking distance of the water, but
definitely landlocked. But there are a few inns and modern
high-rise hotels next to the water, some with marinas. (Palm Beach
Post). MOVED.

   KEYS-TARPON _ LOWER MATECUMBE KEY _ Hungry tarpon tarpons gather

   COXNET ENTERTAINMENT 0703 KING FOR `TODAY' _ ``Today,'' the
first of the morning news shows when it debuted in 1952, is
amazingly dominant in the late '90s _ it's been the No. 1 morning
show for 181 straight weeks, almost 3(apple) years, and its
ratings' lead over ``Good Morning America'' and ``CBS This
Morning'' is enormous. And yet, look out ``Today,'' 'cause it's
only getting harder from here on out. In September, ``Good Morning
America'' moves into its new studio overlooking Times Square, and
in November, CBS unwraps its new revamped show with Bryant Gumbel
as anchor and its own street-side studio on Central Park. (Kloer,

   BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ There is an audience, almost a congregation,
for whom the work of Patricia Hampl is received with something
close to devotion. It is not the largest audience in publishing,
but you wouldn't call it a cult of any sort. Cults gather round
shamans and sorcerers, conjurers of sundry mysticisms. But
mysticism _ need it be said? _ is not mystery, anymore than mere
reminiscence can claim to be a memoir. The personal mysteries on
which the memoir draws are Hampl's abiding subject, and, as she
writes in ``I Could Tell You Stories,'' they lay upon us an
impossible command. They impel us to find in our experience a
meaning whose truth is provisional at most, never final and often
in doubt. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 26. FOR SUNDAY.

   BOOK-NOTES _ Savannah prepares for the paperback launch of
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' and John Berendt will

but you wouldn't call it a cult of any sort. Cults gather round
shamans and sorcerers, conjurers of sundry mysticisms. But
mysticism _ need it be said? _ is not mystery, anymore than mere
reminiscence can claim to be a memoir. The personal mysteries on
which the memoir draws are Hampl's abiding subject, and, as she
writes in ``I Could Tell You Stories,'' they lay upon us an
impossible command. They impel us to find in our experience a
meaning whose truth is provisional at most, never final and often
in doubt. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 26. FOR SUNDAY.

 &HT;    A KOSOVAR LOVE STORY: MIXED SERB-ALBANIAN COUPLE DEFIES HATRED
IN TROUBLED PROVINCE
 &HT;    With Photo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ When Bafti married Gordana 35 years ago,
their love was unremarkable. Today, it seems unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   He is an Albanian and she is a Serb. They are both Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Very infrequently in Kosovo one hears of mixed couples. They are
almost always in their 60s, married in an era when secular
Communism papered over ethnic and religious divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most fear that any discussion of their love will channel
toward their doorstep the ethnic hatred that has left in its wake
dozens of mass graves and burned villages throughout the
war-ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bafti and Gordana Miftari, both a sturdy 60, are proud
grandparents with a lot to say. Their simple words seem to defy the
hateful gravity of a place where people matter-of-factly toss out
blanket racial/ethnic epithets about ``wild animals'' or
``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of people, good and bad. It's not
important, Serb or Albanian. What's important is good or bad,''
Gordana says, as she lays out cola, coffee and pictures of
grandchildren for a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   The pair stayed here in the provincial capital, Pristina, during
the campaign of atrocities committed by Serbs against ethnic
Albanians as NATO warplanes dropped bombs on Yugoslavia for 78
days. They heard the gunshots near their apartment and heard of
Bafti's cousins being murdered. Their 32-year-old daughter fled to
Austria to escape, as her Serb mother puts it, the potential of
``rape and other bad treatment'' at the hands of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   During the carnage, they tried to explain to their Serb friends
what was happening and that the hatred was unnecessary, but to
little avail. Somehow, what would be considered progressive views
of tolerance elsewhere have become outdated in today's violent
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bafti and Gordana said they have had no problems bridging the
cultural gap. They laugh off comparisons to Romeo and Juliet. But,
then they reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is the same sort of love. The play was a love story
and we have our own love story,'' Gordana says.
</P>
<P>
   Born outside Kosovo near the Yugoslav city of Leskovic, Bafti
was one of three Albanian students in Gordana's Serb high school.
She thought he was handsome and of strong character. He wooed her
in Serbo-Croatian, since she spoke no Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Yugoslavia's socialist code eschewed ethnic
differences and mixed couples sometimes even had an advantage as
the model of an egalitarian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were dating, my mother had seen him and I asked if she
liked him,'' Gordana recalls. ``I told her, 'Do you know he's
Albanian?' and she said, 'Your husband will be my son-in-law.' She
was happy because I was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bafti's mother was less pleased. She spoke no Serbo-Croatian and
would not be able to speak with Gordana for years, until Gordana
would learn Albanian. His mother was worried about religion, since
Gordana is Serbian Orthodox Christian and Bafti is Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   But, they had the typical civil wedding and their ethnic
differences mattered little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about it,'' Bafti says. ``It was a different
time, a different place.''
</P>
<P>
   They both worked in a textile factory and he would rise to
director. He notes that he oversaw 200 employees of 23 different
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was essential that both partners appear to be staunchly
indifferent to criticism. Gordana said people have asked her why
she did not ``find any Serb to marry,'' but she never cared. Bafti,
small but strong and trim, never noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't have the courage to say anything to me,'' he
says with a slight smile.
</P>
<P>
   But things started to change, even as their three children grew
and married Albanians. Communism fell and, like many older
Kosovars, the Miftaris blame Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
for stirring up ethnic hatred as he clawed his way to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Yugoslavia, many strange things are happening,'' Bafti
says. ``Instead of developing our economy like other Western
nations, we are looking at Bosnia and Croatia and Kosovo ... where
we are burning bodies at the end of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   As the death toll mounted in recent months, Gordana tried to
tell her relatives and friends what was happening to the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said things at my church. I told the father that you should
educate people not to hate,'' she says. But, she said, people would
argue with her.
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs, not only in Belgrade but even in Kosovo, still claim
they are unaware that Albanians were massacred by their army in
their name. The Miftaris say some Serbs truly do not know because
they get a skewed view from government television. Others know, but
are covering up.
</P>
<P>
   Bafti resorted to numbers and hard facts during the Serbs'
ethnic cleansing campaign this spring, to persuade others of the
people killed and villages destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when we were with friends, hers or mine, we tried to
speak of figures,'' Bafti says. ``When we would persuade them that
it was true, they just shrugged.''
</P>
<P>
   They are both glad NATO undertook a bombing campaign against the
Serb-led Yugoslav government -- even though Gordana's relatives
were theoretically at risk in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as NATO has chased the Serb troops from Kosovo and some
ethnic Albanians seek revenge against even elderly Serbs, Gordana
acknowledges she could be confronted by angry Kosovar Albanians who
see her only as another Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I can explain to them that they should not be like
that. The Bible says to treat others like you want to be treated,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   And, while there is little disagreement between the Miftaris,
they differ slightly when asked if a young couple today could brave
a mixed marriage. No Kosovo high schools dare even mix Serbs and
Albanians in the same classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love has no borders,'' Gordana says. ``It needs a little time,
but it could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bafti is less optimistic: ``If it's going to continue like this,
I don't think it can be possible.''
</P>

`LOLA' RUNS AT WARP SPEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' is definitely not a slacker picture. Its
protagonist, Lola (Franka Potente), spends most of the movie on the
move, feet pounding through the streets of Berlin with a single
purpose: to find enough money to keep her dour-faced boyfriend
(Moritz Bleibtreu) from having to rob a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   He lost dough belonging to the mob _ which has ended up in the
hands, and shopping cart, of a homeless man _ and a thug is waiting
to collect. Lola has 20 minutes to find the cash and stop her man
from taking the ruinous path.
</P>
<P>
   But, wait _ there's more. Not only is ``Run Lola Run'' a
video-game movie, but it must be the first PlayStation picture to
come with its own reset button. The movie offers several possible
scenarios for Lola to bounce through _ a swift and sophisticated
version of motifs played out less successfully in movies like
``Sliding Doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Lola bumps into someone, we see a flurry of freeze
frames, a fast forward of what will happen to whomever she's
crashed into as she hurtles through Berlin. Because she runs into
the same people, we get alternate scenarios of how their lives will
turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Agile and light on its feet, ``Lola'' will be considered an art
movie only because it's in German and with subtitles. Otherwise,
its sleekness, speediness and carefully accessorized techno song
score would make it a much bigger deal than it may turn out to be.
Too bad, because its primary-colored buoyancy will make it one of
the most imitated pictures around. (It's probably fitting that the
movie is coming out on the eve of the millennium, although
``Lola's'' been a hit on the festival circuit since last year's
Toronto Film Festival.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it may well be the first movie to have absorbed the
attention-deficit throb of techno music into its bloodstream, the
kind of movie ready-made for a fan base that runs the gamut from
Orbital to Atari Teenage Riot. (Yes, I know _ it's to believe that
techno encompasses a gamut, but, like the poet says, it's vast: It
contains multitudes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Lola's'' graphic, novel color scheme and energetic precision
will be aped. But no doubt imitators will wrongfully ignore
``Lola's'' dope-slap to capitalism and the poignant portrayal of
the middle class. Her run-ins with her father and his mistress
feature an almost heartless contempt for the bourgeoisie.
</P>
<P>
   The film is breathless, breathtaking and smart _ an
international, pop-fixated cousin of Quentin Tarantino and his
infatuation with Jean-Luc Godard. More than Tarantino, ``Lola''
director Tom Tykwer is truly what Godard called one of the children
of Marx and Coca-Cola _ the movie bounds along fueled by caffeine
and cigarettes and sheer pop adrenaline. (Tykwer understands the
Godard quote, ``All you need to make a movie is a girl and a
gun.'')
</P>
<P>
   And since the film wears its politics and impatience with the
status quo on its sleeve _ it takes its revolution to the streets _
this movie offers subtext.

   Rodney Orr will never forget that breezy Saturday in September
nine years ago. While spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco, he decided to kick away from his paddleboard. Suddenly
he felt as if a boat had run over him. ``All I heard was a big
crunch, kind of like a garage door closing,'' Orr says. White teeth
pierced his eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose. Orr's entire head was in the grip of a
shark. But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended. Orr
survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims. Why? This is just
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, reports
Glen Martin, who covers the environment beat for the San Francisco
Chronicle. A fascinating sidebar titled ``Shark Avoidance'' is
included.

   Crack may be the most addictive substance used by humankind. Its
effects are so potent and immediate that a single hit can hook you.
There's no approved medical treatment for cocaine addiction.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night. However, the U.S.
National Institute on Drug Abuse is now testing a time-honored
approach to controlling disease: vaccination.

   Rodney Orr will never forget that breezy Saturday in September
nine years ago. While spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco, he decided to kick away from his paddleboard. Suddenly
he felt as if a boat had run over him. ``All I heard was a big
crunch, kind of like a garage door closing,'' Orr says. White teeth
pierced his eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose. Orr's entire head was in the grip of a
shark. But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended. Orr
survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims. Why? This is just
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, reports
Glen Martin, who covers the environment beat for the San Francisco
Chronicle. A fascinating sidebar titled ``Shark Avoidance'' is
included.

   Crack may be the most addictive substance used by humankind. Its
effects are so potent and immediate that a single hit can hook you.
There's no approved medical treatment for cocaine addiction.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night. However, the U.S.
National Institute on Drug Abuse is now testing a time-honored
approach to controlling disease: vaccination.

   Rodney Orr will never forget that breezy Saturday in September
nine years ago. While spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco, he decided to kick away from his paddleboard. Suddenly
he felt as if a boat had run over him. ``All I heard was a big
crunch, kind of like a garage door closing,'' Orr says. White teeth
pierced his eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose. Orr's entire head was in the grip of a
shark. But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended. Orr
survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims. Why? This is just
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, reports
Glen Martin, who covers the environment beat for the San Francisco
Chronicle. A fascinating sidebar titled ``Shark Avoidance'' is
included.

   Crack may be the most addictive substance used by humankind. Its
effects are so potent and immediate that a single hit can hook you.
There's no approved medical treatment for cocaine addiction.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night. However, the U.S.
National Institute on Drug Abuse is now testing a time-honored
approach to controlling disease: vaccination.

   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio r a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine

<P>
   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of

   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

<P>
   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>

   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.

   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been

No. No.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rodney Orr was having a good day. By noon on that breezy
Saturday in September nine years ago, the Santa Rosa, Calif.,
electrician was spearfishing 50 miles up the coast from San
Francisco. He kicked away from his fiberglass paddleboard when
suddenly he felt as if a boat had run over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard was a big crunch, kind of like a garage door
closing,'' Orr recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For a second or two he was enveloped in water blackened with his
blood. A glint of sunlight revealed rows of white teeth. They
pierced an eyelid and cheekbone on the left side of his face and
ripped across his nose.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Orr realized his entire head was in the grip of
a shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark had me up out of the water,'' he says. ``And the sea
was kind of flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr flailed at the great white with his speargun in one hand and
beat against the creature's teeth with his other hand as the shark
thrashed him from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds after the attack began, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I just popped out of the shark's mouth,'' Orr
says.
</P>
<P>
   Orr swam back to his paddleboard, a trail of blood marking the
60 or 70 feet the shark had carried him, and then paddled for shore
as he tried to keep from passing out.
</P>
<P>
   He was picked up by a helicopter summoned by a passing highway
patrolman, and by 10 p.m. he was home with nearly 80 stitches
mapping the grisly encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Why Orr survived _ as do most human shark-attack victims _ is
one of the mysteries surrounding the great white shark, among the
least understood of Earth's creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Even the size of great white populations _ now a protected
species in South Africa, Australia and parts of the United States _
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we only see sharks when they make active
attacks on prey,'' says ichthyologist Peter Klimley of the
University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the mindless killing machines of ``Jaws'' fame,
whites seem to observe social customs and rituals and appear to be
particular about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   They grow to 20 feet and more and can reach a weight of 5,000
pounds. Unlike most fish, they are born live, emerging into the
world 5.5-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But even basic information such as how and where the white shark
mates remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory that aims to solve the mystery of the great white
is located 23 miles from Santa Cruz, Calif., off the tiny island of
Ano Nuevo. Each fall, great whites swarm to this rocky outcrop,
presenting biologists with an unparalleled opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the sere and barren island is a prime breeding
ground for the northern elephant seal, one of the world's largest
pinnipeds _ and a delicacy to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elephant-seal rookery like Ano Nuevo is a supermarket for
whites,'' says Burney Le Boeuf, a University of California at Santa
Cruz behavioral ecologist and a leading expert on pinnipeds.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boeuf reasoned that to further his understanding of pinnipeds
he needed a clearer picture of their relationship to their main
adversary. So in 1996 he teamed up with Klimley in hopes of
penetrating the secret life of the great white.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley had previously videotaped more than 100 attacks on
elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals at the Farallon Islands,
a group of rocky islets west of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The images show seals being torn apart. A few are attacked with
such enthusiasm that they are decapitated outright. But Klimley
also observed that a great white would take a tentative bite of an
unfamiliar object and then spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Klimley theorizes that the jaws and teeth of a white are an
exquisite tensiometer. He suspects a white can tell the relative
fat content of an animal by first mouthing it gently. If the
tensile resistance associated with blubber is revealed, the shark
goes for a full-strength bite. If not, it will back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why most humans who are bitten are seldom
killed,'' Klimley says. A human has too much muscle and not enough
fat for a great white.
</P>
<P>
   The great white is warmblooded, and warmbloodedness could place
great energy demands on an animal that lives in cold environs. For
great whites, fat, which contains nine calories per gram compared
with four for protein and carbohydrates, is the good life.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is playing its part to paint a clearer picture of
these creatures. A new tracking system for great whites had its
genesis in individual acoustic tags used by Klimley and his
associates in the mid-199Os. Tagged sharks were tracked for an hour
or two a day using a hydrophone, an underwater microphone, hung
over the side of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Klimley and Le Boeuf replaced the handheld hydrophone
with a triangle of sonobuoys in an area where they had observed
shark attacks off the western shore of Ano Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a single buoy would capture the signal of any
tagged shark that came within a range of about 1,100 yards, and
triangulation would pinpoint the shark's exact location when it
came within range of all three buoys.
</P>
<P>
   This data would be relayed to a computer on Ano Nuevo where the
movement of the sharks could be plotted in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The next job was to tag the sharks _ a dicey maneuver handled by
Sean Van Sommeran, executive director of the Pelagic Shark Research
Foundation in Santa Cruz. It required planting a half-inch barbed
dart fitted with an ultrasonic transmitter at the base of the
shark's dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   To entice the great white to come close to the tagging boat, Van
Sommeran devised a lure: a large piece of plywood cut in the shape
of an elephant seal and smeared with seal or whale blubber.
</P>
<P>
   When a shark neared the boat, someone would plant the
transmitter by jabbing the barbed dart, attached to the end of a
seven-foot lance, into the shark. Five sharks were tagged in the
fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The research team discovered that hunting occurs
around the clock. Great whites are clearly relentless, and
preliminary data suggest they may also be crafty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharks appear to attack from ambush,'' Klimley says.
``From a seal's perspective, the dark gray of the sharks' backs
could blend almost perfectly with a rocky bottom. The area of the
highest attacks at Ano Nuevo is one that provides them perfect
camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the scientists plan to place transmitters in the guts
of five to eight sharks in hopes of learning more. ``Knowing how
sharks eat could help us learn ways to avoid being attacked by
them,'' Klimley says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how successful the research team is in penetrating the
secret life of the great white, its power to terrify is unlikely to
disappear _ especially from up close. Rodney Orr still spearfishes,
but getting shark bit left an indelible impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out how small and defenseless you are,'' he says.
``You're like a soda cracker floating around out there. The shark
is an awesome creature.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: SHARK AVOIDANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to avoid being bit by a great white is to steer
clear of the sharks' hunting grounds: locations along the
California coast frequented by large colonies of seals and sea
lions.
</P>
<P>
   Shark experts say water-sports enthusiasts who venture near such
areas should surf, swim or dive with friends; a group of people
might keep a shark away and will ensure a quick rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Divers and spearfishermen should avoid lingering near the
surface, where most great white victims are attacked, and stay away
from rocky areas underwater where the black back of the great white
could be difficult to distinguish from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe a black wet suit might cause a great
white to mistake a person for a seal. But the sharks have also been
known to attack people dressed in a variety of colors, including
what scientists call ``yum-yum'' yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest misconceptions is, ``If I'm not wearing a
black wet suit, I'm safe,'' says shark expert Peter Klimley. ``No.
No. No.''

<P>
   You know the feeling. It sends you running to the store for
chips, makes you down a pint of ice cream in seconds, destroys your
promise to lay off the caffeine and cigarettes. An out-of-control
craving, a mindless compulsion, an irrepressible urge.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abusers call it Jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced addicts will tell you that you don't really know
what jonesing is all about until you've tried crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smoked cocaine is probably the most addictive substance used by
humankind. Its effects are so potent and immediate _ crack reaches
the brain within 20 heartbeats of inhalation _ that a single hit
can hook you.
</P>
<P>
   And once you're hooked, you're cooked. There's no approved
medical treatment for cocaine addiction: no therapeutic equivalent
of the methadone dose, the Antabuse pill or the nicotine patch.
Instead there are rehab centers, Narcotics Anonymous meetings, a
shrink in the afternoon, group therapy at night.
</P>
<P>
   And the success rates of these programs are sobering in
themselves. Most people in talk therapy for cocaine addiction, for
example, are still using. At a typical longterm treatment center,
only 25 of every 100 residents are still completely clean three to
five years after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To beat those odds, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse
has made developing an effective treatment for cocaine addiction a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   At Daytop, a residential treatment facility run by the Apt
Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the institute is testing a
time-honored approach to controlling disease: vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen addicts housed in Daytop's gloomy brick barracks
on the abandoned grounds of a state mental hospital have pledged to
forgo their cocaine habit and shoot up an experimental vaccine
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine vaccine works the same way other vaccines do: by
stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that bind to a
foreign entity, preventing it from entering the brain or otherwise
interacting with the body's organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the foreigner isn't a virus like polio or a toxin
like the one that causes lockjaw. It's another drug.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine's developers _ chemists at ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
in Waltham, Mass. _ don't plan to vaccinate the masses to prevent
cocaine addiction. Their goal instead is to help people who are
already addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine itself escapes the body's defenses because its molecule
is too small to activate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine couples a piece of the cocaine molecule to chemical
carriers that slow its release into the bloodstream and make it
large enough to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Once the immune system is thus primed, the use of cocaine _ via
nose, lung or vein _ should prompt legions of antibodies to enter
the bloodstream and ambush the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the vaccinated user will no longer get a cocaine
high. And in practice, vaccinated users do seem to lose all
interest in their habit. But so far those users are
cocaine-addicted rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will be a panacea for all (Cocaine)
addicts,'' says John Shields, senior vice president of research at
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a British company that recently bought
ImmuLogic's vaccine program. ``It's only going to be useful if an
individual actually wants to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a catch to the treatment the rats can't
tell you about: The vaccine doesn't reduce the jonesing.
</P>
<P>
   Drug craving is thought to be created by as-yet-unidentified
changes in the function and perhaps even the structure of the
brain. And it's the craving _ the compulsion to use the drug
despite its adverse consequences _ that's the essence of addiction.
Whether using or not, an addict who's craving isn't cured.
</P>
<P>
   Shields and his colleagues emphasize that the vaccine would only
be suitable for people determined to stay clean and confront the
psychological and behavioral aspects of addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial injections are unlikely to confer lifelong
immunity, patients would have to be motivated enough to continue
getting boosters, probably at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vaccine will be very helpful for people who have a
desire to stop using, so that if they slip and use once, they won't
get much out of it,'' says Tom Kosten, a professor of psychiatry at
the Yale School of Medicine and head of the vaccine trials.
</P>
<P>
   Relapses are the reason most treatment programs fail, he says,
because a single, brief exposure to a disavowed drug ignites a
compulsion in addicts more powerful than that engendered by
continual use.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of addiction is not entirely understood, but it
seems that the faster a drug's effects build and diminish, the more
compulsion it creates. That's why crack cocaine is more addictive
than snorted cocaine: Inhaling into the lungs' large surface area
rather than the mucous membranes of the nose gets the drug into the
bloodstream much faster. In fact, the speed and potency of
cocaine's assault on the body could pose a major challenge to the
vaccine approach.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers years to learn how to build an antibody
response that could counter the drug, and even a strongly fortified
immune system may not defeat it completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who want to keep using, I'm sure the vaccine can be
overridden by just lots of use,'' Kosten says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this directly with, you know, the polio
vaccine. Nobody wants polio, so you're not trying to override the
vaccine. But people love cocaine. We don't know what will happen if
you take six times the amount you'd usually use to try to get
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But one trial participant says he does know. He left Daytop
after receiving all three shots and immediately started injecting
megabits of cocaine with a lady friend over the course of a weekend
_ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This report is, of course, what scientists call anecdotal
evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

evidence from an unreliable source. And the current trials are
measuring the vaccine's safety at different dosages, not its
effectiveness.

<P>
   Nevertheless, in subsequent stages of testing, subjective
accounts will become a crucial part of the clinical data.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ There's no real police force here yet,
which may explain why children have been seen driving cars. No one
is sure who owns what, so people are staking their claims to the
tractor next door, the house down the street and the factory in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   There are no trials, elected officials or tax collectors.
Official records -- those that remain -- are under guard to prevent
their being destroyed by retreating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   And, last week, aid groups started confronting a new question:
Who is responsible for removing corpses that are contaminating
hundreds of water wells?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to U.N. Country, also known as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Government institutions are nonexistent in this Serbian province
torn apart by ethnic hatred and war. In the absence of any central
authority, it's up to a few hundred U.N. workers to set up a
government for a divided public that craves structure.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Sergio Vieira de Mello, the special representative from
the United Nations, will decide which laws and people rule the
land. He runs the show from a badly looted Yugoslav army building,
where doors don't lock and employees are urged to take their
computers home with them at night.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is a Kosovo that will hold elections and govern itself
as an autonomous region within Yugoslavia. The United Nations will
oversee the slow transfer of institutions and property from the
hands of ethnic Serbs to the majority ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   But, whether and just how that will be done is still under
contention between the two enemies. The NATO bombing has stopped,
but the battle for Kosovo, which had an estimated 1.8 million
people before the massive refugee flight started in March, will
continue with each ministry, company, house or cow that is
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has run parts or all of countries before,
from Bosnia to Cambodia to Rwanda. But, it has never started with
such major issues unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major complication is that, in other U.N. peacekeeping
operations, you had an agreed upon settlement,'' Eric Morris, a
senior official overseeing the formation of the U.N. Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) said. ``Here, you will be dealing on a daily basis
with questions of sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is a recipe for chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a race, if you don't have some fundamental rule
of law and institutions operating, that (chaos) could be the
result.'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   For help, the United Nations is delegating reconstruction duties
to the European Union. Democracy-building tasks, such as organizing
elections and training police, fall to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees asked for $106 million
for its work in June and UNMIK, with about 400 staff and rising,
needs $60 million to get started.
</P>
<P>
   The actual reconstruction of the country, with thousands of
homes and businesses burned, will take billions of dollars and
possibly 10 years. At least 50 private aid agencies are at work.
</P>
<P>
   But, the United Nations is already running to catch-up. Last
week, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urged foreign ministers and
officials from 18 nations and three regional organizations to
provide the manpower they have promised. For example, only half the
55,000 NATO troops planned have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is worse for police, which U.N. officials say is
the top priority. But Annan secured promises for 1,938 of the 3,110
civilian police needed from U.N. countries.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, only 36 had arrived. But the United States
pledged 450 officers, the first 100 of whom would be sent by July
15, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. The United States
also offered another 100 police trainers. Germany offered 200
officers and Italy, Turkey and Canada also announced increases in
offers they had already made.
</P>
<P>
   A major issue still dividing countries and delaying the police
deployment is whether the civilian police should be armed. The
Netherlands said it preferred the police to be unarmed as most U.N.
civilian police are. Britain as well indicated it would have
trouble contributing to an armed police mission because the bulk of
its own police force was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Albright agreed with U.N. officials that at least some of the
police would have to be armed and have the authority to make
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In their race, U.N. officials have one major advantage: The
desire among most Kosovars -- both Albanian and Serb -- for order.
</P>
<P>
   It may be volunteerism, more than U.N., EU and NATO muscle, that
will rebuild Kosovo. Last week, as shops were starting to re-open
and the first signs of normalcy appeared on the streets of
Pristina, ethnic Albanian Jakup Mehmeti strapped two traffic lights
to the top of his old Opel.
</P>
<P>
   He picked them up from NATO officials running the municipality
and was on his way to install them at an intersection. That was his
job 10 years ago, before the Serbs took over and fired him. He
volunteered to do it again while the United Nations gets organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody is going to pay me, I just want to do
it,'' said Mehmeti. ``I want to see my city safe and the traffic
better.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of ethnic Albanians taking the law into their
own hands, most are ready to find their justice in due course. All
you have to do is go to the provisional police station set up by
British troops, and you can see patient Albanians lined up for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs stole the inventory from Selim Gravalla's building company
and burned his house. But, he waited hours in line to report the
crimes last week, rather than take a match to the abandoned house
of the Serb he knows burned his.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says. ``I do not want to be on their level. I had a
chance to do that a hundred times, but I have not broken even one
little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, relief for people like Gravalla will come slowly.
Currently, NATO forces are so stretched thin that they are slow to
arrive to even life-threatening crimes in progress. At times,
looting has occurred before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They pull suspected criminals into a legal system with no trials
or uniform laws. American, British, French, Italian and German
troops follow their own countries' procedures for temporary
detention.
</P>
<P>
   As for courts, de Mello last week swore in seven legal experts,
including three Albanians and a Serb, to begin appointing the
judges. The first judges will likely travel between NATO detention
centers, clearing the backlog of more than 150 detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the question is what law to use. Yugoslav law will be the
foundation, except when it conflicts with international human
rights standards. For example, the United Nations will scrap
Yugoslav laws that allow long detentions for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   In straightening out non-criminal disputes, the United Nations
is forming seven committees, made-up of Serbs and Albanians, that
will advise and mediate. Of immediate concern are the nearly
violent altercations taking place over employment.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians were purged of their government jobs from
universities, hospitals, factories and ministries when the Serbs
stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989. They were also summarily
fired from private sector businesses such as major hotels and
restaurants. Since NATO came into Kosovo, the workers have been
gathering like ghosts at their old job sites demanding their jobs
back.
</P>
<P>
   Among other sites, NATO troops have had to seal off Pristina's
giant Grand Hotel and the government television complex to keep
violence from erupting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get back our offices and jobs,'' said Mehmet
Mehmeti, a-52-year-old former mining executive who has been driving
taxis since he was fired with 2,400 ethnic Albanian mine workers in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Their old mining office is now the arts building of a Serb-run
university, but that's where Mehmeti and about 30 other men have
been waiting daily while negotiations determine who gets to go back
to work.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what will happen to those owed pensions in the
public jobs, up until now controlled by the Serb-led Yugoslav
government. Also, the Serbs systematically destroyed identification
documents. U.S.-based Microsoft Corp. has donated computer
equipment to begin a re-identification program for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations will also be the final authority on education
in Kosovo, another issue that was contentious long before the NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Since a Serb curriculum was imposed in 1990, most ethnic
Albanians have sent their children to the Albanian ``shadow''
school system. It was financed by Albanian donations.
</P>
<P>
   The system was hit hard during the Serb campaign of ethnic
cleansing this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Only halfway through an assessment of the 1,000 elementary
schools for ethnic Albanians, UNICEF officials have found that at
least 170 schools have been damaged by burning and looting.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools are destroyed. Some are booby-trapped, or worse. In
the United States, officials worry about guns near schools. In
Kosovo, two British soldiers were killed by unexploded NATO cluster
bombs near a schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there is a shortage of the estimated 18,000
teachers needed, as many are missing or refugees. UNICEF's Flaka
Surroi said it is unknown at this point who will pay teacher
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   After the schools are repaired, it's likely that the United
Nations will monitor curriculum and textbooks to make sure the
schools are not teaching ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi would like to see some schools eventually integrated,
with Serb and Albanian children using the same buildings, as they
have infrequently in the past. An ethnic Albanian herself, Surroi
said she hopes someday they can even share bilingual education. In
that case, the United Nations would have surpassed all
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do that as an experiment within five years, but not
now,'' she says. ``It was partly segregation that brought us to
this situation now.''

CHAOS IN THE CITY: BROOKLYN'S SUMMER OF 1977 WAS MURDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spike Lee has grown enormously as a filmmaker, and in ``Summer
of Sam,'' he attempts an almost touching dramatization of a doomed
humanity. The problem is that Lee hasn't evolved nearly as much as
a storyteller. The movie feels distended and poorly worked out, and
the material needs a shaping as much as any subject he has ever
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, he knew exactly where he wanted to go when he last
explored New York during the meanest season, summer, when he wrote
and directed ``Do the Right Thing.'' Here, he dramatizes the
freedom, fear and anger in the air around Brooklyn in 1977, the
year of a miserably hot summer and the year that David Berkowitz,
better known as serial killer Son of Sam, terrorized the city.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz turns up here, played by Michael Badalucco of ``The
Practice,'' wrestling with the turmoil in his head. It should be
said that this adult movie, which doesn't shy away from violence
and sex, isn't about Berkowitz specifically _ it's ``Summer of
Sam,'' not ``Son of Sam.'' (Dissatisfied moviegoers grumbled about
that apparent disappointment as they filed out of the screening I
attended.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer'' starts with New York newspaper legend Jimmy Breslin
delivering a monologue to the camera, reminding us that things are
better now than in 1977. ``There are 8 million stories in the Naked
City,'' he says, ``and this is one of them.'' (Breslin was the
columnist who got letters from Son of Sam during his homicidal
spree.)
</P>
<P>
   1977 was definitely the year of a shift in the wind, the year
that punk took off. Newly hatched punk Ritchie (Adrien Brody), with
his spiky hair reaching up to the sun, is shocking the neighborhood
of pompadoured goodfella wannabes, despite his sad eyes and sweet
nature. This rebel is visibly horrified _ his face is set on
stunned _ when he wanders in on his mom (Patti LuPone) and his new
stepfather (Mike Starr) while they're making love, even though
Ritchie is in his 20s. (The stormy aftermath is one of the funniest
and most touching scenes Lee has ever filmed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer'' is about a series of Pandora's boxes being opened.
Ritchie's boyhood friend Vinny (John Leguizamo) loves his wife
(Mira Sorvino), but can't help seducing women outside his marriage.
Vinny is trapped in the old-school attitude of wanting what he
considers to be dirty sex but thinking getting it from his wife
will sully his marriage; he's racked with guilt and hunger.
</P>
<P>
   In this undercooked part, Leguizamo works as hard as any actor
ever has in a Lee film, and his low-key clowning with Sorvino has
the rudiments of a believable relationship. This Mutt and Jeff pair
belong together.
</P>
<P>
   When Vinny proudly dances around his towering, beautiful wife at
the local discos, his cock-of-the-walk assurance makes him the star
of the joint. But Vinny's compulsive womanizing is leading him to a
fall. Her pert features crumple when his adultery slaps her in the
face. The sick looks on their faces when they find themselves
taking part in the action at Plato's Retreat, the Manhattan club
where couples swapped partners, is heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Lee's ability to direct actors emerges, even
when he sabotages things by going for obvious irony; during a long,
gripping single-take scene when Leguizamo and Sorvino fight to save
their marriage and heroically strip away their defenses, ``Don't
Leave Me This Way'' plays on the soundtrack. (He pulls this
cheapening trick several times during the picture.)
</P>
<P>
   Confident in his own filmmaking style _ the hot saturated colors
in some shots and Lee's patented character-traveling-on-a-dolly
shot are featured here _ Lee works to blend elements of Martin
Scorsese and the late, great actor/director John Cassavetes into
his work.
</P>
<P>
   Cassavetes-film veteran Ben Gazarra turns up as a local mob
figure to whom the cops turn to get help in tracking down Son of
Sam. But Cassavetes' powerful approach toward delving into the
workings of middle-class machismo noisily _ happily, even _
embraced messiness. Lee is, among other things, an incredibly
fastidious director.
</P>
<P>
   Even the flash cuts of the squalor Lee shows in Berkowitz's
home, reflecting the chaos in the killer's head, has the flamboyant
nihilism of a Nine Inch Nails video. (Lee sneaks in a joke from the
1959 Vincent Price schlock horror film, ``The Fly.'')
</P>
<P>
   So, Lee's efforts to display what's going on the heads of the
Italian overgrown boys hanging out in the streets fail, even though
capturing the ripe, funny and slightly pathetic chatter of guys on
the hang is perhaps the director's greatest gift. (It's one he
shares with Cassavetes.) In this case, Lee's contempt for the men
in his movie turns them into sweat-stained, gold-chain-wearing
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a movie that is, in its own way, a mess. ``Summer
of Sam'' is both naive and glum, a combination that grows out of a
filmmaker stretching beyond his talents and not quite measuring up.
</P>
<P>
   Leguizamo is stranded, as much by the way the role was conceived
as for his Hispanic appearance. (Leguizamo looks like the kind of
guy these Brooklynites would beat up when they hit the streets as
vigilantes, looking for their own Son of Sam suspect to pound into
submission.)
</P>
<P>
   Lee gets particularly good performances from some of his cast,
especially Brody, whose hawkish features mask his deftness, and
Sorvino. And an unusual one from Leguizamo, who's still to be
well-used in a movie. ``Summer of Sam'' melts into a lump of failed
melancholy before your eyes, but it's an honest swing at the fences
for grown-ups, something that deserves notice in this summer of
same old thing.

<P>
   They are expecting 50,000 people to show up for George Brett's
induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame July 25, which might make
it a tough trip to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   But during the year, Cooperstown, N.Y., is actually a pretty
easy trip, especially during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   You probably want to fly into Albany, N.Y., which is about 95
miles from Cooperstown, or about a 11/2- to 2-hour drive. The
locals will tell you it can be done in 75 minutes, but no actual
human being has accomplished it.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   There are several bed and breakfasts in town, and a few hotels,
including The Inn at Cooperstown, a beautiful refurbished hotel
first built in 1874. Summer rates are $105-$138. Call (607)
547-5756.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Front Motel, right on the water, is just a block away
from the Baseball Hall of Fame. Rates in July and August run
$95-$135. Call (607) 547-9511.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of hotels in bigger cities within a fairly
short drive, including Utica, Syracuse and Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on travel or accommodations, call the
Cooperstown Chamber of Commerce at (607) 547-9983 or look them up
at cooperstown.net.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   If you're feeling a bit risky, the Hamburger Hall of Fame on New
York 28 doesn't look like much, but it serves a mean burger.
Unfortunately there are no plaques on the wall recognizing great
burgers of the past (Winstead's would have been inducted long ago),
and the miniature golf course that was once next door has closed.
</P>
<P>
   Back in town, the Cooperstown Diner on Main Street has solid
diner food and excellent shakes. Locals will tell you some of the
best food in town is at Black Bart's B-B-Q, which apparently is not
a barbecue joint at all. It serves Tex-Mex food.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall
</P>
<P>
   The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is open from 9
a.m. to 9 p.m. every day from May through September and 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. pretty much the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Adult tickets cost $9.50, children 7-12 get in for $4 and
children younger than 7 get in for free. But be warned, children
under 7 might not appreciate the charm and history of the Hall of
Fame and might, instead, want to wander up the block to the
Cooperstown Bat Company and have a miniature bat made with their
name on it.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the Hall, call 1-888-425-5633 or check
out its Web site at www.baseballhalloffame.org.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere
</P>
<P>
   Away from baseball, the hottest spot is probably the Fenimore
House, built on the site of author James Fenimore Cooper's home. It
houses one of America's largest collections of Native American art.
Call 1-888-547-1450.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fun, though, comes from wandering about, checking
out the various diners and used bookstores, taking in the
spectacular scenery that makes central New York a big spot for
bicyclers.
</P>
<P>
   A few words about memorabilia: It's all here. And it will cost
you a bundle. Along Main Street you can get anything from a 1963
Kansas City Athletics cap to a replica uniform of the New York
Knights, the team Robert Redford played for in ``The Natural.'' But
as the line goes: Bring your love for the game and bring your Visa
card. Nothing is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame: Whaddya say, George?
</P>
<P>
   George Brett talks about the thrill of going to Cooperstown on
July 25 to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it doesn't really sink in until you walk into the
Hall of Fame and you see all the history of this great game. It's
the dream of every player to make it into the Hall of Fame, but
even then you don't really know what it's like until you see those
plaques of all the great players on the walls, Babe Ruth and Lou
Gehrig and Ty Cobb and all those guys and my hero, Carl
Yastrzemski. That's when you really understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it's going to be like up there at the Hall
of Fame that weekend. Everybody knows that when I first got voted
in, I couldn't say anything without crying. But I've been
practicing. I've been getting better. I'm thinking maybe if I
practice enough, I won't cry. But when I start thinking about all
the people who helped me _ my father, Charlie (Lau), my brothers,
Whitey (Herzog) _ I'll probably start blubbering like a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to say. I never write down my
speeches. I just write down a few words. You know, if I write down
`Charlie Lau' (Brett's longtime hitting instructor and dear
friend), I will know what to say, believe me. If I write down
`Dad,'' I will know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's going to be amazing. Cooperstown is a special place,
and this is a special time in my life. It's the most special
time.''

COOPERSTOWN GEARING UP FOR SPECIAL WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POSNANSKI  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The Village of Cooperstown is quaint and
precious and so utterly American that you might want to bring along
some recordings of John Philip Sousa marches. The marches are not
provided by Cooperstown. Everything else American is.
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Hall of Fame sits on Main Street, of course, right
next to the Cooperstown General Store, across the street from the
Cooperstown Post Office. Trees and American flags line the streets.
On Main Street, you can get a chocolate malt, an apple pie or a new
baseball bat with your name carved into it. There are inns and
charming bookstores and a national bank and a Mickey Mantle Wax
Museum and little shops that close at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On the road to Cooperstown (``The Alfred Bleich Expressway,''
New York 28, named for the former VFW Commander) you see the
mountains and the prairies, wheat and the Hamburger Hall of Fame.
There's a plaque for James Fenimore Cooper, America's first
novelist, who died here. Nearby, there's Yogi Bear's Jellystone
Park for campers. Talk about American. Heck, the first building you
see when entering village limits is a large supermarket called
``Great American.'' And like all Great Americans, it's open 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   As you move around, you're not sure whether this is real or just
an elaborate advertising gimmick for a Washington's Birthday white
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Then, that's the point of Cooperstown. America. Cooperstown is
more American than ``Hee Haw.'' And Cooperstown is where George
Brett will finish off his all-American baseball career on July 25,
when he will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Brett will
go into the Hall of Fame with another American icon, Nolan Ryan,
and when you toss in Robin Yount, you have the most star-studded
cast since at least ``Towering Inferno.'' Fifty thousand people
figure to stuff into this town of 2,100. Traffic into Cooperstown
that weekend figures to back up to Manhattan's Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you can't make it for the weekend, Cooperstown will be
here for the viewing year round. That's the beauty of the place.
The weather may change, but it's always '55 in Cooperstown, 1955,
every day, all the time, except perhaps at a store called ``The
Latest Obsession,'' where they sell, well, whatever happens to be
the latest obsession. You have to love a store like that. It's
almost as if the owner got tired of trying to keep up with an
ever-changing country. ``Yeah, yeah,'' you can imagine her saying
to the delivery person trying to explain America's newest fad.
``Just put it on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to history, Cooperstown's claim on baseball is
pretty tenuous. A museum display says that according to cave
drawings, they were playing baseball in one form or another in
Egypt back in 2,000 B.C., or even before that if you believe the
old joke that the Bible itself starts with the baseball phrase ``In
the big inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, practically every country on earth has laid
claim to being the birthplace of baseball. In England, many believe
the game is just a spinoff of rounders. People in the old Soviet
Union asserted that baseball was actually developed in Russia.
Chinese historians have said plainly that the game was invented in
ancient China, but they did not like it much.
</P>
<P>
   Even in America, historians now say baseball's origins are more
closely tied to Hoboken, N.J., than Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   But then, history hardly seems the point. Baseball has always
touched sentimental strings in us, and Cooperstown is as poignant
and corny as an old Jimmy Stewart movie. The Cooperstown story of
baseball may be sketchy, but it's beautiful. The story goes that
the game was invented by Abner Doubleday, the same man who fired
the first gun for the Union at Fort Sumter, S.C. Seems one day he
was playing a game of ``Town Ball'' with the boys in Cooperstown
when, suddenly, in a jolt of inspiration, he grabbed a stick and
marked out a diamond in the dirt, plopped down some bases and,
essentially, invented the game of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Then he invented the infield fly rule.
</P>
<P>
   The story has taken a beating from historians ever since _ at
least partly because it appears to be completely untrue _ but truth
is really not the point. Maybe baseball really was first played in
Hoboken as in the latest theory, but let's face it, Hoboken, for
all its charms and Sinatra connections and refurbished apartments,
would be a lousy place for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Baseball is
about myth and lore and fairy tales, about ghosts coming out of the
cornfield and Babe Ruth calling his home run and fathers playing
catch with sons.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Cooperstown may not be where baseball was
actually invented, but it's exactly where baseball should have been
invented.
</P>
<P>
   Small things
</P>
<P>
   Skip the movie. The first thing they tell you when you wander
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum (a brick
building on the corner of Main and Fair that looks a bit like a
school) is what time the movie starts. People build their entire
days around the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother. The movie is fine _ it's a collage of baseball
photographs with pretty music swirling in the background _ but it's
short. Real short. Some years ago, a group of us went to Disneyland
and waited two hours in 108-degree weather to go on some frog ride.
When we finally made it in, it was, like, BRRRP, ride over, four
seconds at most, and that's exactly what it's like for the movie at
the Hall. Huge buildup, you wait in line, finally make it in, and 5
minutes later you're sitting there going, ``That's it?''
</P>
<P>
   No, the Baseball Hall of Fame isn't all that interactive. It's
really not about videos and little games and talking statues. It's
about small things. The most esteemed room is, of course, The
Members Gallery, and it has the spirit of a church. There are 237
members who have been inducted so far, and only three spots are
left along the main wall, which means Brett, Ryan and Yount will be
the last to get into the big hall. The others will be around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much that means to me,'' Brett says.
``You walk into that room and it's incredible. You can feel the
power of the place, you know? I mean, there they all are, all the
greats. To get into that room, it's, I don't even have any words
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   People have different reactions to The Members Gallery because
it's so elegant and so simple. Many are wowed by the names _ Ruth,
Aaron, Gehrig, Cobb, Musial, DiMaggio, Mays, Clemente _ and the
almost religious grandeur of the place. Others look around and
think ``Uh, this is it? Where are the rides?''
</P>
<P>
   This carries throughout the Hall of Fame. The thrills of the
place are in tiny details, in seeing the bat Bobby Thomson used to
hit the most famous home run in baseball history, in looking at the
beat-up catcher's mitt that Yogi Berra wore the day he caught Don
Larsen's World Series perfect game, in studying the way uniforms
have changed through the years.
</P>
<P>
   A quick warning: Kids often get bored fast here. You often see
dads and moms gawking forever at Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball
or George Brett's pine-tar bat (go ahead, measure how high the pine
tar goes; everyone else does) while their kids run around, bumping
into walls, nearly knocking off the photo of Bill Mazeroski.
</P>
<P>
   You definitely should not miss the baseball movies room. It's
not all that easy to find; you actually have to go past the
sportswriters wing of the Hall of Fame (which includes the eminent
former Kansas City Star columnist Joe McGuff) and into a little
room, where there are posters of a bunch of baseball movies and a
television playing wonderful trailers from such classics as ``It
Happens Every Spring'' and ``The Kid From Left Field.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the Baseball Hall of Fame is there to be
enjoyed at your own pace. There is so much memorabilia, so much
history, that a rabid baseball fan _ one of those people who knows
exactly how many runs batted in Hack Wilson had in 1930 _ can spend
two days there. A casual fan can spend several happy hours. A
non-baseball fan will be in and out in 20 minutes, and that
includes 10 minutes buying $48 shirts in the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   A pace of life
</P>
<P>
   During the Baseball Hall of Fame induction weekend, there's this
guy from Ohio who dresses up like Babe Ruth and walks up and down
Main Street. That's not the amazing part, though. The amazing part
is that the guy doesn't have a full-time job here, because every
time you walk among the shops and street lights, you expect to run
into Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   There are other things in Cooperstown besides baseball.
Virtually everyone you meet will ask if you've gone to the Farmer's
Museum, where people weave and craft and blacksmith and whatever
else they used to do in the 19th century. The Fenimore House has a
wonderful collection of American art, from Native American to folk.
There's a classy Belgian brewery _ Brewery Ommegang _ and boating
along Otsego Lake and all sorts of nature to wow at.
</P>
<P>
   There are also $30 baseball caps and tacky tourist places and
such things. No town, not even Cooperstown, can fully escape from
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Cooperstown is about baseball, and it's about a
pace of life long gone in most places. It's about shutters and
picket fences, cars waiting for you to cross the street and people
window shopping and used bookstores. Baseball has always had this
dreamy quality, this ability to take you away from the rush, even
for a few moments. That's what Cooperstown is all about. America
probably was never really quite this quaint or this charming _ just
as baseball's good old days were never really that good _ but we
all want to believe it. And we all want to go back now and again.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, after his election, George Brett went to
Cooperstown. They wanted to show him around, show him where
everything would happen. As he looked around, he felt overwhelmed
by the history, by the names, by the fact that he would become a
part of this place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This is amazing; I don't belong here,' '' Brett
says. ``But then I thought `You know? I could get used to being
here. I definitely could get used to being here.' ''
</P>

`SON' PROVES MISERY LOVES COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My Son the Fanatic'' is the oddest thing, a comedy about
misery. What's most odd about it is that it works, and works
magnificently. Hanif Kureishi, adapting his own fiction for the
screen, has written a film about the folly of good intentions and
the necessity of delusion.
</P>
<P>
   It's his best work for the screen since his screenplay for ``My
Beautiful Laundrette'' was produced and made a movie star out of
Daniel Day Lewis. ``My Son the Fanatic'' is Farid (Akbar Kurtha),
the child of Parvez (Om Puri), a Pakistani cabbie whose face is
split with pleasure when he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Parvez is happy about his son's impending marriage to
a charming British girl, the daughter of a police officer. But the
boy dumps her when he turns suddenly to Islamic fundamentalism.
``He said my father is the only pig he wants to eat,'' Farid's
stunned and jilted fiancee explains to Parvez.
</P>
<P>
   Parvez is deeply conflicted, a man who wants to create a
comfortable home for his wife and son, whom he loves. Yet he
alienates himself from his family by shutting himself away in the
basement with his decadent good taste for scotch and R&AMP;B records (a
great group of songs selected by the R&AMP;B historian Charlie Gillett,
who was music consultant on the film).
</P>
<P>
   He also disdains ``low-class people,'' his fellow gossiping
cabbies. Yet he brings in extra money by setting prostitutes up
with clients. One particular client is a crude, pale lug of a
German (Stellan Skarsgard) who flings himself happily into affairs
with the hookers. He treats Parvez like a working-class puppy,
patting him on the head and calling him ``little man.''
</P>
<P>
   Skarsgard is almost too perfect a symbol of capitalist
crassness, a straw piggy for the picture to play off. Almost
everyone in ``My Son'' is lusting for a kind of purity. Even
Bettina (Rachel Griffiths, last seen in ``Hilary and Jackie'' and
showing a lovely worn dignity that softens her edges), the hooker
with whom Parvez spends the most time and is starting to fall in
love. Only he gets to see her without her streetwalker's armor, the
wigs and fanny-hugging PVC outfits.
</P>
<P>
   This corrosive comedy is fluidly directed by Udayan Prasad, who
gives the British industrial town a midnight-blue cast, a brooding
color scheme that perfectly complements the moodiness and the mood
shifts. Kureishi's gift for the amiable haze that assimilation can
create causes a delirious potency here, despite his letting Parvez
off the hook with his wife after an incident that shouldn't make
him sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The script is packed with terrific dialogue that doesn't score
at the expense of its characters, because much of it is soaked with
telling observation. ``You always said there were more important
things than `Stairway to Heaven,''' Farid tells his disbelieving
father, ``and you were right.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the father and son descriptions of a
local landmark, a steel mill chimney, are so sharp and varied they
could come right out of a short story. The copyright date on ``My
Son, The Fanatic'' is 1997, which means someone may have been
afraid to release this film. To its credit, it has aged extremely
well.

HAPPY B-DAY WHENEVER, SATCHMO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday will mark the anniversary of one of the most significant
events in this nation's history: Louis Armstrong's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Well ... maybe.
</P>
<P>
   You see, no one is quite sure of the exact date of Satchmo's
entry into this mortal realm. Some say he was born sometime in
1898. But he said he was born July 4, 1900. And if that's the way
that cat wanted it, he earned the right to go down in history as
being born on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is that he got here whenever he did. And
that has been exceedingly good for America, the world and music.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rags-to-riches stories that spangle the fabric of this
nation's star-adorned history, none is more spectacular than
Armstrong's.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in poverty in and on the fringes of New Orleans'
notorious Storyville red-light district, Armstrong came early to
hard work, to privation, to exposure to the seamy underside of
urban life.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping out of school after the fifth grade, he hauled coal,
worked on a milk truck and did whatever menial work he could find
to help support his sister and ailing mother.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he struggled to survive, Armstrong's sensibility
absorbed the robust rhythms of his New Orleans environment, and his
mind's ear soaked up the sounds of the rich and vibrant music _ the
marching bands, the parades, the funerals, the pulsating juke
joints and the great trumpeters.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Bergreen, in ``Louis Armstrong: And Extravagant Life,''
quotes Satchmo reminiscing this way on his old New Orleans days:
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go on talking about my home town like mad because I
love it. I always will. It has given me something to live for.
Those millions of memories. Even with those hard times I'd be
willing to live them all over again if I could run into some more
Joe Olivers and those fine prostitutes and pimps and gamblers who
told me, `Son, you don't want to live this kind of life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him and American culture, he didn't have to live
that kind of life. His turning point came when (if we believe him
about his birthday) Armstrong was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's morning 1913, young Louis fired a pistol into the
air in celebration and was arrested, tried and sent to the New
Orleans Colored Waifs Home. He became the school's bugler, was
inducted into the school's marching band and got his first
extensive lessons on the cornet.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Armstrong grew up to play with bands and orchestras on
riverboats traveling up and down the Mississippi River between New
Orleans and St. Louis, played in clubs in Chicago and New York, and
was proclaimed the world's greatest trumpet player _ cutting
records that became nationwide hits, carrying jazz into new
frontiers, breaking sound barriers with his horn, becoming an
international celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the current generation think of Satchmo (short for
``Satchel Mouth'') as just a popular singer because modern jazz
took off in another direction from where he took it. He was
condemned in some quarters for his blending of pop and jazz music.
</P>
<P>
   Satchmo is known today to millions by his gravely voice; his
singing career did not take off until he caught a bad cold that
left him with that distinctive raspiness. A number of singers tried
to catch colds to get that voice quality.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly Satchmo's best-known song today is ``Hello, Dolly.''
Ironically, he was pressured by his manager to record it. He
thought the recording session was a bomb. When it became a hit, he
and his touring band had to have sheet music sent to them from New
York so that they could do it on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Satchmo's international prestige boosted him into the role of an
American ambassador of good will, a part he delighted in playing.
But there came a time when he refused to play that part. It was
when he saw on television a white man spitting on a little black
girl who was trying to enroll in school in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Satch canceled his international tour. He called
President Dwight Eisenhower a ``two-face'' with ``no guts'' and
Gov. Orville Faubus of Arkansas an ``uneducated plow-boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Armstrong: ``The way they are treating my people down South
the government can go to hell .... The people over there ask me
what's wrong with my country, what am I supposed to say?''
</P>
<P>
   That was stunning coming from Satchmo, who had always projected
the image of the smiling, contented performer with no serious
nonmusical thoughts in his head. A lot of people didn't like that,
especially down South. He was widely criticized, and letters were
sent to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover calling for an investigation
of the musician.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI did start a file, but after reviewing it, Hoover said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong's life is a good argument against the theory that
Negroes are inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   His unpopularity was short-lived, and Armstrong soared to new
heights of adulation both for his musicianship and his citizenship
during the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering the last of a series of heart attacks in June
1971, Satchmo celebrated his last birthday party on July 4 at his
home in Corona, N.Y., telling reporters that he would resume
performing soon. He died in his sleep two days later.
</P>
<P>
   On this last Fourth of July of the 1900s, it would be fitting to
sing a chorus of ``It's a Wonderful World'' in honor of an
extraordinary red,-white-and-blue-and-black American who was born
on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he said.
</P>

REMEMBERING A GREAT WRITER, FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I went to Alice Adams' memorial service because
she was a terrific American fiction writer and because she once
showed me a profound personal kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Through the remembrances of a cadre of people who knew her
intimately and loved her deeply, I learned that her treatment of me
_ a mere acquaintance _ was a microcosm of her life. As Anne Lamott
put it: ``If she loved you, boy, you knew it, and her generosity
knew no bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice's books _ 17 novels and short story collections _ speak
more eloquently (and accurately) than any person could about her
work. Her stories were selected 22 times for inclusion in the
annual O'Henry Awards Collection. Her novels, among them
``Listening to Billie,'' ``Superior Women'' and ``Southern
Exposure,'' are a mainstay of contemporary literature and stand as
bright, lucrative feathers in the cap of her publisher, Alfred A.
Knopf Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But something clearly evident at her memorial service in the
barn-like Golden Gate Club of the Presidio struck me as perhaps the
ultimate tribute to Alice's soul: Scores and scores of
fabulous-looking women of substance came to pay her homage.
</P>
<P>
   I say fabulous not because they were Miss Universe-pretty or
``done'' or draped in expensive clothes. Young, middle-aged or old,
the women in attendance all seemed to have what they used to call
in Hollywood ``A Face'' _ a visage with profound experience (both
awful and ecstatic) written upon it.
</P>
<P>
   Each moved and held herself in a way that promised: ``My story
would take your breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Alice's son Peter Linenthal and a handful of other
men, more than a dozen women took the podium to praise Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them _ like best-selling authors Lamott and Mary
Gaitskill _ are successful writers and poets; most are younger than
Alice, who died May 26 at the age of 72.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an inconsequential pair of facts.
</P>
<P>
   A proud, serious, vulnerable artist, Alice repeatedly exposed
her insecurities and doubts to _ God forbid _ other writers. She
formed deep, intimate, joy-filled friendships with them.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful, highly sexed female who breathed in the attention
of men as if it were pure oxygen, she gathered other beautiful
women around her. She did this not to neutralize or pull rank on
them, but to encourage their talents, to teach them and to be
taught.
</P>
<P>
   The more beautiful and gifted they were, the closer she seemed
to hold them to her heart.
</P>
<P>
   The words most often used at Alice's service were ``beautiful,''
``elegant,'' ``fierce'' and ``generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamott told how Alice had paid her rent for several months after
Lamott's son Sam was born and Lamott was a broke single mom.
</P>
<P>
   On Sam's first birthday, Alice gave Lamott a check for $1,000 in
his name and told her to give it to the next desperate young writer
she encountered, ``somebody who needs the money right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That may have been my favorite thing said about Alice Adams at
her memorial. But here are some other fine words:
</P>
<P>
   ``She never gave up on love or friendship.'' _ Fran Kiernan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I knew her (nearly 25 as her editor), she
never complained or talked about how hard it was to write ... She
was a spiritual woman though not remotely religious ... She was a
true bohemian.'' _ Victoria Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend, ``she was as fierce in her defense of you as a
hockey player on speed. ... She was wild, a great beauty and she
drove men nuts _ some who are in this room. She was an elegant,
old-fashioned sexpot. I don't think she ever wanted to be friends
with men, she wanted to knock their socks off.'' _ Carolyn See.
</P>

   ``She loved Trollope and Chekhov ... (but) the writer she read
over and over was Iris Murdoch. ... When we talked about writers
being jealous of other writers, she said, `I'm never jealous of
someone who writes better than I do.'' _ Millicent Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was opinionated and could be pretty judgmental, but she
could allow her friends to be exactly themselves. So many people,
you can feel them in your face, thinking as you talk, `I wouldn't
do that. You shouldn't have done that. You sure were stupid.' I do
that. But if Alice liked you in any way, she had the grace to stay
in her own skin and not get caught up in whether or not you were
thinking or living as she would. She could just let you be.'' _
Mary Gaitskill.
</P>
<P>
   This is my Alice story: We met at a party in early 1989. She _
THE Alice Adams _ not only tolerated me, she seemed interested in
me as a writer and as a person, and she laughed at my jokes.
Although the place was packed with good-looking men and literati, I
couldn't leave the exciting-but-comfortable space around her.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, she sent me a complimentary note about
something I'd written. It was like a missive from a goddess. I
wrote her back and carried her note around in my purse as if it
were a magic amulet.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1989, I was mugged and knifed in front of my house.
</P>
<P>
   Alice read about it in the newspaper. With only that one
previous meeting and one exchange of notes, she sent me an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   She could only imagine that I must be very afraid now to come
home and be alone, she said. If I wanted, I could come live with
her until my physical wounds healed and I got back my confidence.
</P>
<P>
   As Alice's friend Sheila Ballantyne said at the memorial: ``When
I think of Alice, I think, `Generosity. Generosity. Generosity.'''

VOLVO FIELDS A CONVERTIBLE TO ERASE ITS STODGY IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You remember the Volvo set: bearded men in tweed jackets and
women in sensible shoes, driving cars that were steel boxes, secure
in the knowledge they were protected from the ravages of wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   How then to explain the new Volvo C70, high-pressure turbo,
straight ahead blaster that looks, from the side, more screaming
Italian Ferrari (especially in red) than sensible and safe Swede?
</P>
<P>
   This is a wedge of an automobile with a convertible top that
fits its lines better than its Swedish convertible counterpart, the
Saab droptop, the latter having a bulbous look to it.
</P>
<P>
   It is yet another step in an 18-month overhaul of the Volvo line
that has seen the introduction of the S70, V70, the S80 luxury car,
and three all-wheel-drive wagons.
</P>
<P>
   But at 236 horsepower and 244 lbs./ft. of torque (I love cars
that have more torque than horsepower), Volvo was faced with
balancing high-end performance with its reputation for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Not to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Start with rugged head restraints on all four seats. Add three
break points in the steering column so it is no threat to the
driver. Toss in airbags that are triggered in several ways: if you
are in a low-speed crash and belted, the airbags do not deploy. If
you are not belted, they do. In high-speed crashes, they deploy to
any seat with a belted occupant.
</P>
<P>
   As has long been standard in Volvo, doors are heavily reinforced
with hi-tech steel. In the C70, the rear passenger compartment is
wrapped in a steel horseshoe that provides protection and rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid of rolling over in a convertible? The C70 has built in
roll bars (called ``hoops'') that are spring-loaded and pop up when
they sense pitch or roll to preset angles.
</P>
<P>
   Slide into the luxurious interior and look around. You are
ensconced in leather seats that are beautifully sculpted, right up
through the headrests. These are firm, enveloping seats, front and
rear. Carpets are plush and even the lower portions of the doors
are carpeted.
</P>
<P>
   Guages and controls are carefully grouped along the dash: to the
left of the steering wheel, controls for lights. Behind the wheel,
the standard speed, fuel, engine temperature and tachometer, but
added is an information center that displays outside temperature,
average speed of current trip, how many miles per gallon you are
getting, and how many miles until the tank goes dry.
</P>
<P>
   To the right of that is a mixed grouping: switches for the
Stability and Traction Control system, to raise and lower the roof,
to scroll the information center, and to heat the rear window and
outside mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the dash has all interior environmental controls
on top and the sound system below. What is basically a simple, yet
rich set of appointments loses that simplicity with the sound
system, a myriad of buttons and dials and settings that you would
not want to deal with while driving.
</P>
<P>
   For all the luxury, storage space inside is lacking: The pockets
in the doors are small and only two knuckles deep. Even the console
between the seats has a very shallow bin and the cup holders that
can be pulled from the console are cheap plastic that will break
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Because you need a place to put the roof when it goes down, the
trunk is quite small.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the roof down is very easy: Push a button and wait as it
unlatches, folds back and down, tucks itself away, and blankets
itself with a hard cover. It's just as slick coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Top down, riders are well-protected from swirling winds by the
sharp slope of the windshield. A pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Top up, this is a remarkably quiet convertible: no whistling
wind, minimal road noise. Unfortunately, that silence is broken by
strange, intermittent rattlings that come from inside the body
where door meets the rear panel behind passenger and driver.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility out the back is limited by a small rear window and
large panels at the rear corners of the convertible top. But that
is part of the price you pay for a quiet, tight top on what is, in
effect, a sedan given a ragtop.
</P>
<P>
   And though this is meant to be something of an enthusiast's car,
it is a sedan you think of when driving it.
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead, it surges with a quiet rumble that is absent of
the familiar turbo-whistle of old (old as in the mid-1980s). It has
great power for an auto that still managed 22.1 miles per gallon in
a week of mixed driving.
</P>
<P>
   And while the C70 sticks to corners very well at high speeds, it
does so with a softness that is reminiscent of luxury sedan, rather
than the stiffness of a performance auto. But Volvo is trying to
straddle two worlds here, so this is forgiveable.
</P>
<P>
   It is equipped with a Stability and Traction Control system
that, when the car is doing less than 25 miles per hour, brakes any
wheel it senses slipping until the slippage stops. At higher
speeds, engine torque is cut to end the slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping is sure and true as the four wheel disc brakes, backed
by an antilock system, keep the car going straight ahead even when
braking at higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   _ The soft, multi-nippled nobs that open and close the air vents
along the dash. They are easy to roll up and down.
</P>
<P>
   _ The loop handles on the back of the front seats that, when
pulled, activate the electric motors that move each seat forward. A
blessing for exiting rear-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The all-windows button on the driver's door with which you can
raise and lower all four windows at once.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ Obviously, a whole line of cars cannot be condemned for the
idiosyncracies of one, but if I paid $48,000 for a car and warning
lights kept coming on intermittently and incorrectly _ ABS, for
instance, when you could tell by pedal vibrations that the ABS was
working _ I'd be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   _ The lack of any sort of grip with which to raise the trunk.
You have to set your fingers under a ridge above the license plate.
</P>
<P>
   _ The cover over the lump in the roof, front and center, that
houses the motor that raises and lowers the roof. It looks like an
afterthought; I mistook it for storage space and opened it. The
lump is probably necessary, but it should have been intergrated
into the cowling that comes back from the windshield and houses
interior lights.

RISK SEEN OF PASSING MALE INFERTILITY ALONG IN REPRODUCTIVE BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Troy and Brandy Ciccarelli's story of how they managed to have a
baby is becoming commonplace as the medical community makes strides
in treating infertility.
</P>
<P>
   After Troy, 34, was told by doctors that he had a low sperm
count, the couple consented to an increasingly used fertility
technique that injects sperm into the egg. The result was twins, a
boy and a girl, delivered in August.
</P>
<P>
   But as success stories such as the Ciccarellis' continue to
mount, a new study proves that the mutation that caused his low
sperm count can be passed to the next generation, ensuring that the
number of infertile males will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The Ciccarellis knew of this possibility before the procedure,
and indeed, the couple's son inherited the mutated gene from Troy
Ciccarelli. Fertility experts say they have long warned their
patients that their sons could inherit the infertility.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in the July issue of the journal Human
Reproduction, Dr. David Page of the Whitehead Institute for
Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass. and Dr. Sherman Silber of
the Infertility Center of St. Louis show that sons inherit the
abnormal chromosome linked to male infertility.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic basis for this form of infertility was established
in 1995. Page and colleagues tested 89 infertile men, of whom 12
were missing a fragment of the Y chromosome known as the AZFc
region. The loss of the tiny piece appears to account for
infertility for about 13 percent of men who produce little or no
sperm, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   Considered experimental in the early 1990s, the technique of
injecting a sperm into an egg, called intracytoplasmic sperm
injection, or ICSI, is now the preferred method for circumventing
severe male infertility. In 1996, 16,011 cycles of ICSI were
attempted in the United States, and 6,098 babies were born from the
technique, according to the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In the study published Thursday, the authors examined four sons
of three men who had a deletion in the AZFc region and had
undergone ICSI. In all four cases, the sons had the same Y
chromosome deletion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of stumped that my father didn't have it, that
the genetic thing started with me,'' Ciccarelli said. Page said
that for every 2,000 men, one probably carries the missing piece of
the Y chromosome, but researchers do not know how the mutation
happens.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of all couples' infertility is due to problems
in the male.
</P>
<P>
   Not all male infertility can be explained by genetics, but
Silber said even subtle genetic mutations might be the answer for
the majority of men. Silber said at least eight other genes and as
many as 30 are involved in sperm production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We warn all our patients there is a risk. Even the ones who
don't have this deletion, we are very careful to tell them that
they may have another mutation that we will discover someday,''
Silber said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Richard Reindollar, director of reproductive
endocrinology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston,
said another possible cause of infertility is chromosomal
translocations, which are chromosomes with fragments switched with
fragments from other chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could lead to other abnormalities than just infertility
in the offspring,'' said Reindollar, a physician with Boston IVF,
one of the largest fertility clinics in the nation with more than
2,000 treatment cycles a year, of which 25 percent are ICSI.
</P>
<P>
   Although reproductive technology defies what nature protected by
preventing conception in the first place, most patients say they
are not too worried that their sons, too, will probably have to
make babies via the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Silber, who was the Ciccarellis' doctor, said couples rarely
decide against the ICSI treatment after they are informed that the
mutation can be passed on.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Robert Oates, associate professor of urology at Boston
Medical Center, said about 20 percent of his patients decide not to
go through the therapy because they are worried the infertility
problem could be genetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speaks strongly to us that we need to inform people as
best as we can that infertility can have a genetic basis,'' Oates
said. Oates said other options include using a sperm donor, or
adoption. Silber added that another option is the choice to have
only daughters, because they do not carry the Y chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Ciccarelli hopes that reproductive technologies will become
so advanced that it will be easier to produce a child from the lab
30 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess some of it was selfishness. After you have been
through the wringer, you want to have a family. We are still so
ecstatic,'' Ciccarelli said. ``Obviously, he won't know until we
think the time is right. I don't want him to think he has the green
light to do you know what and not have any worries.''

   I'm very rich. So rich, Bill Gates asked me to cosign the
construction loan on the palace he is building in Washington State;
Michael Jordan asked for a loan after a bad round of golf; Tiger
Woods called to see if I could front him some walking-around money
when the Ryder Cup comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   So rich, my accountant just told me, I should go spend a bunch
of money on cars, trucks and motorcycles. Fifty of them, he
recommended; the 50 I'd take from this closing century.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go shopping, not by rank but just what might look good in
the big barn we'll build to store them all:

Paid 95 large for it. I want it back.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   36. 1966 Shelby/AC 427 Cobra.

   37. Slow down. Peace, love and understanding (plus large bucks):
a 23-window, 1967 Volkswagen bus.
</P>
<P>
   38. 1999 Land Rover Defender. Still has that old Land Rover look
to it.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   40. 1999 Porsche 996 Cabriolet.

   42. 2000 Toyota Tundra; V-8 power, Toyota reliability, in a
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   43. 2000 Ford SVT F-150 Lightning. When is a pickup truck not a
pickup truck, despite that bed on the back? When it does 0-60 in
5.6 seconds, riding 360 horses and 440 lbs./ft. of torque.
</P>
<P>
   44. 1999 G500 Gelaendewagen by Mercedes-Benz. The $150,000-plus
SUV. Hey, I'm rich.
</P>
<P>
   45. 1999 Dodge Viper RT/10
</P>
<P>
   46. 1997 Aston-Martin DB7.
</P>
<P>
   47. 1998 Saleen Mustang
</P>
<P>
   48. 1998 Lamborghini Diablo roadster. Just to go to the store
for bread.
</P>
<P>
   49. 1999 Ferrari F355 Spyder. Oops, forgot the milk.

<P>
   50. 1955 Porsche Spyder 550. A reminder that speed can kill.
See: DEAN, JAMES.

`SUMMER OF SAM,' SPIKE, AND 1977 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty-two summers ago, Shelton Jackson Lee came home
to murder, mayhem, and mercury boiling in thermometers.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1977, and the 20-year-old had just completed his
sophomore year at Morehouse College in Atlanta. He returned to
Brooklyn without a declared major, no summer job, and an apartment
with no air conditioning. With little else to do, he bought a Super
8 camera, walked around the city, and recorded what he saw _
neighborhood block parties fueled by homemade lemonade, malt
liquor, and WKTU's Disco 92 pouring from a boombox; people, young
and old, frolicking in the cooling spray of an uncapped fire
hydrant; a city turned looter's paradise, when a lengthy blackout
draped everything in darkness.
</P>
<P>
   It was the summer when Lee, now best known by his childhood
moniker, Spike, decided to become a filmmaker _ and the time when a
chubby postal worker calling himself the Son of Sam seized the city
by its sweaty throat with a series of execution-style shootings.
Lee's latest film, ``Summer of Sam,'' examines that memorable New
York season when Reggie Jackson was king, sex was unprotected,
every tabloid headline screamed of heat or homicide, and 8 million
people shuddered with the unholy roar of a .44-caliber gun in the
hands of a madman named David Berkowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crazy summer where all these energies, good and bad,
came together. It was an exciting, dangerous, scary time,'' said
Lee recently on a New York day toasty enough to recall that brutal,
bludgeoning summer. ``Disco, the heat, the Yankees, the blackout,
Son of Sam _ what you see in the film are all of my memories of
that summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens Friday, stars John Leguizamo, Mira
Sorvino, Adrien Brody, Jennifer Esposito, Ben Gazzara, Patti
LuPone, and Anthony LaPaglia.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a midtown Manhattan suite _ just a hop, skip, and
limousine ride away from his courtside seat at Madison Square
Garden where he would later see his beloved New York Knicks lose
game four of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs _ Lee was
playful, pugnacious, and talkative despite a day's worth of
interviews for his 14th film. With his trademark glasses and
goatee, he was snazzily dressed in a dark suit, well-shined
loafers, and diamond stud in his left ear, a far cry from the
Latrell Sprewell jersey, Knicks cap, and orange team towel he would
don at the Garden later that night.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one gets the impression thatLee, 42, would be just as
happy talking about the Knicks' near-miracle season of 1999 as his
film about the mean season of 1977. That summer is viewed through
eyes of a group of friends and neighbors in an Italian-American
community in the Bronx. They are preoccupied with finding the Son
of Sam, convinced he's someone from their neighborhood. It captures
the madness and mania of the time _ from the women who cut and dyed
their hair because many of Berkowitz's victims had long dark hair,
to the restaurants and clubs that suffered when patrons were too
frightened to leave their homes at night.
</P>
<P>
   As Lee remembers it, there wasn't a palpable sense of panic in
his Fort Greene neighborhood. Simply put, Berkowitz wasn't
murdering people of color. But while there was grief for the
victims, Lee recalled some felt a certain relief even before
Berkowitz was captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they identified this guy as white, a lot of black
people were praying to God that he was not black,'' said Lee, who
recently moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan's Upper East Side. ``It
was like, `Well, at least that's something they can't blame on us.'
''
</P>
<P>
   There's a scene in the film addressing that sentiment. Yet
``Summer of Sam,'' written by Michael Imperioli, Victor Colicchio,
and Lee, is not a film about Berkowitz, who began his killing spree
in July 1976 and murdered six people and wounded seven before his
arrest in August 1977. Such a project would not have interested
Lee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the script Michael and Victor brought to me had been just
about David Berkowitz, just the Son of Sam, just the .44-caliber
killer, I would have rejected it right away,'' he said, crossing
his legs. ``They had the vision to see that would have been a
terrible movie. That movie has been done a million times before,
about a psychopath or serial murderer. That's not the movie they
wanted to make, that's not the movie they wanted to make, and
that's not the movie we made.''
</P>
<P>
   As with such Lee films as ``Do the Right Thing,'' ``Clockers,''
and ``Jungle Fever,'' ``Summer of Sam'' presents the Atlanta-born
Lee's singular love-hate view of his adopted city. It's a hard
slice of life about a city where nothing seemed to work. In 1977,
New York was unraveling. Teetering on brink of bankruptcy, it
suffered through one of its deadliest years, with more than 1,500
murders. The July 14 blackout _ which Con Edison officials had
assured customers would never happen _ cost the city millions in
damages when looters smashed into stores and stole everything from
bikes to television sets to sneakers to baby diapers. Even Studio
54, with its velvet ropes and fascist door policy, turned
nightclubbing into a battle between the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for anyone who lived in the city at the time, it's
impossible to remember that summer without a tug of nostalgia. The
airwaves percolated with great music from Barry White, The Who,
Talking Heads, and Marvin Gaye. The city, starved for a World
Series champion, rooted for the Yankees of Reggie, Catfish, Munson,
and Nettles. Here were the years before AIDS, before crack, before
Reaganomics and its trickle-down economics left many high and dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember people used to think cocaine was not addictive, that
it was not harmful?'' Lee said with a laugh. ``I don't know who
told them that lie, but back then people believed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Lee captures the era's decadence, especially when
Leguizamo and Sorvino's characters visit the notorious sex club,
Plato's Retreat. Though that scene remains sexually graphic, the
Motion Picture Association of America _ those mysterious folks who
dole out movie ratings _ demanded Lee makes cuts to secure an R
rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in my contract (to deliver a film with no more than an
R rating), and it's a policy at Disney that there are no NC-17
films,'' Lee said. ``So we had to trim some frames in the Plato's
Retreat scene. We had to zoom in slowly past John Leguizamo's
naked, pale . . . buttocks. The MPAA just couldn't deal with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the MPAA did not ask for trims of violent scenes, which Lee
called, ``a sad commentary. Violence never troubles the MPAA. It
always has to do with sex, and don't let (MPAA president) Jack
Valenti tell you any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film's recollections of that violent summer do
trouble some of the victims' survivors; a number of them have
protested the project since it began production last year and
lament that the film unearths painful memories. Michael Lauria,
whose 18-year-old daughter Donna was Berkowitz's first victim,
recently told The New York Times that Lee ``is making money off my
sorrow and my family's hurt. He has got no compassion.'' Neysa
Moskowitz, the mother of Berkowitz's final victim, Stacy, called
Lee ``a piranha.''
</P>
<P>
   On that subject, Lee has adopted a policy of don't ask, don't
tell _ if you don't ask, he won't tell you off. But at the Cannes
Film Festival last May, Lee said, ``I feel deeply for the parents
of the victims of Son of Sam. At the same time, I'm an artist, and
this is a story I wanted to tell. Even if I didn't make this film,
that was not going to bring their daughters, their loved ones back.
They got buried by a psychopath. We do not feel that the film is a
glorification of David Berkowitz.''
</P>
<P>
   What Lee will discuss is The New York Times' interview last
month with Berkowitz, who is serving six consecutive life sentences
in an upstate New York maximum-security prison. Berkowitz, who once
claimed he received his orders to kill from a neighbor's black
Labrador retriever, and, before his capture, sent literate,
taunting letters to then-New York Daily News columnist Jimmy
Breslin, denounced Lee's film for exploiting ``this madness, the
ugliness of the past.'' But Berkowitz, who says he is now a
born-again Christian, also made a creepy comment in the story about
Lee, saying he monitors ``everything there is'' about the filmmaker
and his family, naming Lee's wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he was not only outraged by Berkowitz's comments, but
the newspaper's decision to print them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was 100 percent (expletive) up. Why would you go to
a mass murderer and ask him about a movie? What validity does he
have?'' Lee asked. ``What, this guy is an expert? To quote a phrase
I got from (former Georgetown University) coach John Thompson, `I'm
not drinking the Kool-Aid.' If The New York Times thinks David
Berkowitz is an ideal talcum-powder-smelling American citizen (the
Times' article described Berkowitz as smelling ``pleasantly of
talcum powder), they can. I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid, and
neither are a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a summer dominated by Adam Sandler, Will Smith, and Mini-Me,
Lee's serious meditation on a decades-old New York summer could get
overshadowed. In the modestly budgeted ``Summer of Sam,'' there are
no dazzling special effects, no potty-mouthed cartoon kids, no
annoying computer-animated creatures _ things that often translate
into summertime success. But Lee contends that, unlike many of his
contemporaries, he doesn't judge the success of his films based on
opening-weekend tabulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and Victor brought me a great script that had a
riveting story. It was something I felt passionate about, and I
have to feel passion for anything I choose to direct,'' Lee said.
``Box office has nothing to do with it. It has to do with whether
I've been successful in getting on screen the vision I had in my
mind. With this film, I definitely got that.''

SOLSTICE APOCALYPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some thoughts on the solstice: Life isn't fair. New England
gardeners get used to cold, wet springs and hot, dry summers, but
so far it's been a hot, dry spring, and with unfortunate results.
</P>
<P>
   The spring drought, as droughts do, crept up on us. Lawns
suddenly looked like they do in late July _ brown, crinkly,
crunching underfoot. Shrubs and trees took longer to show the
effect, but when the loopers struck, the combination of being eaten
by the tiny green inchworms and not having water to help regenerate
leaves was too much.
</P>
<P>
   Roses are barren. Our Golden Showers yellow climber, usually
frothy with bright yellow flowers, came up dry, and our lovely
Zephirine Drouhin rose, which drapes a fence with pink, scented
beauties, was bare of flowers and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The early-flowering hyacinthiflora lilac got its show in, but
when I went to dead-head the spent flowers, I found the leaves
curling, withering. I think it was the drought, but I also spent
some time looking for borers, though I didn't find any. I further
suspect some unknown disease.
</P>
<P>
   And worst of all, an ornamental plum, already short of leaves
because it is beset with black knot, lost the rest of its foliage
to the drought and loopers. I fear I may lose the tree, which is
underplanted with Japanese painted ferns and various kinds of
campanula and tradescantia, none of which would appreciate losing
the plum's protection from full sun.
</P>
<P>
   Well, enough is enough. I already had been spraying fungicide
for the black knot. Now it was time to kill bugs and water and
fertilize (and pray for the plum). My supply of Bt (Bacillus
thuringiensis, a natural organism that kills caterpillars) was too
old to trust, and I felt I should not wait, so I loaded the sprayer
with Sevin (a chemical insecticide) and let fly. I prefer organic
methods, but the birds weren't eating enough of the little green
culprits.
</P>
<P>
   I have been watering steadily, have reapplied fungicide to the
plum, have fresh Bt on hand, and have fertilized to help the
weakened plants recover. While they all look terrible, only the
plum is likely to succumb.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we dwell on misfortune, there are bright spots. There
always are, though sometimes we have to look closely.
</P>
<P>
   So, we find the wispy California poppies have returned,
self-seeding, beneath a cherry. Their bright orange flowers are a
delight with the deep blue of Siberian iris and fronting the purple
balls of alliums.
</P>
<P>
   Also wispy and welcome are a handful of lupines. A clump by the
road has been magnificent, and I plan to harvest its seeds to help
it spread. Others hide, some in a tangle of ornamental grasses and
rugosa roses, one among the cherries.
</P>
<P>
   In another bed, Japanese blood grass is spreading, finally,
lending season-long color, slashes of red, by a transplanted
hydrangea that is at last settling in.
</P>
<P>
   In our front bed, along the road, a line of baptisias burst into
foliage and bloom, their flowers pea-like and a soft blue. They
were glorious this spring and hold great promise for next. Fronting
this are the brilliant yellow flowers of a coreopsis. Next to that
is a fringe tree, still under 3 feet tall but this year sporting
feathery white flowers, with the green foliage developing outside
the blooms. The plant fairly glowed.
</P>
<P>
   The small, year-old lime-yellow hostas in the Lucy bed out back
survived the depredations of the bed's namesake Newfoundland dog
(although one of the new ones I planted does appear to have been
stomped or sat upon). And after I had a dreadful battle to rip down
the Rosa multiflora that was strangling it, our heirloom red
climbing rose emerged, in bloom, and to thank me for my bloody
efforts, has thrown out some more blooms.
</P>
<P>
   As we mark the solstice and enter summer _ temperatures noted
the passage by plunging into the 40s the night before _ we can only
wonder at the vagaries of our climate and nature as a whole and
ponder whether we ever will learn all its lessons and tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The most important lesson is to breathe deeply, relax, and enjoy
what is given, not mourn what is taken away. On to July!

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Even though the Serb wielding the machine gun
and barking orders was masked by green grease paint and a
camouflage bandana, Liria Gashi knew he was ``Zvonko.''
</P>
<P>
   The eyes and the nervous hitch in his walk told Gashi, 38, an
ethnic Albanian mother of six, that the gunman descending upon her
rural hamlet was Zvonimir Svetkovic, an old neighbor and friend.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up together in Pec in a time before ethnic hatred in
the Balkans exploded into war. And now the 42-year-old man she
always called by his nickname ``Zvonko,'' and once considered
``like a brother,'' was leading a local unit of the feared and
murderous Serb paramilitaries known as ``Frenkis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go. Let's get this done,'' she heard Svetkovic tell his
militia, moments before 45 men from her village were lined up, shot
at close range, and then set ablaze with gasoline-soaked rags the
morning of May 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do they become so capable of so much evil?'' she asks amid
charred ruins littered with bone fragments where 12 of her
relatives were executed.
</P>
<P>
   Svetkovic, 42, was just one cog in the machinery of
state-sponsored hate and killing unleashed by Serb forces who NATO
officials say killed up to 10,000 Kosovar Albanians and burned and
terrorized some 800,000 people out of their homes. Investigators
say that nowhere did this machine operate more effeciently than in
Pec, a city that represents holy ground for the Serbian Orthodox
Church, and one that Serb ultra-nationalists were willing to
destroy to make their own.
</P>
<P>
   Documents and photographs obtained by The Globe begin to paint a
picture of how Pec's local Serb paramilitary units operated in
concert with the Yugoslave Ministry of Interior Police, known as
``MUPs,'' and with special units within the Yugoslav army. It also
offers a glimpse into the connections between the local killers and
the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, as well as the
network by state-owned businesses that helped finance the groups'
systematic rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The documents comes primarily from KLA sources, along with
prominent Kosovar lawyers and doctors turned human rights
investigators, all trying to cobble together the first draft of a
horrible chapter in history. But the paper work is butresses the
claims of many witnesses, whose accounts in the refugee camps in
Albania and Macedonia seemed at first to strain belief.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging evidence suggests that some 500 people were killed
by the Serb forces here during the war, and 80 percent of the
housing stock was destroyed, all in an effort to rid Pec of its
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the worst killing during the Serb campaign to drive
ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. More died in Kosovo Liberation Army
strongholds such as Djakovica and Drenica, where the Yugoslav
military hit the ethnic Albanian fighters where their families
lived. But what took place in Pec was a crusade, led by civilians,
to reclaim a cherished land, and it was in many ways less of a
bloody conflict but more of a methodical hate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting the dots in this criminal enterprise is a daunting
task that now falls on the shoulders of hundreds of human rights
workers and investigators who will be funneling a torrent of
information to the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
The tribunal hopes to build on the indictments already issued for
Milosevic and four of his regime's top officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Pec, the investigators have a rich harvest of hate to
unearth.
</P>
<P>
   Javad Zekaj, an ethnic Albanian lawyer turned investigator for a
municipal tribunal taking shape at the Kosovo Liberation Army's Pec
headquarters, pored through piles of documents and photographs last
week. They had been seized in recent days by the KLA from homes and
offices of Pec's most feared paramilitary leaders. Weeks earlier,
Zekaj and other community leaders had begun by taking testimony
from witnesses in the muddy refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia,
working to build a body of information that they are now in the
process of bolstering before they hand it over to the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Documents from police headquarters, hundreds of witness'
testimonies, and photographs put faces and names on the evils
perpetrated in Milosevic's name.
</P>
<P>
   Svetkovic and others like him were bit players in a
well-orchestrated campaign. There were dozens of civilians like him
in Pec who went neighborhood to neighborhood to inflict terror on
their ethnic Albanian neighbors and drive them from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   They became the local guides for the more professional killers
in paramilitary groups like the shadowy ``Frenkis,'' who were
recruited among veterans of the 1992 war in Bosnia for their
well-honed skills at ``ethnic cleansing.'' The ``Frenkis'' got
their name from Franko ``Frenki'' Simatovic, a leader of covert
operations in the Interior Ministry police. Rumors abound that he
was killed by the KLA in Pec, but they have not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves ``Frenki's Boys,'' and Svetkovic was proud
to be one of the boys. He was a mechanic in the state-run public
transportation garage. Despite his friendship with Liria Gashi, he
was a man long known for his virulent hatred for the few ethnic
Albanians whom he had not yet fired from their positions at the
garage, according to those who worked with him. He had a penchant
for playing loud Serbian nationalist songs in his neighborhood, and
screaming at children playing near his courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Svetkovic and his minions were organized by a regional commander
of the MUPs, Col. Vlahovic Boriskiv, according to Atem Qeku, the
KLA's chief of logistical operations in Pec and the newly appointed
municipal prefect of Pec's provisional government. He is among
those piecing together the operational structure of the
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Boriskiv became the liaison with the Belgrade regime's Minister
of Interior, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, who was indicted along with
Milosevic by the Hague tribunal last month, Qeku explained.
</P>
<P>
   The minister's signature appears on hundreds of police reports
documenting the arrest of ethnic Albanian civilians who were pulled
off of tractors and buses in late March as they tried to flee to
refugee camps amid the stepped-up NATO bombing. There are hundreds
of these men and women still missing, and their families hope they
are being held in Serb prisons, and not among those killed and
dumped in the mass graves being unearthed around Kosovo. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A ``terrorist suspect''
</P>
<P>
   Agim Shoshi, a 62-year-old farmer, was among those whose arrest
warrant Stojiljkovic signed. Shoshi was among 87 people from Pec
who were pulled out of a convoy that left Pec on March 27. The
police reports on the arrests are all stamped ``terrorist
suspect,'' but offer no supporting information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were beaten. We were not fed for weeks,'' he said of the
three months of captivity that began in Pec before he was
transferred to a prison in Serbia. ``I think there are many who
have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pale and gaunt, with his head shaved, Shoshi was among 166
prisoners released earlier this week by the International Committee
of the Red Cross.

MAKE SURE YOUR CAMPER KEEPS SMILING AFTER VISITING DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though this will be the eighth year she's gone to an Aloha
Foundation camp in Vermont, Lizzie Owens of Boston still looks
forward to Parents' Weekend practically from the moment she
arrives. She also anticipates the night after the weekend is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always hear girls crying into their pillows,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lizzie, who is 15 and loves camp, has succumbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having your parents visit has gotten easier as I'm older,''
she says, ``but I'm always a little sad afterwards. I don't usually
cry right away after they leave, but that night it usually hits me
that I won't see them again for 3 1/2 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the overnight camp season has barely begun,
anticipation of a reunion is already building for campers and
parents alike. For all the joy visiting day brings, there is also
potential for unhappiness: a sense of loss for parents at not
witnessing a child's growth and of sadness for a child who has to
muddle through yet another goodbye. Unfortunately, parents can
inadvertently set the stage for difficulty, sometimes long before
we get there, sometimes at the onset of a visit.
</P>
<P>
   The typical mistake we make is in response to an early homesick
letter when we write back something like this: ``Hang in there
until visiting day, honey. If you're still sad, we'll take you
home.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem for two reasons, says Christopher Thurber, a
University of Washington/Seattle psychologist and researcher who
has tracked 4,000 campers over six years:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Resisting parental urges
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --It fails to acknowledge how normal homesickness is. ``It's the
rare child who doesn't feel some homesickness during a camp stay,
ranging from fleeting feelings he can manage on his own to dramatic
upset that needs staff intervention,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a camper manages it alone, sadness may resurface on
visiting day. ``Kids have settled into a routine as well as a
mindset of functioning autonomously. As much as they want to share
everything with you, as much as this is a day of celebration, it is
also a day of interruption,'' says psychologist and camp consultant
Bruce Muchnick, of Glenside, Pa. Even if you don't talk about
what's going on at home _ and it's best to keep such conversation
very low-key _ you are a reminder of what they are missing out on,
from favorite food to family fun.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for first-time campers, says Posie
Taylor, executive director of the nonprofit Aloha Foundation, which
operates five summer camps and a year-round outdoor program in
Fairlee, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first said goodbye to parents, they had heard of
homesickness, but they didn't really know what it was,'' she says.
``Now they do. As visiting day approaches or as it comes to an end,
they worry: `Am I going to have that awful feeling again?' '' The
anticipation can click in any time during the visit, making a child
clingy, scared, and unhappy to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   --It undermines the goal of camp to foster independence and
undermines a child's self-confidence. ``It's as if you are saying,
`When you experience this developmentally normal feeling, you won't
be able to cope. I'll rescue you,' '' says Thurber. His advice,
which is echoed by other psychologists and camp directors, is
simple: Don't make deals or promises.
</P>
<P>
   It's equally inappropriate, however, to make light of
homesickness in a letter _ ``It'll pass'' _ or to brush it away on
your visit: ``You'll be fine as soon as we leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Davis, New England director of parent education for the
American Camp Association, says the best response validates a
child's feeling and expresses confidence in her ability to handle
it: ``I know you've had some moments of sadness. Camp is full of
ups and downs; that's part of the learning experience.'' ``I can
tell saying goodbye is stirring up feelings for you. You coped
pretty well the first time. How did you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting on the right foot
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How the visit begins can often determine how it will end.
</P>
<P>
   Timeliness is critical. ``Children attach meaning to it if you
are late,'' says Thurber. ``It feels like you aren't making an
effort. This is not like being late to a soccer game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie Owens remembers being 8 or 9 and waiting and watching
while everyone else's parents arrived. ``I started to have thoughts
that maybe they weren't coming or didn't want to come or that
something bad had happened,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says there is nothing sadder than a child whose parents
are late. ``If the visiting time starts at 10 and your flight gets
in at 12, make sure your child knows that in advance. If you're
running late that day, call,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Inappropriate expectations can also ruin a visit for you or your
child, says Muchnick: ``If a kid is expecting to see the dog and
you don't bring him, that's disappointing.'' For parents, he warns,
``Don't look for dramatic changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because one of the goals of overnight camp is to empower a child
to make his own decisions, Muchnick also tells parents to keep it
to yourself if you're unhappy about his choice of activities or
surprised he hasn't made more progress in an activity. ``If you
voice those thoughts,'' he says, ``it's like saying, `I thought you
could make good decisions, but obviously you can't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thurber urges avoiding judgmental comments of any kind,
even seemingly factual ones like, ``I can't believe how dusty
everything is!'' At one extreme, you run the risk of putting
distance between you and your child: ``There goes Mom again . . .''
At the other, you could dampen his enthusiasm: ``Dad's right. How
could I ever have thought this was fun?''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is convinced that what's hardest for parents is seeing
that their child can thrive without them. ``It feels as if you
aren't important,'' she says. As human as that response is, it's an
inaccurate perception. Don't act on it, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you feel a sense of loss, avoid saying something like,
`I'm so sad I wasn't there to see your first no-hitter,' '' she
says. ``On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with saying, `That
makes me so proud of you, I'm tearing up!' ''

   Visiting day is here to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many challenges to visiting day, no one seems
interested in doing away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an excitement in the air for days beforehand,'' says
Lizzie Owens. ``I kinda like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says the benefits _ giving children a chance to share
growth and experiences with parents and reassuring parents that
children are safe, healthy, and thriving _ far outweigh the
challenge of having to redo the departure. And she says the
departure doesn't have to be hard if parents keep it loving, brief,
and firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a child is not sad as you leave, but definitely if she
is, Taylor urges parents to let a counselor know that you're going.
``I never like to see a child standing by herself waving goodbye,''
she says. ``I like to see her waving goodbye with a counselor
standing at her side with an arm around her.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --If you know in advance you can't attend visiting day, your
child should know in advance, too. Can someone go in your stead? If
not, let the camp know.
</P>
<P>
   --If you have something sad to tell your child _ a relative is
sick, a pet has died _ do it at the beginning of the visit. Not
wanting to spoil your time together and thus waiting until you're
leaving to tell him isn't respectful, and it means a counselor is
the person helping your child process the information instead of
you. (If something really dramatic happens at home, a death of a
grandparent, for instance, most directors prefer that parents come
to camp to tell a child and temporarily take him home if that's
appropriate.)
</P>
<P>
   --While a child who has been homesick at the beginning is most
likely to be sad to see you leave at visiting day, Pam Cobb,
director of Camp Runoia in Belgrade Lakes, Maine, says her staff
anticipates a temporary change of mood in most children after
visiting day. ``It can be challenging even for a kid who has been
well integrated,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   --If anything worries or upsets you during the visit, from how
equipment is used to the choice of activity, talk to the counselor
or director. Don't share misgivings with your child.
</P>
<P>
   --Follow the camp's guidelines about visiting day, including
whether and what kind of food to bring. Don't arrive earlier than
requested, don't visit unexpectedly, and think twice before
bringing an extended-family member with you, especially someone who
needs your attention or help. It can make the visit frustrating if
you feel torn, having to tend to this person.
</P>
<P>
   --Many camps make accommodations for parents who are divorced
and prefer not to visit at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   --What to say to a child who wants to go home with you: ``I'll
miss you, too. I'm looking forward to seeing you in two weeks.''
``Saying goodbye is hard, but we all made a commitment for you to
stay for four weeks.'' ``I'm not surprised part of you feels as if
you'd like to spend more time with us. I'll be anxious for your
next letter to see how tennis is going.''
</P>
<P>
   --If you are seriously considering taking your child home,
consult with the camp director first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ A minimum of 20 minutes' reading a day helps
children of all ages not lose ground academically over the summer.

<P>
   I'm very rich. So rich, Bill Gates asked me to cosign the
construction loan on the palace he is building in Washington State;
Michael Jordan asked for a loan after a bad round of golf; Tiger
Woods called to see if I could front him some walking-around money
when the Ryder Cup comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   So rich, my accountant just told me, I should go spend a bunch
of money on cars, trucks and motorcycles. Fifty of them, he
recommended; the 50 I'd take from this closing century.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go shopping, not by rank but just what might look good in
the big barn we'll build to store them all:
</P>
<P>
   1. 1925 Ford Model T.
</P>
<P>
   2. 1928 Model A Ford Roadster pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   3. A 1932 Ford three-window highboy coupe _ turned hot rod. Just
saw one for sale with a 433-cubic inch engine that delivers 750
horespower.
</P>
<P>
   4. 1934 Ford five-window coupe.
</P>
<P>
   5. 1953 Hudson Hornet with Twin-H power, twin carbs, set up for
210 horsepower, just like at Daytona way back when.
</P>
<P>
   6. 1951 Henry J. No glove compartment, no trunk, two doors.
Spartan and ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   7. 1957 Thunderbird. In '58, it got ugly.
</P>
<P>
   8. 1957 Corvette. A nice bookend to above.
</P>
<P>
   9. 1959 BMW 507 Series II 3.2 liter. Two seats, ragtop, heaven.
</P>
<P>
   10. 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. Four doors, but pillarless;
sharp tailfins, brushed aluminum roof.
</P>
<P>
   11. 1936 Harley-Davidson EL, the wonderful Knucklehead engine
and a springer front end.
</P>
<P>
   12. 1952 Vincent Black Shadow. Top speed, 125. Danger.
</P>
<P>
   13. 1937 Indian Chief, made in Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   14. 1969 BSA 441-cc Victor. A one-lunger with yellow and brushed
aluminum tank.
</P>
<P>
   15. Another Springfield bike, the Indian 442, last of the
four-cylinder Indians.
</P>
<P>
   16. 1932 Auburn Boattail Speedster.
</P>
<P>
   17. 1937 Cord 812 Phaeton.
</P>
<P>
   18. 1930 Duesenberg Model J Derham Tourster.
</P>
<P>
   19. 1930 Bugatti Royale. Spitting in the face of the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   20. 1946 MG TC. Electrical woes? What, me worry?
</P>
<P>
   21. 1956 Mercedes Benz 300 SL Gullwing
</P>
<P>
   22. 1962 Jaguar XKE 3.8-liter roadster. In British Racing Green,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   23. 1958 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa.
</P>
<P>
   24. 1944 Volkswagen Schwimmwagen. Did you know VW made a car tht
floated and had propellors?
</P>
<P>
   25. 1950 VW Hebmueller. Only 750 of these two-seat convertibles
survived after the factory burned and the line was discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   26. 1958 Volkswagen convertible. Hey, this Bug was my first car.
Paid 95 large for it. I want it back.
</P>
<P>
   27. 1947 John Deere Model B tractor, the ``Late Styled B.''
We'll cheat here and add a second vehicle, the 1939 Model H Deere _
smaller, good for the kids to play on.
</P>
<P>
   28. 1946 Ford Woody Wagon.
</P>
<P>
   29. 1957 Willys wagon.
</P>
<P>
   30. 1965 Dodge Dart GT with the indestructible Slant-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   31. 1967 Chevelle SS 396 with 350 horspower. Work those muscle
cars.
</P>
<P>
   32. Out of the Mustang corral: a 1969 Shelby GT 350.
</P>
<P>
   33. 1966 Plymouth Hemi Satellite. Looks innocent, but try to
beat its 426 cubic inches away from a light.
</P>
<P>
   34. 1970 Plymouth Barrcuda, 440 Hemi Convertible. An
underappreciated automobile.
</P>
<P>
   35. 1965 Pontiac GTO hard top, with the 389, please.
</P>
<P>
   36. 1966 Shelby/AC 427 Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   37. Slow down. Peace, love and understanding (plus large bucks):
a 23-window, 1967 Volkswagen bus.
</P>
<P>
   38. 1999 Land Rover Defender. Still has that old Land Rover look
to it.
</P>
<P>
   39. 1972 Toyota Landcruiser, back when it was a short box.
</P>
<P>
   40. 1999 Porsche 996 Cabriolet.
</P>
<P>
   41. 1999 BMW M Coupe. Ugly, but a blast to drive; so ugly it
will be a collector's item some day.
</P>
<P>
   42. 2000 Toyota Tundra; V-8 power, Toyota reliability, in a
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   43. 2000 Ford SVT F-150 Lightning. When is a pickup truck not a
pickup truck, despite that bed on the back? When it does 0-60 in
5.6 seconds, riding 360 horses and 440 lbs./ft. of torque.
</P>
<P>
   44. 1999 G500 Gelaendewagen by Mercedes-Benz. The $150,000-plus
SUV. Hey, I'm rich.
</P>
<P>
   45. 1999 Dodge Viper RT/10
</P>
<P>
   46. 1997 Aston-Martin DB7.
</P>
<P>
   47. 1998 Saleen Mustang
</P>
<P>
   48. 1998 Lamborghini Diablo roadster. Just to go to the store
for bread.
</P>
<P>
   49. 1999 Ferrari F355 Spyder. Oops, forgot the milk.
</P>
<P>
   50. 1955 Porsche Spyder 550. A reminder that speed can kill.
See: DEAN, JAMES.
</P>
<P>
   If you have read this far, you are a car nut. So let's spend

VOLVO FIELDS A CONVERTIBLE TO ERASE ITS STODGY IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You remember the Volvo set: bearded men in tweed jackets and
women in sensible shoes, driving cars that were steel boxes, secure
in the knowledge they were protected from the ravages of wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   How then to explain the new Volvo C70, high-pressure turbo,
straight ahead blaster that looks, from the side, more screaming
Italian Ferrari (especially in red) than sensible and safe Swede?
</P>
<P>
   This is a wedge of an automobile with a convertible top that
fits its lines better than its Swedish convertible counterpart, the
Saab droptop, the latter having a bulbous look to it.
</P>
<P>
   It is yet another step in an 18-month overhaul of the Volvo line
that has seen the introduction of the S70, V70, the S80 luxury car,
and three all-wheel-drive wagons.
</P>
<P>
   But at 236 horsepower and 244 lbs./ft. of torque (I love cars
that have more torque than horsepower), Volvo was faced with
balancing high-end performance with its reputation for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Not to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Start with rugged head restraints on all four seats. Add three
break points in the steering column so it is no threat to the
driver. Toss in airbags that are triggered in several ways: if you
are in a low-speed crash and belted, the airbags do not deploy. If
you are not belted, they do. In high-speed crashes, they deploy to
any seat with a belted occupant.
</P>
<P>
   As has long been standard in Volvo, doors are heavily reinforced
with hi-tech steel. In the C70, the rear passenger compartment is
wrapped in a steel horseshoe that provides protection and rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid of rolling over in a convertible? The C70 has built in
roll bars (called ``hoops'') that are spring-loaded and pop up when
they sense pitch or roll to preset angles.
</P>
<P>
   Slide into the luxurious interior and look around. You are
ensconced in leather seats that are beautifully sculpted, right up
through the headrests. These are firm, enveloping seats, front and
rear. Carpets are plush and even the lower portions of the doors
are carpeted.
</P>
<P>
   Guages and controls are carefully grouped along the dash: to the
left of the steering wheel, controls for lights. Behind the wheel,
the standard speed, fuel, engine temperature and tachometer, but
added is an information center that displays outside temperature,
average speed of current trip, how many miles per gallon you are
getting, and how many miles until the tank goes dry.
</P>
<P>
   To the right of that is a mixed grouping: switches for the
Stability and Traction Control system, to raise and lower the roof,
to scroll the information center, and to heat the rear window and
outside mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the dash has all interior environmental controls
on top and the sound system below. What is basically a simple, yet
rich set of appointments loses that simplicity with the sound
system, a myriad of buttons and dials and settings that you would
not want to deal with while driving.
</P>
<P>
   For all the luxury, storage space inside is lacking: The pockets
in the doors are small and only two knuckles deep. Even the console
between the seats has a very shallow bin and the cup holders that
can be pulled from the console are cheap plastic that will break
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Because you need a place to put the roof when it goes down, the
trunk is quite small.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the roof down is very easy: Push a button and wait as it
unlatches, folds back and down, tucks itself away, and blankets
itself with a hard cover. It's just as slick coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Top down, riders are well-protected from swirling winds by the
sharp slope of the windshield. A pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Top up, this is a remarkably quiet convertible: no whistling
wind, minimal road noise. Unfortunately, that silence is broken by
strange, intermittent rattlings that come from inside the body
where door meets the rear panel behind passenger and driver.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility out the back is limited by a small rear window and
large panels at the rear corners of the convertible top. But that
is part of the price you pay for a quiet, tight top on what is, in
effect, a sedan given a ragtop.
</P>
<P>
   And though this is meant to be something of an enthusiast's car,
it is a sedan you think of when driving it.
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead, it surges with a quiet rumble that is absent of
the familiar turbo-whistle of old (old as in the mid-1980s). It has
great power for an auto that still managed 22.1 miles per gallon in
a week of mixed driving.
</P>
<P>
   And while the C70 sticks to corners very well at high speeds, it
does so with a softness that is reminiscent of luxury sedan, rather
than the stiffness of a performance auto. But Volvo is trying to
straddle two worlds here, so this is forgiveable.
</P>
<P>
   It is equipped with a Stability and Traction Control system
that, when the car is doing less than 25 miles per hour, brakes any
wheel it senses slipping until the slippage stops. At higher
speeds, engine torque is cut to end the slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping is sure and true as the four wheel disc brakes, backed
by an antilock system, keep the car going straight ahead even when
braking at higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   _ The soft, multi-nippled nobs that open and close the air vents
along the dash. They are easy to roll up and down.
</P>
<P>
   _ The loop handles on the back of the front seats that, when
pulled, activate the electric motors that move each seat forward. A
blessing for exiting rear-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The all-windows button on the driver's door with which you can
raise and lower all four windows at once.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ Obviously, a whole line of cars cannot be condemned for the
idiosyncracies of one, but if I paid $48,000 for a car and warning
lights kept coming on intermittently and incorrectly _ ABS, for
instance, when you could tell by pedal vibrations that the ABS was
working _ I'd be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   _ The lack of any sort of grip with which to raise the trunk.
You have to set your fingers under a ridge above the license plate.
</P>
<P>
   _ The cover over the lump in the roof, front and center, that
houses the motor that raises and lowers the roof. It looks like an
afterthought; I mistook it for storage space and opened it. The
lump is probably necessary, but it should have been intergrated
into the cowling that comes back from the windshield and houses
interior lights.

GOING ON-LINE FOR BACKUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have a home computer, the chances are excellent that you
don't back it up on a regular basis _ and there is a good chance
that you have never backed it up all.
</P>
<P>
   After all, backing up a home computer is hard work. Most PCs
these days are sold with hard drives that store from 2 to 6
gigabytes. Saving this information to floppies is impractical _ it
would take thousands. Instead, many people use a tape drive, but
they cost hundreds of dollars, and the tape cartridges typically
cost $30 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, if you don't do regular backups, you are courting danger.
Although computers are much more reliable than they were a few
years ago, hard drives still fail. Then there are the constant
risks of fire and theft. Backups also protect against data loss
caused by viruses, clumsy fingers, and children who needed to clean
off your financial records to make way for their computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Connected Online Backup is an innovative system that lets you
back up a huge hard drive without spending a huge fortune. The
system uses your existing Internet connection and a few clever
tricks to safely squirrel your data away at Connected's Backup
Center. You can even schedule the backups to happen automatically _
for example, every day at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   If you later discover a file is missing, you can run Connected's
intuitive user interface, find the file in question, and restore it
to your computer's hard drive. The service costs $19.95 a month for
each computer you back up _ a price that buys you an unlimited
amount of storage space on the company's servers. Businesses can
buy in bulk: For example, if you want to back up 100 computers,
Connected charges $16.41 per month per machine.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Connected works best if you have a high-speed
Internet connection, such as a cable modem or a DSL line. Using my
high-speed cable modem, I backed up a 1.5-gigabyte hard drive in a
little less than two hours. (The same backup would have taken
between 15 and 30 hours over a dial-up connection.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the tricks Connected uses to make the backup go faster is
file comparison. When the program goes to back up your copy of
Microsoft Word, for example, if first checks to see if somebody
else has backed up the files that make up the Word application to
Connected's backup servers. If somebody has, the program doesn't
bother uploading the same file a second time.
</P>
<P>
   This generates huge savings for most users. After all, there is
no reason to back up 10,000 identical copies of the same file from
10,000 individual computers, when one copy that is properly indexed
and archived will work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Connected can't use this data reduction trick when it is
restoring the files to your computer after a crash. Restoring my
hard drive over my high-speed cable modem took 12 hours _ over a
dial-up connection, it would have taken more than a hundred.
Connected knows this is a problem. So instead of downloading the
files over the Internet, you can also elect to have the company
burn your files into a write-once CD-ROM and have Connected send
the disks to you by UPS or FedEx. The cost is $24.95, plus
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest concern when I first learned of Connected Online
Backup was security: There are many secrets stored on my hard
drive. What assurances did I have that the information, once sent
to Connected, would stay secure?
</P>
<P>
   Connected's answer to the security problem is encryption. Before
your files are sent over the Internet, they are scrambled using an
encryption key that you specify. The files remain scrambled at
Connected's data center. If you want to get your files back, you
need to know the key you used. (You can also choose to have
Connected escrow a copy of your key, just in case you are the
forgetful type.) Connected's encryption protects against attackers
on the Internet, who might monitor your files as they travel over
the public network. The encryption also protects against the
possibility of crooked employees at Connected.
</P>
<P>
   But while Connected's encryption is good, it has problems. In my
tests, I discovered that while the contents of the files sent over
the Internet are encrypted, the file names are not. This is a
serious failing, since file names frequently contain confidential
information _ for example, the names of clients. Somebody watching
your Internet connection as your back up your computer can find out
very quickly what you are working on. Such monitoring can be easily
done by a person at your upstream ISP or, in some cases, somebody
on your cable modem network.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Connected about my finding, the company's first
reaction was to dismiss it, saying the confidential information in
file names isn't that significant. Perhaps so, but Connected is
advertising its backup as providing ``absolute security.''
Connected is not delivering on this promise.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with Connected Online Backup is the restore
process itself. Connected's disk ``repair'' software is quite
sophisticated. If your computer stops working after you install a
new program, you can use Connected to roll the computer back to the
way it was before the application was installed. Alternatively, you
can reformat your computer's hard drive (or buy a new one) and
restore the backup from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Connected makes the ``repair'' facility available
only to businesses that use the service for at least 50 computers.
``Repair'' isn't made available to small businesses or individuals
because Connected is worried about the cost of providing technical
support to these users. I think this attitude is cruel and callous
_ it is these small users that need services such as Connected's
repair facility the most.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming years, remote backup systems including Connected
are likely to be very popular, as they provide reliable, off-site
backup at an affordable cost. But Connected's current system needs
to mature a bit before I can give it my wholehearted endorsement.

THE END IS NIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just when I was getting used to a real summer in
San Francisco, the idea of dueling Clintons in the Senate and a guy
named George W. Bush wowing conservatives by pretending to be Bill
Clinton, I learn the world is going to end on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Damn that Nostradamus, spoiling all the fun. On the other hand,
I won't have to fix that retaining wall.
</P>
<P>
   Nostradamus, a 16th-century French apothecary, astrologer and
the second-best-selling author in history after God, used to make
his predictions by sitting on a brass pole in a trance and staring
into a bowl of water.
</P>
<P>
   That's as good a methodology as anything used by pollsters,
pundits, weathermen or Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The one prediction Nostradamus gave us with an actual date on it
is, according to a standard translation: ``In the seventh month of
1999, from the sky will come a great King of Terror.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Y2K too soon. Maybe all those computer designers weren't so
dumb to make room for only two digits in their computer clocks.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4 (or 17, or 24, or 28, depending which Nostradamus buff
you believe), the ``King of Terror'' will appear in the sky and 27
years of world war will ensue, killing a third of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this will not be a NATO war using smart bombs. The
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory might want to check its
inventory to see what's missing.
</P>
<P>
   As for this ``King of Terror'' appearing in the sky on the
Fourth of July, he'll probably be obscured by the fog just like San
Francisco's fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Here we live in the New Age cult capital of America, and we
probably won't even get a good end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the King of Terror will appear over North Carolina, the
home state of Sen. Jesse Helms, and we can watch on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's end of the world hasn't received much publicity in this
country. We're too busy living the good life to repent.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Nostradamus is the biggest hit since Hello Kitty, with
thousands of Web sites and celebrity chat shows devoted to his
predicted apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the world provides a certain relief from recession
and bank failures. Doom is the ultimate Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a red-hot economy, and frankly we don't
want to be distracted.
</P>
<P>
   Nostradamus is just another bear _ or 500-year-old Y2K bug _
who'd have us invest in freeze-dried food and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Nostradamus is that his words are as slippery
as Bill Clinton's. He played games with language, mixing French,
Latin and anagrams, perhaps even redefining est _ the French verb
``is,'' not the encounter group.
</P>
<P>
   This left him open to much interpretation and translation, and
he always gained something in translation. Napoleon found a
prediction of his glory. Goebbels found a prediction of the
thousand-year Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Others have found predictions of everything from Princess
Diana's death and the Gulf War to the success of Adam Sandler's
movies. Well, they could, if they worked hard enough at it.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a prediction of a King of Terror _ coming soon, to a
sky near you, replacing the grand finale of the fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   So what if it comes with a date, ``the seventh month of 1999''?
Already the interpreters, debunkers and New Age bunko artists are
hard at work on Nostradamus' text.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of his book Nostradamus supposedly said
something about bad things happening on ``the Day of the Eagle,''
which believers interpret to mean the Fourth of July. It also could
have something to do with a moon landing, Budweiser snack food or
priority mail.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem here. Sunday's end of the world may have
to be postponed 13 days because Nostradamus was working with the
Julian calendar.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another problem. According to scholars, Nostradamus'
texts have been corrupted over the years. The ``King of Terror''
Nostradamus refers to is un grand Roy d'effraieur in recent texts,
but in the original editions of his book the word was deffraieur.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of apostrophe makes a big difference. It turns the
predicted Big Guy in the Sky from a terror to ``one who defrays,
buys off, appeases or is a spendthrift.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, come Fourth of July, a King of Terror may not appear in
the sky, but a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. They're always appearing in our sky, flying into town
to collect campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   As much as anyone, I'd like to see the end of the world come
Sunday. I wouldn't have to pay my vacation Visa bill, vacuum the
house, figure out the difference between ``compassionate
conservatism'' and ``practical idealism'' (leave that to the
Nostradamus scholars) or write my Sunday column.
</P>
<P>
   I was going to run this one Sunday, but I'm running it now, just
in case.
</P>

JAIR: BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether the subject is politics or soccer, Jair seems like
anything but a right winger.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where Jair found himself at the start of the year.
Nearly half the Revolution season has gone by, but Jair finally
finds himself back where he belongs as the team prepares for
Sunday's game against the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two games, a 3-2 win at Tampa Bay and a 2-0 loss at
Dallas, Jair has been in a central midfield position, the best
platform for him to display his creativity.
</P>
<P>
   And with Edwin Gorter having been traded to Miami, the position
appears to be Jair's for the duration of the season _ especially if
he continues to develop a rapport with John Harkes, who is
questionable to return from a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches haven't told me anything,'' Jair said. ``But I'm
willing to take responsibility for wherever I play. For me to be at
my best, I have to get the ball. But we all are doing whatever we
have to do for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Revolution game plan is about sacrifice. Strikers
are defending, midfielders are pressing. But there have been
moments of inspiration, and Jair has been involved in a couple of
them with Joe-Max Moore in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Against Tampa Bay, Jair finished a move in which Mutiny
defenders were tripping over themselves as he scored his first goal
of the season. At Dallas, though, the Burn's Leonel Alvarez
displayed a little more savvy and ruthlessness. After Jair and
Moore played a skillful give-and-go in a tight space, Alvarez
simply hacked down Jair from behind, short-circuiting the
connection and taking Jair out of action for several minutes early
in the second half. (The combination of Jair's moderate
personality, Alvarez's eccentricity, and a refereeing blunder led
to no foul being called.)
</P>
<P>
   The play might have produced painful reminders of last season,
when Jair broke his left ankle in May and missed three months of
action.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the type of treatment to expect once a player
becomes a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of the responsibility,'' Jair said. ``I feel
very comfortable playing where I am and very confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for me at the beginning of the season. But

KOSOVAR SEES FRIEND LEAD RAID ON HER VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUSHK, Yugoslavia _ The first time the Serb paramilitaries
encircled this tiny rural hamlet was April 17, more than a month
before NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia started.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you will be killed if you don't leave,'' said the man
in the distinctive blue uniform of the feared Ministry of Interior
Police, known as MUPs, the chief agents of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's vision of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   A band of paramilitaries accompanied them in a mix of camouflage
uniforms, along with some Yugoslav army soldiers. They went house
to house, stealing jewelry, demanding money, and stealing most of
the cars.
</P>
<P>
   As the paramilitaries ransacked their way through the village,
Liria Gashi, 38, saw her former neighbor, Zvonimir Svetkovic, 42.
They had grown up together. He was a of her older brothers and they
all attended the Ramiz Sadiku elementary school in downtown Pec.
</P>
<P>
   She could tell by his nervous movements and the wavy, dark hair
tucked under an Australian bush hat that it was the neighbor she
knew by his nickname ``Zvonko,'' she said in an extended interview.
He was a father of three girls. Their families had been close. It
was before the hatreds of Kosovo spilled into war.
</P>
<P>
   Gashi, more out of surprise than courage, said just before he
left the village, ``Zvonko? Is that you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not from here,'' he said, but his voice made her certain
it was him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zvonko, it's me. It's Liliana. We grew up together for 18
years. I know your whole family,'' she remembered saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you here?'' he asked, looking stunned, then angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is from this village,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have children?'' he asked coldly.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't take it as a friendly inquiry by an old neighbor. She
thought she was trying to find out if she had sons in the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have five daughters,'' she lied, not telling him of her
16-year-old son hiding in a chicken coop behind the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave here,'' he said as he jumped into an idling military
``It's the only way I can save you.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after the NATO bombing began, the Serb forces _ this
time there were nearly 100 _ again encircled the warren of stucco
farm houses. The village of about 400 had been too proud and
defiant to leave, as most ethnic Albanian Kosovars had.
</P>
<P>
   While Gashi hid between the headboard of her bed and the wall,
peering through a crack in the window frame, the men were separated
from the women.
</P>
<P>
   She saw Svetkovic, his head shaven and his face covered in green
paint and a camouflage bandana. He seemed to be leading the men.
She stared in horror and shook in fear. She was afraid he was
looking for her.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she saw Svetkovic, he was taking two male members
of her family to a house down a dirt path next to hers. Moments
later there were bursts of gunfire. Then the sound of crackling
fire. Later she learned that 45 people from the village had been
shot at close range, and their bodies set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   This atrocity, confirmed by three men who miraculously survived,
photographs of charred bodies taken by family members before they
buried them, and investigators for the war crimes tribunal at the
Hague, was one of dozens of such attacks throughout the Pec area,
and as many as 100 throughout Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And Gashi has been left to grieve and to wonder about
``Zvonko's'' descent into depravity.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who knew him say that in 1989 he began attending
Serbian ultranationalist rallies in town. He stopped talking to his
ethnic Albanian neighbors about soccer and his passion for cars. By
1992, he was listening to loud Serbian nationalist music in his
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   When his ethnic Albanian neighbors' children played too close to
his side of the garden, he screamed at them and insulted them. When
an Albanian family left an outdoor light on near his bedroom
window, he would reach out with the butt of a rifle and smash it.
His house beaome a local headquarters for the paramilitary unit
known as the ``Frenkis.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the house was looted by ethnic Albanian neighbors who
had returned, and large wooden crates of ammunition and a dozen
paramilitary uniforms lay in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   Sali Seremeti, 46, was once a close friend of Svetkovic. But on
the morning of March 25, he was not surprised when Svetkovic banged
on his door with the butt of a rifle and told the family to leave
their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had gone mad. He changed into something very ugly,'' said
Seremeti. ``We all watched it happen.''

VARNISH WON'T HELP PAINT LAST LONGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I just finished painting my porch floor with two coats of
latex decking paint. Can I varnish that finish to protect it? Also,
the stairway to the porch is pressure-treated, and the 2 x 8
railings are splintering. The railings are made in such a way that
I cannot substitute a smaller or properly shaped railing. Right now
they are a hazard to anyone using them. My painter suggested
sanding, staining, and varnishing the rails.
</P>
<P>
   ROSEMARY FLANNERY, Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can varnish the latex paint, but it won't do any good
because the paint is its own protection. And, it might do some
harm, because any varnish (exterior polyurethane, spar or marine
varnish) is notorious for peeling and doesn't stand up as well as
the paint. The paint may peel, too. If it does, remove it all and
apply a semitransparent stain; only one coat is needed every five
years or so, and it will not peel.
</P>
<P>
   As for the railing, it splintered because it shrank when it
dried out, and I don't think any treatment will help much. However,
you can try one of several approaches:
</P>
<P>
   --Substitute the rail with a 54 pressure-treated floorboard.
This board is only 5 1/2 inches wide but a full inch thick, and
while it is 2 inches narrower than the 2 x 8, it still might be
appropriate as a substitute. It is of a better quality wood than
most other pressure-treated boards, and may splinter less or not at
all. Apply one coat of a semitransparent stain every five years.
</P>
<P>
   --Substitute a quality pine 2 x 8 for the rail, and stain it. A
good piece of pine like that, with rounded edges and kept stained,
will be much less likely to splinter.
</P>
<P>
   --Buy a regular hardwood rail, usually made of oak or birch, and
designed for indoor staircases. Get the one that is higher than it
is wide, and mount it on the 2 x 8 rail. It is much more easily
grabbed, without splinters. Keep such a rail stained with
semitransparent stain because it is made of glued laminates;
unprotected, these laminates will come loose in wet weather. If you
can find a rail that is not laminated, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I lighten my knotty pine paneling, which has become
quite dark over the years?
</P>
<P>
   IN THE DARK
</P>
<P>
   A. Wood will darken with age, whether it is under varnish,
stain, or paint, or left bare. You could paint it, but painting is
iffy because you would have to shellac all the knots to keep them
from bleeding through the paint.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to keep the wood looking natural, you have to remove
the old finish, usually by sanding, to the bare wood. Then apply
two thin coats of a water-based or oil-based polyurethane varnish.
The water-based varnish is OK to use in this instance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a number of windows in my cellar for summer
ventilation to prevent moisture buildup, but the inside grates
(burglar bars) prevent me from getting to the inside latches. Can I
cut out a glass panel and make an outside door?
</P>
<P>
   VERA GROPPER, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You also need screens to keep out bugs in summer, which
complicates the opening and closing of the windows. But opened they
must be in summer. You could install a door in one of the glass
panels; it might work if the window frame is wood, not metal.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, try attaching a hook to a short pole, so that you can
reach and turn the latch. The windows do not have to be open fully;
halfway will be sufficient. Or, reverse the latch so it can be
opened from the outside. The burlgar bars will still keep out
unwanted critters, two- or four-legged.

 PEC, Yugoslavia: ... Red Cross.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As of Friday, he was the only prisoner from Pec to have
returned.
</P>
<P>
   One of Stojiljkovic's top henchmen in the MUPs was Marinko
Jukic, who was also president of the Pec branch of Milosevic's
Socialist Party of Serbia. He is alleged by the investigators to
have been a conduit for financing the paramilitaries' weapons,
ammunition, and logistical support. Seized from his home, in a file
marked ``financing,'' was a red plastic-bound collection of
business cards of Belgrade's top executives in state-run industries
ranging from food processing to construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb thugs who were supported by and took orders from these
men are profiles of sadism and hate.
</P>
<P>
   One was Vidosav Shalipur, a police officer in his early 30s, who
waged a Ku Klux Klan-like campaign of beating, terror, and killing
against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   He is alleged by KLA investigators to have tortured a crippled
youth from Pec after he was kidnapped off the streets as a
suspected KLA supporter. Shalipur is alleged to have made the
youth, who is missing a leg, dance to Serbian nationalist songs in
a detention center before beating him so hard he is now missing
most of his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The detention center was raided by NATO last week and revealed a
torture chamber with a wooden chair fashioned to inflict pain and
connected by bicycle brake cables to an electrical generator. But
Salipur is believed to have had his reckoning. The KLA claims it
assasinated him with a rocket propelled-grenade during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Serb paramilitaries had a taste for cheap sunglasses
and black leather jackets, and a fondness for Mercedes Benz
convertibles and four-wheel drive vehicles stolen from Pec's
prosperous and sophisticated upper class of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Shalipur was hardly unique. Documents, witness accounts, and
photographs yield portraits of many other Serb paramilitary figures
in Pec, most of whom have fled to Serbia and Montenegro. One of
them was Predrag Vlavoic. &QL; 
 &QL; 
With a gun and a cross
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Vlavovic, 25, was the local leader of a loosely
organized paramilitary group made up mostly of civlians and known
as the ``Black Hand.'' The group operated on the fringes and was
particularly sadistic. Known for wearing a large Serbian Orthodox
cross around his neck and executing his victims with a 9 mm pistol,
Vlavovic has been accused of dozens of killings and rapes. The KLA
claims he assisted Zvetkovic's ``Frenkis'' unit in killing 45
people at the village of Cushk.
</P>
<P>
   Zekaj, the Albanian lawyer, said several women have told him and
investigators for the Hague tribunal that Vlavovic was among the
men who raped them at a two-story, stucco house of horrors that was
once an ethnic Albanian-run establishment in Pec known as the
Karagaq Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In a room in the back of the hotel is a black leather-padded
door and a sign marked ``private.'' Behind it are piles of debris
that include a white lace women's undershirt stained by dried
blood, womens' underwear, pornography, paramilitary uniforms, and
condoms, which KLA soldiers say they're leaving in place for
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neshad Asllani, a prominent Pec physician and vice president
of the Council for Defense of Human Rights and Freedom founded 10
years ago, said, ``It will take time for the women to come forward.
But the evidence is mounting. We may not apprehend these criminals,
but if they ever return they will be brought to justice.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The man known as ``death''
</P>
<P>
   Nebojsha Minic _ known by his nickname ``Smert,'' which
translates as ``Death'' _ a 38-year-old, native of Pec, was the
local leader of the paramilitary unit known as Arkan's Tigers. The
group is headed by the Zeljko Ravnatovic, a war criminal convicted
in absentia by the Hague tribunal and better known as ``Arkan.'' He
has close ties to Milosevic and a large financial interest in
various state-run businesses, especially hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Minic was also a active in Milosevic's Socialist Party, known as
SPS. One photograph shows him raising a bottle of plum brandy with
a menacing smile and long curly hair.
</P>
<P>
   He moved from neighboring Montenegro back to Pec around 1989
along with his father and brother, as Milosevic's campaign of
against ethnic Albanians began. Arrest records found in his home
show he had been convicted of fraud and assault, including the
beating of an ethnic Albanian woman in Djakovica in 1988. His
father and brother were members of the MUPs, the investigators say,
reflecting a pattern in which civilian paramilitaries were often
recruited from police families. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Why Pec?
</P>
<P>
   The reason the campaign against Albanians was so unsparing here
lies in Pec's history. Set in the dramatic landscape of the Rugova
Gorge, the city is the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Serbs
frequently call it their Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Serb homes in the rolling hills of wheat fields clustered around
historical churches were untouched, even by the NATO bombing. The
devastation was all in the center of Pec, a jewel for the ethnic
Albanians, and is generally regarded as the seat of Kosovar
Albanians' rich heritage as well.
</P>
<P>
   The methodical campaign to remove Kosovar Albanians from Pec
began years ago, as Milosevic ordered them fired them from their
jobs and replaced them with Serbs. Belgrade ordered construction of
new churches around Pec as part of an effort to reclaim the land
for Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The killing began in December 1998. The paramilitaries started
with Pec's most prominent doctors, lawyers, and business men. They
were abducted, killed, and their bodies dumped on the main street
and left for hours before police responded. It was meant to send a
message. By the time the NATO raids began on March 24, the killing
was becoming wide-scale, a slaughter of whole families and
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Kosovars are begining to return, but they come at a
pace much slower than the rest of Kosovo because there is simply
nowhere to live. Only 15 percent of greater Pec's 120,000 residents
have come back, compared to the 50 percent who have returned to
much of the rest of Kosovo. They come home to a city more ravaged
then they expected, and to haunting nightmares of the men who
carried it out.
</P>
<P>
   But those who have returned are turning their rage on the few
remaining Serbs in perhaps the most intense revenge campaign in
Kosovo. Every night this week, Serb villages and homes, especially
those owned by paramilitaries, have been engulfed by flames. They
lit up the night, and by morning left smoldering plumes of smoke in
the Serb hill towns that surround Pec.
</P>
<P>
   And now Pec, a beloved homeland to both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians, has been nearly burned to the ground _ by both sides in
the conflict.

LOGGING ON TO THE LOVE-IN AT WOODSTOCK.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woodstock.com is more than just a Web site: It's a virtual
nation-state, complete with its own population of preachers and
politicians, leaders and latchers-on, hawkers and hooligans. And by
the time they get to Woodstock '99, these cybercitizens will be
connected in ways that the hippies who trudged to the legendary
festival in upstate New York 30 years ago could never have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The live concert, featuring more than three dozen bands and set
for July 23-26 at Griffiss Park in Rome, N.Y., is a still a month
away, but pilgrims whose starting points range from Methuen to
Milwaukee are already forging friendships, sparking romances, and
building miniature communities.
</P>
<P>
   It's the '90s equivalent of a love-in, and it's happening on
line.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are convening in the Woodstock.com chat room, dishing out
the usual ``What are you wearing?'' and ``Where are you from?''
inanities. They're carping about concert management and complaining
about Aerosmith cancelling. They're forming car pools and arranging
rendezvous. And they're organizing ``tent circles,'' a phenomenon
that belongs to the cyber generation.
</P>
<P>
   A tent circle is a community of like-minded people who meet on
line; at the concert campground, they will pitch their tents in a
circle. One group plans to mark its site with a Winnie-the-Pooh
flag; another group will display a giant Gumby doll. There's a tent
circle for sober celebrants and another congregation of people over
25; both groups have adopted rules to maintain sanity and safety.
``I want to go and have fun, but I don't want to hang around with a
bunch of 18-year-old puking idiots,'' says Lynne Taylor, 28, of
Methuen, who signed up with the Over-25 Road Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   One group calls itself the Milwaukee Party Swingers; another
crowd of Jim Morrison fans goes by the name the Lizard Kingdom. ``I
don't want to say the music takes a back seat, but it's all about
meeting people,'' says Chris Myden, 20, a Calgary native who
launched an on-line Woodstock registry where people can post their
photos and profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these concertgoers wax nostalgic about peace, love, and
tie-dye or about music that aims to change the world. Most of them
weren't even born in 1969, the year of the first festival, and many
of them didn't attend the 25th anniversary extravaganza in 1994.
The only throwback to the '60s era comes from the Lizard Kingdom
folks, who describe their tent circle as a place ``where everyone
can experience and celebrate their soul, a place where you can be
your true self...free from the confines of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Misty metaphysics aside, both the concert and its official Web
site are places where everyone, even the Lizard King, is a
potential consumer. On the Web site, you can buy your camping
equipment from a local hardware store, purchase a transportation
package, or buy T-shirts and other concert paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   No, McLachlan isn't appearing at Woodstock '99, and the ``live''
performance was recorded last year. The site is positioning itself
for a life after Woodstock, and the pay-per-view event is a way to
lure festival groupies to come back when the tents are folded up
and the concert is over.
</P>
<P>
   The times, they are 'a changing, and we're not talking about
music or politics. We're talking about the Internet. Back in 1994,
when the World Wide Web was dawning, there were a few sites and
bulletin boards devoted to Woodstock II. Today, they seem terribly
quaint, grainy text pages counting down to the event.
</P>
<P>
   But now everything on the Web is about commerce: Woodstock.com
is a thinly disguised launching pad for a music portal site that
will combine commerce, news, and entertainment. ``Think of it as an
environment full of rich content that people will enjoy,'' says
Rand Bleimeister, chief executive officer of Music now, which owns
Woodstock.com. In the near future, the site is going to start
offering free e-mail and free home pages, along with an on-line
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the site is incredibly popular with pilgrims seeking
companionship; Bleimeister says it gets about 20,000 hits a day.
But it's not without its detractors. One user who calls himself the
Minister of Edutainment says he doesn't care about ``songwriter
news or all the boring music stuff.'' The organizer of the over-25
group is boycotting the site's bulletin boards because they are
riddled with profanity and personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The nation state is already having its own little rebellion of
sorts, but for the most part, the site is embraced by its avid
population. The tent circle phenomenon is a first, a harbinger of
future festivals. But the members of this cyber community aren't
naive; they grew up on-line, and they know that cyber dreams are
easily burst. ``Everyone is beautiful in the virtual world,'' says
Steve Julius, organizer of the Milwaukee group, laughing. ``It
doesn't always work out that way in real life.'' Send that man to
the Lizard Kingdom circle, where he can be freed from the
``confines of reality.''

DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the most notable boat ride in the history of literature.
On July 4, 1862, Charles L. Dodgson, a mathematics scholar at
Oxford, went rowing on the Thames in the company of the Rev.
Robinson Duckworth, a fellow Oxonian, and the three lovely Liddell
sisters _ 13-year-old Lorina, 10-year-old Alice, and 8-year-old
Edith. The trip began at Folly Bridge near Oxford, and went as far
as the village of Godstow, about three miles upstream. There they
stopped for tea, and as they lay in the shade, Dodgson _ we know
him better by his pseudonym, Lewis Carroll _ began to spin the tale
of Alice's adventures underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I distinctly remember . . . how, in a desperate attempt to
strike out some new line of fairy-lore,'' Carroll would later
write, ``I had sent my heroine straight down a rabbit-hole, to
begin with, without the least idea what was to happen afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)We(unitals know what Alice found at the bottom of that
rabbit-hole _ the frantic white rabbit in the waistcoat and kid
gloves, the bottle labeled ``Drink Me,'' the hookah-smoking
caterpillar, the ugly Duchess and the grinning Cheshire cat, the
Mad Hatter's tea party and the decapitating Queen of Hearts. But on
that July 4th it was all brand-new, and Alice Liddell couldn't get
enough of it. ``Oh, Mr. Dodgson,'' she pleaded that night, when he
took her and her sisters back home, ``I wish you would write out
Alice's adventures for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, he began to do so, and by February 1863 had
completed a handwritten draft of about 18,000 words. He showed it
to his friend, the poet and novelist George MacDonald, who in turn
shared it with his family. The reviews were enthusiastic:
Six-year-old Greville MacDonald told his mother he ``wished there
were 60,000 volumes of it.'' Encouraged, Carroll kept reworking and
expanding the manuscript. Early in 1864 he invited John Tenniel,
the leading cartoonist for Punch, to illustrate it. In June 1865,
the Clarendon Press printed the first 2,000 copies of ``Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland.'' It has never gone out of print.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it has never been just a children's book, either.
Queen Victoria, the story goes, was delighted with Carroll's first
``Alice'' masterpiece, and sent word that she would be grateful to
get a copy of his next book as soon as it was published. What she
received was ``Condensation of Determinants,'' a dense mathematical
tome.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel Victoria was hoping for appeared in 1871. ``Through
the Looking-Glass'' was as wonderful as ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland'' and proved equally as beloved. In its first 12 months,
it sold 25,000 copies; it, too, will be in print forever.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, ``Through the Looking-Glass'' is the more
remarkable. At one level it is a fantasy chess-game, filled with
make-believe characters and comical dialogue, yet closely following
the rules of chess. At another level it is an extended
improvisation on the theme of mirror-images and logical inversion.
Examples abound: Alice finds that to approach the Red Queen she
must walk away from her; to serve the Looking-Glass cake, she hands
it around first, then slices it; the White King has two messengers,
``one to come, and one to go;'' the White Queen lives backward in
time _ first she puts on a bandage, then she screams,
(itals)then(unitals she pricks her finger.
</P>
<P>
   At still another level, ``Through the Looking-Glass'' is an
allusive splash through some of deepest waters of metaphysics. When
the Tweedle brothers tell Alice that she is nothing but an
character in the Red King's dream _ ``If that there King was to
wake,'' Tweedledum says, ``you'd go out _ bang! _ just like a
candle!'' _ they are lining up with Bishop Berkeley, the English
philosopher who held that matter does not exist unless it is
observed. Humpty Dumpty's arrogant claim that ``when I use a word,
it means just what I choose it to mean _ neither more nor less''
echoes a semantic argument dating back to the Middle Ages, the view
that universal terms have no objective meaning outside the mind.
</P>
<P>
   And on on top of it all, ``Through the Looking-Glass'' contains
the greatest nonsense poem in the English language. `` `Twas
brillig,'' begins ``Jabberwocky,''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   and the slithy toves
</P>
<P>
   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
</P>
<P>
   All mimsy were the borogoves,
</P>
<P>
   And the mome raths outgrabe
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't know what it means? Alice didn't either. ``Somehow it
seems to fill my head with ideas,'' she mused, ``only I don't
exactly know what they are.'' The temptation to identify secret
meanings in Carroll's words can be overpowering. In the
introduction to his splendid annotated edition of the ``Alice''
books, Martin Gardner bewails the ``amateur head-shrinkers'' who
find all kinds of Freudian significance in the rich symbolism of
Alice's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider, for example, the scene in which Alice seizes the end
of the White King's pencil and begins scribbling for him. In five
minutes one can invent six different interpretations. Whether
Carroll's unconscious had any of them in mind, however, is an
altogether dubious matter. . . . The hypothesis must not be ruled
out that it is only by accident that a pencil in this scene is
shaped the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen decades after he told them to Alice Liddell and her
sisters, Carroll's stories remain as enchanting and enigmatic as
ever. On that long-ago fourth of July, when the shy Oxford don
first sent his young heroine into the rabbit-hole, who could have
imagined that she would still be jumping down it on the eve of the
21st century?

A WIN FOR GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gambling has triumphed. This is what one takes away after
reading the report of the National Gambling Impact Study
Commission, which two weeks ago released the results of its
three-year inquiry into the state of gambling in America.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, gambling of one form or another (usually lotteries and
derivative games) is now permitted in 47 states and the District of
Columbia. It is thriving on Indian reservations. And regulations
and restrictions on the gambling industry have been dramatically
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, gambling is now seen as just another form of
``family entertainment,'' like going to the movies or visiting a
theme park. This did not happen by accident. Private gambling
interests have spent hundreds of millions of dollars reconfiguring
the industry's image (it's ``gaming,'' not gambling, and it's fun).
These efforts have been successful beyond expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, state governments have become addicted to the
revenue gambling provides. In the last 25 years, those revenues
have grown from $2 billion to $34 billion. Based on the reliability
of this stream of money, states now use these revenues as
collateral for bond issues.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in public opinion toward gambling is so profound that
state governments are now its single largest promoters. They spend
more than $400 million annually advertising lotteries and other
``card'' games. ($400 million is roughly the same amount of money
that Budweiser spends to advertise all of its various beers every
year). And these advertising budgets will only increase in the
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows this is wrong. Lotteries are regressive taxation
at its worst. Gambling brings with it a host of social pathologies
that have real and sometimes devastating consequences for those who
get caught up in its maelstrom. And the promise made is entirely
false. To paraphrase the ad for E Trade: ``Someone's going to win.
It just won't be you.''
</P>
<P>
   But knowing something is wrong and doing something about it are
two different things. The Commission made 76 specific
recommendations regarding gambling in the future. They include an
outright ban on Internet gambling, a prohibition on college and
amateur sports wagering and a tax on gambling activities to help
cover medical costs for ``problem gamblers.'' The Commission's
recommendations, however, carry no legal weight and are unlikely to
be adopted by the Congress and the current Administration. Both the
Republican Party and the Democratic Party have become dependent on
gambling industry campaign contributions. The likelihood that
either party will try to curtail the future growth of gambling is,
as they say in Las Vegas, a loser's bet.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of gambling represents a stunning political and
cultural shift.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, gambling was a deadly political issue.
Liberal activists in the Democratic Party opposed it because it was
regressive taxation. Conservative activists in the Republican Party
opposed it on moral grounds. Any candidate trying to win a major
party nomination understood the politics and steered well clear of
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the only question is whether the gambling industry can
achieve its ultimate goal, which is to bring its games of chance
into every household in the world. Internet technology enables the
industry to do this and already it is hard at work developing this
capability.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an enormously attractive package, particularly for
non-gamblers. Gambling corporations would provide free Internet
access service, high-speed modems and a host of other
Internet-related perquisites _ all for free _ in exchange for some
minimum amount of money wagered on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
   They could package this with clever marketing and advertising as
a boon to the Internet industry and the economy as a whole. And
using the precise targeting methods that the Internet allows, they
could identify the most active gamblers across the country and
around the world and single them out for special treatment.
Eventually, of course, this would allow them to reach a much wider
audience on a more or less constant basis and thus triple and
perhaps quintuple their annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, non-gamblers would benefit from the very low-cost
or free Internet services provided by the gambling industry. Paying
$21 a month to America On Line may be worth it, but getting
Internet access and a high-speed modem from Harrah's for free is a
much better deal.
</P>
<P>
   Having erased the line in the sand that once kept gambling in
back office parlors and bookie joints, the gambling industry now
embarks on its greatest marketing effort ever; the expansion of
gambling through cyberspace. Judging by the industry's success over
the last twenty-five years, it is safe to say that Internet
gambling will be a reality by the end of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good news. It is not good for society. It is
antithetical to what used to be called ``the work ethic.'' And it
will reek havoc on millions of people who are dependent or related
to pathological gamblers. But it will happen, as surely as it is
true that you'll never win the lottery.

GETTING GRAPHIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Like most journalists, I'm irresistibly drawn to tales of
conflict. I reveled in the browser wars between Microsoft Corp. and
Netscape Communications Corp. I thrill to Advanced Micro Devices
Inc.'s desperate campaign to seize a share of the microprocessor
market from mighty Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer blood-on-the-wallpaper viciousness, it's hard to
top the competition in 3D graphic accelerators _ the chips that let
fans of computer games like Quake slaughter one another with
maximum realism.
</P>
<P>
   Good computer 3D used to cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Today it's so cheap any home PC owner can afford it, and it's
getting cheaper and better by the month. Unlike the processor chip
market, where everybody waits for the next new idea from Intel,
there are a host of firms all trying different techniques to serve
up better graphics at lower cost. The result is a market that
resembles an old ``Mad Max'' movie. It's an apocalyptic struggle of
all against all, where even the product names radiate an aura of
menace.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, a firm called Cirrus Logic Inc.
practically owned the market with its ViRGE chips. Today, the
company barely has a pulse. S3 Inc. dominated for a while, then
cratered last year when the public rejected the company's Savage 3D
products. Up came ATI Technologies Inc. of Canada, with its Rage
accelerators. But ATI's reign is now imperiled by 3Dfx Interactive
Inc., whose Voodoo 3 products are presently number one at retail
stores. And S3, once given up for dead, is launching a massive
counterattack with its new Savage 4 chip, which is getting good
early reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in this fearsome struggle are those who do the best
job of deceiving the rest of us. Graphic accelerators draw images
on a flat, two-dimensional computer screen that appear to have the
three-dimensional depth of the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Any sketch artist can trick your eye by drawing two-dimensional
objects that seem to have depth. A computer can do the same. But
what if you want to create the illusion of 3D images that move?
Your problem suddenly becomes a few million times more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Just move your own head and you'll see why. The relative
position of everything in the room changes, because your point of
view has changed. The only way a computer can emulate this effect
is by recalculating the position of every single dot of light on
the screen, using extremely complex math equations to make it all
look right.
</P>
<P>
   It gets far, far worse if you want the objects to move quickly
and smoothly, because then the computer must make all of these
calculations almost instantly. As a Quake player runs down a
virtual corridor, his computer must redraw every image on the
screen dozens of times a second, with no flicker, no delay.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop microprocessors couldn't begin to handle this kind of
load. So graphics firms make chips designed solely to do
three-dimensional math. They run at speeds once found only in Cray
supercomputers, yet graphics cards using these chips generally cost
well below $200.
</P>
<P>
   And as the leaders keep introducing newer and better chips, the
smaller players find it ever harder to keep up. A few years ago,
Number Nine Visual Technologies in Lexington seemed to be within
striking distance of the top-tier graphics players. Today, Number
Nine is only number 31 in market share, according to PC Data Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the company hopes to pick up a few share points by basing
fewer products on its own accelerator chip and building more of
them around the Savage 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a smaller company, it's hard for us to come out with a
sustainable product,'' said general manager William Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Number Nine, I got a glimpse of the
company's Savage 4 board working its magic on Quake. The 3D images
had all the murky grimness anyone could want, with smooth,
realistic movement. The price seemed even more impressive _ $109
list.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, compared with the computer images in films like ``Toy
Story'' or the new ``Star Wars,'' the Savage 4 and its desktop
rivals are still at the Model T stage.
</P>
<P>
   So graphics chip makers continue their relentless campaign of
improvements, constantly leapfrogging their rivals with even better
performance. It's like one of those computer games where victory
simply means staying alive _ my favorite kind.

STICK TO YOUR RIBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(HAS ART)  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Get ready to grill some succulent, tender, finger
lickin' good ribs for Independence Day feasting fare _ and make
them any way you like them. The most die-hard barbecuers generally
favor pork rather than beef ribs, but some grillers and diners will
put their money on big, meaty beef ribs. Suit yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Ribs have a certain mystique. Although messy and not the most
healthful of foods, they have a feverish following. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Few other smells are as welcoming as the smell of ribs slowly
cooking on the grill, roasting in the oven, or bubbling in a
delectable sauce,'' write Hugh Carpenter and Teri Sandison in ``The
Great Ribs Book'' (Ten Speed Press; $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   But lots of controversy surrounds rib cooking. Preferences,
cooking techniques and smoking times vary from cook to cook and
diner to diner, as well as among rib restaurants and different
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some like their ribs a bit chewy and crispy with just a hint of
sauce and lots of hickory flavor, while others like them moist and
tender, falling off the bone and laden with barbecue sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Some say slow, indirect (away from the heat), covered cooking on
a grill is the only way to go, while others rely on parboiling the
ribs stove-top before finishing up on the grill. Still other cooks
rid the ribs of excess fat _ known as degreasing _ by baking them
in the oven before grilling. Others rely on wrapping the ribs in
foil and slowly cooking them on the grill before turning them out
to finish grill-top.
</P>
<P>
   Some favor spice and herb rubs rather than sauces, but the
ultimate decision lies with the rib cook and the amount of time and
effort he or she wants to expend. Have patience, and don't rush the
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever route you take, keep this in mind. ``Rib meat is tough,
and it requires low heat and long cooking to break down the meat
fiber, render the fat and make the meat succulent and tender,'' say
Carpenter and Sandison. While the authors personally prefer pork
baby back ribs, which they refer to as ``the king of ribs,'' they
encourage cooks to feel free to substitute their favorite cuts in
recipes, regardless of what rib type is specified.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison, in their cookbook ``Born
to Grill, An American Celebration'' (Harvard Common Press; $27.95),
write: ``After testing a range of approaches to grilling ribs, we
finally settled on baking them first in an oven (generally wrapped
in foil with seasonings) or covered gas grill _ and then finishing
them over an open outdoor fire. Don't do the pre-cooking by boiling
or microwaving, as some people suggest, because you'll leave much
of the flavor in the kitchen in a pool of grease.''
</P>
<P>
   Both pork and beef ribs come in different styles and from
different sections of the animal. If you're undecided about which
cut to use, here's a quick primer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PORK &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Spareribs come from the underside or belly of the pig; the word
never refers to beef or lamb. A full slab or rack weighs from 3 to
5 pounds. The ribs should have some fat, but avoid those that are
too fatty. Smoke, grill, roast or braise them. Allow a pound of
ribs per person for an entree serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``For meatiness and succulent pork flavor, you can't beat
spareribs, the 13 ribs from the belly of the pig,'' recommend Bruce
Aidells and Denis Kelly in their ``The Complete Meat Cookbook''
(Houghton Mifflin Company; $35). ``If you've ever wondered how they
make those great spareribs in the world-renowned barbecue joints of
Kansas City, the South Side of Chicago or Memphis, the secret is a
flavorful spice rub and long, slow cooking with a spicy sauce
slathered on just before serving. With a covered kettle barbecue,
you can create equally wonderful results in your own back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Pork baby back ribs are cut from the loin or back section. They
take less time to cook than spareribs. They are small, lean and
make good finger food. Quality varies, so check with butchers to
find out who sells those with the most meat. A meaty slab weighs
about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds and has about a dozen ribs. Figure on at
least a pound of baby back ribs per person for an entree.
</P>
<P>
   Country-style ribs are cut from the shoulder or the blade end of
the loin, with each containing a small bone. Boneless country-style
spareribs are cut from the pork butt. Smoke, grill, roast or
braise. Allow half a pound per person if boneless, a little more
with bones. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEEF &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Beef back ribs (also known as beef spareribs) come from the rib
portion of the steer and are the most tender beef ribs for
grilling. Often beef back ribs are referred to as dinosaur bones or
long ribs. Smoke, grill or roast them. As an entree, allow six ribs
per person.
</P>
<P>
   Beef short ribs come from the rib, chuck or short plate
sections. They are rectangular in shape with alternating layers of
lean and fat. For the meat to be tender, hours of smoking or
braising over low heat is necessary. Figure a pound of short ribs
per person.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ribs you select, trim off all exterior fat before
cooking. To keep ribs from drying out, do not cut the sides or
racks of ribs into individual rib servings before grilling.
</P>
<P>
   For the best-tasting, juicy results, Carpenter and Sandison
suggest marinating the ribs in the fridge eight hours. However,
they add, you might get by with a quick five-minute marinade if you
baste them periodically with the marinade. Never brush any marinade
that has come in contact with the raw meat on ribs during the last
15 minutes of cooking time to be sure all the bacteria has been
killed. Additionally, if you want to accompany the finished ribs
with a marinade or sauce, be sure it has never come in contact with
the raw meat. If in doubt, simply whip up a new batch of sauce or
marinade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basting ribs is essential when grilling, oven roasting or
smoking ribs, as it keeps the meat moist and creates a thicker
coating on the ribs,'' advise Carpenter and Sandison, adding that
you can use dry rubs, marinades and slathers for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, flavor ribs with wood chips available at hardware
stores and supermarkets. Soak chips in cold water half an hour,
drain and scatter over charcoal or place on a sheet of foil on lava
rocks in one corner of a gas grill until they begin to smoke. Add
ribs, close the grill and let them cook.
</P>
<P>
   For general grilling information, see the story inside.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of rib recipe options follow. Peruse the various creations
and mix and match the parts of each recipe you like the best to
make a personal statement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BASIC BACK RIBS &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; This recipe is a starting point for rib cookery.

EX-FBI AGENT ASKS INMATE FOR HELP IN GARDNER PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In the latest twist in the attempt to solve the
world's costliest art heist, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
has recently hired a former top FBI agent who believes that an
imprisoned antiques dealer may hold the key for securing the return
of the artworks.
</P>
<P>
   According to letters obtained by the Globe, Larry A. Potts _ the
former head of the FBI's criminal division who was involved in the
bureau's disastrous siege at Ruby Ridge, Idaho _ was hired by the
museum in April. One of his first moves: a polite, respectful
letter to William P. Youngworth last month urging him to help crack
the case once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to me, as it is to those associated with the
museum, that you remain the key to bringing this to a successful
resolution,'' Potts wrote Youngworth. ``You have the capability,
with my help, to put this behind you and be a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Potts's words signal a break in the
nine-year-old case or an attempt to get Youngworth to talk by
appealing to his considerable ego. Potts did not return a phone
call and a museum spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In his reply last week, Youngworth, who is serving a two- to
three-year sentence in the state penitentiary in Shirley on
unrelated charges, agreed to help, but indicated that it wouldn't
come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would be delighted to help you and the Gardner Museum
recover their former property,'' Youngworth wrote on June 21.
``Kindly remit $50 million dollars U.S. and a signed immunity
agreement issued by the Attorney General of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, however, Youngworth had toned down his rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   He released a statement that praised the museum for hiring Potts
and for contacting him directly instead of through the federal
authorities, whom he grew to distrust during their 1997
negotiations. In the past, federal prosecutors and FBI agents were
openly doubtful that Youngworth actually had access to the stolen
paintings and felt he lacked credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from the fact of Mr. Potts' letter that I am
credible and can effectuate the artworks' return,'' Youngworth's
statement said. Still, Youngworth _ who is scheduled for a parole
hearing this summer _ would not say whether he intends to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Youngworth made headlines by contending that he
could solve the crime and secure the return of the 13 pieces of art
that were stolen from the museum in a daring, early-morning
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he was not involved in the March 18, 1990, theft
at the museum, Youngworth insisted he knew where the paintings were
and could broker their return through his contacts in the criminal
underworld.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Youngworth wanted a deal: the $5 million reward
posted by the museum and law enforcement's agreement to drop
pending criminal charges against him. He also demanded they release
his friend, Myles Connor Jr., a skilled art thief with a long
criminal record who was serving time in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the US attorney's office in Boston and state authorities
wouldn't meet Youngworth's demands They also suspected that Connor
may have known who was responsible for the Gardner heist.
</P>
<P>
   Youngworth then angrily charged that the impasse proved that law
enforcement hadn't placed a high enough priority on the artwork's
return.
</P>
<P>
   The talks with Youngworth broke down for good after the bureau
tested microscopic paint chips purportedly from either of two rare
Rembrandt paintings stolen in the heist. The results indicated that
the chips could not have come from either work.
</P>
<P>
   Youngworth later claimed that the chips might have been from a
Vermeer, which also had been stolen from the Gardner. Within
months, he was serving time for possession of a stolen car and
operating it without registration.
</P>
<P>
   Potts, who is vice president of Investigative Group
International Inc., a Washington-based private detective firm,
retired from the FBI in August 1997. His final two jobs with the
Bureau were as head of its criminal division and as second in
command of the its Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, he was placed on administrative leave for more
than a year while the Justice Department investigated his role in
the deadly siege at Ruby Ridge, which ended in the deaths of three
people, including the unarmed wife of white supremacist Randy
Weaver and US Marshall William F. Deegan of Quincy. No charges were
filed as a result of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9, Potts visited Youngworth in prison, but Youngworth
refused to meet with him, according to the letter Potts wrote to
Youngworth the following week. Potts explained that the museum had
hired him to work on the case and he was sensitive to Youngworth's
position.
</P>
<P>
   Potts did not specify why, considering Youngworth's credibility
problems with investigators, he and museum officials believe that
Youngworth is still central to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``While, as many people are quick to point out, there is some
discrepancy in the evidence concerning your knowledge of the
whereabouts of the stolen items, I believe there are a couple of
very strong indications that you have, or at least had at one time,
access to those paintings,'' Potts wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also states: ``I appreciate your need for assurance
that you will not be at risk by assisting in the return of the
stolen art from the Gardner Museum and I assume that you would have
other expectations as well, to include financial. There is a high
degree of probability that I can help you.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his good faith, Potts included a copy of a letter by
Anne Hawley, director of the Gardner Museum, confirming that Potts
had been hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, it has been almost ten years since the theft and
we are most anxious to do everything possible to obtain the return
of our treasures so they can again be part of the cultural life of
our city, nation and the world,'' Hawley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Investigative Group International is one of the country's most
prominent private investigative firms, specializing in sensitive
cases in both business and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by Terry Lenzner, a lawyer with Boston roots, the firm
has worked for the museum investigating the theft on and off since
1990. Since being brought into the case in April, Potts told
Youngworth, he had spent ``a considerable amount of time''
reviewing the case.

 Risks of heart valve woe greatly exaggerated  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid all the news about unsuspected health risks, here's the
opposite: a problem that's far smaller than experts thought.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people have been told they have a heart valve
problem called mitral valve prolapse, which puts them at risk of
stroke at an early age or a potentially fatal heart infection
called endocarditis. But two studies published in the current New
England Journal of Medicine show that the size and gravity of the
problem were vastly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, researchers have estimated that from 5 to
35 percent of adults have leaky mitral valves, a disorder that
allows blood to flow backward from the heart's main pumping chamber
to the left atrium, the chamber above it that collects newly
oxygenated blood from the lungs. Young women were thought to be
especially at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis has bred anxiety among otherwise healthy people,
who have been told they needed antibiotics to prevent heart
infections whenever they had dental procedures. Some have been
unable to get health insurance because of their presumed higher
risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the research shows that mitral valve prolapse affects only
about 2.4 percent of adults, half of whom may have a harmless
variant of normal valve function. The conclusion emerges from a
study of 3,500 middle-aged offspring of the original Framingham
Heart Study participants.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the disorder does not appear to be related to the risk
of stroke, according to a companion study of 213 Massachusetts
General Hospital patients who had strokes before age 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that mitral valve prolapse is a real disease
but it occurs far less commonly than previously thought,'' said Dr.
Robert A. Levine, an MGH cardiologist and coauthor of both papers.
``And we don't find any evidence of a stroke risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitral valve prolapse carries a risk of heart problems, but only
if the leakage is severe, which is true in a minority of cases.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been told they have mitral valve prolapse,
especially those informed more than about five years ago, should
ask their doctors if the diagnosis should be reevaluated, Levine
said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason earlier studies were mistaken, he said, is that
researchers assumed the mitral valve was supposed to be a flat disk
when it was shut. Newer imaging methods show that it's
saddle-shaped, like a Pringle's potato chip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Underage smokers fuel tax haul, report says &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Concern about teenage smoking over the past decade has led to
new prohibitions in all 50 states, a federal law requiring states
to enforce laws against underage smoking, and increases in state
and federal cigarette excise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not slowed sales to underage smokers. Tobacco
industry profits from illegal sales of cigarettes to minors have
more than doubled, according to a study published in the current
American Journal of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The industry reaped at least a half-billion dollars in profits
from illegal sales to youths under age 18, estimates Dr. Joseph R.
DiFranza of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and John
J. Librett of the Utah Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   They estimate that 16 percent of youths between ages 12 and 18,
or 3.8 million, smoked daily in 1997, accounting for nearly 4
percent of total US cigarette sales. That generated $431 million in
taxes, a 33 percent jump since 1988.

   DiFranza said that taxes derived from cigarette sales to
adolescents should be devoted to enforcing laws against selling
tobacco to minors and to antismoking education.

law,'' said the UMass family physician.

   Unusual food cravings, sometimes called pica, are usually a

an especially odd case.

   The 66-year-old woman had been eating up to 10 whole tomatoes a

   Marinella found the woman was severely anemic from the bleeding

was her tomato craving.

CIVIL WAR WAS WOMEN'S WORK, TOO

ALL THE DARING OF THE SOLDIER 
Women of the Civil War Armies 
By Elizabeth D. Leonard 
Norton, 368 pp., illustrated, $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The women who served in the Civil War armies were not only as
daring as the men, but, in historian Elizabeth D. Leonard's
accounts, had to be even more daring just to join up. And there
were more than a few such women. For beyond the hundreds who
``dressed as men, adopted male identities, and enlisted'' in the
Union and Confederate armies, there were scores more who served as
spies, an uncountable number who took up rifles in defense of their
homes and farms, and yet others who accompanied husbands into camp,
and sometimes into combat.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, a professor of history and director of women's studies
at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, touches in ``All the Daring
of the Soldier'' on the social issues facing women in the early
1860s and their aspirations beyond home, hearth, and nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, a New York farm girl who served
as ``Private Lyons Wakeman'' with Company H of the 153d New York
Volunteers from August 1862, her gender apparently undetected until
she died of acute chronic diarrhea in June 1864 after the battle of
Pleasant Hill, La.
</P>
<P>
   Wakeman had some formal education, Leonard writes, but was
working as a domestic servant when, at age 19 and with marriage
``not in the offing,'' she ``seems to have determined that assuming
the garb of a man would provide her with a wider range of
employment opportunities.'' She worked briefly as a boatman on New
York's Chenango Canal where she met some soldiers who encouraged
her to enlist, ``and so I did,'' she wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   She seems to have adjusted easily to a soldier's life, writing
that she slept ``as warm in the tents as I would in a good bed.''
After noting other details of army life, she added, ``I like to be
a soldier very well.'' And in another letter, Wakeman wrote that
she was ``enjoying myself better this summer than I ever did before
in this world. I have good clothing and enough to eat and nothing
to do, only to handle my gun and that I do as well as the rest of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She apparently never directly wrote about her masquerade,
although she did mention encountering one other woman who had, like
her, enlisted as a man, but whose sex had been detected. Her last
letter home provided details of the battle at Pleasant Hill, during
which she was ``under fire for about five hours and laid on the
field of battle all night.'' Barely two weeks later, she fell sick
and died shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that other women soldiers, like Wakeman, reported
encounters with still other women posing as men suggest that
Leonard is not far off in her estimate that ``between 500 and a
thousand women disguised themselves as men and enlisted as
full-fledged soldiers during the Civil War.'' From their accounts,
their experiences seem to have been so similar, even routine, that
they seem almost as unexceptional as those of women serving in the
military today.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptional stories are of the women who served as spies,
such as Confederate Belle Boyd, ``a precious rogue,'' as she was
described by one Union officer, and Pauline Cushman, who spied for
the Union and was described in a contemporary biography as having
``all the daring of the soldier.'' They were typically women of
``physical beauty and personal appeal'' _ which they used in the
course of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Of even more interest are women like Lucy Williams, the young
wife of a Confederate soldier, who had strong Union sympathies.
When the Confederate cavalry commander John Hunt Morgan spoke too
openly of plans to attack a nearby Union encampment while dining at
the home of Williams's mother-in-law, Williams duped him into
granting her a pass through the Confederate lines so that she could
return to her own home _ and even into lending her a horse. But
instead of heading home, Williams rode through the rain to the
Union camp where she exposed Morgan's plan of attack. She then
``reportedly led the federals via a winding secret route'' back to
the Confederate camp where ``they killed Morgan preemptively and
sent his troops in all directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard chose not to turn what is a lively account of women in
the Civil War into a broader and slower-paced study of the social
context and implications of their decisions, and of their actions.
She does attempt to provide a historical context, citing as models
the few women known to have served in the Continental Army during
the Revolution. But the documentation there is even more
speculative than that for the women of the Civil War, and the
social context unclear. Leonard might well have found the social
context that her story lacks among the young women from Waterville
and elsewhere who have entered military service for many of the
same reasons as Sarah Rosetta ``Private Lyons'' Wakeman: adventure
and a wider range of opportunities.

CARNIVAL CRUISE SHIP MAKES GALVESTON ITS HOME PORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As is often the case in Texas, bigger is better. Why do anything
any other way?
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Galveston landed not
just any cruise line but the world's largest to offer trips
year-round from its port. After almost eight years of negotiations,
the Port of Galveston lured Carnival Cruise Lines to its new cruise
pier.
</P>
<P>
   The Celebration, a Carnival SuperLiner, will begin its program
of five- and four-day cruises from Galveston in October 2000. No
other cruise line offers a regular sailing schedule from Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, big, big deal,'' says Diane Falcioni, cruise
promotion manager for the Port of Galveston. ``The timing was right
and the market is the right fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The market was ready, says Bob Warren, director of the Galveston
Island Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, with more than 4,000 hotel
rooms in place and a tourism business that already brings 7 million
visitors to the island annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnival brings us a much broader scope of sales and
tremendous exposure in the travel agent and tour operator arena,''
Warren says. ``We think this will dramatically improve our
out-of-state visitor business.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship carries 1,486 passengers and offers 72 cruises a year,
Warren says, adding that the 85,000 potential new visitors should
have a $21 million impact on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The five-day trips will feature stops at Playa del Carmen,
Cozumel and Cancun, Mexico, while the four-day voyages will skip
Cancun. The shorter cruises will sail from Thursday to Monday,
designed to appeal to long-weekend vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   Four-day cruises begin at $389 per person, based on double
occupancy; five-day sailings will start at $479 per person. Air
fare to Houston Hobby, about 40 minutes away, is extra, and Warren
says his office is already working on pre- and post-cruise packages
for vacationers who want to spend time in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Other visiting cruise ships have included the Stella Solaris,
which makes calls to Galveston from February to April; the Delta
Queen, a replica steamboat that visits from New Orleans during
Galveston's Dickens on the Strand celebration in December; and
RiverBarge Excursion Lines, which calls during early spring.

UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST HOPES FOR UPSWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HERMIONE MALONE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was once one of America's most prominent Christian
denominations, whose history stretches back to the Puritans and
Pilgrims and whose familiar white steeples are staples on New
England postcards.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past three decades, the United Church of Christ has
been in steady decline. From a highpoint of 2.1 million, the
mainline Protestant denomination's rolls have shrunk to 1.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Some church critics and scholars say the church's strong liberal
tilt, including its welcoming attitude toward gays, has turned off
members who are more interested in spiritual nourishment than in
political or social causes.
</P>
<P>
   As the denomination targeted particular issues such as poverty,
racism, or hunger, these critics say, some churches came to
resemble advocacy groups more than houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Against this sober backdrop, about 700 denominational leaders
and members are gathering in Providence, R.I. for a national
convention to grapple with issues that will shape the church's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the church's direction in recent years, social and
economic concerns will dominate the agenda, including international
debt forgiveness, the downside of welfare reform, and teen suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some folk the UCC represents a kind of liberal
Christianity to which they can relate,'' said the Reverend Bennie
E. Whiten Jr., president of the Massachusetts Conference of the
United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Whiten and others are hopeful that the denomination's fortunes
can be reversed and are heartened by some signs that the membership
drain is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   But the church will not likely experience the same kind of
success it enjoyed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Like other mainline Protestant denominations, the church was a
major player on the American religious landscape, lending its moral
pulpit and its Christian values to the struggle for civil rights
and the movement against the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But along with other mainstream Christian groups, its influence
has been eclipsed, at least in the political arena, in recent years
by conservative Christian denominations who seized the spotlight on
issues ranging from abortion to family values.
</P>
<P>
   Some United Church of Christ members have voted with their feet,
leaving denominational churches for evangelical congregations that
emphasize more purely religious themes such as salvation and a
personal relationship with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the recent downturn, there are signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, after losing members for several years, the
state's 433 UCC churches are actually starting to see their
membership rise. More than 2,000 people have joined Bay State
congregations in the past two years, bringing the denomination's
statewide membership to nearly 105,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``After many years of decline, that's very encouraging for us,''
Whiten said.
</P>
<P>
   And state church officials say it's precisely the UCC's liberal
views that are fueling the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are looking for churches that are run
democratically, that do ordain women, that do listen to the
laypeople,'' said the Reverend Donald Whitcomb, pastor of First
Congregational Church in Paxton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Mathers of Leverett, Mass. is one of those who has
returned to the United Church of Christ after years of being an
inactive member, bringing her husband and young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my first thoughts sitting in that church was this
church needs me,'' said Mathers of the First Congregational Church
in Leverett.
</P>
<P>
   After her 5-year-old son Ryan was born, Mathers said she and her
husband both felt it important that he be exposed to church. What
began as a plan to visit several churches and stay where she felt
most welcomed ended with the first church on her list _ First
Congregational.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, it seemed like a dying church. It has really come
back and it's because of the congregation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's convention, the Massachusetts delegation will try
to push a resolution on welfare reform. Whiten wants churches to
look at what is happening to people whose welfare benefits have
expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they caught in a kind of limbo between a job that doesn't
pay benefits and leaves them with lots of issues as far as their
children are concerned?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the UCC, which is a product of the merging of
the Congregational Christian Church and the Evangelical and
Reformed Church, has fought prison expansion in the United States
and apartheid in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It has also advocated for the acceptance of homosexuals,
bisexuals, and transgendered people as members in the
denomination's churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the UCC indicates that it will always be on the
forefront of social issues, that it will be a denomination that is
not afraid to face the issues of the day,'' Whitcomb said.
</P>
<P>
   UCC officials maintain that the social and economic issues the
church tackles are quite spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these are based on a very strong theology and often
they cite biblical passages,'' said William C. Winslow, a church
spokesman. ``They all come out of a sense of justice, which is what
Jesus was calling for.''

PASTORS LOSING SACRED GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Connecticut clergy buried a priest, and then used holy water
to purify the church where he was slain, their ancient ceremonies
symbolized a modern truth: Churches are not sanctuaries anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of the parish pastor, beaten to death last week with
a candle-holder allegedly wielded by a delusional man who bought a
newspaper ad seeking the Virgin Mary's aid, was a senseless act
that supports no clear pattern of violence against the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   But theologians, academicians, and clerics say that the Bristol,
Conn., murder of the Rev. Robert J. Lysz underscores troubling
tensions between ministering to life's less fortunate _ including
those deeply troubled _ and the need to take care when dealing with
the potentially violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clergy have to become more street-smart and many of them
have,'' said the Rev. Robert Friday, who teaches moral theology at
Catholic University. ``It's the kind of thing that has, at times,
moved some Catholic clergy to remove their Roman collars when they
travel because you can attract people you don't want to attract in
an airport or at a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too bad. But you just don't know today.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Monsignor Francis Scollen of St. Peter's Church in
Worcester put it: ``It's a fine line. You don't want to exclude
people. But you don't want to get knocked on the head either.''
</P>
<P>
   Scollen said he feared that might happen to him two months ago,
when he met a man in his church parking lot in an encounter
frighteningly similar to the murderous sequence described by police
in Connecticut last week.
</P>
<P>
   Scollen said he was approached by a 6-foot-5 man who wanted to
sleep in the rectory that night, noting all its empty rooms and his
homelessness. When the priest suggested a shelter, the man, who was
not cogent, angrily refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I had to go to a wake and he said, `Forget the
wake. That person's dead. And I'm here and I want to stay at the
rectory.' I finally talked him out of it,'' Scollen said.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of quick thinking and fast talking apparently did not
work with the 32-year-old drifter who allegedly bludgeoned Lysz,
50, to death June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Ouellette, the ex-Marine who has been charged with
the murder, told police he asked the priest for permission to sleep
in the church but was told instead to go to a homeless shelter.
Ouellette hid in bushes and followed Lysz into St. Matthew Church
several hours later, police said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a struggle. Ouellette struck the priest on the head
with a heavy candlestick ``three or four times,'' dragged the body
behind a pew, dressed himself in Lysz's clerical garb, and then
went to sleep in the rectory, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Ouellette, who was baptized and received his
Holy Communion at St. Matthew before he moved away, was being
treated for a psychiatric condition called bipolar disorder and had
become obsessed with religion.
</P>
<P>
   As efforts to treat the mentally ill have moved increasingly
away from walled-off institutions, specialists say those with
delusions sometimes seek counseling and solace from priests and
ministers, who often lack the training to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the cutback in mental health care, the church is
certainly a place where people go to for a recourse,'' said Dr.
Nancy Kehoe, a psychologist and a Roman Catholic nun who has
organized monthly sessions for religious and mental-health
professionals in Cambridge. ``The clergy traditionally has not been
trained or has been minimally trained in psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop the rectory doorbells from ringing, said
the Rev. Jorge Reyes, a priest at St. Mary's Church in Lawrence,
Mass., who one day found himself sitting across his desk from a
visitor who said he heard the devil's voice in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started going into a rage,'' Reyes said. ``He was flopping
on the floor, hitting himself, and I was wrestling him on the
floor. I thought he was going to hurt me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to deal with. You feel in some way you can
help. They come in and they want God or for us to pray for them,
and they think they're going to be healed. At the same time,
they're suffering from a mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Such encounters and the acts of criminals have changed the way
churches operate. After microphones, candlesticks, and other church
property began to disappear with regularity several years ago, many
churches locked their doors. Church alarm systems are commonplace.
Steel bars obscure many stained-glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeffrey L. Brown, pastor of Union Baptist Church in
Cambridge, Mass., said that if he encounters a parishioner who
needs mental-health professionals he is quick to refer them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the pastor or the priest know where that
fine line is drawn between spirituality and psychology _ where they
intersect and where they diverge,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor William C. Francis, pastor of Holy Family Church in
Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, said his church has turned its
basement into a shelter run by the Pine Street Inn _ a move he
called the greatest security system possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people around all the time,'' Francis said. ``If
you're going to worry about it, you don't belong here. That guy in
Connecticut was just unstable. He would have killed that poor
priest whether he was a priest, a rabbi, or a minister. There are
crazies all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Peter's, Scollen said his doors are locked, his grounds
are well lighted, and the parish hands out bus tickets and food _
but never cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``A church is sometimes the only place that will take these
people,'' Scollen said. ``It can be scary. But on the other hand,
if you become afraid, you can't work in a place like this. If I
ever got to a place where I was afraid, I'd leave. I have no fear,
but I am cautious. The lights are on. The doors are locked.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold I. Schwartz, a psychiatrist and the director of the
Institute of Living in Hartford, Conn., said it is not uncommon for
people afflicted by bipolar disorder or schizophrenia to become
hyper-religious or suffer from religious delusions.
</P>
<P>
   They may believe they are Jesus Christ. They may recite the
Bible on street corners. There often is an acute sense of
grandiosity that may lead them to believe they are God's only true
representative on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely, he said, do people who suffer from the disease such
as the one that afflicts Ouellette become dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to jump to the notion that this person who looks a
little odd is to be feared,'' Schwartz said. ``It would be a
terrible misperception if people were to come away with that
impression. But there is a subset of people who don't get adequate
treatment or are not taking their medication who can become
violent.''

DESPITE APATHY, NEWSPAPER SALE IS HIGH STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Maine's Portland Press Herald was up for sale last year,
nervous employees tried to purchase the paper and concerned
citizens formed a lobbying group to ensure that it would be sold to
a benevolent independent owner.
</P>
<P>
   No such outpouring of interest has greeted the news that the
Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette (T&AMP;G), with roots that go back 115
years, is on the auction block after parent company Chronicle
Publishing's recent decision to sell its media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that after you've changed hands once, (another sale)
doesn't have the overbearing specter it had the first time,'' says
publisher Bruce Bennett, referring to the T&AMP;G's transfer to the San
Francisco-based Chronicle Publishing in 1986. Former mayor and
local radio show host Jordan Levy says, ``I haven't had a single
solitary caller talk about,'' the sale. Inside the paper ``people
are just going about in their summer haze,'' says T&AMP;G reporter
Chris Pope. ``The operative word is fatalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the prospect of new T&AMP;G owners has not stirred Worcester
out of its dog-day doldrums, the battle for control of a monopoly
daily newspaper (107,405 weekday circulation, 134,067 on Sunday) in
New England's second largest city (population: 162,000) could
become a high-stakes chess match between some very powerful media
companies. With analysts setting the price tag in the
quarter-billion range, possible buyers run the gamut from MediaNews
Group to The New York Times Company (which also owns The Boston
Globe) to Fidelity's Community Newspaper Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some names we've heard who are little better than
bandits and there are those who are widely respected in the
industry,'' says Tim Schick, administrator of the Providence
Newspaper Guild, the T&AMP;G's editorial union.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, one thing seems certain. As Bennett puts it:
``It's a wide open game.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale, expected by early next year, is part of the
divestiture of Chronicle Publishing's three television stations,
two book publishing companies, one cable news outlet, one Web site,
and three newspapers _ the T&AMP;G, The Pantagraph in Bloomington,
Ill., and the flagship San Francisco Chronicle. Observers believe
the empire will be parceled off in pieces and estimates of its
value have ranged as high as $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Three industry sources put the T&AMP;G sale price in the $200-$300
million range, proving that even in the era of new media and
declining circulation, papers in major markets can fetch a pretty
penny. Newspapers ``make a lot of money,'' says media analyst John
Morton, noting that the average profit margin for publicly
reporting newspaper companies was a robust 20 percent last year.
Papers are ``still a huge presence, particularly in the local
advertising market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healthy market,'' adds Chronicle Publishing spokesman
Don Solem. ``The predicted tanking of all media for the sake of the
Internet did not occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the question isn't who is interested in the Chronicle
sale. It's (itals)who isn't interested.(unitals) According to news
reports and the rumor mill, Gannett, Hollinger, Knight-Ridder,
Journal Register, The New York Times, A.H. Belo, Times-Mirror, and
Hearst are among the conceivable contenders for one or more of the
papers. (Hearst _ which owns the San Francisco Examiner that shares
a joint operating agreement with the Chronicle _ has the right of
first refusal on the Chronicle.) These corporations declined to
comment on any acquisition plans. But two other companies seem to
have thrown their hat in the ring for the T&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elfers, chairman of the Community Newspaper Company that
owns scores of area weeklies and The Metrowest Daily News, says he
is ``definitely'' eyeing the T&AMP;G. ``Worcester is an extraordinarily
attractive franchise.'' According to a story in the June 17 T&AMP;G,
Bennett sent a memo to employees indicating that MediaNews Group
has expressed a clear interest in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   In this cost-conscious world of regional newspaper
``clustering,'' a number of potential contenders already have New
England publications. But the king of clustering is MediaNews
Group's controversial president William Dean Singleton, who owns
about 50 dailies including the Fitchburg Sentinel &AMP; Enterprise,
North Adams Transcript, The (Lowell) Sun, and The Berkshire Eagle.
Famous for cost-cutting and layoffs, Singleton is a name that
invariably creates newsroom jitters. Last year's grass-roots effort
to keep the Portland Press Herald in friendly hands was aimed at
fending off more bottom line-oriented buyers like Singleton,
Gannett, and Journal Register. To the city's relief, the paper was
bought by the Seattle Times Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope in the newsroom is that The New York Times . . . will
be a serious contender and block any sale to Singleton,'' noted
Worcester Magazine political editor Martha Akstin in a recent
column.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it's Billy Dean's to lose,'' says Dave Cole,
publisher of the News Inc. media newsletter. ``He's building
clusters (in Massachusetts) and he likes New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever emerges will acquire a paper that is considered adequate
but not great and that is often criticized for being too
conservative for its lunch-bucket Democratic readers and too
closely aligned with the city's business elite. But its local
dominance and power is indisputable.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester market is a ``wholly owned subsidiary of the
T&AMP;G,'' says McCormack Institute senior fellow Lou DiNatale, a harsh
critic of the paper. ``It had a great captured market that it
regularly abused.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new publisher,'' he adds, ``can't do anything but help.''

SMART WATERING CRUCIAL IN DRY SPELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watering becomes the number one concern of good gardeners during
the hot months of July and August. But this year summer came early,
with searing temperatures and a record-breaking five weeks in May
and June without measurable rain. And this was after the driest
April on record.
</P>
<P>
   As we enter the first drought since 1995, smart watering becomes
critical.
</P>
<P>
   If your city or town has not yet enacted water restrictions,
water everything to beat the ban. In other words, try to give
everything a long deep drink before it becomes illegal to do so,
especially shrubs and trees. This includes the city trees on the
sidewalk strip in front of your house, though you don't technically
own them. (Lack of watering, not pollution, is the biggest killer
of young street trees.)
</P>
<P>
   Take your sprinklers and start circulating them around your
yard, setting them in each spot for about three hours. It takes me
about a week to cover my entire yard once. Then I start over again.
The goal is one inch of water applied once a week.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to water is the morning, when the sun will dry
leaves to prevent fungus growth without evaporating most of the
moisture you're delivering to the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Most people water wrong. They turn on a hose or sprinkler system
for a few minutes several times a week, wetting only the top of the
ground and encouraging shallow roots that get scorched by the heat
near the soil's surface when that water evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   Drought-resistant plants have deep roots. To get roots to go
deep, you need to get the water down deep, too.
</P>
<P>
   There, insulated from heat by a few inches of soil, water can be
stored in the ground. Think of watering as refilling the reservoir
of moisture in the soil, rather than wetting its surface. It
doesn't matter if the top of the ground is wet or dry. What's
important is that when you stick your finger an inch deep in the
soil, it's moist down below.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuna can method
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The low-tech way to ensure this is called the ``tuna can
method.'' Put an (empty!) tuna can under your sprinkler and keep
watering until it's full.
</P>
<P>
   If you see runoff, you're watering faster than the ground can
absorb. Leave that spot for a while and then come back to it.
</P>
<P>
   How do you prioritize if you can't water everything? The answer
is counterintuitive. Let your lawn go brown, but keep watering your
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawn that isn't watered looks like it's dying, but it isn't.
It's just going dormant and will revive in the fall, when rain and
cooler temperatures arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But valuable trees that aren't watered will look OK, when in
fact they could die. It works like this. Trees stressed by drought
will soldier on, perhaps only losing their leaves earlier in the
fall without much color change. Leaves just go from green to brown
instead of red and gold, and the tourists are put out.
</P>
<P>
   But often the effects of drought will not be felt until next
year, when the weakened trees start to succumb to pests and
diseases they would otherwise have been able to fight off. Watering
is especially vital to trees fighting off pandemics now, such as
dogwoods, ashes, hemlocks, and many kinds of maples.
</P>
<P>
   If your community has a watering ban and only allows, for
instance, hand watering with a hose or watering can, your triage
becomes more ruthless. My favorite tool for hand watering is a
Walkman and a book-on-tape, because you have to stand there a long
time to do deep watering over a large area with a hose. Keep the
nozzle moving so that the water has a chance to sink in without
runoff; water only in the mornings and evenings, when less water
evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milk jug strategy
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're reduced to using a watering can, take plastic gallon
milk jugs, cut off the bottoms, and punch small holes into the
sides. Then dig them upside down into the ground next to your most
precious plants, like your tomatoes, and fill them with water that
will slowly leak into the soil depths you're trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Plants growing in containers are exceptions to the once-a-week
watering rule, as their roots experience evaporation on all sides.
They need daily watering, with a watering can or hose. Polymers
such as Water Grabber that are soaked in water and then mixed with
your potting soil will reducing watering chores.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, lay off the fertilizers. Plants stressed by drought
don't need chemicals forcing them to put out extra growth, any more
than someone suffering heatstroke needs to be entered in a
marathon. In hot weather, fertilizer can act more like a poison
pill than a vitamin.

AT THE BEACH, IT'S LIGHT HOUSEKEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE HATFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN, Mass. _ If you fall off the deck of the home of
Richard DiFrummolo and Donald Winter here, you could drown. At low
tide, you'll still get wet. Set as it is inside the first knuckle
of the hand that is the narrow tip of the arm that is Cape Cod, the
house is so close to being in, and not on, Provincetown Harbor that
you couldjust as well be sailing when you're in the living room,
for all the sea ambience. To describe it as waterfront property
does not do justice to the feel, the smell, and the sight of the
ocean onto which this house opens so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the wood deck, filled with potted flowers and metal
sculpture from local artists, DiFrummolo points out the new
Provincetown-to-Boston high-speed ferry wending its way toward the
Long Point lighthouse and out toward open ocean and says, ``It
gives us a lot of joy and pleasure to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   When you enter the home, the light from the sunlit water floods
the living room and kitchen/dining area, which make up the entire
first floor. Everything, from the bleached pine floors to the
burlap walls and painted wood ceiling, is white, with touches of
sea blue. Some of the blue is in the plaid fabric on chairs, and
some is on the art on the wall, and the rest is from the blue of
the water, seen from every angle, which seems to match every blue
in the house. The entire front wall of the house consists of
floor-to-ceiling French doors, painted white. In front of them, a
small porch gives onto the sizable deck, which can be reached by
stairs on either side of the porch.
</P>
<P>
   This might be a standard, if wonderful, blue-and-white beach
house, were it not for the dramatic pieces of art everywhere,
inside and out. There are paintings by noted Provincetown artists
such as Paul Risika and his student Chet Jones; a
Michelangelo-style bronze torso made from old car parts by Judith
Browne; in the living room, works by Anne Packard and Dimitri
Hadzi; on the deck, a sculpture by Dan McNeil; and, perched on the
pilings just off the deck, a sea gull made from fenders by Jack
Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   Their art-filled home hints at the avocation of this talented
pair, and at their art-related philanthropic activities. These two
are on personal first-name terms with most of the well-known
artists represented throughout their home. Winter, who is in
semiretirement as a partner at Palmer &AMP; Dodge LLP, is a trustee of
the Provincetown Art Association and Museum. DiFrummolo for many
years owned a Boston antique shop called Upstairs Downstairs, and
Winter is an adviser to the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center,
which provides a residence program for 10 artists and authors to
live and work here during the quiet winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the two gave a party in this home to benefit the work
center, hosting Sebastian Junger, the author of ``The Perfect
Storm,'' as their celebrity guest. ``We practically had a perfect
storm during the party, too,'' Winter says with a laugh _ but,
DiFrummolo adds, the storms are just as wonderful to view from this
house as the sunny times. This summer, they will host author
Michael Cunningham, whose 1998 novel, ``The Hours,'' was published
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are on the board of the Provincetown Repertory Theatre,
and last summer they hosted a large benefit party with an all-white
theme. There were too many guests for them to hold the event at
home, so it took place on the hilltop outside the Pilgrim Monument,
within walking distance, under a white tent with hundreds of white
lights, and everyone wore white. They are already at work on this
year's benefit, which will be a masked ball on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love giving back,'' notes DiFrummolo of their many
charitable works. He calls Winter, who was at one time chairman of
the Back Bay Architectural Commission, ``a frustrated architect''
who was only too eager to help redesign and reconfigure the
worn-down house when they bought it in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renovating ``a wreck''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When they bought the gray-shingled little home, which they call
The Beach Box because of its foursquare shape and style, it was, in
Winter's words, ``a wreck.'' But, says DiFrummolo, ``we knew the
area well _ Donald had owned two cottages nearby and I had owned
two houses in the east end of town, and we had had our eyes on the
property, hoping it would someday be for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when it came on the market, Winter said, they bought it
from a broker over the telephone from Boston without seeing the
inside. ``The bones were good,'' says Winter, ``and the size was
right and the layout was good. As far as its condition, we expected
it to be a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Their expectations were met big time. The house came furnished,
with ugly '50s furniture and smallish '50s picture windows on the
wall facing the sea. It was dark, and the plumbing was in very bad
shape. The couple, who have, in Winter's words, ``l'embarras du
choix,'' which includes homes in the South End of Boston and also
in Woodstock, Vt., decided, upon seeing the interior, to spend the
first two summers after buying the house away from it, thinking
about it, and renting it out, furnished as it was, while they fled
to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman who rented the house said afterward, `You gentlemen
should be ashamed of yourselves,' while telling us about the shower
that leaked through the floor below, so we hired a contractor,''
DiFrummolo says. ``First, he was to reshingle the gray exterior of
the house and to reshingle and put a new peak on the roof, and redo
the porch and deck.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter picks up the story. ``Because of the expense, we told the
contractor to work just on the outside of the house at first,
figuring that we could continue on the inside at a later date,'' he
recalls. ``Due to a misunderstanding, when we came back to the
house in summer, we discovered that he had gutted the entire
house!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the spots where the hoppers had been,'' DiFrummolo
adds, ``there were just holes.''
</P>
<P>
   They gritted their teeth and started then to remake the entire
house. That included turning the gutted second-story space into
three small bedrooms and two baths, and the ugly little dank '50s
cellar, which is on the level of the deck, into a beachside cabana,
with a bar and a couch filled with comfortable pillows. The
stairway from bedrooms to first floor was reconfigured so that it
goes two separate ways at the bottom, ``to catch a glimpse of the
sea'' explains DiFrummolo _ even when you're heading toward the
kitchen, which is at the back of the house and looks out on the
quiet one-way residential street nearby. There is practically no
yard, which is typical of property in this beach town. The few feet
on either side of the house, between its neighbor house on one side
and a small restaurant on the other, are planted with rugosa roses,
clematis, and other flora, but no labor-intensive grass. The front
yard is essentially liquid, and to use it even more, the couple has
a Chris Craft boat, called the Beach Bucket, moored near the deck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the furnishings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiFrummolo's training as an antiques dealer served him as
collector of the home's furnishings, a mixture of antiques, white
wicker, and contemporary couches and glass tables. He bought some
old chests, which he then had a friend, the late Romolo del Deo,
decorate and paint with a blue wash for the bedrooms, which are
carpeted in natural-colored sisal, the only carpeting in the home.
In the master bath, he decided to use the same white, brick-shaped
tiles as are used in the Paris Metro because, he said, ``they have
a wonderful three-dimensional architectural element'' of light and
shadow. When they saw the leftover painted white burlap that was
used on the walls, the men thought it might make interesting
valances, and there they are: stiff, white-painted valances draped
over the side windows, looking on closer inspection more like
pieces of art than curtains.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered among the valuable artwork are found pieces of no
specific value, such as a piece of interesting driftwood that a
guest brought up from the water. It is hung next to the
better-known pieces, in a whimsical sense of democratic integration
that the men say causes some interesting comments from unsuspecting
visitors, who view it as critically as all the rest of the works.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the house are pieces from DiFrummolo's collection of
periwinkle-blue Richard Robinson Ransbottom pottery from Ohio. On a
cozy window seat in the kitchen next to the stove is the same blue
plaid fabric as on the cushions of the living room's wicker
furniture, but this cushion has been laminated to protect it from
cooking spills. Also in the kitchen is the 50th birthday present
given to DiFrummolo by Winter and his three sons from a former
marriage. It is a narrow, vertical painting called ``Takeout
Boxes,'' a picture of white Chinese food cartons stacked on top of
each other, painted by Peter Palumbon. ``Those boys,'' says
DiFrummolo of the young Winters _ Andrew, 33, Matthew, 31, and
Tony, 27 _ ``are my family, too, we are so close.''
</P>
<P>
   As he speaks, the sound of bagpipes can be heard from the water.
A nearby resident often plays them at sunset, DiFrummolo notes, and
once in a while, at low tide, the couple also see horseback riders
riding bareback across the wet sand in front of their house. This
summer, Winter commutes back to his city job for three days at
midweek. Next year, he looks forward to living here full time from
May to September. After that, he says, ``Every fall, we have to go
to the Vermont house; it's so beautiful in October.'' It also
houses a whole different set of artwork, from Vermont artists who
live near that home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the December house, too, with all the children there,''
DiFrummolo adds. ``That's definitely the Christmas house.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is definitely the beach house.

FIRST LINES OF DEFENSE IN THE GREAT BUG WARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eek, an ant!
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how just a few ants can send a homeowner into a
tizzy, mainly because he or she doesn't know what kind they are
(maybe they're carpenter ants!), or what to do about them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the homeowner reports seeing one or two ants a day.
The ``cure'' is to sweep them up and throw them away.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the infestation is major, with dozens of ants
skittering here and there, and sometimes those ants are huge ( 1/2
inch and bigger), which may indicate they are indeed, carpenters,
and major action must be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Ants are just one of the pests that invade houses in spring and
summer, adding to the homeowner's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Other insects that can be a problem in the house are roaches,
which have been around, virtually unchanged, for 400 million years.
Honest. That indicates how well they can survive. Termites are
another pest. Even honeybees can invade the house, but rarely do.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors, problem pests are wasps and carpenter bees.
</P>
<P>
   To meet these menaces, major or minor, the Raid Center for
Insect Control, a branch of S.C. Johnson Co., makers of Raid and
Pledge among others, has launched a campaign called ``Don't get
mad, get even!''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign suggests using Raid products, but that is not
always necessary. Other ways may be just as effective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ants
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with ants.
</P>
<P>
   There are several types that invade houses; some are common all
over the country, others are in specific areas. As a rule, they are
harmless, and the invasion is a matter of aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions to these harmless invaders are carpenter ants and
fire ants (in the South).
</P>
<P>
   What to do about them?
</P>
<P>
   Little ants come into the house for warmth, moisture, and food.
The first line of defense is to keep food off floors, counter tops,
and other areas where ants will make a beeline to the food. Quick
cleanup and proper storage of food will help a great deal. Regular
cleaning of counter tops and other surfaces will also help. Ants
will eat almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Also helpful is to caulk cracks, holes, and other places where
you see ants coming from. It is not easy to build barriers against
ants, especially in old houses, but it is possible. You can have a
wonderful time caulking with a caulking gun.
</P>
<P>
   One good thing about these small ants is that most nest
outdoors. And many eat other insects, making them beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   For a severe ant invasion, a quick wipeup with a
detergent-loaded sponge will kill large numbers. Or squirt a
teaspoon of liquid detergent or soap into a quart-sized spray
bottle, fill with water, and spray the critters, wiping up with a
wet sponge.
</P>
<P>
   You can use a pyrethrum spray for severe infestations, but this
handyman recommends against spraying indoors if you can help it.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the ants at bay, put down ant baits, commonly called ant
cups. Use as many as practicable, and put them in cabinets, under
stoves and refrigerators, and other areas, but keep them away from
people and pets, and do not put them where food and dishes are
stored.
</P>
<P>
   A good insecticide is boric acid that comes in dust and spray
form. Apply it to baseboards and other areas where you suspect the
ants. Very little is needed to be effective. Boric acid is toxic;
do not breathe the dust. When applying dust, wear a mask and
goggles to protect eyes and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter ants
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If your house invaders are carpenter ants, you have to do
something different.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter ants are very large, but the only way to identify them
is by an entomologist or an exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   One way to detect carpenter ants is to check the house; do a
Cook's tour of the house, from basement to attic, looking for
little piles of dirty sawdust. Carpenter ants do not eat wood, as
termites do, but rather shovel it out of the nest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you put your ear to the wall near where you found
the sawdust, you may hear a rustling sound _ the sound of those
busy ants at work.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, call an exterminator. An exterminator should
locate and destroy the nest, and the queen with it. Carpenter ants
tend to nest in damp, punky, decaying wood, so the nest may not be
that difficult to locate. In addition, all damp, punky wood should
be replaced with sound wood. And, of course, fix any leaks that
caused the decay in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cockroaches
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's an old saying: It's not a disgrace if you get
cockroaches, only if you keep them.
</P>
<P>
   Roaches usually come into a house on the groceries. Once in the
house, they can proliferate if nothing is done. Most common roaches
in this country are the German cockroach, which is small ( 1/2
inch) and repulsive, and the Amrican roach, which is large (up to 1
3/4 inches) and repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a single-family house, there are ways to get rid
of roaches, and keep rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment buildings and other multi-unit buildings present a
special problem: You can get rid of your roaches, but if your
neighbor does not bother, the roaches will migrate from his place
to yours in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Repulsiveness is one thing, but a health hazard is another.
Cockroaches carry diseases, and also can cause asthma in city
children.
</P>
<P>
   Defenses against roaches are similar to those against ants. Keep
all surfaces free of food. Wipe spills quickly. Sanitation is the
key word.
</P>
<P>
   Several sprays are available for roaches, and boric acid,
applied as it is for ants, will be effective. But it is a
never-ending battle, especially if your unit is in an apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   As with ants, caulk up a storm to keep the critters out.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, a vacuum cleaner or shop vac is great for pulling
roaches from their hiding places. Use the open hose to pull them
from under stove and refrigerator. Use the wand to suck roaches out
of crevices and small openings. Fill the vac bag, tie it, and
dispose of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of bait stations you can buy. Place these
carefully around the house, especially in kitchen and bathroom.
Again, keep these stations away from kids and other human beings
and pets.

   Wasps and hornets

</P>
<P>
   Vespa is the genus of wasps and hornets, which many persons
often mistake for bees, genus Apis.
</P>
<P>
   Wasps and hornets are beneficial insects, feasting on many other
insects and also pollinating plants. They almost always stay
outdoors, rarely going indoors, and usually don't sting unless
provoked.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with wasps and hornets is that about 1 percent
of the population is allergic to their stings, resulting in a
severe reaction or death. Many persons know they are allergic, and
take proper precuations, but others may not know they are allergic.
So, in any case, wasp and hornet control should be left to the
pros.
</P>
<P>
   The most common wasps and hornets are the paper wasps, the ones
that build paper nests shaped like footballs; hornets or yellow
jackets, which nest outdoors; and mud daubers, which nest in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Paper wasps build their nests outdoors, but sometimes nest in
attics, where they are likely to get into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a wasp's nest is best left alone, if it is far enough
away from the house and away from kids and other yard denizens. A
nest in the attic can be left alone, too, if wasps are not in the
living space.
</P>
<P>
   Leave mud daubers or ground-nesting wasps alone, too, unless
their nests are close to the house.
</P>
<P>
   While it is best to have a professional deal with wasps and
their nests, the Raid Center for Insect Control makes a spray for
shooting down nests and colonies when necessary, usually when the
nest is over the front or back entry or in a nearby shrub or tree.
</P>
<P>
   The insecticide is in an aerosol can that shoots a stream some
20 feet, making it a little safer to attack the nest. Do so in the
cool of the evening, when the insects are less active and most are
in the nest. Try to hit the opening, but map out an escape route to
safety in the house after firing a burst, because survivors will
chase you with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   A similar treatment can handle ground-nesting wasps. Be sure in
all cases to wear as much protective clothing as possible and make
sure that the escape route is unobstructed. If you can see where
the wasps are coming out of the ground, you might be able to close
the opening after hitting it with the insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow jackets sometimes nest in small openings in the house.
Plugging those or making proper repairs will keep them out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bees, too
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of beelines (they are never straight, you might
notice), bees (Apis) are rarely a problem, because they generally
mind their own business. Even bumblebees are more scary than
hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Honeybees are beneficial, making great honey and pollinating
plants, and very rarely build hives in a house wall. If they do,
you will have a whole wall full of honey, and often the hive is so
big and bulging that it will push the wall inward or outward. If
that happens, call a beekeeper, who will remove the hive, its
queen, and thousand of bees who must be relocated. Then rebuild the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   The only bee that is a nuisance more than a menace is the
carpenter bee, which drills a hole in wood siding and trim, turning
a corner and depositing eggs in the drilled tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   If you are plagued with such critters and their holes, you can
spray insecticide in the hole and plug it with a piece of glazing
compund or pliable putty.
</P>
<P>
   We won't talk much about termites because termite treatment is
best done by professionals. If you have termites or think you have,
call an exterminator. Most do-it-yourself termite treatments are
not very effective, and since subterranean termites nest in the
ground, not in the house, they are relatively easily treated.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to keep termites away is to keep any wood off the
ground; there should be at least eight inches between wood
structural members and the ground.

ends; crease to form triangle and fold each end over several times
toward packet, pressing tightly to seal. Place packets on grid over
low to medium coals. (To check temperature, cautiously hold hand
about 4 inches above coals. Low to medium coals will force removal
of hand in 4 to 5 seconds.)
</P>
<P>
   Grill 2 hours or until tender, turning packets over every 1/2
hour. Remove ribs from packets and place on grid. Continue grilling
10 to 20 minutes, turning once. Brush sauce over ribs; continue

THE VIPS WE TAKE FOR GRANTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does a life-changing experience look like? At our
Unitarian-Universalist Church in Marblehead the other Sunday, my
friend Jim gave this account of an event that happened 32 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Having left the military to move into the field of
organizational development, Jim was required to participate in a
two-week training program with the National Training Labs,
participating in long daily sessions with almost no agenda except
that the trainees share their feelings, respond authentically, give
honest feedback to others, learn to really listen, and, by focusing
upon relationships within the group, come to understand group
dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   At first Jim found the process ``weird,'' but a few days into
the program he noticed something unfamiliar happening to him. Used
to communicating about issues, he'd never been comfortable talking
to others without an agenda. Now he found himself wanting to engage
people in personal conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Friday,'' he recalls, ``I was really tuning in to people.
It was like a window had opened and I could see, for the first
time, the seductions, the competition, the reaching out _ how open
some people were and how closed others were. It was like coming out
of a sleep and beginning to function on a level I had never before
experienced. It was clear that my normal state to that point was
pretty unconscious. I had been functioning on the surface and now I
was going much deeper, like going from black and white to
Technicolor to 3-D. There was so much going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Jim's wife came to visit, bringing their
18-month-old son. When Judy drove up, Jim went out to her car.
After they kissed, she flipped on the inside light, and there was
his son John, standing in a playpen in the back of their wagon,
peering at his dad over the railing.
</P>
<P>
   As a dad, Jim had occasionally spooned food into John's tiny
mouth, wiped drool off John's damp chin, tucked blankets around
John's sleeping form. This encounter was surprisingly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was my son,'' Jim says. ``His eyes shone with pure
happiness to see me. This was not a partially formed human being,
but a fully formed person, with all the emotional equipment fully
functioning. I met my son for the first time. And he was responding
immediately, instantaneously, fully. I thought I was going to drop
in my tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, Jim and Judy spent time with other members
of the group. Jim figured his socially-competent-enough wife could
hold her own with strangers, but he had totally underestimated her.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my amazement,'' he continues, ``Judy was right there, open,
present, getting all the nuances, the stuff that was going on, and
forming relationships. Here I had come this great distance and she
was already there. I could hardly believe it. Before this evening I
hadn't really realized who I had married.'' There is obviously more
to this story, but Jim's admission that up to that point he'd had
very little idea that he'd married an extraordinary woman stopped
me in my tracks.
</P>
<P>
   I think we may all be admirationally impaired.
</P>
<P>
   There are two deathbed tragedies that I'm desperately trying to
avoid. The first is the pain of realizing, when it's far too late,
that although you were unaware of it at the time, there were
periods in your life when you were miraculously happy. The second
is to die without ever having recognized how remarkable the people
in your life were.
</P>
<P>
   The reason it's so difficult to see the exceptional talent, the
amazing creativity, the profound humanity, or the immense goodness
of those around us is because we're blinded by a culture that
insists that fame and fortune are the only measures of worth we can
trust. We think that anyone local _ teacher, minister, musician,
neighbor, friend _ must fall short of the greatness that is always
somewhere else, never within our circle of acquaintances, and
certainly never within us.
</P>
<P>
   We are so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to argue that anyone, even Jim's wife, is perfect. I
know Judy well enough to tell you she is merely magnificent and
astonishing. Like Jim, I am lucky enough to have recently shed the
psychic filters that misled me all my life into believing I was
seeing nothing special. Now, at rare and precious times, I look at
those with whom my life is tightly interwoven and no longer
perceive only the shadow of their true selves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with powers of observation once beyond my ken, I sense
them blazing from within like a star and am dazzled by their
radiance.

MOUNT RUSHMORE: AMERICA AT ITS GRANDIOSE BEST AND TACKY WORST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEYSTONE, S.D. _ When viewing Mount Rushmore on a brilliantly
sunny summer day, it's inevitable that several thoughts cross your
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The new parking lots, entrance way, visitors center and walking
paths are efficient and attractive.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington looks so distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson's carved stone visage is the most
weather-beaten of the four.
</P>
<P>
   From some angles, Teddy Roosevelt seems to be whispering in
Abraham Lincoln's ear.
</P>
<P>
   You sure have to pass a lot of hokey, pseudo-attractions on your
way to and from Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   That is the paradox. In frantic efforts since its 1941 opening
to capitalize on one of America's foremost patriotic shrines,
entrepreneurs in the Black Hills area have surrounded
architect/sculptor Gutzon Borglum's masterpiece with a chaotic
collection of waterparks, reptile farms, chintzy ``Old West''
tourist trap towns and other eyesores.
</P>
<P>
   This is America at its grandiose best and tacky worst.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from afar should keep in mind that Mount Rushmore's
remote location makes it difficult to reach.
</P>
<P>
   By air, you can fly to Minneapolis or Denver and connect to a
smaller aircraft for another hour's flight to Rapid City. Then you
would have to rent a car and drive 45 minutes to the massive
monument.
</P>
<P>
   By then you have invested so much money and time that it doesn't
make sense to look at Washington &AMP; Co. for 30 minutes, turn around
and go right back home.
</P>
<P>
   So you consider these options:
</P>
<P>
   _You spend several days sulking in a Black Hills motel room,
venturing out for repeated looks at Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   _You visit the Crazy Horse Monument, or enjoy the natural
wonders of Custer State Park and the nearby Dakota Badlands, which
shimmer with ominous beauty.
</P>
<P>
   _You give in to the temptation of tackiness.
</P>
<P>
   But without question, Mount Rushmore is a grand place and where
you will want to start your trip.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have visited before will be pleasantly surprised by
new amenities added since the early 1990s. There are two vast
parking lots. One is free but a half-mile hike from the entrance;
the other costs $8 for an ``annual pass,'' but is more accessible
to the new monument entranceway, whose clean granite lines offer a
breathtaking frame to the four famous faces. Admission is free,
although donations are encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk walk down the Avenue of Flags leading to the massive
viewing deck is tempting, but postpone it for a few minutes to
wander through the new visitors center. It includes fascinating
displays that tell the story of how the monument was commissioned
and constructed. Learn why Borglum insisted that Teddy Roosevelt be
the fourth president represented while Roosevelt's detractors
believed it was premature to etch his memory in stone.
</P>
<P>
   The viewing deck is perfect for gawking. Mount Rushmore is a
tremendous sight. But now newly constructed footpaths make it
possible to get a closer look. You still can't pat Washington on
the nose, but you get a clearer view of his nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Rushmore gift shop is exactly what you'd expect _ an
eclectic mix of tasteful and tacky. Elegant knit shirts are on
shelves next to garish glow-in-the-dark neon T-shirts. There are
expensive carved Indian artifacts as well as $2 plastic keychains.
Snacks are available, too.
</P>
<P>
   Borglum's on-site studio is open to visitors, with interesting
displays chronicling how the famous faces were blasted out of rock.
</P>
<P>
   Too many Mount Rushmore neophytes forget to return after
sundown. Every night at 9 o'clock, there is a simple but moving
lighting ceremony when Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln
seem to suddenly spring in ivory tones from the pitch darkness. The
crowd inevitably oohs and aahs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like a great painting in a museum, Mount Rushmore can be
looked at only so long before there is an urge to move on. Although
they receive far less publicity, there are other natural and
man-made wonders in the Rapid City region that are well worth
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ATTRACTIONS, LIKE CRAZY: The Crazy Horse Memorial, located 17
miles from Mount Rushmore on U.S. 16, is a logical place for
monument devotees to visit. The 9-story rendering of Crazy Horse
and his mount has been under construction for several decades, ever
since sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski was asked by Lakota chief Henry
Standing Bear to carve a mountain monument so ``the white man
(will) know the red man has great heroes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been obstacles, foremost among them Ziolkowski's
death (his family has continued the work) and the fact that Crazy
Horse never allowed his photo to be taken.

OPTIMISTS SEE NO QUICK END TO THE MARKET PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Watching the stock market has become America's
newest spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of investors follow their holdings as closely as the
World Series. From high-powered traders to short-order cooks,
people eagerly await daily market reports and interest rate
pronouncements from the Federal Reserve. It's the great
democratization of the market.
</P>
<P>
   And the excitement that stretches from Wall Street to Main
Street may not go away just yet, investment specialists say. The
economic climate is sweet, and the money is flowing easily.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers keep pouring billions of dollars into retirement
funds. Financial Web sites have opened up investments to millions
of people. Cyber traders have turned on-line investing into a new
growth field. The brawny U.S. economy keeps charging ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's still here,'' said Jonathan Horton of the Horton
Investment Advisory Group in San Francisco. ``We might go into a
slow dance now and then, but the party should keep going for at
least eight to 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite gloomy predictions of a bear market, stock indexes in
the United States have enjoyed strong gains during the first six
months of 1999. If the trends continue, the market may post
double-digit gains for the fifth straight year _ an all-time
record.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell the story. In the first six months of the year,
the Dow was up to 10,970.80 from 9,184.27 at the end of 1998. The
S&AMP;P 500 rose to 1,372.66 from 1,228.10. And the Nasdaq 100 was at
2,686.12 from 1,993.58 six months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of Wall Street's good health, baby boomers
concerned about their retirement kept mutual funds going strong.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this year, the total assets of the nation's
7,000-plus funds grew to $5.9 trillion from $5.5 trillion _ a 6.3
percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some 70 million people have moved into their prime saving
years, and they're in it for the long term,'' said John Collins, a
spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, a trade group in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Even recent stock market declines have not scared investors, who
are mostly middle-aged, middle-class people with $60,000 in median
household income. During market plunges they stop pouring money
into mutual funds, but resume their investing within weeks or
months, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't pull the trigger and panic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the rosy scenario, market specialists are split into
two camps. Some are mildly bullish, advising their clients to keep
taking profits on hot stocks, while guarding against a sudden
crash. Bearish investment pros are telling their clients to
hibernate and pour money into safe bonds and low-risk stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree the key economic signs still look good.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity and employment are up, while inflation is in check.
And the Federal Reserve didn't jack up interest rates too much _ a
big hike might chill the economy and pop the stock market bubble.
The explosion of the Internet and other wireless technologies
should keep the economy healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But bears warn that the market is at the cusp of a long-term
correction or a crash. Internet mania will die soon, they predict.
Stocks on the S&AMP;P 500 are dangerously overvalued, trading at 35
times earnings. The market is too narrow and concentrated, with
investors pouring too much money into a small number of large, blue
chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The raging bull market has created unrealistic expectations
among investors, warned Joe Turner, co-founder of Pring Turner
Capital Corp. in San Ramon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's mentors taught him long ago to grow cautious when
everything looks too good, when business can't get any better. The
signs are too positive, he said: Consumer confidence is at an
all-time high. President Clinton announced a $1 trillion federal
surplus earlier this week. And many analysts believe the stock
market will keep soaring into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   To play it safe, Turner advises his clients to pour money into
safe bonds and so-called ``value'' stocks that boast cheap prices
and solid earnings potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at history, the stock market has suffered 25
percent corrections every three to four years,'' Turner said. ``The
bull market has got people thinking that investing is fun and
easy.''

   VARIOUS/``TESTIFY! THE GOSPEL BOX'' (Rhino) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Housed in a faux pocket-sized Bible (complete with white ribbon
marker) this three-disc box impressively captures the wide-ranging
sounds and intense purpose of more than 50 years of roof-raising
African-American gospel. The collection will please the faithful
and undoubtedly convert a few non-believers to the power of this
expressive music.
</P>
<P>
   Each disc covers a specific incarnation, moving from heavenly
harmonies of vocal groups to '60s soul to the present-day mix of
hip-hop, r&AMP;b and funk. All the important artists get to share their
testimonials _ Dorothy Love Coats, the Staple Singers, Aretha
Franklin, Walter Hawkins and the Love Center Choir, Andrae Crouch,
the Winans (pictured) ... all the way up to Whitney Houston and the
Georgia Mass Choir performing ``I Love the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   When you finish listening to these 50 tracks, you'll be left
thinking ``how great thou art'' as you cue it up for another
listen. A blessing indeed. 4 stars

<P>
   SOUNDTRACK/``THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER'' (Milan)
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDTRACK/``BIG DADDY'' (American/C2)
</P>
<P>
   The hip-hop-heavy ``Wild Wild West'' soundtrack is big,
overbearing and mostly awful _ and it's being pounded without mercy
by radio, which explains why it zoomed into the Top 5 upon release.
The blockbuster tracks, including Will Smith's title theme (based
upon Stevie Wonder's ``I Wish'') and Enrique Iglesias' ``Bailamos''
are already so familiar you're probably hearing them in your sleep.
No need, then, to play them while awake. 1 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' disc represents a refreshingly
imaginative approach. Bay Area musician Greg Hale Jones' remix of
'30s field recordings is the most haunting film music we've heard
all year. In addition, Carter Burwell's typically dark score and
the inclusion of the classic opera piece ``O Fortuna'' make the
album a compelling listen whether you like the movie or not. 3
stars
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' is more enjoyable than similar rock-themed
collections due to Sheryl Crow's lighthearted remake of ``Sweet
Child O' Mine'' and Everlast's version of Neil Young's ``Only Love
Can Break Your Heart.'' Other goodies include items from Garbage,
Rufus Wainwright and Shawn Mullins. Could do without the movie
dialogue, though. 2 stars

   Almost 30 years ago, the fathers of these Malian musicians
recorded a seminal album of duets on the kora, a bulbous,
21-stringed cross between a lute and harp. The sons, themselves
noted kora players, have now collaborated on another collection of
lovely, quiet duets of mostly classic West African repertoire.
Truly remarkable sounds from a peaceful place in the soul.

</P>
<P>
   Elliott's supposed to be the cutting edge of hip-hop, and her
producer Timbaland is billed as one of the genre's most innovative
knob-twiddlers. Her new album, though, reveals a tepid throwback to
an early age that won't have anyone dancing ``Da Real World''
shuffle or gasping in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, Elliott deals with the war between the sexes, and if
this is how some sections of society relate, we're in trouble. It's
all about the ``b-word'' here, as if it's somehow revolutionary to
rap bad language in dance mixes. Elliott's 1997 debut promised so
much more than this one-dimensional noise delivers. 1 1/2 stars

   This 15-track disc offers an early taste of the forthcoming
three-CD box set from this missing-in-action Seattle hard rock
quartet. How you respond to such stuff as the new track ``Get Born
Again,'' the acoustic ``Got Me Wrong'' and such familiar radio
fodder as ``Man in the Box,'' ``Rooster'' and ``I Stay Away''
depends on how much you actually miss hearing this long-lost
outfit. 2 stars

   In 1969, blues great Waters was banged up in a car wreck, while
his longtime pianist Otis Spann died the following year. After
healing and hiring Pinetop Perkins to tickle the ivories, Waters
took his superb Chicago blues band on the road. This recently
discovered live session from that trek is a sheer smoker as Waters'
crack outfit navigates the classics _ ``Honey Bee,'' ``Trouble No
More,'' ``She's 19 Years Old'' and ``Long Distance Call.'' The best
live Muddy since ``Fathers and Sons.'' 3 stars

boasted an instantly recognizable guitar style, vibrato and tone,
all used to greatest effect on originals like ``If You Be My Baby''
and ``Albatross.'' The weakest moment is the rave-up version of
``Great Balls of Fire,'' which closes out the proceedings. 3 stars

KEYSTONE, S.D.: to be taken. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sculptor rendered the chief's likeness from written and oral
descriptions, and now a huge head glares out of the mountainside.
There is no firm date for when the sculpture will be completed, but
estimates are in the 40-to-50-year range. It costs $20 a car to
visit the monument-in-the-making, but it's worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   Custer State Park is in buffalo country. You cannot help but
encounter some of the shaggy creatures, and jeep rides are
available where the herds roam thickest. But much of the fun is
getting there. The tiny mountain highways offer frequent vistas of
glimmering lakes, towering pines and occasional Rocky Mountain
Goats who like to walk alongside the road.
</P>
<P>
   To the north of Rapid City, the towns of Deadwood, Lead and
Spearfish re-create reasonably accurate Wild West settings.
Although selling cap pistols and T-shirts are a priority, the staff
is well-versed in town lore. Authentic period entertainment is
available, too; on July 12-21 in Spearfish, for instance, Texas
musician/historian Bobby Bridger performs his ``Ballad of the
West'' trilogy. Call (605) 642-5890 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has the most available motel rooms, Rapid City will
probably serve as a home base. Its eight-block downtown is replete
with antiques stores and western clothiers. Rapid City also boasts
a half-dozen free attractions, which is welcome in a place where a
buffalo burger can set you back $8.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Geology is worth seeing, although youngsters will
prefer Dinosaur Park along Skyline Drive. The seven life-size
reptiles look phony to the adult eye, but they're perfect for
climbing and picture-posing, so kids who have a passion for
make-believe and are bored easily are likely to love them.
</P>
<P>
   Another Rapid City-area attraction is the helicopter ride around
Mount Rushmore. The price increases the closer you get to the
monument. It starts at $20 per person, jumps to $40 for a view from
200 yards, and skyrockets to $120 for a really up-close and
personal look.
</P>
<P>
   Other attractions include the Sitting Bull Crystal Caverns,
which are like shiny holes in the ground; waterslides and ``the
Black Hills Maze'' (a few square yards of shrubbery with pathways
cut in the greenery); and Keystone, a town with apparently no
purpose other than siphoning your money when you're heading to or
from Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   To the east of Rapid City, only an hour's drive on Interstate
90, is the Badlands. What you're likely to remember most about the
Badlands is Wall Drug Store, which is promoted with more roadside
signs than it is possible to count. From food to frolic to toys,
the signs promise that Wall Drug has everything. And if it's junk
you're looking for, it does. Curiosity will make you stop to see
what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre, the state capital of South Dakota, is another 200 miles
away. It is pleasant but undistinguished and the Capitol building
pales when compared with Austin's, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But filmgoers may recognize the surrounding landscape because
Kevin Costner filmed much of ``Dances With Wolves'' in the area.
It's fun for a little while to park by the side of the road where
signs mark where scenes were filmed and try to remember which
scenes these might have been.
</P>
<P>
   To the west, across the Wyoming border, is the staggeringly
beautiful Devil's Tower National Monument. Spielberg fans will
recall that Devil's Tower figured prominently in ``Close Encounters
of the Third Kind.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've got the time and a car that gets good gas mileage, you
may also want to drive to North Dakota or Canada. Be warned that
both states named Dakota are huge, and maps disguise actual drive
times.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to be in your car eight to 10 hours before nearing
our neighbor to the north, but once there, Canadian border guards
seem uniformly friendly and enjoy suggesting scenic spots on their
side.
</P>
<P>
   American guards are less chummy. Smaller U.S. crossing points,
for instance, are open only from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and even if you
arrive at 8:55 in the morning, you will have to wait until
regulations allow you to drive across the invisible divide between
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The identification necessary to travel between the two countries
is minimal; a U.S. driver's license will do.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you decide to spend your time enjoying nature's wonders
or mankind's tourist traps, though, you'll undoubtedly conclude
your Black Hills visit with one last, lingering look at Washington,
Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln. It says a lot that the chance to
gaze up at their chiseled rock faces on Mount Rushmore makes
anything else superfluous.

MAYORAL CANDIDATE TACKLES HOMELESS ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayoral candidate Clint Reilly has announced his
answer to a problem no San Francisco mayor has succeeded in
conquering _ homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   In a 48-page booklet entitled ``Homeless Solutions,'' unveiled
Wednesday, Reilly details a plan that includes conducting a census
of homeless people, opening day shelters for the mentally ill and
encouraging public aid recipients to take vouchers instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed a no-tolerance policy for graffiti, aggressive
panhandling and public urination. The incumbent mayor, Willie
Brown, and his predecessor, Frank Jordan, have both been criticized
for cracking down on such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown has mismanaged the homeless issue just as badly
as he has mismanaged Muni,'' said Reilly, referring to the city's
transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, owner of a commercial real estate business and a former
political strategist, launched his campaign four months ago with an
indictment of Brown's handling of Muni.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Johnston, spokesman for Brown's re-election campaign, said
Reilly's proposal contained no fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a sensible, thought-out solution to the homeless
problem,'' Johnston said. ``This is a political candidate who has
no credibility on the issue of poverty since he's been largely the
reason for the escalating rents that landlords have been able to
collect in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston noted that a census was unnecessary because officials
already had a clear idea of who made up the homeless population and
what their needs are. For example, he said, 70 percent of people on
the streets have substance-abuse problems, and 50 percent have
resided in San Francisco less than one year.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Gillis, coordinator of the Coalition for Ethical Welfare
Reform, said Reilly's idea to give people vouchers for food,
shelter and services rather than cash would not help people out of
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That to me is saying homeless people are not responsible folks
just because they're homeless,'' she said. ``We know a lot of the
folks that are homeless are actually working, but because the rents
are so high in San Francisco, they can't afford a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly also has proposed turning unused city buildings into day
shelters for the mentally ill. Gillis said what that population
needed were services for their problems, not places to go during
the day.

for such unexpected behavior: liquidity trap. Now an economist
suggests that a liquidity trap is a distinct possibility. The

that they will pull back sharply on both spending and investing. By

COOLING FANS ALONG WITH THE DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The Golden State Warriors teased the Bay Area
shamelessly Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They picked Todd Fuller II in the NBA draft, and their
apoplectic fans couldn't dial up talk-radio hosts fast enough. It
was time for whining, groaning, hair-pulling, time for a wake.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Fuller, the cardboard cutout that the Warriors
chose with the 11th pick three years ago. Big guy. Good student.
Had a deadly game. It killed the career of Dave Twardzik, the
general manager who drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Foster was this year's Fuller, a giant nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's not fair, but Warriors fans have every right to
leap to certain conclusions. They have endured Joe Barry Carroll.
They have survived Chris Washburn. By now, they know how to use the
word ``bust'' as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb and decorative
potholder.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Warriors needed this year was another big
man, not on their roster. And a big man available at the 21st spot?
This is where the ``you can't teach height'' becomes ``some teams
never learn.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Warriors were trying something new here. Five picks
after they took Foster/Fuller, they dumped him on the Indiana
Pacers. The Pacers gave up a future first-round draft pick, plus a
point guard, exactly what the Warriors need _ Vonteego Cummings,
the 26th player taken this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings may or may not be a point guard of the future.
</P>
<P>
   He may or may not last three years in the NBA. But, by taking
him, the Warriors dodged some of their own ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time anyone reviewed a Warriors trade and
questioned the judgment of the other team in the deal? In recent
years, negotiating with the Warriors has been like winning a
sweepstakes. Minnesota, Miami, Indiana, New York, Sacramento _ one
way or another, they all picked Golden State clean.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Pacers appear to be the dupes.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they turn out to be geniuses and Foster turns out to
be the next Patrick Ewing, the Warriors have some insulation
against second-guessing. They just have to save the tapes from
those radio shows. And let's admit it: Everyone, even if we didn't
call in, was thinking the same thoughts: ``Todd Fuller, stiff, not
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way this draft day turns into another nightmare is if
Jason Terry becomes the next Jason Kidd. The Warriors could have
had him at the 10th spot, but they traded the pick to get veteran
Mookie Blaylock and move down to 21. Terry was first-team
All-American. Cummings was third-team all-Big East. Blaylock, at
32, was off his game this year. Add this all up the right way, and
you have an equation for regret.
</P>
<P>
   What the Warriors really did was bow out of this draft. By the
time the draft hits the 21st spot, no one expects to find a player
who can contribute right away. The Warriors dropped down that low
because this draft, even in the top five picks, was woefully short
on talent. It's hard to blame them, even if Terry turns out to be a
star. After all, he went behind three other point guards, including
UCLA's Baron Davis, who never would have been the No. 3 pick in a
good year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Warriors have a first-round choice from Indiana, to be
used in a year when there is more talent. Also, over the next five
years, when that pick comes due, the NBA may have figured out a
plan to farm teen-agers out to a minor league.
</P>
<P>
   Then taking one won't be such a gamble. But Jeff Foster still
has a chance to hurt the Warriors. He could be the star of an
Eastern Conference power that never earns a draft pick higher than
25.
</P>
<P>
   It's a convoluted scenario, one that requires Warriors fans to
wind through a maze in search of trouble. In the past, they found
plenty without even trying.

OTTMAR LIEBERT INFUSES SOUND WITH NEW ENERGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ German-born New Age guitarist Ottmar Liebert has
always been just a little ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after releasing his million-selling debut, ``Nouveau
Flamenco,'' in 1990, pop instrumental fans went mad for flamenco,
even while Liebert was drawing on influences from the Middle East
and Asia, r&AMP;b, jazz and ambient music.
</P>
<P>
   With his just-issued ``Innamorare/Summer Flamenco'' (Epic), the
Santa Fe, N.M.-based guitar virtuoso takes a trip back to the
melodic Spanish sound of ``Nouveau Flamenco,'' one of the
top-selling guitar records of all time, regardless of genre.
</P>
<P>
   The germ of the new album came to Liebert during several months
he spent in Italy in spring 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something with a lot more energy,'' he said. ``I put
together a nine-member band with three drummers, a horn section,
three guitarists and bass. I took the same lineup and made the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebert's breezy, rhythmic sound crosses many borders: New Age,
flamenco, funk, jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a crossroads in culture and music,'' Liebert says.
``I'm very interested in seeing where it will lead. We need to find
ways that our cultures can merge to a certain extent. While I was
born in Germany and have a German passport, and while I love being
a longtime resident of my chosen home, the U.S., I also feel I'm a
citizen of this whole planet, with its wealth of different flavors,
sounds and colors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy Award-nominated Liebert and his group perform two
shows Saturday at the House of Blues in West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having 10 albums under his belt and an international
following, Liebert finds radio has recently become somewhat
resistant to his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airplay has slowed down considerably for us because we're not
smooth jazz, and I don't play soprano sax,'' he said. ``Plus, you
need that hip-hop thing in there. See, when you start your career,
you have to make a point and sell as many records as you can. For
some people, that means doing exactly what radio wants. Or you can
follow your instincts and see where the music takes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of ``Innamorare/Summer Flamenco'' are a
couple of upbeat Caribbean-flavored tunes, a mariachi-tinged number
that pays tribute to Santa Fe's ``low rider'' culture and a tune
featuring a cameo from Carlos Santana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky I have enough fans where I don't have to take a day
job again,'' Liebert said. ``I can take chances with my music, and
nobody tells me what to do. I proudly tell you my home studio is a
thousand miles away from the nearest record guy.'' &QL;

VAST NETWORK INVOLVED IN RECRUITING IMMIGRANTS FOR BOOMING U.S. JOB
MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARISA TAYLOR, 
STEVE STEIN 
and DIANE SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six undocumented immigrants, huddled a few yards from the
U.S.-Mexico border in Brownsville, snap to attention when a
stranger in a pickup slows to a halt. If the men want work, the
stranger can ship them to jobs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At a recruiting office in McAllen set up by meatpacking giant
IBP, company employees offer the promise of good-paying jobs and
benefits at plants in the Midwest _ and transportation there.
</P>
<P>
   At an El Paso homeless shelter, job counselors hand out fliers
advertising job openings in everything from food processing in
North Texas to tire recycling in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   All along the Southwest border, a sophisticated system is
supplying a steady flow of immigrants _ documented and undocumented
_ for U.S. industries desperate for workers in an era of low
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which has evolved from the U.S. tradition of
recruiting Mexican farm laborers, involves a broad network of
people, including ``coyotes'' who smuggle in undocumented
immigrants, businesses that house and transport workers, recruiters
who comb the border and Mexico for workers, and the companies that
hire them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gringos arrive here from all over: Texas, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Illinois and Florida. They find illegal workers who
are willing to work,'' said Enrique Pena, one of the few U.S.
citizens who goes to the Brownsville street corner daily to seek
work.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is usually to hire legal immigrants. But across Mexico
and Central America, undocumented workers know they can hook into
the U.S. job market by paying a smuggler $200 to $5,000 to cross
into the United States, resting up in a homeless shelter or a hotel
along the border and buying counterfeit documents such as passports
and ``green cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Some come after seeing ads by companies eager for workers.
Others have a U.S. relative with job connections for those without
proper immigration papers.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number connect with recruiters at the border _ on
street corners, at bus stations or at the Texas Workforce
Commission office, where companies can get space to recruit. They
sign up for jobs, then often board a bus, a plane or a company van
for the trip north.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the waves of immigrant workers going north,
several bus lines have been formed from Texas to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The charter business for Houston-based El Expreso accounts for
$15,000 in monthly business at its Brownsville station alone, said
Alberto Gutierrez, the Brownsville terminal supervisor for the
company, which offers direct service to Fort Worth and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, El Expreso, a Coach USA company, has taken
15,000 workers from Laredo to the tobacco fields of Raleigh, N.C.,
Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the workers are sought for backbreaking manual labor and
unskilled service jobs in industries such as meatpacking,
landscaping, construction, restaurants and hotels, where turnover
is high and transience is common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We import every type of worker but prostitutes into this
country,'' said Armando Alvarez, an El Paso recruiter who said he
has sent legal immigrants to jobs for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, Ana Maria Gandara, an El Paso recruiter for the
nonprofit Opportunity Center, sends 25 to 50 people to Dallas-Fort
Worth for jobs in construction and food processing. Many employers
pay to fly the workers to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport or to Dallas
Love Field, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have a real need. They ask for 50 people a month,''
she said, adding that she is careful to check documents.
``Companies are starving for workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some recruiters known as headhunters seek out undocumented
workers because they are vulnerable and because many will take on
any task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many recruiters take anybody who has a pulse,'' said Bob
Wingfield, a Dallas recruiter who checks workers' Social Security
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Mexican worker, whether he is legal or illegal, will get a
job. Mexican workers have become a commodity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo, a Mexico City native waiting to cross the Rio Grande in
Ciudad Juarez, said the most recent time he had traveled to the
United States, he easily found an employment office in Fort Worth
where he was recruited to remove asbestos for six months at an Army
base in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The fit, middle-age man said that for 10 years he has removed
asbestos in 39 states as an undocumented worker, sometimes using a
counterfeit document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone guesses that I wasn't legal. I think even the Army
knew,'' he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   In Agua Prieta, Mexico, Honorio D. waits for his patron, or
boss, to send him to his next construction job in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't worry about your documents,'' he said. ``You just
show up for work and they tell you what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mexican boss tells me where to cross, and then my American
boss finds me work,'' he said. ``Sometimes they take us and we have
no idea where we are going. They take us somewhere in America and
we work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked for all the big U.S. home builders, especially
in San Antonio,'' he said. ``The next time I will work in San
Antonio, Houston, and my boss tells me there is work for me in
Dallas and Fort Worth.''
</P>
<P>
   DEPENDING ON SMUGGLERS: The first step toward a U.S. job is to
get into the country. To do this, many illegal immigrants seek out
smugglers on both sides of the border who help them cross and find
fake documents.
</P>
<P>
   Some coyotes, who often are immigrants themselves, offer the
newcomers help in finding jobs and give them information about safe
passageways. Others are profiteers who exploit their clients.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Mexico city San Luis Potosi, polleros _ immigrant
smugglers known as ``chicken catchers'' _ set up scam agencies near
consul offices to appear official when they sell documents and
promise work, Mexican consul officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the smugglers are customer-savvy and shrewd, providing
food and diapers for babies while waiting for U.S. Border Patrol
agents to switch shifts at checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Some coyotes will do anything to avoid being caught, including
leaving behind those who slow them down. In May, Border Patrol
agents found a 15-year-old Honduran boy curled up and crying in a
desert 15 miles southwest of Deming, N.M., with an empty water jug.
A smuggler had abandoned him because he couldn't keep up with a
group of undocumented immigrants crossing from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The coyotes' work does not end at the border. They transport
clients to safe houses or to hotels, where they hide until the path
is clear. In mid-May, the INS got a tip and found 126 undocumented
immigrants in a small Phoenix house where they shared one bathroom.

ROCKER'S SON NOW TAKIN' CARE OF BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Even though he grew up surrounded by music and
musicians, Tal Bachman wasn't sure he wanted to pursue a pop
career.
</P>
<P>
   Bachman's dad is Randy Bachman, member of the Guess Who and
Bachman-Turner Overdrive and author of such hits as ``Takin' Care
of Business.'' Through his dad's massive record collection, the
younger Bachman became acquainted with 50 years of pop music.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he turned 18, he essentially stopped listening to
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my favorite band _ U2 _ had gone off the deep end,''
Bachman, 27, said. ``My other favorite groups, like the Smiths, had
long since broken up, the Cure were redundant and I hated
hair-metal bands.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bachman realized his talents were in music and moved
back to his hometown near Vancouver, British Columbia. Soon, a
self-produced demo was making the rounds, eventually catching the
ear of a Columbia Records executive.
</P>
<P>
   Bachman's self-titled debut, co-produced by Bob Rock (Metallica,
the Cult, Veruca Salt, Aerosmith), was recently issued while the
hook-laden ``She's So High'' is currently among the Top 30 album
tracks at both the adult alternative and hot adult contemporary
radio formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting airplay is very important if you care about other
people hearing your music, which I do,'' Bachman said. ``But I
don't have control over whether a radio programmer adds my song or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachman says the current state of pop worries him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's bands just can't seem to write more than one good
song,'' he offered. ``I don't blame radio for that. I lament the
decline in the number of bands who can sustain the attention of the
audience.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; FRED NEIL REDISCOVERED &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; It's ironic that the guy who penned the song ``Everybody's
Talkin''' should be so under-recognized, but Fred Neil remains one
of the last great undiscovered Greenwich Village folk legends.
</P>
<P>
   A contemporary of Bob Dylan, David Crosby and Paul Kantner, the
melancholy Neil, whose haunting songs have been covered by Harry
Nilsson and Tim Buckley, has had absolutely nothing in print on CD
and has not been seen or heard from musically since 1971 _ until
now.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the recent release of ``The Many Sides of Fred Neil''
(DRG) is such an event. The engaging two-CD set, which contains
testimonials from Crosby and John Sebastian, includes the three
sought-after albums Neil cut for Capitol, plus the two sides of his
rare single with the Nashville Street Singers and six unreleased or
alternate tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Neil's low, rumbling voice and chiming 12-string guitar make for
perfect late-night contemplation.

   RECRUITERS HEAD TO BORDER: When the owners of InStaff Personnel,
a Plano-based employment agency, realized that they couldn't find
workers locally for two food processing companies, they decided to
head to the border.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the company began sending workers hired in El Paso
to Delta Daily Foods in McKinney and to Tyson Foods in Union City,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than not to come through for our clients, we thought we
needed a creative way to find employees,'' said Randy Burkhart, one
of three partners who owns InStaff. ``El Paso has such a high
unemployment rate, we thought it would be a good place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has sent 12 workers to McKinney and 140 to the
Tennessee plant. By year's end, Tyson wants 400 to 500 more
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success, Burkhart said he has concerns because
counterfeit documents often appear authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing things the right way,'' he said, adding that the
company checks each worker's Social Security number. ``But anybody
who tells you that they're not concerned is fooling themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all recruiters are as careful. Some, paid as much as $300
per worker they sign up, seek workers at bus stations, private
offices and busy street corners. Fliers and radio, television and
newspaper advertisements ask, ``Busca trabajo?'' or ``Looking for
work?''
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, Ark., many immigrants arrive penniless at the
immigrant shelter Centro Hispano, carrying only slips of paper with
names of people who they say are friends or family members, said
Edwin M. Vasquez, the center director.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I call for them, it turns out the person isn't a friend
or relative, but an employer or recruiter,'' Vasquez said. ``The
recruiters tell them if you make it over here, then you have a job
_ just don't tell anyone who you are working for.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recruiters search for undocumented workers to take
advantage of them. Some pocket money that employers send for
workers' transportation and don't tell immigrants that they will be
charged later for the trip. Some misrepresent wages and housing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   One Mississippi recruiter hired several workers to burn tires
that were being recycled, but didn't provide masks or pay the
workers for several days of work, Gandara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recruiter told me he didn't want to hire blacks or Anglos,
he just wanted Hispanics,'' she said. ``He didn't want them to know
English.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, companies use as many as three or four recruiters to
find workers. With each layer of recruiting, it becomes more
difficult for the INS to prove that employers knowingly hired
undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a contractor or recruiter is going to deny that he
had any knowledge that the worker was undocumented,'' said Lynn
Ligon, an INS spokesman in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies handle their own recruiting at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Fliers displayed at Texas Workforce Commission offices in the
Rio Grande Valley attracted several applicants to an IBP recruiting
office in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   One woman gets news via a telephone that she is eligible to work
at an IBP meatpacking plant in the Midwest. Company literature
states that she has the option of getting reimbursed 20 cents a
mile if she drives to the plant, or IBP will pay her bus fare from
the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   To meet its labor needs, IBP also has recruited in Mexico. The
company says that workers it hired there already had the
appropriate documentation, such as temporary visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding adequate supplies of labor has become an uphill battle
for most businesses these days, including IBP,'' said Gary
Mickelson, a spokesman for IBP based in Dakota City, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   IBP has never been sanctioned for knowingly hiring undocumented
workers, Mickelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at IBP feel strongly about the issue of illegal
immigration, partly out of our own self-interest,'' he said. ``The
removal of undocumented workers by the INS costs IBP hundreds of
thousands of dollars in lost production, overtime pay and training
of replacement workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company acknowledges that meatpackers struggle to
screen out undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an employee claims to be a U.S. citizen and supplies
documents to support that claim, IBP must by law accept that claim
as true,'' the company said in a written statement. ``The problem
lies in the ease with which false documentation can be obtained
that purports U.S. citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   In an INS review of 24,148 employees in Nebraska meatpacking and
processing plants from May 3 to June 3, the agency said it found
4,495 ``record discrepancies.''
</P>
<P>
   After the problems were found, 3,152 employees chose to leave
their jobs, 303 were no-shows or excused absences, and 1,040 were
interviewed by the INS. The investigation resulted in 34
undocumented workers being apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   JOBS HAVE HIGH TURNOVER: Mesmerized by the prospect of
prosperity, immigrants are willing to take on the most demanding
work to fulfill simple dreams. They want to buy houses, cars and
educate their children.
</P>
<P>
   But many immigrants stay a short time in the jobs that U.S.
citizens often won't take. Grinding manual labor, culture shock and
the inability to meet their expenses lead to high turnover and a
constant need to recruit more workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel, a native of Guerrero, Mexico, left California three
years ago to find work in the Mississippi chicken industry. Earning
$350 a week, he chased and caught chickens sent to plants for
butchering and processing. But he quit because the work was so
grueling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fingers and hands got swollen,'' he said. He now is a
maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
   Two to three weeks into poultry jobs in Scott County, Miss.,
workers start looking for other jobs, said Sally Del Castillo, a
missionary who assists immigrants at the Trinity Mission Center for
Hispanic Ministries in Scott County.
</P>
<P>
   Annual turnover in the poultry processing factories in Delaware,
Maryland and Virginia is approaching 100 percent at one facility,
according to an industry study. That creates a constant need for
new workers.
</P>
<P>
   After wearing out from arduous work, some immigrants use their
employment as a springboard to better-paying jobs in metropolitan
areas such as Fort Worth-Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta. They often
feel more comfortable settling in areas where their language is
more commonly spoken, their native dishes are served and their
traditions are understood.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas, who came to the United States to do fieldwork with a
temporary visa, later worked in a turkey processing plant and now
works in the Metroplex. He is a foreman pouring concrete for
sidewalks and driveways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working to eat and live, not to make money. In Mexico,
it's the same, but the refrigerator is empty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalia, a 33-year-old undocumented immigrant, came with her
husband to pick cucumbers. He tired of the long hours and low pay
and found a better job in construction, she said. Rosalia now works
in a doughnut shop. Recently, she urged her brother to come live
with the couple, although they still feel pangs of nostalgia for
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think it would have been better if I hadn't come.
It's difficult here,'' she said with a sigh. ``But it's better than
home, because I can find work.''

EX-FBI AGENT ASKS INMATE FOR HELP IN GARDNER PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In the latest twist in the attempt to solve the
world's costliest art heist, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum
has recently hired a former top FBI agent who believes that an
imprisoned antiques dealer may hold the key for securing the return
of the artworks.
</P>
<P>
   According to letters obtained by the Globe, Larry A. Potts _ the
former head of the FBI's criminal division who was involved in the
bureau's disastrous siege at Ruby Ridge, Idaho _ was hired by the
museum in April. One of his first moves: a polite, respectful
letter to William P. Youngworth last month urging him to help crack
the case once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to me, as it is to those associated with the
museum, that you remain the key to bringing this to a successful
resolution,'' Potts wrote Youngworth. ``You have the capability,
with my help, to put this behind you and be a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Potts's words signal a break in the
nine-year-old case or an attempt to get Youngworth to talk by
appealing to his considerable ego. Potts did not return a phone
call and a museum spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In his reply last week, Youngworth, who is serving a two- to
three-year sentence in the state penitentiary in Shirley on
unrelated charges, agreed to help, but indicated that it wouldn't
come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would be delighted to help you and the Gardner Museum
recover their former property,'' Youngworth wrote on June 21.
``Kindly remit $50 million dollars U.S. and a signed immunity
agreement issued by the Attorney General of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, however, Youngworth had toned down his rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   He released a statement that praised the museum for hiring Potts
and for contacting him directly instead of through the federal
authorities, whom he grew to distrust during their 1997
negotiations. In the past, federal prosecutors and FBI agents were
openly doubtful that Youngworth actually had access to the stolen
paintings and felt he lacked credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from the fact of Mr. Potts' letter that I am
credible and can effectuate the artworks' return,'' Youngworth's
statement said. Still, Youngworth _ who is scheduled for a parole
hearing this summer _ would not say whether he intends to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Youngworth made headlines by contending that he
could solve the crime and secure the return of the 13 pieces of art
that were stolen from the museum in a daring, early-morning
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he was not involved in the March 18, 1990, theft
at the museum, Youngworth insisted he knew where the paintings were
and could broker their return through his contacts in the criminal
underworld.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Youngworth wanted a deal: the $5 million reward
posted by the museum and law enforcement's agreement to drop
pending criminal charges against him. He also demanded they release
his friend, Myles Connor Jr., a skilled art thief with a long
criminal record who was serving time in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the US attorney's office in Boston and state authorities
wouldn't meet Youngworth's demands They also suspected that Connor
may have known who was responsible for the Gardner heist.
</P>
<P>
   Youngworth then angrily charged that the impasse proved that law
enforcement hadn't placed a high enough priority on the artwork's
return.
</P>
<P>
   The talks with Youngworth broke down for good after the bureau
tested microscopic paint chips purportedly from either of two rare
Rembrandt paintings stolen in the heist. The results indicated that
the chips could not have come from either work.
</P>
<P>
   Youngworth later claimed that the chips might have been from a
Vermeer, which also had been stolen from the Gardner. Within
months, he was serving time for possession of a stolen car and
operating it without registration.
</P>
<P>
   Potts, who is vice president of Investigative Group
International Inc., a Washington-based private detective firm,
retired from the FBI in August 1997. His final two jobs with the
Bureau were as head of its criminal division and as second in
command of the its Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, he was placed on administrative leave for more
than a year while the Justice Department investigated his role in
the deadly siege at Ruby Ridge, which ended in the deaths of three
people, including the unarmed wife of white supremacist Randy
Weaver and US Marshall William F. Deegan of Quincy. No charges were
filed as a result of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9, Potts visited Youngworth in prison, but Youngworth
refused to meet with him, according to the letter Potts wrote to
Youngworth the following week. Potts explained that the museum had
hired him to work on the case and he was sensitive to Youngworth's
position.
</P>
<P>
   Potts did not specify why, considering Youngworth's credibility
problems with investigators, he and museum officials believe that
Youngworth is still central to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``While, as many people are quick to point out, there is some
discrepancy in the evidence concerning your knowledge of the
whereabouts of the stolen items, I believe there are a couple of
very strong indications that you have, or at least had at one time,
access to those paintings,'' Potts wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also states: ``I appreciate your need for assurance
that you will not be at risk by assisting in the return of the
stolen art from the Gardner Museum and I assume that you would have
other expectations as well, to include financial. There is a high
degree of probability that I can help you.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his good faith, Potts included a copy of a letter by
Anne Hawley, director of the Gardner Museum, confirming that Potts
had been hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, it has been almost ten years since the theft and
we are most anxious to do everything possible to obtain the return
of our treasures so they can again be part of the cultural life of
our city, nation and the world,'' Hawley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Investigative Group International is one of the country's most
prominent private investigative firms, specializing in sensitive
cases in both business and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by Terry Lenzner, a lawyer with Boston roots, the firm
has worked for the museum investigating the theft on and off since
1990. Since being brought into the case in April, Potts told
Youngworth, he had spent ``a considerable amount of time''
reviewing the case.

   BROCHTRUP-THEATER (New York) _ Television's Bill Brochtrup.
What's that you say? Name doesn't ring a bell? If there were any
justice, it would. Brochtrup plays the empathic, sad-eyed clerk
John Irvin, who greets the perps and the prosecutors at the squad
room door in ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' (He took a bullet in a courthouse
shootout in the season's two-part finale and earned a promotion to
the opening-credits roster of stars.) If the television role is not
proof enough of this actor's gentle strength, his knockout work in
``Snakebit,'' David Marshall Grant's deeply satisfying off Broadway
comedy-drama about days of waning love and friendship in Los
Angeles, should provide the supporting evidence. By Peter Marks.

TOP EXPERTS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO HOW MONEY GAME IS PLAYED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for investment ideas, consider picking the
brains of the best.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you would like to chat with John Bogle, who founded he
Vanguard Group, the second-largest mutual fund in the world; or
Mary Zweigt, chairman of a $9 billion mutual fund bearing his name;
or maybe Mario Gabelli, chairman of a $10 billion mutual fund that
bears his name. Foster Friess, manager and owner of the Brandywine
Fund, the best-performing no-loan mutual fund, may also have a few
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   For a different point of view, you may want to talk to some of
the information specialists in investing: Louis Navallier, who
edits the MPT Review, a highly rated investment newsletter; or
William O'Neil, founder of Investor's Business Daily. Don Phillips,
who heads Morningstar, the leading firm for rating and tracking
mutual funds, also has his own take.
</P>
<P>
   Round that out with a talk with Harry Markowitz, Nobel Prize
winner for developing the Modern Portfolio Theory, and you would
consider yourself well-educated in investment.
</P>
<P>
   Or you would have a book.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kenneth A. Stern thought when he interviewed all of
those people for ``Secrets of the Investment All-Stars'' (Amacom,
301 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   This tome offers the investment insights of nine top
investors/market information specialists. Each brings a unique
perspective to the complex world of investing.
</P>
<P>
   A simple question-and-answer format brings the reader into the
room where Stern is interviewing the investment stars, making the
material easy to breeze through.
</P>
<P>
   And the information is specific enough to be useful, yet doesn't
get bogged down in mind-numbing number-crunching and graphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each all-star has very distinct and different views from that
of their peers,'' Stern writes. ``This is revealing in many ways.
Most importantly, it confirms to an investor that there is more
than one way to skin a cat, and more than one way to make money at
investing. It also provides a whole array of different styles and
disciplines for you to greedily absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Zweig. He has been named by ``Forbes,'' among others, as a
legend in market forecasting. Stern says he is meticulous in his
constant market analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``To forecast the market, Zweig has probably probed, measured,
monitored ... and created more forecasting models than anyone you
will ever meet,'' Stern writes. ``Zweig would say that forecasting
the market is not so much about understanding money as it is about
creating a model, about finding a trend and sticking to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zweig has 70 factors in his market model, Stern writes. The most
important are monetary indicators, (mostly interest rates);
sentiment indicators (flows into mutual funds); and momentum
indicators (price and volume of stocks).
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli looks at the stock market in a totally different light,
Stern writes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than changing his model to keep up with Wall Street
trends, Gabelli makes his decisions based on something called value
investing, a strategy of picking bargain stocks that have not
reached their potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Gabelli adds a kicker that he calls a catalyst. An
undervalued company will probably stay there, he believes, unless
an active ingredient, an event of some type, is triggered. Then
stock will rise to its true value. The catalyst can be anything
from the death of the founder to regulatory changes, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Stern concludes with a 20-point checklist, summing up how to use
``the best of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Investing can be hard work. Stern shows us how it can be
intriguing and fun as well.

   ``High-Tech Careers for Low-Tech People''
</P>
<P>
   By William A. Schaffer
</P>
<P>
   Ten Speed Press, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   Communication is the most important skill required by the
high-tech industry, author William Schaffer found when talking to
industry sources about his premise that people with arts degrees
can find a home in the high-tech world. Schaffer is a good example.
He has a degree in government and French literature from Columbia,
but he works as an international business development manager for
Sun Microsystems. Schaffer offers a career option that many people
may not realize they have and shows them how to pursue it.

Greatest Deal-Maker''
</P>
<P>
   By Stuart Crainer
</P>
<P>
   Amacom, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   This is one of a series of four books highlighting the business
practices of Murdoch, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Jack Welch.
All are well-written by English business author Stuart Crainer, who
has also written such bestsellers as ``The Ultimate Business
Library.'' Crainer has done his homework on these business moguls
and offers not only detailed backgrounds, but also insights into
their business practices.

FAT CHECKBOOK ADDS TO AURA OF BUSH CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An impish-looking George W. Bush took the podium
at a charter school in Los Angeles to dispel some rumors about his
fund-raising abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've raised as of right now $35.5 million,'' Bush said with a
quick laugh, as if almost embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   A gasp went through the audience. Just that morning the New York
Times reported that the Texas governor had raised ``at least $20
million.'' Two hours later, the Bush campaign would revise the
figure to $36.25 million, and it seemed like money was falling from
the hazy Los Angeles sky.
</P>
<P>
   And at a San Francisco fund-raiser later on Wednesday, so many
people wanted to toss money at the early Republican front-runner
that Bush aides had to add a half-dozen tables outside the ballroom
at the Westin St. Francis Hotel. The $1,000-a-person event was
expected to net $800,000, but when the checks were counted, the
tally was $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The understatement of the day came when Bush's national finance
chairman, Don Evans, said of the three-day fund-raising trip to
California, which raised at least $4.5 million: ``The low-hanging
fruit has been plucked.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a heavy tree.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has raised more money in four months than 1996
presidential candidate Bob Dole raised during his entire primary
campaign. And Bush has raised nearly twice as much as Vice
President Al Gore, who has a powerful Democratic fund-raising
machine, White House clout.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, which raised half as much as Bush in the
first six months of the year, was shocked at the Bush haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Roger Salazar, Gore's campaign
spokesman, said when told of the Bush total. ``We will get back to
you to see if we want to have anything to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Marla Romash, Gore's deputy campaign chairman, said,
``Republicans always have more money than Democrats. That is a fact
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush wrapped up his California trip Thursday after attending
seven fund-raisers over three days.
</P>
<P>
   The money flush has clearly jazzed Bush. During a Sacramento
event Wednesday, where he played football with a group of
youngsters in a mentoring program, his signal calls were: ``77! 36
point 25!'' before the handoff. It was an obvious reference to his
new fund-raising figure _ $36.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson of the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan group in Washington that tracks campaign contributions,
said of Bush's record-breaking fund-raising mark: ``This is the
political equivalent of hitting 90 home runs in a season.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Bush sounded like a candidate in the final
days of a general election race, not like someone who still sends
out press releases on ``Bush Presidential Exploratory Committee''
stationery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to carry your state,'' he told 1,100 supporters at
the event, ``and I intend to be the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the fund-raising has added to the aura that the
candidate is already on the road to the presidency, a year before
the party nominating conventions and 17 months before the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between a traveling Bush and a traveling
President Clinton is that freeways are closed for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, just moments after Bush made his fund-raising
announcement, the Los Angeles police blocked off surface streets to
allow Bush's 12-car motorcade to pass and make it more swiftly to
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Even the protesters at the Bush events have added to the
presidential air of his trip. Outside the Westin St. Francis, 30
supporters of abortion rights railed against Bush while a dozen
environmentalists attacked the governor for doing little to protect
endangered sea turtles on the Texas coast. Would such a crowd have
turned out for Steve Forbes or former Vice President Dan Quayle,
both candidates for the Republican presidential nomination?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who's been coronated by the media and the
donors,'' Kelly Hayes-Raitt, an executive at California Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League, said of her group's decision
to protest against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked during the California trip whether he would
consider a vice presidential running mate who supported abortion
rights. He cracked a wry, downturned smile and said: ``It's a
little presumptive for me to be selecting a running mate before I
have secured the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he would not rule out a pro-choice running mate.

  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of actresses
Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal'' and Lara Flynn Boyle of ``The
Practice.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Boys with breasts,'' Tom Wolfe calls them.
 &HT;    If you want to know what he means, tune into television's hit
legal series ``The Practice'' and take a look at Lara Flynn Boyle
as Deputy District Attorney Helen Gamble.
 &HT;    What you'll see is a beautiful face atop the body of a
12-year-old boy, except with mammary glands.
 &HT;    And Boyle is no exception. Just ask any fan of television's
other hot legal show, ``Ally McBeal.'' When star Calista Flockhart
turned her back to the camera in a recent episode, she looked like
a refugee from some POW camp.
 &HT;    Flockhart has had to answer repeated allegations of anorexia, a
potentially lethal eating disorder especially common in young
girls. Predictably, she denies it, with explanations that have
included ``I'm just small-boned,'' ``I've been working too hard''
and ``I have a fast metabolism.''
 &HT;    But her high-school pictures tell a different story: Yes, she
was a slim, pretty cheerleader, but in those days her bones were
amply covered. She looked, dare I say it, normal.
 &HT;    To Boyle and Flockhart add ``Friends'' star Courtney Cox,
Oscar-winner Helen Hunt, singer Celine Dion and model Kate Moss,
any of whom makes 1960s icon Twiggy look morbidly obese.
``Frasier's'' Jane Leeves, ``Jesse's'' Christina Applegate and
``Dharma &AMP; Greg's'' Jenna Elfman have all been photographed looking
rake-thin.
 &HT;    Even 37-year-old Meg Ryan, mother of a 6-year-old child, looked
much thinner than normal in her most recent film, ``You've Got
Mail'' (l998)
 &HT;    And if you think they look skinny on camera, which traditionally
adds 10 pounds, you should see them in real life.
 &HT;    ``I was on `The Howie Mandel Show' with Ms. Boyle,'' says
novelist Jackie Collins, ``and when she turned sideways I swear she
vanished.''
 &HT;    Once upon a time, the Duchess of Windsor decreed ``You can never
be too rich or too thin.'' But as recently as the 1950s, Hollywood
stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell and Jayne Mansfield were
anything but pinched.
 &HT;    But times change, according to Sharlene Hesse-Biber, a sociology
professor at Boston College and author of ``Am I Thin Enough Yet?
The Cult of Thinness and the Commercialization of Identity''
(Oxford University Press, 1996).
 &HT;    ``By the time the '60s came along, women were beginning to close
the education gap and seeking out careers,'' she says. ``And, just
as in the flapper '20s when they were out campaigning for the vote,
the ideal body image for women started to shrink.''
 &HT;    But Twiggy and the other bone-thin ``dolly birds'' of 1960s
Britain were teen-agers, Hesse-Biber adds.
 &HT;    ``What's new today,'' she says, ``is we've got 10-year-olds and
postmenopausal women trying to be Twiggy.''
 &HT;    And the way they do that is by starvation _ there's no other
word for it.
 &HT;    ``This may be politically incorrect, but I find it fascinating
how ugly, starved, bony women can be considered attractive,'' says
Dr. Arnold Anderson, director of the Eating Disorders Unit at the
University of Iowa College of Medicine in Ames. ``When you see them
during examination, they are skeletons for hanging expensive
clothes on. It's extraordinary that people can be convinced they're
glamorous.''
 &HT;    According to Hesse-Biber, the current trend is merely the
extreme manifestation of a longtime, cross-cultural emphasis on the
attractiveness of tiny, childlike women.
 &HT;    ``Cinderella was the one tiny enough to fit into the slipper,''
she says, ``and the Chinese footbinders used to have smallest-foot
contests. In the late '60s there was Barbie with her
Victorian-sized waist and big chest. It was an impossible goal, but
it influenced all those little girls who between them had enough
Barbies in their toy box to circle the globe.
 &HT;    ``Now these actresses and models are taking the fantasy and
playing it out to its logical conclusion.''
 &HT;    And these days, thinness is big business, with huge sums being
spent on advertising that sends the worst possible message to women
and especially young girls.
 &HT;    ``Weight Watchers, the Jenny Craigs, the gyms, the beauty
products, the low-fat-food manufacturers, the diet gurus, the
plastic surgeons all conspire to convince us that we need to be
skeletal,'' Hesse-Biber says. ``They've done it so well that they
now have a growing population that will spend any amount of money,
endure any medical risk, in pursuit of the impossible.
 &HT;    ``We have women dying under anesthetic after nine and 10 hours
of surgery, trying to be perfect,'' Hesse-Biber adds, ``and others
spending their salaries on expensive diet products.''
 &HT;    It's a vicious circle: Young girls tune in to ``Ally McBeal''
and see an ideal they're supposed to measure up to _ presumably
with the help of the upcoming ``Ally McBeal'' line of health and
beauty products for young women.
 &HT;    The actresses themselves are trapped in the same spiral, knowing
that no one ever fired an actress for being too thin. On the other
hand, to be ``full-figured'' is _ except for rare exceptions such
as Roseanne or Camryn Manheim _ a ticket to the unemployment line.
 &HT;    As a result, they feel pressured into the kind of crash diets,
cosmetic surgery and, often, eating disorders which their own
example make so dangerous to their young fans.
 &HT;    Writer/producer David Kelley, who created both ``The Practice''
and ``Ally McBeal,'' is well aware of the controversy over his
stars' appearance, as he showed in a recent episode of the latter,
in which Ally and Gamble cross paths.
 &HT;    After giving Ally a cool once-over, Gamble sniffily remarks,
``Maybe you should eat a cookie.''
 &HT;    ``Maybe we should share it,'' Ally responds snidely.
 &HT;    In another episode Ally is accosted in a courthouse hallway by a
pushy woman who says she wants to nominate McBeal as a feminist
role model.
 &HT;    ``We'll have to fatten you up,'' she adds as an afterthought.
``And you'll have to drop that skinny, whiny thing.''
 &HT;    It turns out it's just Ally having a nightmare, of course.
 &HT;    Funny stuff, to be sure. But the reality behind the jokes is
something that Kelley, Flockhart, Boyle and their peers had better
take a good look at.
 &HT;    Otherwise it is their fans, young girls and teen-agers across
America and beyond, who may be the ones who die laughing.

   BROCHTRUP-THEATER (New York) _ Television's Bill Brochtrup.
What's that you say? Name doesn't ring a bell? If there were any
justice, it would. Brochtrup plays the empathic, sad-eyed clerk
John Irvin, who greets the perps and the prosecutors at the squad
room door in ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' (He took a bullet in a courthouse
shootout in the season's two-part finale and earned a promotion to
the opening-credits roster of stars.) If the television role is not
proof enough of this actor's gentle strength, his knockout work in
``Snakebit,'' David Marshall Grant's deeply satisfying off Broadway
comedy-drama about days of waning love and friendship in Los
Angeles, should provide the supporting evidence. By Peter Marks.

KOSOVAR SEES FRIEND LEAD RAID ON HER VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects time reference in lede)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUSHK, Yugoslavia _ The first time the Serb paramilitaries
encircled this tiny rural hamlet was April 17, less than than a
month after NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia started.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you will be killed if you don't leave,'' said the man
in the distinctive blue uniform of the feared Ministry of Interior
Police, known as MUPs, the chief agents of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's vision of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   A band of paramilitaries accompanied them in a mix of camouflage
uniforms, along with some Yugoslav army soldiers. They went house
to house, stealing jewelry, demanding money, and stealing most of
the cars.
</P>
<P>
   As the paramilitaries ransacked their way through the village,
Liria Gashi, 38, saw her former neighbor, Zvonimir Svetkovic, 42.
They had grown up together. He was a of her older brothers and they
all attended the Ramiz Sadiku elementary school in downtown Pec.
</P>
<P>
   She could tell by his nervous movements and the wavy, dark hair
tucked under an Australian bush hat that it was the neighbor she
knew by his nickname ``Zvonko,'' she said in an extended interview.
He was a father of three girls. Their families had been close. It
was before the hatreds of Kosovo spilled into war.
</P>
<P>
   Gashi, more out of surprise than courage, said just before he
left the village, ``Zvonko? Is that you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not from here,'' he said, but his voice made her certain
it was him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zvonko, it's me. It's Liliana. We grew up together for 18
years. I know your whole family,'' she remembered saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you here?'' he asked, looking stunned, then angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is from this village,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have children?'' he asked coldly.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't take it as a friendly inquiry by an old neighbor. She
thought she was trying to find out if she had sons in the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have five daughters,'' she lied, not telling him of her
16-year-old son hiding in a chicken coop behind the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave here,'' he said as he jumped into an idling military
``It's the only way I can save you.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after the NATO bombing began, the Serb forces _ this
time there were nearly 100 _ again encircled the warren of stucco
farm houses. The village of about 400 had been too proud and
defiant to leave, as most ethnic Albanian Kosovars had.
</P>
<P>
   While Gashi hid between the headboard of her bed and the wall,
peering through a crack in the window frame, the men were separated
from the women.
</P>
<P>
   She saw Svetkovic, his head shaven and his face covered in green
paint and a camouflage bandana. He seemed to be leading the men.
She stared in horror and shook in fear. She was afraid he was
looking for her.
</P>
<P>
   The last time she saw Svetkovic, he was taking two male members
of her family to a house down a dirt path next to hers. Moments
later there were bursts of gunfire. Then the sound of crackling
fire. Later she learned that 45 people from the village had been
shot at close range, and their bodies set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   This atrocity, confirmed by three men who miraculously survived,
photographs of charred bodies taken by family members before they
buried them, and investigators for the war crimes tribunal at the
Hague, was one of dozens of such attacks throughout the Pec area,
and as many as 100 throughout Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And Gashi has been left to grieve and to wonder about
``Zvonko's'' descent into depravity.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who knew him say that in 1989 he began attending
Serbian ultranationalist rallies in town. He stopped talking to his
ethnic Albanian neighbors about soccer and his passion for cars. By
1992, he was listening to loud Serbian nationalist music in his
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   When his ethnic Albanian neighbors' children played too close to
his side of the garden, he screamed at them and insulted them. When
an Albanian family left an outdoor light on near his bedroom
window, he would reach out with the butt of a rifle and smash it.
His house beaome a local headquarters for the paramilitary unit
known as the ``Frenkis.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the house was looted by ethnic Albanian neighbors who
had returned, and large wooden crates of ammunition and a dozen
paramilitary uniforms lay in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   Sali Seremeti, 46, was once a close friend of Svetkovic. But on
the morning of March 25, he was not surprised when Svetkovic banged
on his door with the butt of a rifle and told the family to leave
their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had gone mad. He changed into something very ugly,'' said
Seremeti. ``We all watched it happen.''

 &HT;    A suite bonus for those who visit Biltmore
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 4
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four newly restored bedrooms on the third floor of Asheville's
circa-1895 Biltmore Estate are included in the tour of George
Vanderbilt's grand chateau in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Collectively known as the Artists' Suite, the rooms' names _
Watson, Van Dyck, Morland and Madonna _ allude to artists and works
represented in Vanderbilt's collection.
</P>
<P>
   When the meticulous floor-to-ceiling restoration began three
years ago, Biltmore curators found mostly bare walls, scraps of
wallpaper and holes where prints once hung _ few clues as to the
former grandeur of the rooms. Extensive research by design
detectives revealed the look of the original wallpaper, textile and
architectural details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was essential to interpret how these rooms might
have been furnished and how they were used in daily life at the
turn of the century,'' says Ellen Rickman, staff collections
curator. Visitors to the Biltmore Estate this summer will find
other enhancements including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Explore Biltmore Estate: This environmental adventure program
puts visitors in touch with Biltmore's land, history and outdoor
culture. Activities offered through Sept. 4 include a 90-minute
float on the French Broad River; a 90-minute, moderate off-trail
hike; and a 30-minute carriage ride through Biltmore's agricultural
areas. One-day admission plus additional fee.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Garden Treasure Walks: These 90-minute strolls provide a
historical overview of the grounds, with an emphasis on seasonal
flora, and offer advice for the home gardener. Three walks daily;
$11.95 per person.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Conservatory: The centerpiece to Frederick Law Olmstead's
75 acres of formally landscaped gardens and grounds has reopened
after a two-year, $2.5 million restoration. The 7,500-square-foot
facility boasts a 12,000-square-foot basement as its most unusual
feature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Summer Evening Concerts: Music will ring from the South
Terrace on Saturday nights in August as Biltmore hosts orchestral
and jazz bands. ``An Evening With Roberta Flack'' is the season
finale on Aug. 22. Tickets $35-$40.

   Earth-shattering event
</P>
<P>
   We feel safe in saying that the only place you can see a
125-pound anvil shot into the sky this Fourth of July is at the
Museum of Appalachia in Norris, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The anvil will be fired by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum Baker, who will
be carrying on a tradition that dates to pioneer America. Here's
what happens: A blacksmith's anvil is placed upside down on the
ground, its cavity filled with fine black powder. A second anvil is
placed upright on top. The powder is ignited and the top anvil is
blown from 50 to 150 feet in the air as the earth shakes. The boom
can be heard for 15 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-acre farm/village complex will be abuzz all day with
demonstrations of other traditional activities such as sawmilling,
sheep herding, rail splitting, crosscut sawing and buggy rides.
Old-time musicians will play and sing on the porches of the cabins
and in the old log church. Home-cooked food will be available.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Sunday. Anvil shootings at 10 a.m.,
noon and 2, 4 and 5 p.m. (Baker will light the fuse at 2 p.m.) $7;
$4 ages 6-15; under 6 free. The museum is 16 miles north of
Knoxville, one mile off I-75 (Exit 122). 423-494-0514.
</P>
<P>
   A 116-year-old
</P>
<P>
   tradition
</P>
<P>
   The first official celebration of the Fourth of July in North
Carolina will be relived when Old Salem, a restored Moravian town,
holds its 34th Annual Torchlight Procession on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The records of Salem Diary show that on July 4, 1783, the
Moravian settlement of Salem held a full day's events ``for the
restoration of peace.'' The day ended when the congregation
gathered after an 8 p.m. service to process through illuminated
streets with music, antiphonal choral singing and a blessing before
returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The re-creation of this procession will highlight historic
interpretive events Saturday and Sunday in the living history
village.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Exhibit buildings will be open 9 a.m.-4:30 p.m.
Saturday, 1-7 p.m. Sunday; the procession begins at 9 p.m. Sunday
at Salem Square. Two-day tickets $15; $8 ages 5-16. 1-888-653-7253

 &HT;    Italy: The art of eating well
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 4.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy _ Before I went to New York or New Orleans,
before I went anywhere really, I went to Italy. Fresh off the farm,
20 years old, a classics student on his first trip abroad, I wore
white tennis shorts, pink Izods and plastic glasses as big as
diving goggles. Most of the time, I was in ruins. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Pompeii and Paestum. The Pantheon. The Forum. We read Virgil's
``Aeneid'' and kept the Blue Guide to Rome in our hip pockets.
</P>
<P>
   And the food? At that age, Bologna meant sandwiches, and
Parmesan cheese came out of a shaker. ``First, we were served pasta
with meat sauce,'' says my journal entry of June 30, 1980, the day
of my first Italian meal, at a pensione in Rome. ``Then, we had
fried veal and a salad. Of course, there was plenty of bread and
water, too.''
</P>
<P>
   I had come here to study the arts, but the art of eating well
escaped me. I was more interested in how Caravaggio's light
transformed a bowl of peaches and grapes than I was in tasting the
ripened flesh. Ecstasy was Bernini's Santa Teresa, an arrow at her
heart, swooning in yards of cloth cut from marble. I didn't know
that pasta-making could be a form of sculpture, too, that moistened
flour could be folded around a lump of meat and cheese,
miraculously transformed into the bright yellow, bellybutton-shaped
pasta known as tortellini.
</P>
<P>
   All this changed recently, when my best friend gave me a ticket
to Bologna and suggested that we explore Emilia-Romagna, the
northern region known as ``the belly of Italy.'' Over 10 bright
days and cool nights this spring, we explored Italy's other Holy
Trinity: prosciutto di Parma (Parma ham); Parmigiano-Reggiano
(Parmesan cheese); and the balsamic vinegars of Modena and
surrounding towns.
</P>
<P>
   This is a culture that rightly sings the praises of its lusty
cuisine, which embraces every kind of combination of cheese, meat
and pasta under the sun. And in Emilia-Romagna, the purest balsamic
vinegars are kept in tiny flagons, coveted like heirlooms or holy
relics, even used as dowries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only one word could describe Emilia-Romagna, it would have
to be `rich,''' says Lynne Rosetto Kaspar in ``The Splendid
Table,'' a paean to the region's food. ``Not rich in the sense of
fat, but rich in dishes of deep, layered tastes. Even at its
simplest, Emilia-Romagna's food tastes as if it has evolved from a
long tradition. Yet there is always a spontaneity to what you
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly our approach. With a rental car and a few
guidebooks, but no advance reservations, we wandered the
countryside and found some of the loveliest scenes _ and
best-tasting food _ in unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   Did we make it to nearby Ravenna, site of those ravishingly
beautiful Byzantine mosaics that inspired William Butler Yeats?
Heck, no. We even zipped past Florence, to the Tuscan wine country,
to sip some of the best reds in the world. Imagine a 2,000-year-old
Napa Valley, and you get the idea of this green, undulating
landscape, where you can buy acacia honey, fresh-made pecorino
cheese and pungent olive oils straight from the source.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason why this food tastes better, and it has little
to do with best-selling travelogues, decaying villas or romantic
light. It has everything to do with the farmers I saw handing
purple-tinged artichokes and bunches of green-silver sage to their
neighbors. In this land of exquisite produce and baaing sheep, the
time between field and table is but a minute. The flavors never get
a chance to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   But you do.
</P>
<P>
   At a shop in Pienza, we watched a man carve porchetta (whole
roasted pig seasoned with rosemary, garlic, wild fennel and lots of
salt and pepper) and stuff it between thick slices of Tuscan bread
to make a sandwich. The flavor was amazing.
</P>
<P>
   At the idyllic Locanda dell'Amorosa, a hotel-restaurant-wine bar
near Sinalunga, Tuscany, I had the best risotto I've ever tasted _
a perfect amalgam of rice, nettle, ricotta and chopped tomatoes:
emerald green, red, white. Before lunch, we sat in the garden
sipping wine and admiring an explosion of purple irises, roses and
wisteria. Afterward, we returned to take grappa. An Italian woman,
her gray hair knotted on her head, sat under an umbrella with her
husband and two sons, drinking in the luminous day. We were certain
we'd found la dolce vita.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, we rambled along a cypress-lined dirt road from
Montalcino to Montepulciano, through a bucolic landscape
upholstered with sheep. In tiny Monticchiello, we asked the locals
to point us up the hill to Taverna di Morando. We'd heard it was
good, and it was. Chicken livers _ sauteed in a little butter,
white wine and garlic _ were the best I have ever tasted. Dessert
was a glass of vin santo (the local after-dinner wine that's as
sweet as honeysuckle) and a pair of oaty, almondy biscotti. This
was simple food at its best.
</P>
<P>
   But even as you follow your gut, you cannot escape the pull of
history, time, art, architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In Parma's massive museum _ with its cantilevered galleries
suspended in a hulking old Farnese palace shattered during World
War II _ you look around to see a beautiful Leonardo girl on an
easel. In Modena, well-buffed medieval churches are stacked like
wedding cakes. From dawn to dusk, their colors change like
evanescent lozenges _ white, pink, gray.
</P>
<P>
   Bologna is a never-ending cavalcade of columns, block after
block of arched porticoes, under which society has mingled through
the ages. This city reputedly has the oldest university in the
world, founded in the 12th century. Today, observing kids push
money into sidewalk cigarette machines today, you imagine the
civilization that preceded them: Did Renaissance brides, feuding
lords, nuns and soldiers once tread here? In the town center, two
red brick medieval towers lean like upset chessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Emilia-Romagna may well be Italy's best-kept secret. It's a
worthy alternative for travelers wishing to skirt the busy grand
tour destinations of Venice, Florence and Rome. I put it off for 20
years, thanks to the train station bombing that killed 85 people
within days of my passing through, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But we made up for the lost time _ and managed to feel like
innocents abroad once again. And since the authorities didn't
declare us personae non grappa (wink, wink), we'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, is a city-by-city guide. Recommended establishments
are highlighted in bold. Addresses and phone numbers are provided
in the accompanying sidebar.
</P>
<P>
   BOLOGNA
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is fully-fully,'' said the voice over the phone from
the hotel. We were about to leave Atlanta for Bologna, and to our
horror, the city was completely booked by a convention of
cosmetologists (we were to witness some great hair and fashion,
though). We had no choice but to wing it.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, we got a place at Agriturismo Cavaione, a pair
of rambling farmhouses in the hills just south of Bologna. The
agricultural-tourism concept allows visitors to rent rooms in a
hands-on environment (on fruit and vegetable farms, or with makers
of olive oil, honey or cheese, for example). In our case, we were
surrounded by grapevines and rolling fields of wildflowers. Davide,
our spritely, smiling host, let us try the house Lambrusco, the
spritzy local red wine. Not a bad tonic for jet lag. Suddenly, we
felt like Patsy and Edina on ``Absolutely Fabulous'' _ remember the
segment in which they drive a rental car to the rustic farmhouse in
the South of France?
</P>
<P>
   At La Felina, a two-story country trattoria down the road, we
ordered our first affettati misti, a platter of mixed regional
meats, including prosciutto, salame, pancetta and copa. The
waitress brought us warm crescenti (crescents of fried dough). We
stuffed them with the cold cuts and butter and inhaled. And it was
here that we tasted our first _ and only _ mortadella (bologna
sausage), cut into cubes and mixed with rice at the antipasto
table. And on it went: fat little tortellini in a creamy sauce;
gramigna con salsiccia (spiral pasta with sweet, crumbled sausage);
a huge slab of steak with a rich, balsamic vinegar sauce. Talk
about ``fully-fully.''
</P>
<P>
   Intown, our favorite perch was Bar Pasticceria San Domenico, an
old-fashioned confectionary shop across from Basilica San Domenico.
The 12th-century cathedral is the center of the Domenican order,
and it sits on a handsome square with pillared Victorian-style
crypts off to the side. We took coffee in the bar, and wondered at
the shop's immense cases of sweets; its tall, drugstore jars of
fancy hard candies; those cute little grappa sets. According to the
press on the walls, this is one of Italy's best bars. We agree: The
bartender sure knows how to shake a martini. At happy hour, the
kitchen puts out all sorts of nibbles, from nuts and olives to
boiled eggs and little anchovy-flavored pastries. It's a great
people-watching place, too.

   BOLOGNA, Italy: people-watching place, too.
</P>
<P>
   MODENA
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget the saleslady at the food shop off the main
square of town. Trying to sell us an $80, 3/4-ounce bottle of aceto
balsamico tradizionale di Modena, she kissed her fingers, smacked
her lips and said that you haven't lived until you try it with ice
cream. She was speaking Italian, but we understood.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the balsamic vinegar capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 minutes northwest of Bologna, on the Via Emilia _ the
old Roman road that connects the region's most notable food
destinations _ Modena is a spic-and-span jewel box of medieval
architecture, fashion boutiques and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to chef Massimo Bottura's inventive use of local
ingredients, Osteria La Francescana is beginning to get
international press. We loved-loved-loved the trio of
Parmigiano-Reggiano preparations: a custard, a creme and a crisp.
House-made gnocchi was green with herbs, and coddled in cream. With
dessert, we had our first sip of nocino, a regional digestif made
from crushed green walnuts. Emilians pour the sweet liqueur with
pride and hospitality. We liked it, and the excellent wine list,
very much.
</P>
<P>
   One of our favorite stops of the entire tour was Ristorante
Lancellotti, a family-run inn and restaurant in Soliera, a little
town just outside Modena, where we checked in for a night.
</P>
<P>
   It isthe place to sample the rarest of cured meat products,
which the kitchen strews with herbs from its garden. Lardo _ which
is little more than thinly sliced (and disguised) fatback _ is
aromatized with fragrant herbs. It melts on the tongue. We also
sampled our first culatello, a sliced cured ham with a richer,
redder, more intense flavor than prosciutto. To cleanse the
palette, we loved the apple salad, tossed with fresh chives and
other herbs.
</P>
<P>
   And, boy, does Mama Ida Lancelloti know how to roll out the egg
pasta. Tortelloni, vibrant with yolk, was stuffed with ricotta and
spinach and tossed with butter. Delicious. The baby roast pig was
one of the best pieces of pork I've ever tasted. We asked Emilio
Lancellotti if we could have one to go.
</P>
<P>
   We were too embarrassed to mention our pig-nic plan the next
morning, but we sure bought a bottle of the house-label nocino and
traditional balsamic vinegar. Emilio explained how the vinegar is
aged in smaller and smaller barrels until it has achieved its
purest state _ a process that takes 12 years, often longer. You can
buy lesser balsamics all over the region, but if you want the best,
look for the tradizionale label, which is
</P>
<P>
   the sign that it's certified by the producers' consortium.
</P>
<P>
   REGGIO
</P>
<P>
   Tucked between Modena and Parma, this foodie destination is
where the other half of Parmesan cheese _ Parmigiano-Reggiano _
gets its name. Here, at Trattoria Della Ghiara, we stumbled upon
another memorable meal, where balsamic vinegar and local cheese are
front and center on nearly every dish.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant, cool, thin slices of rabbit filet were fanned out
across a salad of radicchio and fresh field greens. It was an easy
segue to the fusilli with puttanesca sauce, a delicious marriage of
anchovy, tomato, garlic and olive oil. Were we full yet? Of course,
but we still had to try the rosemary-scented veal and the steak
with Parmesan shavings and balsamic vinegar. Before departing, we
struck up a conversation with our sweet-natured waiter, and it
turned out that he's a beekeeper and member of the balsamic
consortium of Reggio.
</P>
<P>
   PARMA
</P>
<P>
   A lovely city with an abundance of art galleries, Parma turned
out to be a timeless and evocative place. The Duomo and baptistry
are the apotheosis of the region's distinctive Romanesque
architecture. In an old convent, the Camera di San Paolo is an
exquisitely restored chamber of rooms with frescoes by Corregio.
The Palazzo della Pilotta, built by the Farneses at the end of the
16th century, is the home of the National Gallery (where we saw the
Leonardo). Another treasure within its monumental walls is the
Farnese Theater, a perfect wooden copy of a Palladian original.
</P>
<P>
   About the food: Skip the highly touted La Greppia, and go to La
Filoma. Its pasta ranked among the best of our journey.
Particularly good were the strozzapreti (literally, ``priest
stranglers''), a somewhat hard-to-find regional gnocchi. I won't
speculate on the etymology of that name, but I adored these
dumplings, stuffed with ricotta and spinach. Those bold enough to
try the veal cheeks will discover that it's the tenderest part of
the calf. With its attentive service and stylish clientele, this
place was a find.
</P>
<P>
   MONTEPULCIANO,
</P>
<P>
   MONTALCINO
</P>
<P>
   AND ENVIRONS
</P>
<P>
   Wine and roses. Honey and pecorino cheese. Purple skies and a
range of mountains that's as arresting as a quilt of emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the best, the only, balcony at Caffe Poliziano at the
very top of Montepulciano at sunset, I thought we'd finally gotten
everything right. This is where you go when you need to unclutter
the mind _ be it a two-day purge or a six-month sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know about the friendly, go-with-anything Chianti
Classico. It's got its own region nearby. But the Vino Nobiles of
Montepulciano and the Brunellos of Montalcino are in a league of
their own. Conveniently, the towns are only about 45 minutes apart.
That we were able to taste freely, eat well and happen upon such
picture-perfect scenery made for a bittersweet ending to a
well-nigh perfect escape. Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Montepulciano. Get a room on a hill in the ancient walled
city, park the car and take the walking wine tour. Start with an
espresso drink at Caffe Poliziano (I don't recommend dinner at the
adjoining restaurant). From there, it only takes about a half-day
to hit the major vintners. One of the best is Contucci, with its
cavernous, cobwebby cellars in a 16th-century palazzo off the main
square. On Saturdays, go down to the street market just outside the
old city walls and watch the local farmers put out those awesome
melons, peaches, asparagus, artichokes _ whatever's in season.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pienza. This town is synonymous with the sheep's milk cheese
called pecorino. Just outside the main road between Montepulciano
and Pienza, stop at Formaggi Silvana Cugusi, where the view's
wonderful and the cheese is even better. The brown-crusted wheels
set the standard for the region; some are rubbed with tomato paste,
which imparts an extra layer of flavor, others dusted with ash or
wrapped in walnut leaves. Ask for a crumb of the ``reserved.'' This
sour-salty granddaddy of them all is remarkable. And yes, you may
photograph the sheep.
</P>
<P>
   We hit Pienza proper in the throes of May Day, so all the
restaurants were overbooked. But this being a food lovers' mecca,
we didn't go hungry. La Cornucopia food shop is a good place to
stock up on truffles, olive oil, pate and honey. I even found a
dreamy sandalwood cologne made in Florence. Haven't tasted it yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Montalcino. Strolling into the Fattoria dei Barbi, a winery
and tavern on the outskirts of town, I was reminded of the Mondavi
estate in California. The place has impeccable style, yet it's very
low-key. Besides the Brunellos (which you can find at Atlanta's
Sotto Sotto), they make a grappa that is both firm-gripping and
complex. And a mighty sweet little Vin Santo. We bought one of each
to take home.
</P>
<P>
   Montalcino is an oenophile's dream.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly liked Enoteca Osteria Osticcio, where
English-speaking owner Tullio Scrivani set me up with a couple of
bottles of hard-to-come-by Gravner. The place also has a glassed-in
view of the valley that makes an inspiring nook for sitting and
sipping.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Monticchiello. Heading back to Montepulciano for the night, we
took Scrivani's advice and wended our way through this
speck-on-a-map town to try the home cooking at Taverna di Morando.
A cozy, romantic hideaway, it had a kitchen that could do no wrong.
Alice Waters and Atlanta's own Anne Quatrano (Floataway Cafe) would
probably weep over the simple, straightforward roasted rabbit and
lamb, redolent of garlic and rosemary. Best of all, everybody in
the place seemed to be having fun. And when we asked our waitress
to explain one dish (a pasta with duck), she quacked.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sinalunga. How did I love Locando dell'Amorosa? Let me count
the ways. Veal steak in a black olive crust with fried celery.
Grilled sea bass with red chicory salad. I could loll on the
grounds of this hotel-restaurant compound _ there's even a chapel _
for a very long time. It's the sort of place where you hope
tomorrow will never come.

SOME DOGS _ AND CATS, TOO _ LIKE TO EAT GRASS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: My dog is eating grasses whenever we are in rural
settings. What grasses can I plant for her? How do I care for them?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't say which grasses a dog prefers, and from what I've
read, no one is really sure why dogs even eat grass. Pet columnists
are often asked why dogs eat grass and then sometimes throw up.
Some theorize the animal does so because of a nutritional
deficiency; others believe it is to calm an upset stomach. A third
answer: Dogs graze for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   A diet of high-quality food and multiple vitamins, of course,
will ensure there is no nutritional deficiency. I've heard of dog
owners adding cooked green vegetables to the pet's diet to
discourage his eating grass.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be that some dogs _ and cats, too _ like to eat
grass because they like the taste or that it does actually calm
irritated stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen our pets munch on various ornamental grasses,
including Mexican feather grass, Japanese silver grass and purple
fountain grass. These grasses, especially the purple fountain
grass, are often available at nurseries. Avoid pesticide use on
``grazing'' grasses.
</P>
<P>
   I've also seen cats and dogs eat other grasses, even ``weedy''
types.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a winding flagstone walkway in our garden. The spaces
between the stones are filled with sand. After most rains the sand
washes out and must be refilled.
</P>
<P>
   A ground-cover book suggests Irish moss, and a local nursery
suggested Corsican grass. I cannot find either of these plants.
</P>
<P>
   Can you recommend something locally available that will tolerate
foot traffic, or can you tell me where I may find the two suggested
plants?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not have a source for either suggestions. Nor do I know
if they would even be good for your growing area. I would consider,
however, one or more of the following to plant between flagstones.
They should not be too difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   The dense, dark-green, 3-inch tufts of dwarf mondo grass
tolerate sun or shade and various soils but thrive in soil that
drains well. To ensure a little nutrition, work some humus into the
sand around your flagstones.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial herbs such as thyme and oregano will grow between the
stones in sun or partial sun, as will clumping sweet violets and
the diminutive, spreading Australian violets, which display small
leaves inches above the ground and tiny white and purple flowers on
slender stems. The soil need not be too rich but must drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Knotweed, ``Polygonum capitatum'' `Pink Buttons', hugs the
ground, spreading by jointed stems to form a mat of oval,
bronze-green foliage that turns red or orange in fall. Small, pink,
globelike blooms appear for months. I use this reliable creeper
between stones in bright shade and sun.
</P>
<P>
   Spotted leopard tongue, ``Mazus reptans,'' has narrow, toothed
leaves and violet or white flowers. This perennial ground cover
forms a mat in sun to bright shade.
</P>
<P>
   Ajuga, or bugleweed, is another consideration. This clumping
spreader is only 3 to 4 inches tall. It prefers partial sun to
light shade, and though ajuga likes water, this per- ennial needs
good drainage. Foliage coloring varies with cultivars; flowers may
be white or blue.
</P>
<P>
   Creeping Jenny (``Lysimachia nummularia'') is a low-grower that
accepts sun or shade. The small, rounded leaves are light green,
and as the plant spreads it roots at the nodes. Creeping Jenny is
approximately 4 inches tall and has yellow flowers in summer. It
likes a moist soil.
</P>
<P>
   There are several low-growing sedums that would work in a path.
The succulent leaves would provide a nice contrast to the stones.
In spring you would have a mass of tiny flowers. You could use more
than one type to heighten interest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The roots that appear on top of the ground around my red
maple trees make it difficult to mow. Is there something I can do
to keep these roots below the soil surface? I have tried chopping
the roots on top of the ground, but this is hard work.
</P>
<P>
   A: As with some trees, red maple roots may rise above the
surface as they mature and thicken. I would not chop the roots for
fear of damaging the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Tree roots generally are within the top 18 inches of soil. It's
possible to remove a larger root on some trees, but this should be
done one root at a time and only once a year. And I would only do
so under the guidance of an arborist.
</P>
<P>
   Water your trees deeply during long, dry spells so the soil is
moist several inches down. Shallow watering encourages roots to
rise to the moisture.
</P>
<P>
   I have a maple with a considerable root system, and because of
this and the shade the tree creates, I found it easy and attractive
to just use a ground cover beneath the tree's canopy.
</P>
<P>
   You might consider some of the following ground covers or simply
use a layer of mulch beneath the canopies of your trees.
</P>
<P>
   Variegated ``Vinca major,'' commonly called periwinkle, works
nicely under our large red maple. It has a loose and airy look, and
the white on the foliage brightens the shade. The trailing stems
root where they touch the ground, and before long the new plantlet
becomes a mound. But if you're after an instantly full look, buy
several 4-inch pots and pack them in beneath the tree. This plant
produces pretty blue flowers that appear among the white and green
foliage in spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ajuga and ardisia are among the most dependable ground covers
for use beneath shade trees. Others are Asian jasmine and liriope.
With variegated liriope you could vary the height by planting the
regular 12-inch size and the giant variegated liriope, which
matures to about 3 feet. I think the use of dwarf mondo grass is
attractive, too. I like the 3-inch-tall, dense, dark-green tufts.
</P>
<P>
   You might consider using ferns, either alone or with another
ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   Creeping Jenny (``Lysimachia nummularia''), mentioned earlier,
is a low-grower (4 inches tall) that accepts sun or shade and has
small, rounded, light-green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Australian violets, also mentioned previously, would work well.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ground cover you choose, remember to monitor the
moisture while the plants take root. If you go with a
moisture-lover, you'll need to make sure the big trees don't take
too much away from the ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to arrange plants in front of the fireplace
while it is not in use. There is no direct light and not much
reflected light in this area, but the room is well-lighted at
night. Which plants would be most suitable for such an area?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first plant that pops into my head as something that can
tolerate moderate light and low humidity is the mother-in-law
tongue, ``Sansevieria trifasciata.'' I'm sure you've seen this
plant _ it has vertical, fleshy foliage with light or dark-green
cross stripes; one variety has yellow margins.
</P>
<P>
   Mother-in-law tongue needs less-than-average watering and
biweekly to monthly applications of a standard liquid houseplant
food when actively growing. Water sparingly during winter.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese evergreen, ``Aglaonema commutatum,'' produces a
dome-shaped clump of gray-green leaves. Some have variegations.
While this plant tolerates less light than some, it does like
humidity and is best when its pot stands on a tray filled with
moist pebbles.
</P>
<P>
   Pothos ivy is an easy-to-grow standby. You might try aspidistra,
which produces its large, deep-green leaves in the shadiest spots
in the garden. Indoors it is tolerant of low light as well.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide the light is just too low for even these plants, a
large basket of dried flowers and foliage would be an easy
alternative. Large bouquets of hydrangea blossoms always look great
in baskets or vases. Dried poppy-seed pods and other seed pods also
make nice arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you please tell me why my bougainvillea does not bloom?
It was in full bloom when I bought it a year ago. It has no
evidence of any disease and has put on a lot of growth.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bougainvillea brachts seem to color best after repeated dry
periods, so watch the watering. Many people say the plants bloom
best when somewhat pot-bound.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a potash-rich (represented by the last number in the
formula) fertilizer at least twice a year _ in late spring and
midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners use hibiscus fertilizer, which has a high potash
number. One expert gets good color by applying 1 tablespoon of
hibiscus food and 1 tablespoon of Epsom salt each month. Always
water before and after fertilizing. There also are special,
controlled-release bougainvillea fertilizers on the market.

 INSIDE TREK &AMP; SCI-FI 
 SQUARE DEAL: NICOLE DE BOER AND `CUBE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., JULY 12, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Nicole de
Boer with Maurice Dean Wint, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a
scene from ``Cube.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The only thing smaller than the splash made by a microbudgeted
American movie is the one made by the same movie if it's from
Canada.
 &HT;    Ask Nicole de Boer, recent survivor of ``Star Trek: Deep Space
Nine.''
 &HT;    In 1998, just before she got her big break on the show, de Boer
co-starred in ``Cube,'' a nifty, futuristic drama about six
prisoners struggling to escape from a booby-trapped cube floating
in space. With a tiny $500,000 budget, the Canadian production
received rave reviews, raked in a few million dollars at the box
office and attracted a cult following.
 &HT;    ``Cult following,'' in this case, meaning that a lot of people
heard it was good but hardly anyone saw it.
 &HT;    That may change on Sat., July 24, however. At 9 p.m. (EDT)
``Cube'' will make its television debut on the Sci-Fi Channel. It
will almost certainly be seen by more people in that two-hour span
than have seen it in its entire existence to date.
 &HT;    ``I always knew it was a good film, but a lot of people never
see a lot of good films,'' de Boer says. ``Everybody was shocked at
how well `Cube' did. I guess it just really appeals to that kind of
a cult audience.
 &HT;    ``Now, with the film on video and on the Sci-Fi Channel, even
more people will get to see it,'' she adds. ``That can only be a
good thing.''
 &HT;    Anyone tuning in can expect a tense, taut affair, with de Boer
cast as Leaven, a math brainiac who just might help her fellow
prisoners get out alive. But that's only if the prisoners'
intensifying paranoia and frustration don't drive them to kill each
other as they trek from room to identical room in the
multidimensional cube.
 &HT;    ``It's basically about people, our existence and how we move
through this maze of life,'' the Canadian actress says by telephone
from a Toronto hotel, where she's staying while shooting ``Rated
X,'' an upcoming Showtime movie.
 &HT;    ```Cube' is also about how we deal with each other under
pressure, with the obstacles that come up in our lives,'' she says.
``Then, for Leaven, there's the whole math element, which I suck at
but find very cool. If I were in that cube, I'd probably just stay
there and never move.''
 &HT;    The film arrives on the small screen two months after ``DS9''
concluded its seven-year run. During the show's final season de
Boer played Ezri Dax, an untested Trill brought aboard the space
station as a counselor but thrust into the Federation-Dominion War.
 &HT;    By the series finale, ``What You Leave Behind,'' Ezri had earned
the respect of her crewmates and something more than respect from
Dr. Bashir (Alexander Siddig).
 &HT;    ``In some ways the year went by very quickly, and in some ways
it felt like a good, long year,'' says de Boer, a sci-fi veteran
whose credits include guest shots on ``The Outer Limits,''
``TekWar'' and ``Psi Factor,'' as well as a stint as a regular on
the Sci-Fi Channel series, ``Mission Genesis.''
 &HT;    ```DS9' was a very special experience, just to be on a `Trek'
show and be part of the whole `Trek' phenomenon,'' she says. ``I
was glad I got the opportunity. It's weird for me to sit here and
think I may never get to do it again, and it's when I think that
way that I think the year went by incredibly fast.''
 &HT;    As for the pairing-off of Ezri and Bashir _ whose first scene in
the finale featured them in bed together _ de Boer couldn't sound
happier.
 &HT;    ``They make a very cute couple,'' she says. ``The last scene
with them was very sweet, but that first scene was not so sweet _
it was pretty sexy, I thought!''
 &HT;    Though the future might hold some kind of ``DS9'' reunion
project, de Boer isn't waiting around. After ``Rated X,'' she's
already signed to star in ``Stalk,'' a dramatic thriller that goes
before the camera in August.
 &HT;    ``I can see on my fan sites that everybody is freaking out
because they think `Rated X' is some sort of porno movie,'' she
says, laughing. ``It's not a porno movie, but it is about the
Mitchell brothers, who sort of got the porno industry going in
California.
 &HT;    ``Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez play the brothers, and Emilio
is directing the movie,'' she says. ``I play the wife of one of the
guys _ and there are a bunch of actresses playing wives, because
they went through a number of marriages.
 &HT;    ``It's a good little part,'' she says. ``I'm happy to be working
and to be up here in Toronto and to be paid for working up here in
Toronto.''
 &HT;    And not to be doing science fiction, she adds.
 &HT;    ``I've done so much sci-fi in my career,'' de Boer says, ``and I
don't want to get too locked into it. I just want to keep working
and finding different roles in different kinds of projects.''

 Turkey after Ocalan  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death sentence a state security court handed down this week
for the leader of the violent Kurdish Workers Party, Abdullah
Ocalan, represents a temporary triumph against separatist and
terrorist forces. It also illuminates an identity crisis that
Turkey will have to resolve wisely if it wishes to fulfill the
modernizing aspirations of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the
Turkish nation-state that succeeded the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Impassioning as the fate of the convicted terrorist Ocalan may
appear to Turks and Kurds alike, it signifies but a dramatic high
point in Turkey's unacknowledged conflict between a rigid
definition of what it means to be Turkish and a conception of
nationality that includes the linguistic and cultural shadings of
diverse peoples.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist forms of resistance adopted by Ocalan's party,
known as the PKK, were made possible by the harsh denial of Kurdish
particularity within Turkey. Kurds who assimilated completely were
allowed to exercise the same civil rights as other Turks, but Kurds
who wanted their children to learn Kurdish in school or wanted to
broadcast and publish in their language were treated as enemies of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the poor, rural areas of southeastern Turkey,
the PKK's provocation has been great and the army's repression
savage. Kurdish terrorist attacks have killed thousands, and the
security forces have destroyed scores of villages and employed
torture and death squads.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish government of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit is
embarked on a modernizing program that includes reforms in banking
laws, social security, and the state security laws. For its own
sake and not merely to please members of the European Union who
have been hypocritical in their reluctance to grant Turkish
membership in the EU, the government of Turkey should undertake a
modernization that would allow the Kurds to become Turks without
ceasing to be Kurds. That would solve the problem of which Ocalan
was an effect, not a cause.

 &HT;    NEIGHBORHOOD'S REBIRTH IS SYMBOL OF NEW CLINTON ECONOMIC PUSH
 &HT;    With CLINTON-MARKETS-DATA. For release Sunday, July 4.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ By the time President Clinton gets to Phoenix this
week, the abandoned Rainbow Market, an adjoining deserted liquor
store and Wong's To Go Chinese Food will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Good riddance, say local residents and city officials. The
market, liquor store and carry-out are the last remains of the
city's most notorious intersection, 24th and Broadway, long a haunt
of drug dealers and crack heads, speakeasies and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection is the future site of the ``Four Corners''
development, a project that city planners believe is the key to the
economic revitalization of south Phoenix, the
wrong-side-of-the-tracks community in this booming southwestern
city. The planners envision professional and government offices,
shops, restaurants, a community center and movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But to be successful, ``Four Corners'' is going to need more
than the mix of federal start-up money and local tax dollars that
has nurtured the project so far. It will need the kind of private
investment the president is hoping to spur with his so-called ``New
Markets'' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton unveiled the ``New Markets'' initiative last January in
New York at the Rev. Jesse Jackson's ``Wall Street Project,'' an
effort to steer private investment to inner cities and rural areas
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal, a mix of tax breaks and loan
guarantees to businesses that locate in economically deprived
areas, has yet to be introduced in Congress. Even so, the
president, with corporate executives in tow, leaves Washington on
Tuesday for a six-state, four-day tour of economic trouble spots to
promote the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Phoenix, the group will visit Appalachia, the
Mississippi Delta, the inner cities of Watts and East St. Louis,
and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where
unemployment currently stands at 72 percent. The trip will end with
a conference in Anaheim, Calif., where Clinton will exhort
executives to invest in these and similar communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the strongest economy on record, all right, but
there are still too many poor neighborhoods and rural communities
where prosperity is something you read about, not experience,''
Clinton said recently. ``We want to shine a spotlight on the
pockets of poverty that remain in America, and on the potential
they have for new investment, new jobs, new hope, new
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of his administration, Clinton has marched to
the Rose Garden to trumpet one happy economic development after
another. But this week's trip is an acknowledgement that not every
boat has risen with the tide of the largest economic expansion in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the unfinished business of the Clinton agenda,'' said
Al From, the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) official who was
one of the architects of the ``New Democrat'' initiatives that
Clinton rode to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix seems an unlikely stop for Clinton's ``New Markets''
tour compared to the other stubborn pockets of poverty he'll visit.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is a hub for manufacturing, technology and financial
services. It has grown from less than 6,000 in 1900 to 1.2 million
today, the 7th most populous city in the country and the
fastest-growing large city since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its travel-brochure image of swaying palms,
shimmering pools, lush golf courses and major league sports
franchises, some areas of the city are anything but an oasis.
Crime, unemployment and poverty are pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in south Phoenix, and especially around 24th and
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real battlefield _ shootouts almost every night,''
said Melissa Rider, 34, a police officer and lifelong resident of
south Phoenix. Sitting in her police cruiser in front of the
Rainbow Market, she recalled the gun fights she often witnessed
there as a teenager while driving home from high school dances.
``Everybody raced through because nobody ever wanted to get caught
by a red light,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But things began to change in 1989, when neighborhood activists,
organized as the Community Excellence Project Inc., presented a
plan to the Phoenix City Council for reclaiming their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The effort accelerated in 1994 when a 19.9-square-mile area of
south and central Phoenix was declared an ``enterprise community,''
or ``EC,'' under one of the major anti-poverty programs of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The designation provided the city of Phoenix with a $3 million
grant to create jobs and spur private investments. And two EC
``success stories'' were suggested by city officials to the White
House to be included on the president's south Phoenix itinerary:
the Moreno Welding Inc. and the I.G. Homes Boys and Girls Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out with a $100 bill in my pocket,'' said Leonard
Moreno, standing in the 108-degree heat of the dusty back lot of
Moreno Welding, the business he started 20 years ago in this
worn-down industrial area located less than two miles from 24th and
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a boast, but Moreno is clearly proud of his success.
Moreno Welding grosses nearly $2 million a year today and employs
between 15 and 20 workers who make between $14 and $20 an hour.

   But what really boosted Moreno's business was a $75,000 loan
guarantee he got in 1995 under the EC program, allowing him to buy
equipment he desperately needed in order to compete for larger
contracts. ``That let me be able to do what I've done,'' he said.
Now he needs additional financial backing to expand his shop.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Moreno Welding may not appear to be a success
story. The parking lot is gravel and the trailer that once served
as offices is surrounded with a chain-link fence topped with razor
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the neighborhood surrounding the I.G. Homes Boys
and Girls Club, the streets are pock-marked with dilapidated houses
that the city is trying to reclaim.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the club is a state-of-the-art computer learning lab
and an on-site dental clinic that provides virtually free care to
10 children a day, four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The club received $75,000 in EC funds two years ago and has
leveraged an additional $465,000 to refurbish the facility and add
the learning center and the dental clinic. It is one of only two
Boys and Girls Clubs in the country that provides dental care for
nominal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could I be a millionaire somewhere else? Probably,'' says
Richard Landgren, or ``Dr. Rick,'' as he is known to the kids at
the club. ``Can I make a difference here? Absolutely,'' he adds.
``But there's a whole conglomeration of people here who are
dedicated to making a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way it's supposed to work _ not just government
but a public and private partnership,'' says Gail Knight, executive
director of the Community Excellence Project. All south Phoenix
needs now is for private investors to look beyond the area's
reputation and recognize its market potential, she adds.

of low unemployment. The system, which has evolved from the U.S.

``Summer of Sam,'' he attempts an almost touching dramatization of

date of Satchmo's entry into this mortal realm. Some say he was
born sometime in 1898. But he said he was born July 4, 1900. And if
that's the way that cat wanted it, he earned the right to go down

`LOVE ETC..': A MILLENNIUM ROMANTIC TRIANGLE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAERENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to the philosophical French to re-examine the romantic
triangle in the light of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But because the new epoch has yet to arrive, the conclusion
reached by the inquiry that is ``Love Etc.,'' opening Friday in New
York City, can only be speculative.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the triangle remains eternally fascinating, and
whether or not the viewer is convinced by the resolution reached by
``Love Etc.'' in its final scene, on Jan. 1, 2000, getting there is
more than half the fun; pondering what one would do in the shoes of
its principal characters adds more.
</P>
<P>
   This film, reminiscent of Truffaut's 1961 classic, ``Jules et
Jim,'' tells the story of Benoit, a shy, staid bank employee who
falls in love with Marie, a young woman he meets through a
personals ad (using as bait a picture of Pierre, his best friend),
marries her and slowly realizes that his friend has mounted a
campaign to win her away.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Marion Vernoux from a screenplay by Dodine Herry and
Ms. Vernoux adapted from ``Talking It Over,'' a novel by Julian
Barnes, ``Love Etc.'' makes the most of convincing performances by
Charlotte Gainsbourg, who won a Cesar nomination for best actress
as the torn Marie; Yves Attal as Benoit, who finds and loses the
greatest happiness he has ever known, and Charles Berling as
Pierre, the feckless, egocentric teacher of literature who has been
Benoit's friend since their school days.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Benoit, in his early 30s, is overjoyed at his
good fortune at winning Marie, a pretty art restorer in her mid-20s
who is taken with his innate decency if not exactly swept away by
love.
</P>
<P>
   On their sunny wedding day, Benoit is pleased that things worked
out for him. Marie tells herself that Benoit is good and kind and
that he loves her. And Pierre suddenly realizes that he is in love
with Marie.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to happen now?'' he asks himself.
</P>
<P>
   Artfully treading a fine line between operatic tragedy and
romantic comedy as it drips the poison of betrayal into the heady
elixir of love, ``Love Etc.'' proceeds unwaveringly and with rising
tension until it reaches its debatable denouement on the Channel
coast at the advent of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Etc.'' is at its best at raising questions and depicting
how three ordinary people approach a solution to the personal
mathematics of an age-old problem in relationships.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES

<P>
   The smell from an old lady's armpits can raise your spirits, a
scientist in Pennsylvania claims. Her work also suggests that in
contrast, the scent of a young child does nothing to improve your
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Studies using animals have shown that smell is vital for
conveying information. Rodents can detect and transmit fear through
smell, for instance, and animals often identify a high-ranking
member of a group by its smell. A recent study has shown that
people can distinguish the body odor of both happy and fearful
people.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of body odor on people's moods has hardly been
explored at all.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Chen of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia
hoped to find out more. So she recruited 30 volunteers in six
different categories: girls and boys aged between 3 and 8, young
adult women and men in their early 20s and elderly women and men in
their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers all gave samples of their body odor by strapping
a gauze pad under each armpit and keeping it there for 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were not allowed to use any perfumes or
deodorants, or eat strong-smelling foods, in the four days before
the samples were collected. They could shower, but only with
unscented soap and shampoo. Odors were also collected from the
homes of all the donors and combined into a neutral control smell.
</P>
<P>
   Chen then asked 308 university students to complete a 36-part
questionnaire that assessed how positive their mood was. Then they
smelled the gauze pads from one of the six categories of people _
without being told what the smells were. After this, the students
answered the questionnaire a second time, this time with the
questions shuffled around.
</P>
<P>
   People who had inhaled the samples taken from old women's
armpits responded significantly more positively, Chen found. ''Old
women had an uplifting effect,'' she says. The smell of young men,
on the other hand, produced a depressive effect. In general, the
smell of older people improved mood, as did smells from females,
Chen will report in a future issue of the journal Physiology and
Behaviour.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Haviland, of Rutgers University in New Jersey, who
also worked on the project, says it's possible that hormones make
the body odor of young people signal aggression. But hormonal
changes may make the odor of older people, especially women, signal
that they are approachable. Alternatively, it could be that women
in their golden years are generally happy, and that their odor can
transmit this mood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The airborne chemicals that we collected from them _ ''l'eau
de grandmere'' _ may indicate that state,'' says Haviland. &QL;

   A few radar operators from RAF airborne early-warning aircraft
have taken their annual leave to coincide with the Wimbledon tennis
matches so that they can help the BBC anticipate rain at the
championships. The operators are working for David Morton, who runs
RaceNet Radar Systems of Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't stop the rain coming. But we can predict when it will
arrive to within a couple of minutes, so the BBC can reschedule its
programs,'' Morton says.
</P>
<P>
   RaceNet has developed a local weather radar based on the
hardware used on supertankers, but it needs skilled operators to
work with the proprietary software. A 2.5-meter antenna, mounted on
top of the 75-meter crane that the BBC uses for bird's-eye camera
shots, sends out a 9-gigahertz radar signal. The signal bounces off
any clouds that are heavy with water, which are displayed on a
computer screen as yellow patches. As a cloud moves, it leaves a
blue tail across the screen which shows which direction it is
moving.
</P>
<P>
   After plotting a cloud and its tail for six minutes, the team of
five operators calculates its speed and direction, and predicts
where it will be in 45 minutes and how long it will take to move
on. If the Wimbledon courts look a likely target, the team alerts
the BBC's Television Center in London, where staff line up
prerecorded programmes to fill the gap. &QL;

   A study of changes in wind patterns linked to global warming
over the past 50 years suggests they are slowing the planet's daily
spin by around half a millisecond every century. These effects open
up a new way of tracking the progress of global warming without the
uncertainties in simple temperature measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean currents associated with El Nio are already known to make
equatorial winds blow faster and boost the angular momentum of the
atmosphere. Momentum must be conserved, so the atmosphere steals
momentum from the Earth's rotation, making it spin more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite observations showed that last year's El Nio made days
drag on by an extra 0.4 milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might
have a similar effect. Computer models of the effects of warming
point to the appearance of jets of fast-moving wind between the
troposphere and stratosphere, roughly 12 kilometers above the
Earth's surface. These would also boost the angular momentum of the
atmosphere, triggering a compensating slowing down in the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rodrigo Abarca del Rio of the French space agency's Toulouse
Space Center has looked for direct evidence of this. Over the past
50 years, the Earth's average temperature has been increasing by
around 0.79 C per century.
</P>
<P>
   Using wind data for the same period from the U.S. National
Centers for Atmospheric Research and Environmental Prediction,
Abarca del Rio calculated the angular momentum of the atmosphere.
He found it had increased in step with the temperature rise
</P>
<P>
   ''There has also been a net loss in angular momentum by the
solid Earth,'' he says. ''The data suggest that global warming has
caused a slowdown of the Earth at a rate of 0.56 milliseconds a
century.''
</P>
<P>
   This implies that global warming is responsible for almost
one-third of the slowing down in the Earth's spin scientists have
measured. It also suggests that the length of the day could provide
a means of monitoring global warming in future. Every 0.1 degree C
increase should produce a slowdown of 0.07 milliseconds, which is
easy to measure.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abarca del Rio says too many other complex effects
influence the Earth's spin, such as movement of molten rock beneath
its surface. Instead, he suggests using records on atmospheric
angular momentum, which have been kept since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Records of surface air temperature have been the main measure
of global warming,'' says Abarca del Rio. ''Measurements of
atmospheric angular momentum may be an easier and more reliable
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaki Satoh, a climate modeler at Saitama Institute of
Technology in Japan, agrees that the results could provide a new
and better way to monitor global warming. ''Atmospheric angular
momentum is increased by the El Nio event, so it is reasonable that
it should also increase with global warming.''  &QL;

probes with which they extract honey and insects from trees, and
dig out seeds from fruits protected by stinging hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Orangutans are found only in Borneo and Sumatra, and 90 percent
of them have been lost over the past century. The total population
was estimated at less than 40,000 even before the latest upsurge in
logging and the forest fires that have ravaged Borneo since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Suaq Balimbing orangutans live in an area of tropical forest
teeming with biting insects. ''It's a horrible place for research,
a fetid swamp, but it's orangutan paradise,'' says primatologist
Ian Singleton of the University of Kent at Canterbury, who has
recently returned from the area. Not only can the orangutans wield
tools, but they are more gregarious than most.
</P>
<P>
   The research station lies within the Gunung-Leuser National
Park. This is part of the Leuser Ecosystem, an area of tropical
rainforest extending over 2.5 million hectares. But the resignation
of Indonesia's President Suharto in May last year has created an
unstable situation. ''Because of the political uncertainty,
everyone is making the most of what they can get,'' says Singleton.
Loggers have been openly flouting regulations and removing many of
the large trees that provide the orangutans with their food.
</P>
<P>
   The apes are especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Even
selective logging has a drastic impact on populations. Females are
almost totally sedentary, and when large feeding trees are removed
they become malnourished. According to Kathryn Monk of the
Zoological Society of London, a scientific coordinator with the
Leuser Management Unit, half of the research area has already been
affected by logging. Even if the apes survive, she fears that the
disturbance could endanger their unique social behavior and tool
use.
</P>
<P>
   Some research students have even been threatened by loggers.
''In the past week, we've had meetings with local people and local
and provincial government. Everyone is giving their support,'' says
Monk. ''But in the longer term, we are concerned about encroachment
throughout the whole park.'' &QL;

RURAL RACES ARE KEY IN 2000 BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a remark that Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.,
the Kennedy family scion on Capitol Hill, would later regret.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, the day House Democrats and moderate Republicans
rejected gun control legislation that they argued was too watered
down, Kennedy was asked how his party's strategy would play in
rural districts that traditionally frown on gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, which organizes and supports Democratic candidates for
House seats, replied that his party had already ``written off the
rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy statement came as a shock, especially in light of
the fact that Democrats succeeded in 1998 in slimming the
Republican House majority to six seats by electing three
conservative, anti-abortion and pro-gun Democrats in rural areas in
Mississippi, Kentucky and southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy quickly backed off his dismissive statement and has
since talked up Democratic prospects in conservative rural areas
that increasingly have gone Republican in the past few decades.
Later he called his comment an ``emotional response'' uttered amid
controversy over guns, an issue close to a family that suffered the
assassinations of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and New York
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage had been done and Republicans gleefully called
attention to his gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the chairman of the committee charged with electing
Democrats says in essence moderate-to-conservative Democrats need
not apply, that sends a chilling message for candidate
recruitment,'' said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., whose far-flung
16-country district is based in Midland, Mich. ``I hope they pursue
that political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp is a leader of the Republicans' organization to win GOP
House seats.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar over Kennedy's remark underscores a crucial factor in
the Democrats' bid to retake control of the House after five years
in the minority: Democratic conservatives are the party's only hope
for winning rural districts, particularly in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't run as a Massachusetts Democrat down there,'' said
Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, rural America would seem an unlikely site for a
political battleground. More and more, the U.S. population is
concentrating itself in urban areas _ a category that incorporates
cities, suburbs and exurbs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, 54.4 percent of the U.S. population of 92.2 million
lived in rural areas and 45.6 lived in urban areas, according to
Census Bureau figures. By 1990 with the population at 248.7
million, those percentages were 75.2 percent urban and 24.3 percent
rural.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the Republicans holding a thin 223-211 majority (and
independent Rep. Bernard Sanders usually siding with Democrats),
every district counts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats theoretically could retake the House without victories
in rural districts. But party activists and political experts see
that as highly improbable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to take back the House without
winning rural districts,'' said Giles Perkins, executive director
of the Alabama Democratic Party. ``And we're optimistic that some
of those wins will be in Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, in fact, is a good measure of how far Democrats have
fallen in rural areas over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the state _ which has no purely urban congressional
districts _ had five Democratic representatives and two
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the year before Republicans seized control, the
Democratic margin was 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Republicans control the delegation 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 election, ``it's very difficult to see much
potential for Democrats given the incredible success of
Republicans'' in these districts, said Q. Whitfield Ayres, an
Atlanta-based Republican pollster and political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   To have a chance of winning, he added, a Democrat would have to
be facing a non-incumbent Republican in a district with a
significant percentage of votes from African-Americans, a
traditional Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts in the South said the region is particularly
keen on returning incumbents to office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an incumbent, you get to know your constituents so well
that they will overlook your partisanship (if they disagree with
it),'' said Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political
science professor. ``In the past, this worked for Democrats. Now it
helps Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, who chaired the 1998 Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, made a virtue out of recruiting
conservative Democrats who could win rural districts by proclaiming
that they, like their Republican adversaries, also were
anti-abortion and pro-gun.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy produced victories by Rep. Ronnie Shows, D-Miss.,
Rep. Ken Lucas, D-Ky., and Rep. Dave Phelps, D-Ill., all of whom
ran as conservatives on social issues. At the same time, they
argued that as Democrats, they were more committed than their GOP
adversaries to propping up bedrock government programs such as
Social Security and Medicare.

</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy took the reins of the DCCC for the 2000 election
cycle, political observers wondered whether a New England liberal
would maintain the same recruitment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to DCCC spokesman John Del Cecato, is
``Yes.'' He cited several examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Louisiana, Marjorie McKeithen, anti-abortion and pro-gun
granddaughter of a former Democratic governor, is set for a rematch
against Rep. Richard Baker, R-La. Baker beat McKeithen in 1998 by a
margin of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Texas, conservative rice farmer Loy Sneary will again
challenge libertarian-minded Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas. It's an uphill
battle for Sneary, having lost to Paul in 1998 by 11 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Pennsylvania, conservative Pat Casey, son of anti-abortion
former Gov. Robert Casey, will take another crack at Rep. Don
Sherwood, R-Pa. Sherwood won his first term in 1998 by beating
Casey by 515 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say the success we've had in recruiting
candidates who are a good fit for their district will continue, Del
Cecato said.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one incumbent says the key is to avoid social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, whose district stretches from
Beaumont to Galveston, describes himself as a supporter of abortion
rights and an opponent of gun controls. But he concentrates on
bread-and-butter issues such as trying to help out his district's
economically troubled rice farmers by lifting U.S. food embargoes
against nations such as Cuba and Iraq.

`SHILOH 2': SEQUEL TO A BEAGLE'S TROUBLED PAST
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

<P>
   It would be so easy to make fun of Friendly, W.Va., where the
little yellow school bus rolls by, reading ``Friendly Elementary
School'' on the side. And it would be easy to ridicule the
Prestons, who live there and are so down home that their television
set doesn't even have a remote.
</P>
<P>
   The Prestons are wise, hard-working parents; the town has a
kindly country doctor; the new schoolteacher is too sweet to be
true. ``Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season'' could have turned sappy or
simple-minded in many ways, but it never does _ despite the
numerous close-ups of the title character, a soulful-eyed beagle
with a troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, ``Shiloh'' introduced young filmgoers (at least
those who had not already read Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's Newbery
Medal-winning book) to the Prestons and their son, Marty, who
befriended an abused dog and worked hard to make the dog his own.
</P>
<P>
   The dog, which Marty named Shiloh, had belonged to Judd Travers,
a solitary, tobacco-spitting, beer-drinking misanthrope, the
meanest man in town.
</P>
<P>
   In the wise, engaging, truly heartwarming sequel, Judd, again
played by Scott Wilson, is up to no good, drinking a lot, reneging
on his deal with Marty, shooting his hunting rifle when and where
he shouldn't, and driving his pickup truck all too recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   Marty, a seventh grader at this point, is now played by Zachary
Browne, who bears a major resemblance to the actress Frances
Fisher. Michael Moriarty and Ann Dowd return as Marty's parents.
Rod Steiger returns as Doc Wallace, who saved Shiloh's life in the
first film.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the plot is that it is made up of little
terrors, the thousands of near-tragedies that make up most people's
real lives. Oh my God, where's Becky? She was just here playing
hide-and-seek. Oh my God, where has Shiloh run off to now _ and
isn't that the sound of gunfire in the woods? Oh my God, isn't that
Jake's truck heading straight for the dog?
</P>
<P>
   When something does go terribly wrong and Shiloh starts barking
wildly, it's a refreshing touch of reality that no one can figure
out what's wrong. (None of that ``What's that, Lassie? Timmy's in
the well?'' stuff for these people.)
</P>
<P>
   The moral question in ``Shiloh 2'' is whether people really can
change _ specifically, whether anything could affect Judd enough to
``wipe a whole life of meanness away.'' But this is a smart,
sensitive movie _ based on the second book in Ms. Naylor's trilogy
and written by Dale Rosenbloom, who both wrote and directed the
first ``Shiloh'' film _ about morality in general.
</P>
<P>
   When Marty's friend David (Joe Pichler) wants to spy on Judd,
Marty doesn't want to, for two good reasons: because he's afraid
they'll get caught and because he said he wouldn't. David and Marty
actually talk about whether Judd is mean because his parents were
awful to him or if he was just born that way. And when they ask
adults for wisdom, they don't get pap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tests of life, they get harder,'' Doc Wallace tells Marty.
Later, Doc explains: ``Kindness in life is something you have to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   At school the teacher discusses the important difference between
truth and gossip. And in the end, kindness does pay off, with just
a dash of sentimentality and the touch of a little paw.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shock in the sequel is Marty's visit to David's
house for a sleepover. The house has a high-ceilinged marble foyer
with a chandelier, and the household has a cook. Who knew there was
money in town?
</P>

`SUMMER OF SAM': RED HOT BUTTONS IN LEE'S STEAMING `SAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spike Lee's fiery ``Summer of Sam'' has as much to do with the
summers of 1989 and 1999 as it does with the tabloid fevers of
1977, which are so electrifyingly rekindled here. It was in 1989
that the film of Lee's that ``Summer of Sam'' most resembles, ``Do
the Right Thing,'' arrived on the wave of sensationalism and
outrage that continue to swamp some of his best efforts.
</P>
<P>
   So here he is fielding complaints about having bruised the
tender feelings of David Berkowitz, the .44 caliber killer whose
murderous rampage and purple prose brought New York City to the
boiling point 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lee didn't make up Berkowitz's crimes. And he didn't make them
central to his furiously enthralling ``Summer of Sam,'' either.
What may surprise anyone following the publicity maelstrom around
the director's latest effort is that its Son of Sam aspects, while
fiendishly vivid, are only the backdrop for a film that is much
more lurid in other regards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' pushes sexual hot buttons even more
emphatically, to the point where it also pushes the envelope for
raw talk and raunchy eroticism on screen.
</P>
<P>
   That may be standard practice for the summer of 1999, but it
still invites some second thoughts. In a season when Austin Powers
has schoolchildren kidding about Swedish penis enhancers and the
casual props for ``Wild Wild West'' include bondage gear and a
severed head, it's time to wonder how much the traffic will bear.
</P>
<P>
   Our notions of prurience require some rethinking when an
otherwise routine thriller like ``The General's Daughter'' cashes
in on a naked, spread-eagled corpse. That's an image far more
obscene than anything the hilarious, willfully filthy ``South Park:
Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``South Park'' earns its blue streak by treating both
the foul-mouthed and the self-righteous with a wicked satirical
edge, ``Summer of Sam'' earns its steam heat. That was, first of
all, a legitimate sign of the times. The director plunges his
audience headlong into a pre-AIDS libidinous frenzy sweeping enough
to encompass disco, punk, drugs, screaming headlines and hysterical
prejudices, none of this made any less frenzied by the specter of a
killer on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Son of Sam is used as a deranged catalyst, seen
writhing in black socks and boxer shorts as he howls at the dog
next door. It's some measure of the film's own pressure-cooker
madness that David Berkowitz no longer seems like the most tortured
soul onscreen as ``Summer of Sam'' reaches its savage finale.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a xenophobic, embattled Bronx neighborhood where
non-Italian Americans are regarded with deep suspicion, ``Summer of
Sam'' shares the ``Do the Right Thing'' affinity for local color.
That the color is white this time makes surprisingly little
difference to Lee's approach.
</P>
<P>
   These characters roam the neighborhood, affect macho posturing
and endlessly shoot the breeze just as the filmmaker's
Bedford-Stuyvesant characters did. And they become embroiled in a
story with similar slow-building but unstoppable momentum, as that
scorching summer's craziness starts to tear old friendships apart.
</P>
<P>
   In a raging, startlingly visceral performance, John Leguizamo
plays Vinny, a blend of sexual insatiability and status quo. Vinny
hews loyally to the community's provincial attitudes, but he also
has a libido that's spinning him out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Like every major character in just about any of Lee's films, he
is thinly conceived but wildly vibrant anyhow, especially when the
story pits him against Ritchie (Adrien Brody), a boyhood friend who
has taken on rebellious affectations.
</P>
<P>
   You could say that the tension between them boils down to
nothing more interesting than a schism between punk and disco.
(Like all of Lee's fiction films, this one is steeped in pop
cultural references and a hugely effective musical score.) Or you
could just sit back and watch two tough, furious actors making
their moves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The film's interesting if tricky conceit is to give each of
them, and many of the other figures in a busy screenplay written by
Lee, Victor Colicchio and the actor Michael Imperioli, some kind of
double life. These dichotomies rivet attention even when they're
hackneyed, like Vinny's Madonna-whore cheating on his wife, Dionna
(Mira Sorvino), or farfetched, like Ritchie's allegedly
heterosexual yen for the world of gay porn.
</P>
<P>
   Credible plotting doesn't always come easily to Lee, but wild
verve does; this film, like the dazzling but many-tentacled ``He
Got Game'' before it, makes up in fury much of what it lacks in
form. It overflows with lurid, posturing characters who define the
limits of the small world in which they live.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's love-hate relationship with cultural stereotypes remains
alive and well. He brings the same jokey familiarity to this film
that he has to his Brooklyn stories. And for every blunt, dead-end
detail (there is quite literally a ``Dead End'' sign here, flanked
by the colors of the Italian flag), there's a sharp one, like the
addict in this waterfront neighborhood who tries to sell broken
lobsters at cut rates.
</P>
<P>
   If many of the particulars and much of the talk here are
exceptionally coarse, that too is a well-established part of Lee's
arsenal. ``Summer of Sam,'' which easily accommodates a brief scene
at Plato's Retreat and the knock-down, drag-out marital fight that
follows it, is intent on making this a long, hot summer in more
ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorvino is radiant and poignant as Vinny's disco queen with
her own double life as a girlish waitress; Jennifer Esposito makes
a tough foil for Ritchie; Bebe Neuwirth turns the local beauty
parlor into her personal den of iniquity, and Patti Lupone vamps
frighteningly as Ritchie's slatternly mother. But ``Summer of Sam''
unfolds in what is very much a man's world.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more than a couple of Michaels (Rispoli and
Imperioli) linking it to ``The Sopranos,'' or to the Martin
Scorsese ambience it vaguely echoes. But Lee's Italian-American
world and the mounting anger that consumes it are consistent enough
with his earlier work to be his own more than anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Gazarra (as a cool mobster), Anthony LaPaglia (as a
detective), Ken Garito and Brian Tarantino are among those who
bring it to life, with Michael Badalucco seen briefly as the eerie
killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' is loaded with visual energy thanks to Ellen
Kuras' bold, inventive cinematography, a nonstop array of tricks
(time to give those lengthening, distorting lenses seen in
``Crooklyn'' a rest), and editing that's sometimes abrupt,
sometimes formidable. Two standout montages edited to suit
hard-hitting, emblematic Who songs (from ``Who's Next'') perfectly
capture the blazing chaos of the season in hell that Lee recalls. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTIONB NOTES
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes strong profanity, sexual
situations, frequent references to oral and anal sex, and
intermittent brutal but quick glimpses of violence. &QL;

 &HT;    Promised greenhouse rekindles orchid interest
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Barbara Davis made it crystal clear. She'd
pick up and leave her beloved Savannah (Ga.) for a home here in the
hills on one condition: Her husband, Ed, had to build a greenhouse
for her orchids.
</P>
<P>
   So, in June 1998, the couple moved into the big house on a rise
that affords an inspiring view of the mountains. Soon after they
joined our neighborhood, I'd drive by and see them marking the land
_ planting a tree here, another there, putting in a flower patch
that now includes a great stand of hollyhocks. On some days, the
red Corvette would stand out on the driveway next to the pickup,
top down, sunning.
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know that behind this idyllic scene, Barbara was
metaphorically tapping her feet, waiting for her orchid house.
After a decent interval, Barbara recalled the other day, she
reminded her husband: ``You promised me a greenhouse; what about
that promise?''
</P>
<P>
   We've all been there. Part of the rhythm of relationships is
finding a way to balance two competing needs: the need for
do-nothing time and the need to keep the household chores done in
timely fashion, thus keeping family ties harmonious. So prevalent
is this tug of opposing interests that the expression ``honey do
list'' is part of the language, always inspiring snickers and great
rolling of eyes. I mention that here, knowing that my own list
contains a glaring item that has remained undone for many months: I
just cannot get around to fixing that shelf under the sink.
</P>
<P>
   But compared to Ed's big-ticket chore, mine is mercifully
paltry; fortunately, for Lyn and for unhandy me, I never promised
her a greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   With such a big commitment hanging in the air, Ed had no choice
but to deliver. And, he did so with skill and enthusiasm. On my
drives by, I noticed the framework rising next to the house. And,
in what seemed an amazingly short period, a whole greenhouse
greeted me one day as I drove past.
</P>
<P>
   This was months ago. Since then, I had wondered about the
greenhouse _ who was its prime keeper, what plants it grows.
</P>
<P>
   I decided not to just drop in, but I did think of practicing the
old country custom that prevailed before telephones allowed us to
call ahead: Walk to a neighbor's home and stand in the front yard.
If someone looks out, sees you and comes out to chat, you visit. If
no one does, you go away. Ed's ``Why don't you come over and see
our greenhouse'' made that unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into the hot humid greenhouse on a recent Saturday made
me understand. It was Barbara's Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Ed had delivered on his promise _ really delivered. He not only
built his wife a home for her orchids; he built her a coastal
climate, its air regulated by both a heater and cooling system.
``He's prouder about this than anything,'' says Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   And so is she. Guiding us through her lush collection, she
caressed the names. Dendrobium, cymbidium ... some producing tiny
blooms, others largish ones. Yellows, pinks, whites. There seemed
to be hundreds of them. In fact, there are, says Barbara _ about
500. Their elegant, delicate-looking flowers persist with iron
will. In June, she pointed to flowers that had been around since
March and showed no signs of faltering.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing her wealth, Barbara, whose talents include painting
evocative botanicals, sets aside some of the plants and tags them
with names of friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, this visit to Barbara's Savannah inspired me to think
about giving orchids a go, again, something I haven't done in a
while. Over the years, I have had no problem growing them; it's
getting them to bloom again that gives me trouble. My greatest
re-blooming success was with a phalaenopsis that I set in a shady
spot outside after watching it languish indoors for a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   I forgot about it for months, letting it take care of itself,
drinking from the rain, until I noticed blooms on it. What a lovely
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, abandoning neglect, I'll go in another direction. No, I
won't even attempt to build a greenhouse. Instead, I'll try
providing orchid essentials _ high humidity and good air
circulation _ by stashing the plants where they feel the breezes
along the ridge and the humidity from Fightingtown Creek. And if
this works half as well as Barbara's greenhouse, I'll call it my
Savannah.

 &HT;    Lights, mirrors, mood: Decorators share tips
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few trade secrets of model home decorators:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To make the house look larger, designers use light-colored
carpeting and flooring. They use furnishings judiciously, keeping
them on the perimeter of rooms. And occasionally they use mirrored
walls as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paint colors and furnishings generally reflect the way people
live now. Some designers mine ideas from shelter magazines and
catalogs such as Crate &AMP; Barrel. They purchase furnishings and
accessories where their target market is likely to shop, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Decorators seek to inspire envy. A model home isn't just about
how you live today; it's about the lifestyle to which you aspire in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Designers put together a few looks that visitors can re-create
inexpensively at home. Conversely, they showcase a few things that
visitors don't have at home and probably won't add: spa baths,
separate showers, built-in cabinetry, updated kitchens. That way,
they'll start thinking about buying a new house with all those
features.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To make visitors remember the model, designers tap into
nostalgia and community interests. For example, Kaye Graham Designs
put together an airplane-themed child's bedroom for a Southside
community aimed at pilots with families.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Color palettes vary depending on the cost of the house and its
potential buyers. Homes aimed at first-time buyers usually have
brighter colors. The look turns more neutral for upper-income
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Designers accessorize, accessorize, accessorize. Details
create a mood and make a house more memorable.

 &HT;    A passion for home fashion drives many to tour models, show
houses
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just looking,'' you say as you breeze through the
door, past the price sheets and floor plans, the community map and
the agent eager to take down your phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Just looking for decorating ideas. Just looking for an
entertaining, free way to fill a weekend afternoon. Just looking to
see how the other half lives.
</P>
<P>
   Designer show house tours are hard to find this time of year.
But day in and day out, no matter the season, there are always
dozens of gussied-up model homes to see around metro Atlanta _ and
thousands showing up to tour them. Model homes exist to sell
subdivisions, but on any given weekend, many of the people walking
through them are not home-buyers, but budding Martha Stewarts just
looking for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   People like Karin Meyer, 36, who took photos of the paint on the
dining room picture molding during a recent visit to Pathway
Communities' SummerGrove in Newnan (Ga.), a model home nirvana with
nine decorated homes from eight builders.
</P>
<P>
   People like Claudia Vital, her daughter, Sabra LeBlanc, 26, and
granddaughter Quianna LeBlanc, 3, who visit model homes once a
month for some air-conditioned window-shopping. At SummerGrove,
they puzzled over why some walls in a master bedroom were painted
dark green and others beige (the paler walls face the windows, to
reflect light, they decided) and admired the accessorizing that had
matched a straw chair with straw matting around a zebra print.
</P>
<P>
   The Newnan residents have spent years comparing notes on houses
in Fayetteville (Ga.), Peachtree City (Ga.), LaGrange (Ga.) and
farther afield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked in Texas as well,'' Vital says. ``Everywhere we
go, we look.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Vicky Foster, 47. On trips to Disney World and the
Florida Panhandle, she's toured houses at Celebration and Seaside.
In metro Atlanta, she's ranged as far north as Cherokee County to
tour the gigantic planned community of BridgeMill and hits all the
big show home tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a compulsion,'' Foster says. ``I think I should have been
a decorator, but I didn't know it when I went to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she teaches business at Forest Park High School and
satisfies her decorating urge by watching HGTV, shopping for
furnishings she spots in model homes and gleaning ideas to spiff up
her Fayette County house. Like many, she's searching for
window-treatment inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   And that's OK with the developers who set up model homes. They
figure that today's looker might be next year's buyer, or have a
friend in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people come in and bring cameras and measuring
tape,'' says Heidi Carr, marketing manager for Centex Homes'
Atlanta division. ``I walked in on a lady one day who'd torn apart
the bedding in the master bedroom and was measuring and taking
pictures and writing down colors. She was so embarrassed, but I
told her `don't be.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye Graham, owner of Kaye Graham Designs of Alpharetta (Ga.),
just might be the queen of model home tours. Her company
specializes in models, decorating between 30 to 50 annually in
Atlanta and elsewhere. They get many of their ideas from
California, where the staff of four visits as many as 40 models in
a weekend.

   ``Nobody wants what they can afford today,'' Graham says. ``You
have to romance them with things they could do in a house, or
things they would want to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the master suite of the model at Garrison Oaks, a
Williamscraft Community in east Cobb (Ga.), romance is what it's
all about. A champagne bottle and two wine glasses sit next to a
whirlpool tub for two. In the bedroom, a fireplace faces a tester
bed covered in velvet and silk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being on a honeymoon,'' says Buzzy Keith, 51, as he
eyes the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could just move right in,'' says his wife, Bitsy, 50.
</P>
<P>
   The Keiths are removating their east Cobb County (Ga.) kitchen
and looking for countertop ideas. But Bitsy is picking up a few
tips upstairs, too. The neutral Window treatments in the master
bedroom would make it easy to change the colors of other
furnishings in the room, she notes.
</P>
<P>
   The basement is fitted out with a wet bar, pool table and home
theater, complete with eight easy chairs and a clicking marquee
announcing the current show.
</P>
<P>
   But Durwin Mitchell, 37, ignores the blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of today's visitors to the home, he and his wife,
Joanne, 38, are actually consideringbuying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Models are designed to lure you in,'' Mitchell says. ``I'm one
of those people that if I go to the mall and I'm looking for a
shirt, I look for a shirt. I don't look in the slacks section.''

 &HT;    Thinking ahead is key ingredient to ensuring success when
creating a garden
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

   (A gardener's journal
</P>
<P>
   Planning plays a big part in creating a successful garden. But
even the best-laid plans are subject to the challenges of nature.
That's what makes gardening a matter of trial and error. For the
next year, Home &AMP; Garden will follow the development of one garden,
revisiting it each season to show what worked, what didn't and what
the gardeners learned.)
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sam Schwartz and Lynn Goldowski want to make their
yard an inviting place to relax, but their busy lifestyles leave
little time for gardening.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike most young homeowners who do well to create an
attractive landscape in spring and summer, the husband and wife are
determined to have a garden for all seasons _ one they can enjoy
from indoors on hot or cold days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals were to have a livable outdoor space that is
free-flowing and accessible from the house,'' Schwartz says. ``We
also wanted things to look good in winter, with lots of different
colors, heights and texture, but still be a low-maintenance
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, who travels often on business, and Goldowski, a
physician turned stay-at-home mom, are parents to a 3-year-old and
an infant, so gardening ranks low on their to-do lists these days.
But after building an addition to their Decatur (Ga.) house three
years ago, the couple was left with a back yard that screamed for
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years, this was just a pit,'' Schwartz says of the
large clay area. Once they'd settled into their family room
addition, the couple, realizing how landscaping increases property
values, was ready to tackle part of their 1 1/2-acre wooded lot.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz had done some vegetable and flower gardening. He plans
to maintain the garden. But the couple decided to call in a design
expert on the front end to avoid costly mistakes. Atlanta landscape
architect Dottie Myers spent hours last winter talking with them
about their needs and lifestyles. She took them to nurseries and to
the Southeastern Flower Show to show them plants before developing
a design that encompasses areas closest to the house. (They plan to
take on outlying areas in later phases.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also doing the yard in phases because they have kids,
whose needs will change as they grow up,'' Myers says. ``And with
two small children, it's going to be hard for them to keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners wanted a variety of trees, shrubs and perennials _
especially less common varieties _ yet the garden had to be
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   A big challenge will be watering. Myers recommends soaker hoses
or hand watering over irrigation systems so that the ground, not
the foliage, benefits most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam's made the commitment for the first year to be the
waterer. But what we have done to help is to do incredible soil
preparation,'' Myers says, noting the amendments will help beds
retain their moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the project evolved:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Building the garden's bones. After drafting a site plan, Myers
and the owners settled on a budget, about 70 percent of which went
to building a retaining wall and stone patio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardscaping is usually the biggest outlay of money,'' Myers
says. ``In the beginning, there were little things they had to give
up, like a cap on the retaining wall, which they can put on later
but saved them thousands of dollars by not doing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In late winter, Ed Castro Landscape was hired to push tons of
soil some 28 feet away from the house and build the 4 1/2-foot high
granite wall. A set of steps rises to an upper terrace, where the
remnants of an old stone surface became more evident.
</P>
<P>
   Myers designed a lower terrace as a transition between the house
and garden. The centerpiece is a crab orchard stone patio that
flows casually around the back of the house. ``The house is
perfectly symmetrical on the back, but we didn't want anything that
formal in the garden,'' Schwartz says. ``We wanted the wall to be
curved and for friends to be able to sit on it when we're out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   They also wanted to incorporate a water garden, but with young
children, feared a pond at this stage. So Myers designed a bed,
outfitted with electricity, where a water garden can be installed
later.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  First stop: Improving the soil. The most crucial step in
creating any garden is soil preparation. Typically, Georgia's
heavy, rock-laden clay requires amending to provide nutrients and
to improve drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Organic Landscaping and Design Implementation
weeded and cleared the yard of ivy and other existing plants,
rocks, roots and debris. For several days the crew did the work by
hand to avoid further compacting the soil with heavy equipment.
``The upper part was so incredibly hard we had to use a mattock to
break up the soil,'' says company owner Jerry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Workers then tilled the soil a depth of 8 to 13 inches before
topping it with a 3-inch layer of Mr. Natural Complete Landscape
Mix, which contains expanded slate, fine granite sand, coarse river
sand, bark humus, worm casings and composted chicken manure. ``It's
been our experience that when we do good soil prep like this, we
get a three-year look within a garden's first year,'' Allen says.
</P>
<P>
   After tilling in the amendments, the crew raked the soil toward
the center of beds to create a contour for ensuring proper
drainage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Let the planting begin. Because the property is wooded, Myers'
design includes few new trees. Instead, she emphasized shrubs and
perennials that offer an attractive feature _ flowers, berries,
foliage, fragrance _ during various seasons. ``I've tried to have
something blooming at every stage of the year,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For summer, she planted hydrangeas, banana shrub, ornamental
grasses, Margarita and Blackie potato vines, and copper fennel _ a
host plant for butterflies that she included ``just for the kids.''
For fall, there's the brilliant foliage of Mt. Airy fothergilla,
Japanese maples and fragrant plants such as an orange-flowering tea
olive. In winter, the family should appreciate a variety of
evergreens, conifers, Gilt-Edged elaeagnus, Peggy Clark flowering
apricot, variegated daphne and several camellias. And come spring,
there will be small perennials, such as astilbe, irises, coreopsis
and dianthus.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are complemented by calm spots of mondo grass, a
low-growing dark green ground cover. ``Sam didn't want any grass to
mow,'' Myers says.
</P>
<P>
   And all of the plantings have been mulched with hardwood bark to
help the soil retain moisture and discourage weeds.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the young garden is sparse but holds plenty of promise,
despite a first summer that's expected to be hotter and drier than
ususal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already anticipated that to be a problem,'' Allen says.
``The good thing about amending the soil the way we did is it will
now hold a great deal of moisture.''
</P>
<P>
   Success, after all, comes with planning _ and a little luck from
Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   G A R D E N P O I N T E R S
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have a plan. Whether you hire a landscape designer or do it
yourself, list your priorities for a garden, considering how you
want to use it, how much time you have to maintain it. Then sketch
a design on paper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learn as much as you can about plants appropriate for your
area. A good starting point is ``Georgia Gardener's Guide'' by
Erica Glasener and Walter Reeves (Cool Springs Press, $18.95).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take into account the seasons, incorporating plants that will
offer something interesting in winter, such as evergreen foliage,
berries, bark, fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start a photo file of features from gardening magazines that
you like.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't let a large yard overwhelm you. You don't have to
implement your plan at once; tackle one area at a time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't plant until you amend Georgia's heavy clay soil. Two
amendments popular with Atlanta horticulturists are Mr. Natural
Complete Landscape Mix and Nature's Helper Organic Soil
Conditioner, available at area garden centers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep a journal, noting which plants failed, which flourished _
a do's-and-don'ts reminder for the future.

 &HT;    July 4th Tabletop options
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celebrate in style this July Fourth _ the quintessential summer
holiday for family, friends and festive meals. From picnics to
patio buffets, America's big birthday party is an unabashed tribute
to all things patriotic, including stripes and stars and those
spirited colors of the flag. With a bit of time and savvy, you can
create a fun red, bright and blue table for your guests.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might take an entirely different approach to the holiday
and simply set a pretty table that incorporates those delicate
summertime shades of greens and roses, pinks and yellows. To get in
the celebration mode, guests can sip champagne or lemonade while
watching fireworks or playing with sparklers.
</P>
<P>
   A party table is an expression of yourself, a chance to show
your creativity, according to Atlantan Liz Schimpf, who plans
parties for a living. ``Yet that table _ and the food _ should be
simple,'' says Schimpf, who's the marketing director for Glorious
Events, a catering and party design firm. ``People feel the need to
impress their guests, which is simply not true. Your guests love
you for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   When planning your table, Schimpf suggests you ``build and
layer,'' like an architect. Start with color, then texture. Keep in
mind, she says, that busy colors will clash with the food. Next
come table coverings, layered on top with place settings and,
finally, other accessories.
</P>
<P>
   To keep you independent on the Fourth _ to enjoy your guests _
we asked Schimpf to create two settings. One is the traditional
rah-rah patriotic look; the other is a summer-themed table that can
be set on Independence Day or any other time you want to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Let freedom zing
</P>
<P>
   For this colorful look, Schimpf chose a red-and-white-checked
plastic tablecloth on which she put Martha Stewart's blue plaid
cotton tablecloth. Next, she chose bamboo plate holders, which she
topped with red-and-white-
</P>
<P>
   checked paper plates and napkins and smaller, solid blue paper
plates. If you're doing a buffet table, blue acrylic tumblers make
perfect holders for the flatware _ in this case, clear plastic
spoons, forks and knives. Other accents: a round cobalt blue vase
filled with just-picked blue hydrangeas (you could also use
sunflowers or red and white carnations), citronella candles in red
and blue glass holders and an oil lantern. The final touch? Tiny
flags for each guest. ``Remember,'' she says, ``disposable flatware
is appropriate for an informal party. So is stainless or
silverplate. It's your choice.''
</P>
<P>
   COST OF TABLE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From Party City: Red-and-white-checked plastic tablecloth
($2.75); bamboo plate holders ($1.29); red-checked dinner plates
($2.29 pack of 12); solid blue salad plates ($2.55 pack of 24);
red-checked napkins ($1.99 pack of 20); clear plastic flatware
($1.79 for pack of 24 forks, knives or spoons); citronella candles
in red and blue glass holders ($1.39 each); citronella candle in
large tin ($4.99); tiny American flags (29 cents each).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From Kmart: Blue acrylic tumblers (59 cents each); Martha
Stewart blue plaid cotton tablecloth ($14.99).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From Williams Sonoma: Oil lantern ($20).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From Pottery Barn: Cobalt blue bubble vase ($15).
</P>
<P>
   A taste of independence
</P>
<P>
   To ``build'' this summery-looking spread, our stylist first
covered the table with an ivory damask cloth, then added green
woven place mats. For the place setting, she chose Villeroy &AMP;
Boch's mix-and-match china from the company's ``Summerhouse''
collection: bowls and plates trimmed with roses or a green
Florentine border. Note: To hold the cost down, you might wish to
select paper products in similar colors or patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the china is a wooden bar tray _ great for holding
drinks and flowers _ tiled in green and yellow. Other touches:
bright yellow resin flatware, clear glass pitcher and gold leaf
wine bucket.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to flowers, Schimpf suggests snipping roses,
peonies, pink stock or anemones from your garden. Or ask a friend
if you can raid hers and casually stick them in a glass vase.
``Stylized arrangements are dead,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   COST OF TABLE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From Fragile in Sandy Springs:
</P>
<P>
   Xochi green woven place mats ($6 each); green striped cloth
napkins ($4.20 each); Villeroy &AMP; Boch's Summerhouse Collection
includes ``Arabesco'' dinner plate ($20.80 each); ``A Rose'' salad
plate ($13.60 each) and ``A Rose'' vegetable bowl ($44.80);
``Acacia'' bread-and-butter plate ($12) and ``Acacia'' chowder bowl
($22.40 each); bar tray ($47.20); Villeroy &AMP; Boch flatware ``Play''
in yellow ($21 for five-piece place setting); Nautilus pitcher
($24); Zrike oversized goblets ($10 each).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From Macy's: Ivory damask cloth ($39.99).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  From Pottery Barn: Gold leaf wine bucket ($36); clear bubble
vase ($15).

 &HT;    Style has timeless appeal, but a little goes a long way
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 4
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How crazy is the notion of cowboy accouterment suddenly gaining
favor among the clothes-conscious? No more far-fetched, really,
than the idea of a black actor (Will Smith) reprising the role of a
turn-of-the-century cowboy-sleuth in the movie version of ``Wild
Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people may say that wild horses couldn't drag them into a
Westernwear store. But they'd be missing out on some style points
that cutting-edge dressers have been scoring for the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, fashion magazines targeting both men and women
touted ``Vegas chic'' _ fringed and beaded jackets, skirts and
pants, for instance _ as the style to mimic. The industry's
affinity for all things Western carried over into the fall and
winter, when people attending the fashion shows in New York, Paris
and Milan turned out in dark denim outfits accented with scrunched
cowboy hats and gleaming black boots.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the wardrobe in Smith's new flick serves as a
reminder that there's a timeless appeal to Westernwear. It connotes
strength, courage, self-assuredness, Americana.
</P>
<P>
   And a little bit of it goes a long way. Just one of the look's
central components _ the hat, belt or boots _ is all one really
needs to transform an ordinary outfit into something endearingly
reminiscent of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   So, unless you're going someplace to dance the two-step, rein in
that inclination to don Westernwear from head to toe. Leave the
wearing of complete cowboy costumes to the characters in ``Wild
Wild West.''

 &HT;    Stone terrace a compromise for lawn lovers
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tired of mowing that lawn but don't want a
high-maintenance garden? Brad Murphy might have just the solution.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the Atlanta resident created a terrace in his front
yard that's half patio-half grass. The patio part consists of
square steppingstones arranged in a diamond pattern; the grass part
is dwarf mondo planted between the stones. The result is a
checkerboard surface that can be walked on and requires no mowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted some green but not just grass,'' said Murphy, a
hairdresser who discovered gardening four years ago. ``This way, I
never have to mow.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had seen similar designs using stones and pebbles but
opted for bluestone and mondo, a matty ground cover that grows only
2 to 3 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   He began by killing what was left of a lawn already in poor
shape. Then he leveled the area by filling low spots with topsoil,
grading the yard slightly to ensure proper drainage. Next, he added
a 2-inch layer of sand to create a smooth surface for positioning
the stones.
</P>
<P>
   After measuring the space, Murphy chose 18-inch-square stones.
He'd planned to lay them in a grid but ended up placing them
diagonally, which required more materials. Finally, he bordered the
terrace with a cobblestone coping.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy then filled the square gaps between stones with a mixture
of soil and compost to prepare for planting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dwarf mondo doesn't grow very fast, and I'm very impatient. I
wanted the terrace to look like it's been here for years,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   So to speed things up, Murphy bought 25 flats of grass
containing 18 plugs, each of which he divided into several plants.
He then placed the plants only about 2 inches apart. He also
applied a slow-release fertilizer and mulch to help the soil retain
moisture and prohibit weed growth.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy figures it will take at least a year for the grass to
cover their squares, forming a dense carpet capable of withstanding
foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And although the weekend project cost about $500 for the stones
(about $7 each) and another $300 for the plants, less expensive
stones and fewer plants can be used.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the low-maintenance terrace now allows him to do what
he likes best _ gardening _ instead of mowing.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Square steppingstones (12, 18 or 24 inch)

<P>
   &QR;  Fertilizer
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pine bark mulch
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Measure the area to be terraced to determine how many
stones will be needed. Clear the area of weeds, level the soil at a
grade so it will drain and cover with a 2-inch layer of sand. Begin
positioning the stones so they don't rock when stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Fill in the gaps between stones with a mixture of
topsoil and compost that's level with the stones.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Plant plugs of mondo grass several inches apart. (Plugs
can be divided into several plants to cover more area.) Then mulch
around the plants to ward off weeds.

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Wearing camouflage fatigues, his waist-long hair
in a ponytail and a Fu Manchu mustache offsetting dark eyes, Ivan
Alcantar looks the part of a moody young revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   But as he chain-smokes cigarettes and guzzles an orange soda,
Alcantar says he is just a student who wants to make a difference
in an undemocratic world ruled by bankers and financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 20, the history and philosophy major has been part
of a student strike that began over changing a venerated aspect of
Mexican higher education: plans to charge tuition at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, the largest in Latin
America with nearly 270,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of us are striking because we think we have a
just cause,'' said Alcantar, 24, the son a physician. ``I am doing
my part against a global economic system that is being imposed on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded during the first eruptions of the 1910 Mexican
revolution, UNAM has near-mythical repute and is often regarded as
a mirror of Mexican society.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years it has had its share of controversy. But not
since 1968, when dozens of UNAM protesters were killed, allegedly
by government snipers, have students voiced such discord and spread
such upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   UNAM, known as ``the maximum house of studies'' in Mexico, has
been a virtually free university since its inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution drawn up in 1916 envisioned it could provide
a free higher education for all, regardless of class or social
status, a principle still alive today.
</P>
<P>
   Often compared to Harvard and Yale for its quality of education,
the university has produced three Nobel laureates and has several
presidents of Mexico among its alumni.
</P>
<P>
   So when university dean Francisco Barnes announced plans to
raise tuition costs, but only for those who could afford to pay, he
touched on a sacred cow.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to raise the tuition from a symbolic 2 cents per
semester to about $60 per semester, a fee intended to offset a
reduction of government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other university in the world with such low
tuition fees,'' Barnes said during a trip to San Antonio in April.
``We don't think increasing it slightly is an unfair proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes later backed down, saying the tuition would be voluntary.
But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   A Pandora's box was opened that touches on the core of Mexico's
past and what the country is becoming today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of charging tuition at UNAM is taboo. You cannot
touch the subject. It is just not done,'' said Primitivo Rodriguez,
a historian and theologian. ``The only way to do it, and you would
not have been able to, is to consult students.''
</P>
<P>
   The students seem to be volatile brew of leftist ideologues,
in-your-face punk rockers and malcontent Generation Xers. They have
nicknames such as ``El Mosh'' and ``El Marx.''
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are called the ``Ultras,'' radicals who adorn their
faces with war-like red paint and stage noisy demonstrations that
block highways for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are Marxist, Leninist, extremists. But most are
democratic and independent of any political parties,'' said
Alcantar, a student of Mexican Marxist historians.
</P>
<P>
   Although many have undefined philosophies, they share a deep
mistrust of Mexico's accelerated push from a welfare state to a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Another common trait is a deep admiration for the Zapatista
guerrillas demanding better living conditions for Maya Indians in
the southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   The now-dormant 1994 Zapatista uprising is led by the romantic
figure of the masked, pipe-smoking Subcommander Marcos, himself a
UNAM philosophy graduate and one-time professor at another school,
the Autonomous Metropolitan University in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas emerged just as the North American Free Trade
Agreement was going into effect in the last year of the
administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the market
reformer who privatized banks and other government-controlled
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us '94 was going to be a wonderful for Mexico, but
when that (the Zapatista uprising) happened, it was an awakening
for our society,'' said UNAM student Manuel Ponce, 21. ``They
wanted us to believe Mexico would become a wonderland, a country of
dreams come true, but that was not the reality.''

</P>
<P>
   Although shaky talks began last week with student leaders and
UNAM officials to end the walkout, the end seems far off. The
university remains closed with rocks and debris blocking the entry
to sprawling Ciudad Universitaria campus, which resembles a ghost
town.
</P>
<P>
   As the strike drags on, it is wearing on the patience of many
people. Last week, about 5,000 demonstrators packed a downtown
plaza to call on classes to restart.
</P>
<P>
   And President Ernesto Zedillo, who had remained silent through
most of the strike, called the student movement a ``brutal
aggression'' on the university.
</P>
<P>
   Students, meanwhile, complained of government repression after
video cameras were installed around the university and they said
they feared soldiers would try to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout all this there is the specter of the massacre of
1968, the year the country was staging the Olympics and one the
darkest periods in Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the question of who fired on the students _ up
to 300 of whom were killed _ remained a mystery. But explosive
excerpts from a book citing the papers of a former defense
secretary said officers of the Presidential Guard fired the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Although that scenario is unlikely today, many here wonder if
the revelations will add to student discontent.

`BROKEN VESSELS': STONELIKE DESCENT INTO DEPRAVITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every so often, at moments of high stress, Tom (Jason London),
the Los Angeles paramedic who narrates ``Broken Vessels,'' has
dreamlike flashbacks to the pastoral world back East that he fled
in a big hurry. In these sequences Tom, who grew up in Altoona,
Pa., and is nicknamed Tuna Fish by his boss, remembers speeding in
his car through a bright-green landscape of farms and woodlands
that look infinitely more wholesome than the place where he has
landed. Whatever drove Tom to abandon such a pretty environment for
the concrete wilds of Los Angeles, we wonder. Might he be fleeing
some terrible personal blunder?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it turns out. But exactly what he's running from isn't
revealed until the end of the movie, which traces Tom's rapid
disintegration from idealistic medical worker to loathsome,
creepy-crawly drug addict. And when that revelation arrives, it is
too perfunctory to illuminate Tom's stonelike descent into
depravity.
</P>
<P>
   The chief agent of Tom's destruction is Jimmy (Todd Field), his
cynical, poker-faced, ambulance-driving partner and tutor in
corruption. Jimmy is a stout, mustachioed blob of trouble who
through most of the film is able to consume vast amounts of drugs
and alcohol without cracking any facial expression beyond appearing
terminally glum. He is a human cement mixer who numbly grinds along
through life with an all-purpose chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Directed with some flair by Scott Ziehl, ``Broken Vessels'' is
so eager to rub our noses in drugs (both snorted and injected) and
psychotic behavior that it forgets to give that behavior a wider
context. Tom's efforts to resist succumbing to his colleague's
lifestyle are at best feeble, and the movie is one long swatch of
increasingly joyless and desperate sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   First come the bar girls and cocaine. Then Tom's roommate throws
him out after he vomits (while high) into his aquarium, killing all
the fish. Tom moves in with Jimmy, and the pair hang out with Susy
(Susan Traylor), the twitching, motor-mouthed speed freak who lives
next door. Jimmy's one friend in the world is his grandfather, a
lifelong addict whom he supplies with heroin. Jimmy also feels no
qualms about stealing from clients when the whim strikes him and
sexually molesting unconscious women in the back of the ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broken Vessels'' also takes us to the sites of horrendous car
crashes and other human disasters, but the movie is so intent on
delivering successive shocks that after a while they seem dull and
repetitive. The story gives Tom one shot at redemption in his
romance with Elizabeth (Roxana Zal) a sweet, too-good-to-be-true
young nurse, but their scenes together seem false and wooden.
</P>
<P>
   If Ziehl shows poor judgment in balancing the elements of a
story, he has talent at directing actors (Ms. Traylor's strung-out
Susy is especially scary) and at sustaining a queasy, vertiginous
atmosphere of all-out craziness.

 &HT;    U.S. SENATE SEEKS MORE ACCOUNTABILITY ON CLINTON HAITI POLICY
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Seeking more control over how U.S. taxpayer money is
spent in Haiti, the Senate has instructed the Clinton
administration to report to Congress every six months on the
Caribbean nation's progress -- if any -- towards achieving economic
and political stability.
</P>
<P>
   If sufficient progress is not achieved, Congress could block
U.S. funding for the hemisphere's poorest nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also has spelled out, on paper, its priorities in
Haiti, which include continued U.S. support for both the Haitian
National Police and for the holding of parliamentary elections in
Haiti later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, passed late Wednesday as part of a foreign aid
bill, still has to make it through the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the administration to spend money effectively, and we
also want to list our priorities because this is a democracy that
is having very significant problems so that the jury is still out
on it,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It's been nearly five years since President Clinton ordered
20,000 troops to Haiti to oust a brutal military regime and restore
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Cox Newspapers series earlier this year, showed that the
Clinton administration has poured more than $2.2 billion --
including $669 million in nonmilitary aid -- into Haiti with
little, or no progress in key areas such as elections. This year,
the administration has requested another $105 million for Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, today, many in Congress still harbor concerns over Haiti's
stability and over what role the United States should continue to
play in the small, troubled nation.
</P>
<P>
   The country has been in turmoil since April 1997, when Haiti's
most-recent election was held. That election attracted a derisory 5
percent of the electorate, and was never validated due to charges
of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, political bickering has paralyzed Haiti's
government, rendering it unable to accept nearly $1 billion in
loans and grants from international agencies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, crime has grown, as has the number of violent
street protests, many of which have been aimed at Haiti's mostly
U.S.-trained police force.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian government officials have promised to hold elections in
November or December, raising hopes that the political stalemate
will soon end.
</P>
<P>
   ``International support and assistance is needed to help
maintain a secure environment in which all parties and candidates
can organize and campaign without fear of intimidation and
violence,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But many Haiti experts doubt that the country -- sorely lacking
in funding -- can pull the elections off.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has asked the Clinton administration to report to
Congress on its efforts to help Haiti hold fair elections,
privatize state-owned businesses, investigate various political
killings, and remove members of the police force involved in human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hahn, a State Department spokesman, said it's not
unusual for Congress to place reporting requirements on an
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But what is unusual is the amount of frustration mounting in
Congress over a place often cited as one of Clinton's foreign
policy successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep a close watch on Haiti,'' DeWine said. ``What
we do there could affect the number of boat people coming in and
the amount of drugs coming in (to the United States).''

U.S. MARINES STRUGGLE TO KEEP LID ON HATE-CHARGED SECTOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ohio, Pa.) 
 
By RICHARD MERTENS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJLANE, Yugoslavia _ A scratchy call over a walkie-talkie sent
a jolt through the headquarters of Lima Company's 1st Platoon. Four
men, three of them in uniforms of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army,
had been spotted on a rooftop just down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on top of the freakin' theater, and they're waving,''
reported a breathless young Marine who burst into the office of the
platoon commander, Lt. Randall Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines had been shot at in Gnjlane twice already, and their
first thought was snipers. Then they learned that the ethnic
Albanians on the roof had climbed there because three Serbs with
pistols had entered the building.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, a tall and unflappable 24-year-old from Danville,
Ohio, slipped on his flak jacket, picked up his M-16 rifle, and
sent a squad down the street at double time.
</P>
<P>
   Some Marines took up positions around the theater, while others
slipped through the main door and disappeared. They searched the
building and found no Serbs with guns, only four frightened men on
the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if no one is armed, we don't know if the stories are
made up or true,'' Johnston said afterward. ``There's no way to
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to make their section of Kosovo safe for both
returning ethnic Albanian refugees and the frightened Serb
minority, the U.S. Marines who arrived here less than two weeks ago
are coping with guns, with people who carry guns, and with people
who fear guns. It is not an easy task. The Marines of Gnjlane find
themselves in the middle of an ethnically mixed population that is
heavily armed and charged with fear and hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in town has weapons,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines have confiscated hundreds of guns, most of them
AK-47 assault rifles, the weapon of choice not only for military
forces in the Balkans but also for household protection. But
hundreds is a small number compared to the arsenal that the U.S.
peacekeepers believe remains in the hands of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines know this not only from intelligence reports but
also from the spatter of gunfire at night from nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
   The danger that these guns pose was impressed upon Johnston's
platoon last Friday when at least one person, and possibly as many
as three, fired on Marines manning a checkpoint on the main street
outside the platoon's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The shootout that followed lasted more than an hour. When it was
over, one Serb was dead. No Marines were hurt, but their building
was pocked with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the Marines were given an easy assignment in
Kosovo. The violence and destruction around Gnjlane, the largest
town in the American sector in Kosovo, was mild by comparison with
much of the rest of the province.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the war is over, the tensions are rising.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians who fled the province are returning in large
numbers, and many are angry and vengeful. They have taken over
public buildings and hoisted the Albanian flag. In some places they
have burned and looted Serb houses. The Serb minority, finding
itself suddenly out of power, is feeling itself backed into a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Every day the Americans in Gnjlane are beset by frightened
citizens reporting threats, looting and kidnappings, or more often
just asking for protection. Often, the Marines can do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person in town would like a Marine standing in front of
their house,'' said Johnston. ``It's just impossible to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Marines do is make frequent patrols around the city and
into nearby villages, just to remind people that they are there.
They also have set up dozens of checkpoints along the roads, where
they search any car that looks suspicious. Cars with women and
children are usually waved through; a car with young men is almost
certain to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are actually getting pretty good at pulling over the
right cars,'' said Lance Cpl. Michael Fritz, 22, of Lancaster, Pa.,
who commanded a checkpoint on the outskirts of Gnjlane. ``We're
still getting stuff. That's what kind of keeps you going. When you
find a weapon you're thinking maybe you saved somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   While he talked, a small car approaching the checkpoint caught
his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey! Check those guys,'' he ordered. Five young men, some
wearing partial uniforms of the Kosovo Liberation Army, got out.
The Marines frisked them and searched the car. Fritz found a pair
of license plates in the trunk and, suspecting they had been
stolen, tossed them on the grass. After a conversation with the
men, he gave them back. The Albanians smiled, shook hands with the
helmeted and heavily armed Americans, and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is pleased with the job the Marines are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic Albanians want the soldiers to ferret out weapons
more aggressively from the Serbs living around Gnjlane, who were
armed with AK-47s by the Yugoslav security forces in the past
several years. Other people, of both nationalities, want greater
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Naser Zymberi, the head of Gnjlane's theater, asked the Marines
for a guard in front of the building. He said his ethnic Albanian
workers were afraid to come to work. The Marines were sympathetic
but not obliging.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't live in fear,'' Capt. Jerry Morgan told him. ``You
just have to go out and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Zymberi listened politely but went away dissatisfied. ``We're
afraid of the Serbs,'' he explained. ``They will shoot at us. We
don't have the courage to go out and do our jobs. We're not feeling
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear in Gnjlane points to one of the limitations of the
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. KFOR, the international military
force to which the Marines belong, is expected to act as the local
police. The United Nations plans to set up a civilian police force
of 3,000 in Kosovo, but it hasn't done so yet. In the meantime, the
peacekeepers must fill the gap. In the eyes of many people, they
aren't doing the job.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Marines' headquarters, through a back
gate, is the office of Gnjlane's Serb mayor, Bogdan Peric. On a
recent afternoon, he and several colleagues were taking calls from
frightened Serbs. One woman complained that ethnic Albanians had
entered her home looking for guns. Another called to report a
kidnapping. Most of the callers were told that there is little the
mayor can do these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we're not satisfied with the security situation
in the area,'' said Peric, a tense and fast-talking man. ``We've
had many threats to people. And many people have been beaten. But
KFOR always arrives too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans often dismiss the fears of the Serbs in Gnjlane as
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   But their inability to make the Serbs feel safe has left the
impression that the Americans are less even-handed than they claim
to be.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Marines' chief worries is just to protect themselves.
On Gnjlane's main street, three Marines with automatic rifles sat
in a sand-bagged outpost and watched the passing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   They were looking at the faces and hands of pedestrians,
scanning the rooftops and windows, staring at the passing cars.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Cpl. Sean Holcomb, 22, peered down the street with a pair
of binoculars. Days earlier, he had dashed across the street as
bullets from an unknown shooter, one of several that lashed out at
the Marines, had struck close behind him and another Marine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wakes you up and makes you realize the threat is always
there, never to relax,'' he said, not looking up from his task.
``It makes you realize that people will retaliate.''

   TARZAN
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Sir
Nigel Hawthorne, Alex D. Linz, Rosie O'Donnell, Brian Blessed,
Lance Henriksen, Wayne Knight, Taylor Dempsey &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G 88 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Freed visually by Disney animation and computer-generated
motion, the 48th Tarzan movie bounds spontaneously through the bush
if not across virgin narrative territory.
</P>
<P>
   With his parents done in by a leopard, the Greystoke baby is
gathered up by the gentle ape Kala (Ms. Close) over the misgivings
of her husband, Kerchak (Henriksen), leader of the pack, who can't
be argued with when he points out that the hairless one is not
their kind.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Tarzan, who morphs from a jungle sprite into
a lean machine slipping and sliding among the tree tops as if he
were liquid. Add good looks, a cheerful disposition and,
mercifully, only two Tarzan yells all movie long.
</P>
<P>
   The first triumphal bellow follows his defeat of the killer
leopard. Soon afterward, gun shots announce the arrival of a
species Tarzan never knew existed. Professor Porter (Sir Nigel) and
his daughter, Jane (Ms. Driver), have come from England to study
the apes for the furtherment of science.
</P>
<P>
   With another agenda, Clayton ( Blessed) shoots at anything that
moves and can scarcely contain his self-satisfaction over a scheme
to capture the apes and ship them home for a pretty fee.
</P>
<P>
   But Tarzan has met Jane. From her he learns that he needn't only
grunt when communicating; from him she learns to hop on a vine.
Together they face Clayton and the ultimate question about their
relationship: his habitat or hers?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The fight with the leopard is plainly to the death.
Later the ape round-up goes none too gently.
</P>
<P>
   SEX None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 The film is slightly more violent than the G rating
might indicate, but Tarzan and Jane are good people and the animals
make sweet, upbeat company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-10 Just right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13 It depends on the child, but this is a sleek,
sophisticated piece of animation that should appeal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP Only if they, like many adults, enjoy animated
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Mary Kay Bergman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Trey Parker &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 88 minutes
</P>
<P>
   And now, exactly on time for the current flap over children's
admission to R-rated movies, comes an almost complete textbook
case: an R-rated obscenity-laced movie about children hooked on an
R-rated obscenity-laced movie.
</P>
<P>
   Had Parker's film, which calls on the gang from his and Stone's
``South Park'' show on Comedy Central, been a little heavier on
graphic violence, it would have presented a perfectly rounded R
specimen to consider.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the issues are enough to start a war between the
United States and Canada. In the ``redneck, white-bread'' mountain
town of South Park, Cartman, Stan, Kyle and little Kenny trot off
to the latest R-rated import starring two obscenity-spewing
Canadians, Terrance and Phillip.
</P>
<P>
   At the theater they are firmly thwarted by a ticket seller who
reminds them that no one under 17 is admitted without a parent or
guardian. A homeless man and the promise of a $10 bottle of vodka
quickly remove that impediment and the children settle in front and
center.
</P>
<P>
   Profane to begin with, Cartman emerges from the movie unable to
stop himself from speaking almost exclusively in four-letter words.
Stan and Kyle aren't much better off, nor are their third-grade
classmates who soon finagle their way in.
</P>
<P>
   Rallied by Kyle's mother, Sheila Broflovski, an outraged town
and nation spare no freedom to cleanse potty mouths. A professor
invents a V-chip that gives children an electrical shock every time
they curse.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond censorship and parental guidance, Sheila proposes
another remedy: ``Blame Canada!'' President Clinton buys that
approach and the military is assembled. Sheila places Terrance and
Phillip under citizens' arrest and they are scheduled to be
executed during a USO show.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation, Canadian smart bombs wipe out the Baldwins.
Finally, Satan takes a hand _ and all over a rating system that
proclaims, according to Sheila, ``horrific, deplorable violence is
OK as long as people don't say naughty words.''
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Bullets fly and war rages among cartoonish stick
figures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Many crude references to various sex acts and prominent
displays of sexual organs, or representations thereof. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY See above and include a good amount of general raunch,
scatology, and racial and ethnic slurs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER 14 They will yowl in disappointment, but this isn't a
movie for young children (only about them). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14-17 Obviously the film has immense appeal for viewers
under 17. Given theater owners' announced intentions to check ages
at R-rated films, the situation should be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   BIG DADDY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams, Cole and Dylan Sprouse, Steve
Buscemi, Jon Stewart, Rob Schneider, Kristy Swanson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Dennis Dugan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 95 minutes
</P>
<P>
   A highway toll taker named Sonny Koufax (Sandler) finds himself
in custody of 5-year-old Julian (alternately played by Cole and
Dylan Sprouse). Julian, it seems, is a result of a liaison between
Sonny's friend Kevin (Stewart) and a woman he met during the
Toronto-Philadelphia World Series in 1993. About to die of cancer,
the woman ships Julian off unannounced to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But Sonny volunteers to take care of the boy after it is pointed
out that shouldering such a responsibility will make a favorable
impression on his girlfriend, Vanessa (Ms. Swanson). Nevertheless,
fretful about Sonny's one-day workweek and lack of ambition, she
drops him for a 60-year-old with a five-year-plan.
</P>
<P>
   A cut above the imbecile Sandler usually portrays, Sonny
dribbles milk down his chin but apparently has enough of an I.Q. to
have gotten through law school and enough heart to stick it out and
bond with the boy. That helps attract a woman after all: a young
lawyer named Layla (Ms. Adams), who finds Sonny's jaunty sloth as
appealing as Vanessa found it off-putting. But custody problems
loom, requiring all the legalistics and courtroom emoting Sonny and
friends can muster.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Other than continually talking about it, none. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Lots of cursing, bathroom vulgarity and references to
women's breasts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10 They won't be stunted, but the film is coarse in
places and there are better things to do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13 Ah, the call of Sandler. This is not to suggest
children routinely ignore parental wishes about films like this,
but young viewers will congregate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP Fine unless parents have an objection.

`THE UNPRIVATE HOUSE': 26 THOUGHT-PROVOKING DESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to architecture exhibitions, nothing
hits home like a show about houses. It is a subject to which
everyone brings an intimate familiarity, strong opinions and
feelings both buried and exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home is Where We Start From,'' as the English psychoanalyst
D.W. Winnicott put it in the title of one of his books. At once
inescapable and irretrievable, it affects all future decisions
about where and how we live. The philosopher Gaston Bachelard
defined the childhood home as our ``first universe,'' the adult one
as ``a nest for dreaming, a shelter for the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently one echoes the other. It is not surprising that I
love the proportions of my New York apartment: They recall the
low-slung lines of the house I grew up in, which was also of early
1950s vintage.
</P>
<P>
   From a more esthetic viewpoint, the private house can seem like
the architectural equivalent of easel painting, both of which are
about half a millennium old. Like painting, the house is the most
intimate and familiar, continuous and contested, malleable and
beloved form of its discipline, although its death is not nearly so
regularly announced.
</P>
<P>
   So ``The Un-Private House,'' the Museum of Modern Art's swank,
thought-provoking exhibition of 26 houses designed in the last
decade, is almost guaranteed to attract a large interested audience
inclined to think for itself. Happily, it will reward this audience
in ways that range from superficial to profound, from physical to
visual. But it also falls short in certain respects. Sometimes the
universes these houses define seem a little too complete and,
despite the show's title, cut off from the world.
</P>
<P>
   After clothing design, there is probably no more accurate
physical measure of changes in a culture's mores, customs,
demographics and taste than the design of its domestic dwellings.
When it explores the consequences of this, the show can trigger
complex, opposing responses.
</P>
<P>
   One minute it seems you are seeing successive waves of the
future, worthy of big attention-getting headlines. Postmodernism as
an architectural style is really over. Computer technology is
changing everything. The nuclear family is not what it used to be.
Ditto for domesticity.
</P>
<P>
   At other points the show simply seems to provide voyeuristic
glimpses of how the other half _ or an elite 10 to 20 percent,
maybe _ lives. As in a high-end shelter magazine, it is rife with
examples of drop-dead beauty and luxe, ingenious design,
cutting-edge electronic gadgetry and spacious interiors with that
pristine unlived-in look. It proves several times over that people
with money, imagination and self-knowledge can end up with stunning
domiciles.
</P>
<P>
   The two reactions, of course, are not unrelated. Inventions
popular with the rich tend to become less expensive, witness indoor
plumbing, color television and cell phones. Just because you
currently can't afford a house with video or computer screens for
walls doesn't mean that you never will.
</P>
<P>
   And there are special needs that turn out to be inspiring. A
large collection of video art results in a Northern Californian
house whose walls are, in effect, video screens. Some 10,000 books
lead to a house in New York state where the library is shut away
from the sun yet windowed on four sides. A desire for
round-the-clock trading facilities yields a New York loft-apartment
designed for two brokers that not only has its own trading room but
also monitors to display market activity in every room.
</P>
<P>
   The most brilliant design solution may be found at the core of
Rem Koolhaas' handsome Corbusier-flavored Maison a Bordeaux, with
its glass-enclosed living room supporting a slab of brown concrete
rooms _ the bedroom wing. Designed to accommodate a client in a
wheelchair, it has a central wall-less office, powered by a
hydraulic lift, that moves up and down to three floors.
</P>
<P>
   Geared to needs we don't have quite yet is the Digital House
designed by Hariri &AMP; Hariri on a commission from House Beautiful,
to be built with liquid-crystal-display blocks (just like a laptop
computer screen). Inhabitants would be able to simply log-on and
call up famous chefs for cooking tips on the kitchen wall, replace
the house's surroundings with views of their own choice, or see
their dearest fantasies played out larger than life in the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Un-Private House'' has been organized by Terence Riley,
chief curator of the Modern's department of architecture and
design, and it is the museum's first exhibition in 30 years devoted
exclusively to domestic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's first premise is that the best, most adventurous
architecture of the last decade has been domestic. (Given the state
of recent commercial and public architecture, the opinion seems
irrefutable.) His second is that this vitality stems from the way
the house is being reshaped on every side, rendered porous and
permeable _ ``un-private'' _ in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   One way is by new definitions of public and private space: Many
of the houses here have enlarged and opened bathrooms or moveable
walls; others make extensive use of new transparent or translucent
materials, like polycarbons. Another way is by technological
advances: Computers, which allow more and more people to work at
home yet remain plugged into the outside world, are also making the
houses themselves increasing interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Also an impetus reshaping the house is the rise in the number of
childless couples, same-sex couples and people who live alone: The
house is no longer centered on marriage, raising children or the
traditional family.
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Riley has brought together a stylistically
eclectic selection of houses designed since 1988. All but six of
the 26 have been or are being built, at locales that range from
downtown Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles to the French,
English and Northern California countryside, to the residential
suburbs of Brussels, Belgium; Minneapolis, and Buenos Aires,
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the architects, like Koolhaas, Bernard Tschumi, Steven
Holl and the Swiss firm of Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, are well known, if
not world famous. Others, like Diller &AMP; Scofidio, have growing
reputations. But most are unknown outside architectural circles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They work in styles ranging from the circling, destabilized
intersecting forms of the Mobius House, designed by UN Studio/Van
Berkel &AMP; Bos in the Netherlands, to the undulating, organic lines,
a mixture of Gaudi, Goff and Gehry, of Preston Scott Cohen's Torus
House under construction in Old Chatham, N.Y.; from the solid
rectilinear volumes of Francois de Menil's Shorthand House in
Houston to the shimmering, translucent ones of Scogin Elam and Bray
Architects' 64 Wakefield in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   There are several show-stoppers: Shigeru Ban's Curtain Wall
House in downtown Toyko, whose floors can be as open to the street
as a couple of shelves or cloaked in fabric like a Christo; the
T-House in Wilton, N.Y., by Simon Ungers with Thomas Kinslow, which
includes that 10,000-book library. Symmetrical as an alter, clad
entirely in Cor-Ten steel, the T-House suggests what Richard Serra
might do if he suddenly became obsessed with Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   And yet an odd kind of coherence prevails. Overall, the designs
suggest that the houses of the late 20th century may be closer in
spirit to the modernist houses of the early part of the century
than has been the case in several decades. Flat of roof, exposed of
structure, distinguished by the simple use of new materials,
frequently adhering to a grid in both plan and elevation, they
evoke the spirits of Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Richard
Neutra, Gerrit Rietveld and the Case Study Houses of postwar Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign of postmodern quotation is Clorindo Testa's
jarring, nonsensical renovation of a Tudor-style house in Buenos
Aires, which includes a cut stair bannister that appears to bleed.
The only hint of a peaked roof is found on Neil Denari's unbuilt
Massey House, whose gently sloping enamel steel roof curves and
continues down the structure's sides, creating a sleek floating box
top that hovers ambiguously between house, Quonset hut and factory.
</P>
<P>
   It should be pointed out that there are exceptions to the
general spare-no-expense atmosphere. Michael Bell's 900-square-foot
Glass House at 2(DEG) may resemble Philip Johnson's glass house,
but it was designed and built to conform to the strict requirements
of a federal housing program. Similarly modest is Workhouse in Los
Angeles, designed by the architects Danelle Guthrie and Tom Buresh
for themselves: Its split-level interior is made entirely of
plywood, its exterior clad in a smooth skin of polycarbonate
panels, which glows softly when the lights are on.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's use of the same material for the exhibition's
freestanding walls gives the show some of the see-through
transparency that is one of his themes. The overall appearance here
is part graphic design studio, part architect's atelier, part comfy
living room. The walls are papered with big color photographs,
texts and well-labeled floor plans _ all over a pale band of
William Morris wallpaper that signals the Arts and Crafts Movement,
one of the points of origin of the modern house.
</P>
<P>
   The houses are also represented by detailed, often beautiful
scale models that, taken together, form an elaborate exegesis on
the state of the art of model building. There are also a couple of
eerie virtual-reality house tours.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the main themes and ideas, domesticity reigns:
There's not a museum pedestal in sight. All the models are
displayed on the big, plain-spoken, solid wood dining, kitchen and
drafting tables and the metal tables and shelving designed by David
Schaefer and others for Furniture Co., his New York City company,
which is in effect having its first solo show.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture Co. is also responsible for many chairs and stools and
for the big cushy lounge chairs and couches, grouped on rugs and
around coffee tables, that count as the most comfortable museum
seating in recent memory. It should be added that these designs,
which evoke the Arts and Crafts Movement by way of Donald Judd, are
considerably more old-fashioned than anything found in the houses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, visitors can experience firsthand the increasingly
interactive nature of the contemporary house and of the computer's
growing invisibility _ its absorption into walls and familiar
objects. The show's interactive component, thanks to a system
designed by the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, is embedded in a big round dining room table (seating
for 12) with a lazy susan. From this revolving surface, a visitor
chooses one of 26 coaster-size discs and places it on a circle in
front of her (roughly where a glass of water would be); a
programmed screen displaying the floor plan of one of the houses
instantly pops into view, like a digital place mat, ready for
browsing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fullness of Riley's treatment of his theme, one
leaves this show with several questions, both about what is here
and what is not. First of all, despite their open interiors and
integration of work and living spaces, the majority of these houses
seem decidedly private. In photographs, they are usually plopped in
the middle of large, parklike acreages, seemingly far from towns,
streets or even neighbors, related only to the natural landscape
and the invisible fabric of cyberspace. They are beautiful esthetic
objects, but with the exception Bell's glass house and possibly
Denari's metal one, none could be a prototype for a larger
community.
</P>
<P>
   Riley maintains that throughout the century, the house has been
the site of important architectural experimentation. If so, its
successful innovations can't be applied fast enough to the larger
architectural and social situation _ to the building of apartment
houses and commercial and public buildings that directly and
indirectly shape the lives of more and more of the world's
population.

HOME VIDEO: `HIGH NOON'; NEW RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   `HIGH NOON,' FRAME BY FRAME
</P>
<P>
   Watching films on digital videodisc, one gets into the habit of
stopping the film suddenly to look at scenes in freeze frame. There
may be no other reason for this than to use the disc's sharpness
and clarity to see what any one second in a movie, especially a
famous one, looks like as a still picture. Do it often and randomly
enough in ``High Noon,'' Fred Zinnemann's classic western, released
last week on DVD and in a new videocassette edition by Artisan, and
the exercise reveals a production that, even caught unawares, so to
speak, stays steadily on its game from first frame to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not forsake me,'' begins the famous song at the outset of
the film, about a town marshal, Will Kane, portrayed by Gary Cooper
in the latter stages of his career, whose sense of principle and
honor won't let him flee when four gunmen come to kill him. Grace
Kelly, in her first starring role, is his bride, a Quaker who
because of her own principles can't bring herself to stay and face
the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   In a documentary included on the disc but not on the tape, film
critic Leonard Maltin notes that the movie was unusual for its time
_ 1952 _ in that it was shot in black and white, brought something
of a Shakespearean flavor to its sense of moral struggle and
impending tragedy, and held all its action to the end.
</P>
<P>
   As with many special editions, the Artisan disc and tape are
``digitally remastered from the film negative,'' which has lent the
black-and-white ``stills'' within it a wonderfully fresh, vivid
feel. In any one of them involving Cooper there is a man whose
every expression, from resolve to hurt and bewilderment, is not
only a dead-on evocation of emotion but also a reflection of
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Noted himself for an economical style, Zinnemann (``From Here to
Eternity,'' ``A Man for All Seasons'') shot the film in 28 days for
$730,000. Accounts usually mention that not a frame was wasted.
Stop any one of them and the entire story, written by Carl Foreman
(``The Bridge on the River Kwai''), seems served by that instant
and propelled by it.
</P>
<P>
   A Viennese, Zinnemann, who died in 1997, was considered an odd
choice to direct a western. In the documentary he says that the
universality of Kane's plight drew him and lists three elements he
kept in the film's forefront: the stark reality of the railroad
tracks that would bring evil to town at high noon, a man (Kane)
asking for help from a town that deserts him, and the unstoppable
march of several clocks toward the dreaded hour.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who died in 1961, put up with physical ailments during
the shooting, which lends a gauntness to the stills. Before a
packed church, Kane asks the people to help him defend the town he
has long defended for them. In a stream of equivocation they turn
their backs, leaving him standing dead alone looking by turns
imploring and embarrassed. In the stills, his discomfort is even
more immediate than it is in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper liked westerns. ``The good ones are real,'' he said in an
interview used in the documentary. ``You feel real when you're
making them.''

   `AFFLICTION'
</P>
<P>
   About to fly out of control, the small-town policeman Wade
Whitehouse (Nick Nolte in the performance of his career) realizes
that his hardest job is to police himself. For Wade, a brutal
boyhood under the thumb of a drunken savage of a father (James
Coburn) has led to a life of anguish. Botched relations with his
daughter (Brigid Tierney) and former wife (Mary Beth Hurt) don't
help, nor do the depressed conditions in Lawford, N.H., where he
works. A final, ghastly confrontation leads to Wade's particular
undoing, but in its universality, Paul Schrader's quietly stunning
film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``succeeds in
finding something larger than one man's misery.'' &QL;

   ``If you didn't have that cello to prop you up, you'd be
nothing,'' says Hilary du Pre (Rachel Griffiths) to her sister
Jacqueline (Emily Watson). Resentment goes with a complex, troubled
relationship that ends with Jackie, the acclaimed cellist, dead of
multiple sclerosis at age 42. A kind of concerto in three
movements, Anand Tucker's film follows the sisters through
childhood, then into a period of separation when Hilary marries and
Jackie goes off to become famous. In Act III, Jackie returns
wanting to take over Hilary's husband (David Morrissey) and life,
in ``one of the most insightful and wrenching portraits of the joys
and tribulations of being a classical musician ever filmed''
(Stephen Holden).

<P>
   British director Stephen Frears tries his hand with the story of
two young cowboys (Billy Crudup and Woody Harrelson) who go into
the cattle business together in New Mexico after World War II. Big
Boy (Harrelson) is the ferociously exuberant type while his friend
Pete (Crudup) just tends to the livestock. Sam Elliott is the
sinister cattle baron in their way and Patricia Arquette is the
married woman Pete and Big Boy fall for, in a film that in its best
moments ``feels like an epic hybrid of `Red River' and `The Last
Picture Show''' (Holden). &QL;

   `THE MIGHTY'
</P>
<P>
   Two boys, the big, hulking Maxwell (Elden Henson) and his
disabled next-door neighbor, Kevin (Kieran Culkan), form a
fortuitous friendship. Max does the walking (Kevin is locked in leg
braces) and Kevin makes him feel less obtuse by being smart and
funny. Together they develop a sort of medieval fortress approach

</P>
<P>
   Three films from the so-called Eastern European New Wave, two of
them available on video for the first time, reflect the outlook of
filmmakers in the Soviet bloc of the 1960s. In ``Siberian Lady
Macbeth'' (1962, 93 minutes), a Yugoslav film by Polish director
Andrzej Wajda (``Ashes and Diamonds''), a woman driven by her
passion for a drifter faces her own destruction. In Serbo-Croatian
with English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Istvan Szabo's ``Father'' (1966, 85 minutes), also new on tape,
is the story of a young boy named Tako (Dani Erdelyi), who has
visions of his dead father as a freedom fighter and hero. As a man,
Tako (Andras Balint) tries to live up to that image, which now
includes the fantasy that his father protected Hungarian Jews from
the Nazis. ``A beautiful study of the need for heritage,'' Richard
F. Shepard wrote in The New York Times. Hungarian with English
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red and the White'' (1968, 92 minutes), by Miklos Jansco,
follows a young Hungarian revolutionary in central Russia after
1918, recording arrests, imprisonment and escapes in a struggle in
which one side often seems to mirror the other.

`THE HOOP LIFE': NO SURPRISES. NO SWEAT. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at and of review)  
 (af)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the NBA season is over, basketball fans are invited to
turn their attention to the UBA No, that's not the women's league.
It's the fictional outfit at the center of ``The Hoop Life,'' a new
Showtime series that begins with a two-hour episode on Sunday
night. (Future shows will be an hour each.)
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's drama sows the seeds of a garden of subplots as it
introduces the central characters: the people on and around a
single team, the New England Knights. While elements of the show
are promising enough to encourage another look, the opener fails to
capture, even metaphorically, the electricity of basketball. It has
neither the game's driving pace nor its surprising turns.
</P>
<P>
   Generously sprinkled with salty language and naked, willing
women, the show seems to be proclaiming its gritty reality. But
proclaiming isn't the same as delivering. A world in which
basketball stars don't seem to work up a sweat, on the court or in
private, hardly feels real.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting among the regular characters is the
Knights' weary and wary coach, Leonard Fero, played by Dan Lauria.
Most familiar as the gruff father on the series ``The Wonder
Years,'' Lauria here plays a father figure who is more rounded,
literally and figuratively, a man who is trying to grasp a handful
of dignity in a life filled with compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard has a complicated relationship with the team's general
manager, Eliot Pierce (Dorian Harewood), who once played for the
coach. Harewood, of the television series ``Seventh Heaven,''
offers a man still trying to redirect an athlete's energy into the
demands of his job and of his boss, the team owner, Emily Yeager
(Linda Thorson). These front-office dynamics could prove
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hoop Life'' also focuses on three of the Knights' players,
each with his own circle of family and hangers-on. Curtis Thorpe
(Cirroc Lofton) is the high school phenom who is drafted by the
team after he decides to forgo college.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton, the captain's son on ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,''
will no doubt be called upon to morph from boy into man as the
series moves along. He seems appropriately overwhelmed by what he
finds in Sunday's episode. Curtis' saintly grandmother (Lynda
Gravatt) and greedy uncle-manager (Raymond Anthony Thomas) are
easily the most interesting among the dozens of secondary
characters who are dangled before the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   The team's two veteran stars, Marvin Buxton (Mykelti Williamson)
and Greg Marr (Rick Peters), should be the show's stars, too. But
so far they seem like a pair of selfish overgrown babies, and not
very interesting ones. Their love lives are complicated. Isn't
everybody's?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's episode, written by Sean Jablonski and directed by
Kevin Hooks, has so much ground to cover that it can barely spare a
moment for any hint of wit. Yet it often feels sluggish, even
during its opening sequence, a montage meant to convey the Knights'
narrow loss in the seventh game of a league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   As the team looks ahead to its next season, all eyes are on
young Curtis, who sunnily tells the coach he has been waiting for
this chance his whole life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coaching longer than you've been alive,'' Leonard
replies. ``That doesn't impress me. (italics)De(end italics)-fense
impresses me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hoop Life'' is another rookie that still has to prove it
has the stuff. As a television series, it may be pro material. But
if you want basketball, head for that women's league.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ There's no real police force here yet,
which may explain why children have been seen driving cars. No one
agrees who owns what, so people are staking their claims to the
tractor next door, the house down the street and the factory in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   There are no trials, elected officials or tax collectors.
Official records -- those that remain -- are under guard to prevent
their being destroyed by retreating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   And, last week, aid groups started confronting a new question:
Who is responsible for removing human and livestock corpses that
are contaminating hundreds of water wells?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to U.N. Country, also known as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Government institutions are nonexistent in this Serbian province
torn apart by ethnic hatred and war. In the absence of any central
authority, it's up to a few hundred U.N. workers to set up a
government for a divided public that craves structure.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Sergio Vieira de Mello, the special representative from
the United Nations, will decide which laws and people rule the
land. He runs the show from a badly looted Yugoslav army building,
where doors don't lock and employees are urged to take their
computers home with them at night.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is a Kosovo that will hold elections and govern itself
as an autonomous region within Yugoslavia. The United Nations will
oversee the slow transfer of institutions and property from the
hands of ethnic Serbs to the majority ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   But, whether and just how that will be done is still under
contention between the two enemies. The NATO bombing has stopped,
but the battle for Kosovo, which had an estimated 1.8 million
people before the massive refugee flight started in March, will
continue with each ministry, company, house or cow that is
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has run parts or all of countries before,
from Bosnia to Cambodia to Rwanda. But, it has never started with
such major issues unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major complication is that, in other U.N. peacekeeping
operations, you had an agreed upon settlement,'' Eric Morris, a
senior official overseeing the formation of the U.N. Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) said. ``Here, you will be dealing on a daily basis
with questions of sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is a recipe for chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a race, if you don't have some fundamental rule
of law and institutions operating, that (chaos) could be the
result.'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   For help, the United Nations is delegating reconstruction duties
to the European Union. Democracy-building tasks, such as organizing
elections and training police, fall to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees asked for $106 million
for its work in June and UNMIK, with about 400 staff and rising,
needs $60 million to get started.
</P>
<P>
   The actual reconstruction of the country, with thousands of
homes and businesses burned, will take billions of dollars and
possibly 10 years. At least 50 private aid agencies are at work.
</P>
<P>
   But, the United Nations is already running to catch-up. Last
week, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urged foreign ministers and
officials from 18 nations and three regional organizations to
provide the manpower they have promised. For example, only half the
55,000 NATO troops planned have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is worse for police, which U.N. officials say is
the top priority. But Annan secured promises for 1,938 of the 3,110
civilian police needed from U.N. countries.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, only 36 had arrived. But the United States
pledged 450 officers, the first 100 of whom would be sent by July
15, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. The United States
also offered another 100 police trainers. Germany offered 200
officers and Italy, Turkey and Canada also announced increases in
offers they had already made.
</P>
<P>
   A major issue still dividing countries and delaying the police
deployment is whether the civilian police should be armed. The
Netherlands said it preferred the police to be unarmed as most U.N.
civilian police are. Britain as well indicated it would have
trouble contributing to an armed police mission because the bulk of
its own police force was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Albright agreed with U.N. officials that at least some of the
police would have to be armed and have the authority to make
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In their race, U.N. officials have one major advantage: The
desire among most Kosovars -- both Albanian and Serb -- for order.
</P>
<P>
   It may be volunteerism, more than U.N., EU and NATO muscle, that
will rebuild Kosovo. Last week, as shops were starting to re-open
and the first signs of normalcy appeared on the streets of
Pristina, ethnic Albanian Jakup Mehmeti strapped two traffic lights
to the top of his old Opel.
</P>
<P>
   He picked them up from NATO officials running the municipality
and was on his way to install them at an intersection. That was his
job 10 years ago, before the Serbs took over and fired him. He
volunteered to do it again while the United Nations gets organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody is going to pay me, I just want to do
it,'' said Mehmeti. ``I want to see my city safe and the traffic
better.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of ethnic Albanians taking the law into their
own hands, most are ready to find their justice in due course. All
you have to do is go to the provisional police station set up by
British troops, and you can see patient Albanians lined up for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs stole the inventory from Selim Gravalla's building company
and burned his house. But, he waited hours in line to report the
crimes last week, rather than take a match to the abandoned house
of the Serb he knows burned his.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he says. ``I do not want to be on their level. I had a
chance to do that a hundred times, but I have not broken even one
little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, relief for people like Gravalla will come slowly.
Currently, NATO forces are so stretched thin that they are slow to
arrive to even life-threatening crimes in progress. At times,
looting has occurred before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They pull suspected criminals into a legal system with no trials
or uniform laws. American, British, French, Italian and German
troops follow their own countries' procedures for temporary
detention.
</P>
<P>
   As for courts, de Mello last week swore in seven legal experts,
including three Albanians and a Serb, to begin appointing the
judges. The first judges will likely travel between NATO detention
centers, clearing the backlog of more than 150 detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the question is what law to use. Yugoslav law will be the
foundation, except when it conflicts with international human
rights standards. For example, the United Nations will scrap
Yugoslav laws that allow long detentions for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   In straightening out non-criminal disputes, the United Nations
is forming seven committees, made-up of Serbs and Albanians, that
will advise and mediate. Of immediate concern are the nearly
violent altercations taking place over employment.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians were purged of their government jobs from
universities, hospitals, factories and ministries when the Serbs
stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989. They were also summarily
fired from private sector businesses such as major hotels and
restaurants. Since NATO came into Kosovo, the workers have been
gathering like ghosts at their old job sites demanding their jobs
back.
</P>
<P>
   Among other sites, NATO troops have had to seal off Pristina's
giant Grand Hotel and the government television complex to keep
violence from erupting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get back our offices and jobs,'' said Mehmet
Mehmeti, a-52-year-old former mining executive who has been driving
taxis since he was fired with 2,400 ethnic Albanian mine workers in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Their old mining office is now the arts building of a Serb-run
university, but that's where Mehmeti and about 30 other men have
been waiting daily while negotiations determine who gets to go back
to work.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what will happen to those owed pensions in the
public jobs, up until now controlled by the Serb-led Yugoslav
government. Also, the Serbs systematically destroyed identification
documents. U.S.-based Microsoft Corp. has donated computer
equipment to begin a re-identification program for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations will also be the final authority on education
in Kosovo, another issue that was contentious long before the NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Since a Serb curriculum was imposed in 1990, most ethnic
Albanians have sent their children to the Albanian ``shadow''
school system. It was financed by Albanian donations.
</P>
<P>
   The system was hit hard during the Serb campaign of ethnic
cleansing this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Only halfway through an assessment of the 1,000 elementary
schools for ethnic Albanians, UNICEF officials have found that at
least 170 schools have been damaged by burning and looting.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools are destroyed. Some are booby-trapped, or worse. In
the United States, officials worry about guns near schools. In
Kosovo, two British soldiers were killed by unexploded NATO cluster
bombs near a schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there is a shortage of the estimated 18,000
teachers needed, as many are missing or refugees. UNICEF's Flaka
Surroi said it is unknown at this point who will pay teacher
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   After the schools are repaired, it's likely that the United
Nations will monitor curriculum and textbooks to make sure the
schools are not teaching ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi would like to see some schools eventually integrated,
with Serb and Albanian children using the same buildings, as they
have infrequently in the past. An ethnic Albanian herself, Surroi
said she hopes someday they can even share bilingual education. In
that case, the United Nations would have surpassed all
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do that as an experiment within five years, but not
now,'' she says. ``It was partly segregation that brought us to
this situation now.''

INS KNEW OF SUSPECTED KILLER BEFORE RELEASING HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department admitted Thursday that
immigration officers failed to detain accused killer Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez last month even though the police in Houston had
told federal agents that the man was a murder suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, something got screwed up along the way,'' said
Carole Florman, a Justice Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service also announced that a
Justice Department watchdog would investigate why agents along the
border deported the fugitive, who is charged with two killings and
is an suspect in six others.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston police informed INS officials in December that
Resendez-Ramirez was wanted for questioning in the death of a
Houston physician earlier that month. The police asked the INS
district office for any information it had on the man, Florman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, INS officials in Houston provided the police
department with background information and photos of
Resendez-Ramirez, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, INS officials said that the 39-year-old drifter, also
known as Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis, was deported to Mexico on
June 2 after being captured a day earlier by Border Patrol agents.
He was caught illegally crossing into the United States near Santa
Teresa, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The INS, which is part of the Justice Department, oversees the
Border Patrol. Florman said the INS had no explanation for why the
entire agency was not alerted about Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know who made the mistake, but a mistake was made in
communicating this information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez was wanted for questioning in three killings in
Texas and one in Kentucky when he was detained on June 1. He also
is suspected in at least two slayings in Texas and two in Illinois
that occurred after he was deported.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said Thursday she referred the
case to the Justice Department's inspector general, who
investigates abuses within the department and its agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Resendez-Ramirez case has raised serious questions about
INS' knowledge of the case and procedures used in encounters with
Resendez-Ramirez,'' Meissner said in a statement. ``These issues
include why Resendez-Ramirez had multiple entries in the (INS
computer) system and was not detained and whether INS knew about
Resendez-Ramirez's criminal activities after being contacted by
local law enforcement earlier this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said the agency also would review ``the effectiveness
of our current systems in an effort to avoid any similar situation
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS computer identification system _ called IDENT _ contains
information such as fingerprints and photographs of illegal
immigrants who are detained by INS officials. The system was
developed in 1994 to track illegal border crossers and became
widely used between 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the system is primarily a database about how many times a
person has illegally crossed the border, it does contain some
criminal background information, according to Meissner.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents also have access to the FBI's crime
database through a separate system but do not routinely run a check
on all of the 1.5 million illegal immigrants who are detained along
the U.S.-Mexico border each year.
</P>
<P>
   When people are detained by INS for illegally crossing the
border, their fingerprints are entered into the system for
identification. Before the system was installed, those caught
crossing the border illegally routinely used aliases.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez was detained by Border Patrol agents in Texas
and New Mexico nine times between January 1998 and June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is charged in the June 15 murders of George
Morber, 80, and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, 52, in Gorham,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   He is a suspect in the deaths of:
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Maier, 21, in Lexington, Ky., on Aug. 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife Karen, 47, in Weimar,
Texas, on April 30, 1998.

</P>
<P>
   _ Josephine Konvicka, 73, of Fayette County, Texas, on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   _ Noemi Dominguez, 26, of Houston, on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Resendez-Ramirez travels by freight train
because the deaths all occurred near train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year officers investigating Benton's killing found
fingerprints on his car and sent them to the Texas Department of
Public Safety, which later matched the prints of Resendez-Ramirez.
The FBI issued a warrant for his arrest on May 27.

GOP LEADERS UNVEIL $1 TRILLION TAX-CUT PACKAGE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Armed with new forecasts of a growing budget
surplus, House Republican leaders unveiled a tax-cut package
Thursday that would lower federal income rates across-the-board and
give married couples a tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use a major portion of the available surplus to reduce
taxes on all Americans, whose income taxes have produced this
surplus,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, the panel that writes federal tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   While Archer didn't provide specific details, he said the tax
cut-package he and his staff are drafting will include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A broad-based tax cut that will benefit all federal income tax
payers. One proposal includes lowering the 15 percent federal
income tax bracket to 13.5 percent. All taxpayers have some income
taxed at the 15 percent tax rate so a tax cut in that bracket would
benefit everyone.
</P>
<P>
   _ A reduction in the so-called marriage penalty created by
present law that results in two-income married couples often paying
more in federal taxes than if they had remained single. This
reflects the fact that the couple's combined income is taxed at a
higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cut in capital gains taxes and estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ An increase in the current annual $2,000 limit in
contributions that can be made to Individual Retirement Accounts.
The top limit may be raised to as much as $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow self-employed people to deduct the cost of health
insurance from their federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican drum beat for tax cuts picked up tempo as the
Congressional Budget Office projected the federal budget surplus
would total $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. Earlier this week
the White House's Office of Management and Budget forecast similar
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Archer and the House Republican leadership to enact
a $1 trillion tax cut over 10-years met resistance from the party's
moderates in both the House and Senate, not to mention Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many moderate House Republicans prefer to stick with the smaller
$778 billion tax-cut plan over 10 years outlined in the budget plan
passed by Congress earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller tax-cut plan was based on CBO's earlier forecast
that the budget surplus over 10 years would come to $1.78 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Budget surplus projections from the CBO and OMB have grown in
recent months as the U.S. economy continues to outperform
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., said the $778 billion package is
large enough and that the rest of the surplus should go to other
government programs like Medicare, veterans health benefits and
elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for most government programs like education and health
care has been frozen or cut as part of a White House and
congressional agreement in 1997 to balance the federal budget. But
now that the budget has been balanced, Democrats and many
Republicans would like to see some federal spending increased.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said so many House Republicans have balked at the $1
trillion tax proposal that the leadership may have to stick with
the $778 billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and President Clinton think both plans are too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called the
Republican tax cuts plans ``totally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really left out important priorities that we ought
to be dealing with,'' Gephardt said, referring to education and
Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats favor a less expensive tax cut, similar
to the one outlined earlier this year by Clinton. That proposal
would cost about $300 billion over 10 years and include such
targeted tax cuts as a $500 tax credit for parents who stay at home
to care for infants and a $1,000 tax credit for people who care for
a disabled child or parent.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic
Council, said the Republicans' tax cut plan would take money that
could be better used to bolster Social Security and Medicare when
the large baby boom generation begins retiring in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Under current projections, Medicare is projected to go broke in
2015 and if nothing is done to Social Security, it will be unable
to pay full benefits beginning in 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said parts of the Republican plan such as the capital
gains tax cut is skewed toward people with higher incomes who can
afford to invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tax cut that helps more moderate families is a higher
priority,'' he said. ``We have no intention of supporting a new
capital gains tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts are likely to be a continuing topic of discussion
between the White House and Capitol Hill this year because
lawmakers from both parties say some type of tax cut will likely be
approved and signed into law this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly some momentum building for a middle-income
tax cut,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``The fight is
becoming not whether there should be a tax cut, but who gets the
dividend.''

   In the Company of Profit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bash'' is a smash. (But can it last?)
</P>
<P>
   With a trio of hot Hollywood actors, a hot Hollywood writer and
a batch of hot reviews, the evening of three short plays by Neil
LaBute has completely sold out its five-week off-Broadway run. The
producers are looking for ways to extend the show past July 24, its
closing date.
</P>
<P>
   The main obstacle is that the current cast can't stick around.
Calista Flockhart has to return to California to film her
television series, ``Ally McBeal.'' Ron Eldard, meanwhile, goes
directly from ``Bash'' to Broadway's ``Death of a Salesman,''
taking over the role of Biff on July 28. The third player, Paul
Rudd, is entertaining offers but could be available for an
extension.
</P>
<P>
   So the hunt is on for replacements. Eric Krebs, one of the
producers, would not say who was being sought, but an agent
involved in negotiations said Sarah Jessica Parker and Aaron
Eckhart, a veteran of LaBute's films, had been approached.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-out notwithstanding, ``Bash'' is not a huge moneymaker,
yet. Playing in the 199-seat Douglas Fairbanks Theater, the show
will certainly return its $120,000 initial investment by July 24,
but the profit will only be about $20,000, Krebs said. With an
extension, that number could very well increase, though Krebs said
a move to a larger theater was not being considered. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Positive `Side' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Has the ``Side Man'' gambit paid off?
</P>
<P>
   After enduring a string of money-losing months, the producers of
``Side Man'' have watched their sales surge since the drama won the
Tony Award for best play on June 6. Last week the show grossed
$189,449, its biggest week since early January, with crowds running
at a healthy 83 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the miserable days of late April, when
audiences were running at less than 40 percent, and weekly losses
sometimes reached $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The play has also benefited from smart casting, including the
current addition of Scott Wolf, the young television actor who
plays the narrator and whose effect on the opposite sex seems to be
particularly dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott has an enormous following among young women,'' said Jay
Harris, one of the producers. ``There are literally droves of women
out front of the theater every night. And it's a joy to have them
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the show has landed another Hollywood star to fill the
narrator's shoes. Andrew McCarthy, a former Brat Pack member, has
been signed for 12 weeks beginning on July 19.
</P>
<P>
   The show is still far from recouping its initial $750,000
investment, and the coming weeks may prove critical to its
long-term success. But Harris said positive signs abound.
</P>
<P>
   The total advance sales for the play have doubled in the last
month, to about $300,000. And a $100,000 loan, taken out during the
fallow days of late spring, will probably be repaid by the end of
July. Between the sale of movie rights and royalties from regional
productions, Harris said, he is confident the play will eventually
return its investment. ``It would be sinful if a show like this
couldn't make money,'' Harris said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who's the Star? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking over a role in a hit show like ``Wit'' is never easy. And
when the role is the one played by Kathleen Chalfant, whose
portrayal of the stricken professor Vivian Bearing has been praised
to the moon, the task is downright daunting.
</P>
<P>
   But the play's producers say they have found a replacement who's
up to the challenge. She is Judith Light, a veteran actress perhaps
best known as Tony Danza's foil on the television sitcom ``Who's
the Boss?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were deathly afraid to replace Kathleen because it's
been hailed as the performance of the year,'' said Bernard Telsey,
a producer and casting director for the play. ``But Judith came in
and really understood the role, and had the smarts and emotional
life to nail it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant, who has played Vivian since the show's first
incarnation in New Haven two years ago, gives her final performance
on Aug. 8. Ms. Light begins on Aug. 10. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White House, Darkly &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Anna Deavere Smith first decided to take a look at the
presidency and its relationship with the press, the Clinton
administration was in its early days, and Monica Lewinsky was still
in high school.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of on and off work, the first viewing of the
resulting piece, ``House Arrest,'' was in late 1997 at the Arena
Stage in Washington. But a month later Monicagate began, prompting
Ms. Smith to pull the piece from planned performances in Los
Angeles and Seattle, to enlarge President Clinton's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened me up to something bigger,'' Ms. Smith said, ``which
is the question of how we know what we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Next March she will bring the piece to the Joseph Papp Public
Theater. But unlike workshop versions, which had full casts, the
Public's will feature Ms. Smith performing solo, a style in which
she rose to fame with ``Fires in the Mirror'' and later with
``Twilight: Los Angeles 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said there was a bonus to adding more Clinton to the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love performing him,'' she said. ``He does these astonishing
linguistic things.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues'' may have been snubbed by
the Tonys, but it's not slowing down. On Sept. 8 the revue will
shift from Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater to another
Broadway theater, the Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call it the anti-``Via Dolorosa.'' Last summer, Marc Maron, a
downtown comic, took a trip through Israel equipped with a dry wit
and a balky video camera. His resulting monologue, ``Jerusalem
Syndrome,'' takes on pressing issues like the search for
spirituality and the search for the perfect pair of Nikes. The
show's at Nada 45, 445 West 45th Street, Clinton. Information:
(212) 581-6030.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impress your friends: The Right Size, a British comedy team
that was a hit at the Edinburgh Fringe festival (i.e., unknown in
the United States) opens a four-week run at P.S. 122 in the East
Village on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   _ The final rinse cycle has begun for ``Symphonie Fantastique,''
the abstract underwater puppet show developed by Basil Twist,
playing at Here, at 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street,
South Village. Producers posted an Aug. 15 closing date this week.
</P>
<P>
   The watery spectacle, which completes a simultaneous run in San
Francisco on Sunday, will most likely go on tour.

AT HENLEY, CLASSIC BOATS TO CHERISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among motor boat enthusiasts, the vintage launch has always been
the queen of the waterways. Though its purpose _ to celebrate
idyllic river life _ may be frivolous, the boat is not a frivolous
enterprise. It must have beauty, history and fine wood patina, and
it cannot make waves, so it can be properly admired as it purrs
along.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds very English, it is.
</P>
<P>
   The finest old launches will be on display through Sunday in
England at the 150th Henley Royal Regatta, a highlight of the
British summer social calendar. Hundreds of rowing crews from all
over the world meet to compete on a bucolic reach of the River
Thames at Henley-on-Thames, 30 miles outside of London.
</P>
<P>
   There, the spectators are as much a part of the show as the
rowers. The tents are populated with men wearing brightly striped
coats or double-breasted blue blazers, cravats, white flannels and
straw boaters. The women don huge hats and fashionable summer
dresses; pants and shorts are outlawed, and skirts must fall below
the knee. No mobile telephones are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The food is as old-fashioned as the craft. There are cucumber
sandwiches, strawberries and cream, and lashings of Pimms No. 1
Cup. And there are tables, chairs and silver service. General
admission is 10 pounds a day, or about $16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really like a festival,'' said Colin Henwood, co-owner of
Henwood &AMP; Dean, a Henley boatbuilder who also restores old boats.
``People come along for the sights. It's a social and jolly time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a time to purchase a vintage boat.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, for the 14th year, will hold its annual Rivercraft and
Ephemera sale at Henley on July 10, the Saturday after the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regatta is a decorative and joyous occasion, and Phillips
has become part of it,'' said Dan Klein, the international
executive director of Phillips. ``Regatta week has enormous charm
and tradition. It's a celebration of rowing with all the style one
would like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   This year 53 boats are for sale, 12 of which will be afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boat collectors are like car enthusiasts,'' Klein said. ``The
boats are something to care for, cherish and love, like vintage
cars. Even the grandest people like to do a bit of varnishing, and
these boats are a 365-day commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction includes launches, boating trophies, marine
paintings and old boat models. Classifications vary, but Lionel
Willis, Phillips' boat specialist, said he considered a boat
``antique'' if it was 100 years old and ``vintage'' if built before
1930.
</P>
<P>
   ``A classic boat doesn't have to be particularly old, but it has
to have style, finish and be made and used in classic fashion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 231 lots at Phillips is a boat with a royal
provenance: It is a 1950s Albatross aluminum-alloy speedboat once
owned by Prince Philip, the duke of Edinburgh, who attended the
Henley Regatta last year. The boat is a 13-foot sports runabout
with a Ford inboard engine and was designed as a light, fast boat
for water skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were built when aluminum was a brand-new material, so
they were considered novel and sexy,'' Willis said. According to
Phillips, Brigitte Bardot, Aristotle Onassis and Prince Rainier all
had Albatrosses.
</P>
<P>
   The Albatross in the auction was on the Royal Yacht Britannia
until 1967, when it was transferred to Balmoral in Scotland. It was
sold to its present owner in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with instructions from the captain of the
Britannia,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Willis added: ``The Britannia was a Navy ship. Everything had to
be done by the book, Navy fashion, including how to come up
alongside the yacht.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albatross is estimated to sell for $4,750 to $7,900.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage racing boats are another favorite collecting category.
</P>
<P>
   The rarest boat in the sale, Klein said, is Batboat II, a
21-foot-long hydroplane lake racing boat built in 1912 that is
named for its British designer, Montague Batting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't build very many of them, and they stopped making
them in 1915, so few survive,'' Willis said. Created for the
British International Trophy Races, Batboat II has a mahogany deck
with an open cockpit fitted with a mahogany bench seat.
</P>
<P>
   The boat finished first in the 1913 trials, and was then sent to
America where, Klein said, ``She was used for rum running on the
Hudson River during Prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimate: $9,500 to $14,250.
</P>
<P>
   The most elegant boat type in the sale is the slipper stern
launch, whose stern angles down to the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tapers off at the back like a sucked toffee,'' Willis said.
``It was designed by a man who lived on the Thames and wanted a
boat that had less wash, so he wouldn't swamp the punts and
canoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These launches are classics,'' Klein said. ``They were
designed for little afternoon excursions, to see and be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is selling the Mayflower, a slipper stern launch made
in 1934 that is 30 feet long and fitted with four white Decoesque
movable lounge chairs. Willis said the owner was selling it because
she now wanted a boat ``with the lid on it,'' meaning a top for
shade. Estimate: $28,500 to $31,600.
</P>
<P>
   Americans like classic boats as much as the English do, though
Americans divide their loyalties into camps: power and sail; modern
and traditional, freshwater and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gilson of Madison, Wis., has been collecting old Gar Wood,
Chris-Craft and Hacker power boats for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love restoring wooden boats,'' he said. ``I like the smell
of the wood varnish and figuring out how to maintain the old
motors.'' He said he attended a classic boat show in March in Mount
Dora, Fla., and planned to go to another one in Lake Tahoe, Calif.,
in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reason to go somewhere to go boating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide speedboat show schedule is printed in Classic
Boating, a bimonthly published in Oconomowoc, Wis. On the East
Coast, Wooden Boat magazine of Brooklin, Maine, lists wooden boat
shows and events all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Boat lovers are a congenial lot. Several members of the East End
Classic Boat Society gathered on Sunday at the main dock of Sag
Harbor, N.Y., for the annual blessing of the fleet. The wooden
boats present included a Friendship sloop from Maine, a Beetle
catboat, a Monterey Clipper fishing boat from California, a Maine
peapod (a double-ended rowing skiff), a 12-foot Bahamian sailing
dinghy and a sailing dory.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Barker of Easton, Pa., who built the dory for sails and
oars, explained, ``you use the ash breeze when the wind goes
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The boaters were having a grand time trading stories and
cocktails. The blarney was nearly as classic as the boats.

   GUILLERMO KLEIN: ``Los Guachos II'' (Sunnyside).
</P>
<P>
   Record stores will file it under jazz, but there's nothing in
popular music right now like ``Diario de Alina Reyes,'' the lead
track from Guillermo Klein's second large-ensemble album. It's
constructed out of a series of rapid, beautiful melodies, and it
sounds as if Klein composed them without worrying about length; he
was going to find a way to fit them together.
</P>
<P>
   It's a three-and-a-half-minute jumble of sound, with Klein's
nicotine-stained voice opening up into hand percussion and muted
brass, doublings and triplings of vocal lines, some synthesizer
arpeggios, then (believe it or not) lyrics written in palindromes;
the tapes run backward for a sequence of the song, and then the
instrumentation opens up to a full band, with brass and woodwinds.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare to find jazz people experimenting with recording tape;
it's also rare to hear any music this brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, a young Argentine composer and pianist, has been playing
with groups of various sizes around New York for four years in
little clubs like Smalls and the C-Note; some good local musicians
are on the record, including the saxophonists Tony Malaby and Chris
Cheek, the guitarist Ben Monder, and the singer Claudia Acuna.
</P>
<P>
   He's literate in the rhythmic layering of music of Brazil and
Cuba, and some of the record sounds like an updated version of
Flora Purim's Brazilian fusion records from the 70s. Though he's
one of the most original big-band composers around, it may be his
gruff singing that ultimately gets him recognition; on tracks like
``Se Me Va la Voz,'' he shows the makings of a possible Paolo
Conte.

   angelique closes july 11, not this week &UR; gfbyline &LR;  By PETER MARKS
</P>
<P>
   Yet another name-brand star of the small screen is taking his
bows on a New York stage this summer. He's visiting through August,
or in other words, until he is due back on the set of his long-
running, Emmy-winning police series, Tuesday nights on ABC. In the
interim you can catch him in a little theater off Union Square,
where he is delivering just the sort of sensitive performance that
landed him a juicy part in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking, of course, about Bill Brochtrup.
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say? Name doesn't ring a bell? If there were any
justice, it would. Mr. Brochtrup plays the empath- ic, sad-eyed
clerk John Irvin, who greets the perps and the prosecutors at the
squad room door in ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' (He took a bullet during a
courthouse shoot- out in the season's two-part finale and earned a
promotion to the opening-cred- its roster of stars.) If the
television role is not proof enough of this actor's gentle
strength, his knockout work in ``Snake-H bit,'' David Marshall
Grant's deeply sat- isfying Off Broadway comedy-drama about days of
waning love and friendship in Los Angeles, should provide the sup-
porting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Brochtrup recently stepped into the play at the Century
Theater, replac- ing Geoffrey Nauffts in the pivotal role of
Michael, a gay Angeleno mourning the breakup with his lover and
playing host to his closest friends, a warring New York couple, an
actor and his wife. It is, simply put, a beautifully calibrated
per- formance that fits as snugly as cork to wine bottle with those
of the superb Christopher Garten as the actor and the sublime Jodie
Markell as the wife.
</P>
<P>
   The portrayal also taps nicely into an intensifying current in
New York thea- ter: the deployment of actors more fa-
 &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  miliar from the pages of TV Guide than
Playbill, in productions across the city and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart, moonlighting from ``Ally McBeal,'' caught a
wave of favorable response to her portray- al of a jilted lover
driven to psychotic revenge in Neil LaBute's ``Bash.'' Scott Wolf,
the ``Party of Five'' heartthrob, is using his down time this
summer to draw a young crowd reared on Fox serials to Warren
Leight's Tony-winning ``Side Man.'' Wayne Knight, without his
television uniforms _ he played Newman the mailman on ``Seinfeld''
and is now Don the policeman on ``Third Rock From the Sun'' _ is a
vision in black as a vital part of the latest threesome in ``Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Attaching a television name to a theater venture is often a
marketing ploy. And while there is plenty of wonderful acting
across the cable channels, a veteran New York play- goer remains a
bit of a snob about the tube. You can't help wondering when you see
a famous television name on a Broadway marquee, ``Can that guy
really act?'' (``The Odd Couple,'' for instance, did wonders for
Tony Randall's pocketbook and visibility, but it was an impediment
to his being taken seriously in sophis- ticated theater circles
when he be- gan reviving the classics for his Na- tional Actors
Theater.)
</P>
<P>
   For whatever the reason television stars are attracted to the
stage _ to flex old muscles, to retool an image, to rekindle the
flame of professional passion _ they must overcome the vast impact
they have already made.  &UR; .................... &LR;  Whether widely
recognizable like Ms. Flockhart or hovering in our peripheral
vision like Mr. Brochtrup, their transitions to the stage require
them to erase even as they create.
</P>
<P>
   How successful is this season's class from the coast in making
us forget how well we know them? Pret- ty darned successful, it
seems.
</P>
<P>
   A few have had a bumpy time. Lisa Gay Hamilton, a stage-trained
ac- tress who now has a major role on ABC's acclaimed legal series
``The Practice,'' was ill served by ``Angeli-H que,'' a muddle of a
play that she left last month. The show closes on July 11 at the
MCC Theater.
</P>
<P>
   And others seem in a bit over their heads. The winsome Mr. Wolf
is not yet playing at the level of the rest of the exemplary ``Side
Man'' actors. But to be fair, they have been at it a lot longer
than he.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part the casting of the familiar faces has proved
felici- tous; in some cases, surprisingly so. Here, in alphabetical
order, are five of the cannier recent placements on- stage of
figures from our evenings in front of the set.
 &UR; gfsubhed &LR;  Bill Brochtrup
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Mr. Brochtrup to play Michael, a decent but
forlorn gay man who faces a series of per- sonal crises in
``Snakebit,'' was in- spired. That is in part because the role is
really not that much of a stretch for the actor, who portrays John,
a tenderhearted gay man fac- ing a personal crisis or two on
``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' The major differ- ence is one of emphasis.
John's con- cerns are background noise on the television show;
onstage Michael's are front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Brochtrup handles the step up in responsibility with a
leading man's aplomb and a keen ear for the playwright's acidly
funny dialogue. There isn't as much attitude in his performance as
there was in Mr. Nauffts's; the character's edges
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  have been softened a bit, which al- ters the
balance of the relationships. Michael now seems more of a confi-
dant to the Jenifer of Ms. Markell, the sole holdover from the
original cast. And Mr. Brochtrup's more se- rene demeanor meshes
nicely with the work of Mr. Garten, a revelation as Jonathan, a
would-be star of ac- tion movies who browbeats Michael and reduces
his anxious wife to tears.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions of all involved in ``Snakebit'' reflect such a
high de- gree of accomplishment _ Guiller- mo Diaz, the fourth
member of the ensemble, is another worthy replace- ment _ that an
audience's past asso- ciations with these actors seem to melt away.
And Mr. Brochtrup wins our hearts anew because he wears his with
such refinement and com- passion.
 &UR; gfsubhed &LR;  Tony Danza
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a disaster. With a stage crowded with
unforgettable characters _ among them James Hazeldine's thrilling
Harry Hope, Michael Emerson's tragic Willie Oban, Katie Finneran's
wild-eyed Cora and perhaps most affectingly Paul Giamatti's
heart-rending Jim- my Tomorrow _ an audience mem- ber might be
forgiven for gazing up at the actor in fighting trim behind the bar
and wondering, ``What's the boxer from `Taxi' doing there?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mr. Danza is an authenti- cating presence in the huge
``Ice- man'' cast; when he speaks, Flat-H bush Avenue rolls right
up to your seat. Yes, as others have pointed out, he isn't the
subtlest performer. His barkeep, Rocky Pioggi, has perhaps a tad
too much of the gladhanding politician about him. Yet you want to
believe that Rocky has the oily charm to control the prostitutes he
swears he doesn't pimp for, as well as the thuggish toughness to
back up the threats in lines like ``I'd like an excuse to give you
a good punch in the snoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Danza, so accustomed to en- semble work from his years on
tele- vision, conveys these attributes with ease. You have to
admire this actor's  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  willingness to extend
and challenge himself. After a long run in sitcoms, he has
performed on Broadway in plays by Arthur Miller, credibly re-
placing Anthony LaPaglia in ``A View From the Bridge,'' and now a
play by Eugene O'Neill. In what other ways, one wonders, does Mr.
Danza plan to push the envelope?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; gfsubhed &LR;  Polly Draper
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Draper's trajectory is the op- posite of Mr. Danza's. Her
training is stage-based, and it was only after years of theater
work that she was cast as the high-powered, heat-seek- ing Ellen on
``Thirtysomething,'' the signature yuppie drama series of the late
80's and early 90's. Now she is back onstage in New York, replacing
Natasha Richardson in ``Closer,'' Patrick Marber's partner-swapping
precis of sexual mores in the bed- rooms and chat rooms of
contempo- rary London.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the casting of an American, Mr. Marber tinkered
with his play, modifying the Britishisms and even tweaking the
staging of the final scene. The changes, alas, do not alter the
perception that ``Closer'' has lost some of its seductive vile-
ness in the metamorphosing journey from the West End to Broadway.
Still, Ms. Draper settles comfortably into Mr. Marber's world of
sex and faithlessness, a morally decayed re- vision of the dating
universe she in- habited in ``Thirtysomething.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anna, the fickle photographer drawn into the competing beds
of a dermatologist played by Ciaran L Hinds and the obituary writer
por- trayed by Rupert Graves, Ms. Dra- per looks smashing; you
believe that civilized men might start a fistfight over her. But it
is in her fleeting opportunities at comedy that she shows herself
off to best advantage. For all the play's sexual intrigue, what
works best for Ms. Draper is a funny speech about the secret bag-
gage men bring to a relationship.
 &UR; gfsubhed &LR;  Calista Flockhart
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flockhart, by the magnitude of her stardom, had more to lose
than  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  most television stars in hazarding a
return to the stage. She had a potent weapon, though; she can act.
This was clear to anyone who knew her work before she landed on the
cover of Time. Her Natasha in Scott El- liott's ``Three Sisters''
at the Round- about in 1997 stamped her as a clas- sical performer
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Now that everyone is watching, what's the result? A hit play. In
Mr. LaBute's monologue-driven ``Bash,'' she portrays two women with
oppos- ing perspectives on homicidal vio- lence: one who relishes
it, another who wishes it away. Although the excellent Ron Eldard,
as a bland businessman making a horrific ho- tel-room confession,
is handed a more rewardingly complex story line, it is Ms.
Flockhart's perform- ances that pack them in nightly.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of disturbance L evolves slowly; the triumph of her
turn as the disintegrating interroga- tion-room subject of ``Medea
Re-H dux,'' the first of the monologues, is in the sense of
misdirection. Ms. Flockhart's dead-eyed recounting of the story of
a life, couched in defen- sive language, casts her as victim. The
portrayal is so alive that you imagine her in motion constantly,
when in fact she is glued to the interview table.
 &UR; gfsubhed &LR;  Wayne Knight
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that Mr. Knight could work in such delicate brush
strokes? On ``Seinfeld,'' his Newman was a sort of Penguin to
Jerry's Batman, a mischievous comic-strip character with a demonic
grin and a compul- sion not to deliver the mail. As Mr. Knight
reveals so touchingly in his carefully modulated performance in
``Art,'' Newman is history.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the audience wouldn't like him back; a chord of happy
familiar- ity was struck during the play when Mr. Knight let slip
an evil laugh, Newman style. (Mr. Wolf triggered a similar buzz
among younger playgo- ers, mostly female, at ``Side Man,'' whenever
he smiled boyishly. L ``Soooooo cute,'' cooed a young wom- an
behind me who seemed to want to take him home.)
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Art'' trio also includes Buck Henry and George Segal
(these days a sitcom star himself, on ``Just Shoot Me''), both of
whom are limber and playfully into the game. But it is Mr. Knight
who makes the most in- triguing impression here. His Yvan _ the one
with the breakneck-paced monologue about the controversial wedding
invitation _ builds almost imperceptibly in power, up to the moment
Mr. Henry's Marc and Mr. Segal's Serge turn their anger at each
other on him.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Knight dissolves sud- denly in tears, immobilized by
the feeling that his world is collapsing, it is unthinkable that
there ever was a Newman at all.

 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was old-time Pennsylvania railroad country, but there was
nothing of the Rust Belt about it. There was no soot in the air, no
grime to speak of, no debris scattered in weeds along the track
beds. The landscape was actually scenic, and for a camera-toting
tourist at the heart of it, in the historic town of Strasburg,
there were plenty of pretty shots to be had: a Georgian brick home
serenely overlooking a shady Main Street, a white barn and silo
standing crisply by a green pasture, a Victorian station restored
to its gabled glory. All with photo-album potential.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's one image from Strasburg that I'll surely keep _
one that managed in a single frame to sum up the place as well as
my main reason for being there _ it's a picture my camera didn't
get.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was a coach of an antique train, its iron-horse
locomotive billowing steam across a swath of southeastern
Pennsylvania farmland on a nine-mile round-trip jaunt between
Strasburg and a forlorn-looking junction called, without a trace of
irony, Paradise. The coach, as tall as a lamppost, was rocking and
groaning as the train lumbered across fields newly sprouting with
corn and rye, signs of late spring in Lancaster County.
</P>
<P>
   A conductor in blue with a handlebar mustache brushed by as he
pushed his way up the aisle, and my eyes got pulled along in his
wake, drifting from the bobbing heads of passengers to the
varnished oak paneling all around to the brass chandeliers swaying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   I think it was the shriek of the locomotive's whistle that
summoned me back to the window, or maybe it was just a parent's
sixth sense, but I turned to see that my 3-year-old son had poked
his head out from under the raised wooden sash and was drinking in
sights this New York boy had never seen. I didn't want to lose him,
so I grabbed him by the elastic waist of his blue jeans, tugged him
inside a bit and didn't let go. Outside, a turkey farm rolled by,
then a gang of dull-eyed cows lazing by the tracks, then the Cherry
Hill depot, which isn't much of a depot at all but rather a
whitewashed wood-frame booth planted by the side of a grade
crossing.
</P>
<P>
   It was right about there that the elements of my indelible
picture began to arrange themselves. Fifty yards off or so, in a
field furrowed as evenly as corduroy, a plow pulled by a team of
six horses came into view. Riding on a cross-piece and gripping the
reins was a boy of no more than 12. He was wearing a floppy white
straw hat, a homespun powder-blue shirt and a pair of black
suspenders holding up his, well, britches. He might have even been
barefoot. As the train chugged by, it let out a whoop, and the boy
turned and waved.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze frame. Two distinct, even clashing, American traditions
had fortuitously and visibly converged: the steam railroad,
harbinger of a mechanized age, and the peaceful Plain People,
shunners of technological progress, both evoking in their different
ways the romance and simplicity of life in the 19th century _ or at
least our sepia-tinted view of it from the lip of the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   For an instant, the view was a distillation of Strasburg
(population 2,600), where the country lanes of the Amish and the
railroad tracks of yesteryear intersect. And completing the
tableau, at the center of the frame, was a 3-year-old, who had
brought us to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Like many a child bolting from toddlerhood, my son has a passion
for trains, mostly of the toy variety. (In his case it may be
genetic: a great-grandfather was a railroad man, on the New Haven
line.) And like many parents of children who are both uncontainable
and urban _ an often incompatible mix _ my wife and I needed to get
out of the city for a few days and into some unwalled space. The
Strasburg area promised to satisfy all parties. It's pastoral, but
it's also command central for railroad buffs, being home to one of
the oldest operating steam rail lines in America, a magnificent
railroad museum next door and enough toy trains to occupy even the
most fidgety enthusiast, of any age.
</P>
<P>
   A Train Lover's Playground
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop on entering Strasburg was the railroad station,
even though we'd come by car, after a three-and-a-half-hour drive
from New York. Built in 1882 and now fully restored, the station _
it's actually the East Strasburg Station _ is the centerpiece of a
tourist site that's one part living history, one part museum and
one part small-scale theme park. The grounds contain a railroad
memorabilia gift shop, a toy train store (a must-see for us), a
sweets emporium, a restaurant called the Dining Car and a portrait
studio in which you can pose stiffly in 19th-century dress
advertised as authentic.
</P>
<P>
   You can also tour a restored luxury suite on rails built for the
bigshots of the Philadelphia &AMP; Reading line in 1916. The coach,
with cut-glass ceiling lamps and mahogany paneling inlaid with
rosewood, cost a hefty $100,000 to build, the equivalent of $1
million today, and houses separate sitting and dining rooms, three
bedrooms and a full kitchen with bunks for the stewards and chef.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the real attraction is the Strasburg Rail Road itself, the
nation's oldest short-line railroad; it was founded in 1832 and
became a tourist operation in 1958. Today the line has four
fearsomely voracious steam engines, consuming 1,000 gallons of
water and a half-ton of hand-shoveled coal per mile, and 14
restored wooden coaches, each with its own 19th-century decor and
degree of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The basic coaches are hardly austere; they come with plush
upholstered seats, brass-trimmed interiors of polished wood and
stained glass and a working wood stove in one corner. The
first-class parlor car, which you can ride for a few dollars more
than the usual $8.25 adult fare, is furnished with Gilded Age
sofas, tables inlaid with checkerboards and a bar. One might be
tempted to light up a cigar and order a scotch if only the rules
permitted it, and if only the bar served alcoholic drinks. Riders
can also choose a yellow open-air observation car that was used in
the movie ``Hello Dolly'' or a dining car, which serves both lunch
and dinner by reservation.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of our journalistic mission, we took two trips, of
45 minutes each, riding in a standard coach the first time and the
dining car the other. I can report that the basic coach alone would
have been fine; though my son was amused to be served a hot dog on
a train, his parents found the food unappetizing and unbefiting the
stately coach in which it was served.
</P>
<P>
   But, then again, you don't come for the food; the feel of
history is the thing. And the train provides that in abundance,
transporting you back as it trundles through countryside that does
its part in stoking the illusion of times gone by.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is home to the Amish; from the train you can
see the bearded men in wide-brimmed hats driving horse-drawn
buggies and hay wagons, the children riding wooden scooters, the
bonneted women hanging hand-washed clothes on the lines. The train
remains at a respectful remove, but you can hardly observe the
Amish from a century-old coach and not imagine you're looking into
the past.
</P>
<P>
   The imperatives of the present moment can also be strong, and
after a few hours of railroading we were ready for our room at the
Historic Strasburg Inn, just outside the center of town. The
Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, directly across the road from the
station, would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The Historic Strasburg Inn is something of a misnomer. For one
thing, it's not really an inn; for another, it's not really
historic. Rather, sitting imposingly in the middle of a 58-acre
spread, it's a 101-room hotel complex done up in colonial style
while offering modern amenities: an outdoor pool, a hot tub, an
exercise room and two restaurants _ the casual By George Tavern,
which also has outdoor dining, and the Washington House, an
elegant, white-tablecloth establishment offering plain, overpriced
fare.
</P>
<P>
   So one doesn't necessarily go there for the food, either. But in
other respects the hotel, among the best in the area, suited us
well, providing a comfortable suite and plenty of room for a child
to run free, as well as swings, a playhouse and a jungle gym out
back. Indeed, the small but true inns in town generally do not
allow young children.
</P>
<P>
   History and Local Shoppes
</P>
<P>
   We learned this on a quick walking tour of the Strasburg
historic district after unpacking and collecting ourselves. The old
town, originally settled about 1733 by Swiss Mennonites, who named
it after the cathedral city in Alsace, is clustered around two
intersecting streets, Main and Decatur. Main Street has known
traffic since at least 1714, when it was part of the Old Conestoga
Road, the first westward trail from Philadelphia. Today, dozens of
brick, stone and wood-frame homes dating from the late 18th century
and well into the 19th line these streets; among them are several
250-year-old log houses that put you in mind of settlers in
buckskin shouldering muskets.
</P>
<P>
   The district also has a few stores and businesses, and happily,
by all appearances they're quite local; there's not a Benneton or a
Starbucks in sight. There is, for example, Sadie's Rose, which
advertises homemade crafts ``and canned foods.'' At Mrs. Penn's
Shoppe (gifts and watch repair), a portly Amish man sat on a bench
by the door, alternately reading his Bible and dozing. And outside
the Yule Shoppe a posted sign pleaded, ``Amish Friends Please Clean
Up After Your Horses!''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Strasburg is just a hitching post,
untouched by the wide world. A couple of miles away is Route 30, a
deadening strip of outlet malls and fast-food filling stations
worthy of Anywhere, U.S.A. And right in town, a coffee shop,
Merenda Zug, which doubles as an antiques store, boasts of offering
a blend served in restaurants like Le Bernadin and Daniel in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there was nothing pretentious about the
Strasburg Country Store and Creamery, which dispenses the best ice
cream around. And though two of the finer inns in the district _
the Strasburg Village Inn and the Limestone Inn _ were graciously
fitted out, there was nothing stuffy about them. Indeed, the
Limestone's proprietor, Denise Waller, exhibited the manner of a
solicitous house mother toward her mostly young guests as she took
me on a tour of her 213-year-old establishment.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to say that we wished we had had more time to nose
around the historic district, but in truth there wasn't a lot more
to see; you can get the flavor of it in an hour. Besides, there was
Amish country to explore, and we had a young train aficionado to
tend to. So the next day, as planned, we headed back to the
railroad museum, about a mile up the road. We were glad we did.

PRESIDENT GIVES FIRST LADY LEEWAY TO DISAGREE ON POLITICAL ISSUES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton gave First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton the green light Thursday to publicly disagree with White
House policies in her bid to become the next senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks came amid mounting political pressure in
New York for Mrs. Clinton to distance herself from provisions of
the Clinton administration's latest Medicare overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my wife decides to run for senator from New York, then some
of the disagreements that we've had in the past over decisions that
I've made as president, she may be constrained to state publicly,''
Clinton said in response to a question during a joint news
conference with visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Political allies need not ``agree on all things,'' the president
said, adding: ``It would be a dreary world indeed if we all agreed
on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., on Wednesday criticized portions
of the latest White House Medicare plan, saying the proposed
revisions would hurt New York.
</P>
<P>
   If the first lady hopes to represent New York in the Senate, she
``has to defend New York interests,'' Schumer insisted, adding:
``There's a way to keep this plan intact and help New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton plans to notify the Federal Election Commission
next Tuesday that she is creating a fund-raising committee to
underwrite her continued exploration of a Senate campaign to
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady plans a four-day, five-city tour of upstate New
York beginning next Wednesday that targets traditional Republican
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his latest Medicare proposal would soften the
impact on teaching hospitals of earlier Medicare cutbacks. The
administration's latest version provides a $7.5 billion emergency
fund to enable Congress to offset hospital budget problems brought
on by changes in Medicare reimbursement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal bows to the concerns of ``not just people in
New York'' but elsewhere that cost cuts adopted by Congress in 1997
``were too severe'' and made it difficult for hospitals to
``maintain quality of care'' for uninsured patients.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton's latest plan would reduce Medicare
reimbursements to hospitals by $39 billion over 10 years _
including $3.2 billion cut from hospital reimbursements in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would encourage the senators from New York or anyone else
who is concerned about this to bring those concerns (and) bring the
facts to the table, get it out in the open,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged lawmakers to ``embrace the idea of Medicare reform,
pass the fund and then allocate it as it should be allocated'' to
alleviate hospitals' budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said on
Wednesday that the first lady supports the president's Medicare
proposal but believes teaching hospitals should be protected from
potential cuts.

   Mrs. Clinton underscored her appreciation for the concerns
raised by New York's teaching hospitals during an address at
Hofstra University in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teaching hospitals are the crown jewels of America's
health care system,'' Mrs. Clinton said, adding: ``It is only fair
and appropriate for health insurance plans to help pay for the
missions of our nation's teaching hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Jennings, the president's top health care adviser at
the White House, says the latest Medicare plan directly addresses
teaching hospitals' concerns about lost reimbursement for treating
the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The latest White House plan proposes carving out Medicare
reimbursements for the uninsured and paying the money directly to
hospitals providing the care rather than funneling the
reimbursements through the managed health care plans that have the
patients on their rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching facilities and academic health centers question
whether those dollars are passing through,'' Jennings said. ``We
think it's much more efficient to have those payments go directly
back to the provider.''

`GOD'S FUNERAL': THE DEATH OF GOD, A CONTINUING SERIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 1908-1910 poem, ``God's Funeral,'' Thomas Hardy
proclaimed the death of God. ``Tricked by our own early dream and
need of solace,'' he wrote, ``we grew self-deceived'' and ``what we
had imagined we believed.'' Yet with ``Time's stayless stealthy
swing,'' he adds, ``uncompromising rude reality mangled the Monarch
of our fashioning, who quavered, sank; and now has ceased to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As A.N. Wilson observes in his absorbing new book, humankind,
``which had worshiped God or the Gods time out of mind, from the
era of the cave men until the French Revolution, went crazy and
threw off God'' some time in the late 19th century. The Victorian
era ``had created a climate for itself _ philosophical,
politico-sociological, literary, artistic, personal _ in which God
had become unknowable, His voice inaudible against the din of
machines and the atonal banshee of the emerging egomania called The
Modern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cohesive social force which organized religion had once
provided was broken up,'' Wilson writes. ``The nature of society
itself, urban, industrialized, materialistic, was the background
for the godlessness which philosophy and science did not so much
discover as ratify.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``God's Funeral,'' Wilson re-examines the ``Victorian Big
Fight'' between religion and science, faith and intellect, and
tries ``to make sense of it by getting to know the men and women
who were caught up in it.'' The approach, focused on interlinking
biographical sketches, is similar to that used in Wilson's earlier
study of the same period, ``Eminent Victorians'' (inspired,
needless to say, by Lytton Strachey's famous 1918 book of the same
name), and relies heavily on his gift for creating pithy,
insightful and often highly subjective portraits.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book, drawing on Wilson's wide-ranging reading in
philosophy, literature and ecclesiastic history, is erudite and
expansive. While it may add little to the reader's overall
understanding of the period, its biographical portraits movingly
illustrate the terrible struggle many thoughtful individuals of the
era experienced in trying ``to choose between giving up
intellectual honesty or abandoning that spiritual and religious
dimension to life which, as far as we can discover from the
historians and anthropologists, is so fundamental a part of all
previous human experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson begins his study with the work of the Enlightenment
thinkers, work that contained the seeds of the Victorians' doubts.
He reminds us that Hume's skepticism brought into question the very
notion of Causation (and the image of a Designer behind the
Universe), while Gibbon's ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''
made it difficult to admire many of the church's greatest saints
and popes, exposing them as ``morally absurd.'' Kant, he notes,
``demolished the traditional proofs for the existence of God and
left a moral imperative in the place of a spiritual enthusiasm,''
even as empiricism was underscoring ``the sheer unlikelihood, the
basic, common-sense improbability, of angelic apparitions, a
virginal conception, loaves and fishes which could be multiplied, a
human body which could rise from the tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   This, then, was the philosophical Weltanschauung that the
scientific advancements of the 19th century would help ratify.
Charles Lyell's ``Principles of Geology'' suggested that every
species, including the human, was ephemeral. And Darwin's theory of
natural selection suggested that species mutate, evolve and change,
and do so, in Wilson's words, ``within a system which requires for
its `explanation' no theory of volition by a creator _ no
Watchmaker, coming in from outside to `make' what is.''
</P>
<P>
   Such new scientific knowledge implied a bleak, pitiless universe
that operated according to its own laws _ a view echoed in many
respects by Marx, who argued that human society, culture and law
were all the products of economic forces, and who tried to
substitute the inexorable momentum of history for God's benevolent
protectorship.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1880s, as awareness of these ideas spread, agnosticism
moved from intellectual coteries in London to suburban Britain. Yet
as Wilson's portraits of individual Victorians so eloquently
attest, letting go of God was rarely easy. Carlyle, for one, wanted
to believe ``in a Supreme Lawgiver, in Duty and Morality, in a
personal Guide to life,'' but remained concerned that the Christian
religion had lost its credibility; he was convinced that faith was
intrinsic to the human temperament and worried that if it were not
directed toward one true God, it would be directed toward
disreputable idols.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson offers us sketches of Ivy Compton-Burnett, the writer
whose novels uniformly made the point that religion had had its
day; Algernon Charles Swinburne, the poet whose verse celebrated a
generation's liberation from ``the sexual constraints and
intellectual absurdities (as they saw things) of Christianity'';
and the novelist Samuel Butler, whose two great themes were the
``dismissal of Christianity and hatred of family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Having himself written 17 works of fiction (in addition to
biographies of Jesus, Tolstoy, C.S. Lewis and Milton), the
prodigious Wilson uses his narrative skills to invest his portraits
with a tactile, novelistic energy. He describes Marx as a character
out of Balzac, the fury of his inner demons erupting in a violent
vision of greedy capitalists and suffering workers clashing in a
historical drama. Shaw is dismissed as the ``prophet of the
sweatless armpit,'' while Carlyle is compared to A.A. Milne's
Eeyore, plaintive, dyspeptic and willfully gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   Like his hero Ruskin, Wilson is occasionally given to
intemperate judgments, and this book is seasoned with questionable
assertions. Wilson bizarrely characterizes the family of William
and Henry James as ``honest and openhearted.'' He makes the gross
generalization that in the Victorian era, ``boys did come to hate
their fathers,'' and he summarizes Freud's work as teaching us
``that neurosis can only be eliminated by overt hatred of our
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader can overlook such silly asides because of the overall
intelligence of this book and Wilson's own passion in dissecting
the decline in religious faith. Indeed, one senses that he takes
the subject personally, torn, like so many of the people he
profiles, between a determination not to commit ``intellectual
suicide'' and the belief that without religious emotion _ ``the
sense of the holy, the sense of the numinous, the feeling that
humankind is not alone'' _ the world is a diminished place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wilson comes to the conclusion that ``the God-idea''
was not wrenched from human consciousness with the ease that so
many late Victorians predicted. He notes that the Christian ethical
ideal would retain immense potency in the 20th century and that
women and men _ as disparate as Martin Luther King Jr., Simone
Weil, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin _ would
decide to ``ignore the death of God in the 19th century'' and put
their trust in One who said, `I was dead, and see, I am alive for
evermore.'''

HEARST ACQUIRES THREE WEEKLY NEWSPAPERS NEAR ALBANY, N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Corporation has acquired three weekly
newspaper companies near Albany, N.Y. The newspaper companies are
The Advertiser, in Rensselaer County, The Journal Newspapers, in
Saratoga County and The Pennysaver, based in Saratoga County.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies will now comprise the new Capital Region
Weekly Newspaper Group (CRWNG), a division of Hearst Newspapers.
Hearst also publishes the daily Times Union in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition demonstrates The Hearst Corporation's
confidence in the vitality and economic health of New York's
Capital Region,'' said George B. Irish, president of Hearst
Newspapers and vice president of The Hearst Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Smith has been appointed publisher of CRWNG,
reporting to Irish. Smith brings more than 30 years of newspaper
experience to CRWNG, most recently as director of sales and
marketing at This Week Publications, a Long Island, N.Y.-based
weekly newspaper group serving more than one million homes with 70
editions. Prior to that position, Smith was vice president of sales
and marketing at the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The CRWNG publications were acquired from three separate,
privately held ownerships.
</P>
<P>
   The Advertiser (weekly distribution of 35,200 in Rensselaer
County) was founded by Albert Hayner more than 40 years ago. Hayner
will continue as adviser and consultant to The Advertiser. Alyson
Hayner Regan, his daughter, will continue her 22-year career as The
Advertiser's editor and office manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal Newspapers (total circulation of 27,050 in central
and southern Saratoga County communities) was formerly owned and
operated by Charles Hogan. The Journal Newspapers include The
Ballston Journal (circulation 2,350), a paid weekly newspaper which
celebrated its 200th anniversary in 1998; The Money Saver
(distribution 17,000), a free weekly newspaper in central Saratoga
County; and the Malta Messenger (circulation 7,700), a free weekly
newspaper in southern Saratoga County.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennysaver (distribution of 53,000 in southern Saratoga and
northeastern Albany County communities), was started in 1950 by
Richard and Jeanne Staffield. In 1973, the company was taken over
by their son, James Staffield. James Staffield will continue to own
and operate Staffield Printing of Clifton Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Newspapers, a unit of The Hearst Corporation, publishes
12 daily newspapers.

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

   Museum Fills Gap in Dutch Paintings &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When J. Patrice Marandel, the curator of European painting and
sculpture at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, attended the
Maastricht art fair in the Netherlands four months ago, he spotted
exactly what he had been looking for to add to the museum's
permanent collection: a first-rate example of an Utrecht School
painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mocking of Christ,'' by the Dutch master Gerrit van Honthorst,
is a haunting image in which the artist used a candle to cast
shadows on the figures he painted, in this case to dramatically
depict the suffering of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   While it is a theme the artist explored several times and there
are at least five known versions of the painting, Marandel believes
this one is among the artist's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to the museum six years ago, I realized that we
really needed a painting of this school,'' he said. ``The emotion
in this picture and the dignified treatment of the subject make it
particularly special. It will be the museum's first Honthorst.''
</P>
<P>
   Painted around 1617, when the artist was in Rome working with
Caravaggio, ``Mocking of Christ'' had been unpublished and unknown
to scholars until Rob Smeets, a Milan dealer, exhibited it at the
art fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was known to Professor J. Richard Judson, who is writing a
new catalog raisonne of the artist's work,'' Marandel said. ``We
know it had been in a private Dutch collection.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of the gaps in its provenance, especially during the
middle years of the 20th century, Marandel said, he spent
considerable time confirming that at no point was it looted during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was acquired for the museum through the Ahmanson
Foundation, based in Los Angeles, which has been the museum's
biggest benefactor in European paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The painting helps to flesh out the Caravaggesque pictures
already in the Los Angeles Museum County of Art's collection,
especially Georges de La Tour's ``Magdalen With the Smoking Flame''
(circa 1640) and Valentin de Boulogne's ``Musical Party'' (1626).
</P>
<P>
   The Honthorst will go on view in the fall, Marandel said, after
some minor conservation and restoration work.
</P>
<P>
   Biennale as `Gold Mine'
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several years the Venice Biennale is to go from a
government-run entity to a private profit-making organization, one
that will hold year-round arts events in all disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for joint ventures with private organizations
and corporations to help fund us,'' said Giovanna Legnani, the
general director of the Biennale, who is working with its
president, Paolo Baratta, to make the change happen. ``If we
succeed, we hope this will be an economic model that will be copied
at other Biennales around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government passed a law in February allowing the
Venice Biennale, which costs about $8 million a year to produce, to
become a private cultural organization. While the art world thinks
of it as an art fair that happens every two years, the organizers
of the Biennale actually oversee a host of other cultural
activities in Venice, including a film festival every September and
biennales in such fields as music, theater, dance and architecture,
which are held sporadically during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name biennale, some occur every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Biennale is a gold mine that's never been exploited,'' Ms.
Legnani said. ``I have a mandate to make it profitable and
self-sufficient in four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been 100 percent financed by the Italian
government, Ms. Legnani said that in three years government funds
will account for only 40 percent of the budget and that over time
it will become totally self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   To lure corporations like Philip Morris to become sponsors, she
plans to emphasize the economic impact these events have on Venice,
which she believes insures high visibility for sponsors. Each year
about $3 million is made directly from the event's entrance fees
and catalog sales.
</P>
<P>
   About $10 million is generated from tourism, spent at hotels,
restaurants and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the Biennale's plans is a new theater on San Giorgio
Island, across the canal from San Marco, which would hold
year-round dance and performing arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, plans also include keeping the gardens
at the tip of Venice _ where the 26 national pavilions are
clustered _ open all the time, beginning with a schedule of
programs in the Italian pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope other pavilions will follow,'' Ms. Legnani said.
</P>
<P>
   Not LA Style
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to art world speculation, Pace Wildenstein is not
closing its Beverly Hills gallery. But it is discontinuing its
exhibition program there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gallery is still open and there is art for people to
buy,'' said Arne Glimcher, the chairman of Pace Wildenstein.
</P>
<P>
   It will continue to stock work by the artists it represents,
including Agnes Martin, Chuck Close, Kiki Smith and Robert
Rauschenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pace Wildenstein opened its Los Angeles branch on Wilshire
Boulevard in 1995, the gallery has held more than 50 exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to come to the openings, but the Los Angeles life
style does not include gallery going, it's simply not part of the
culture.'' Glimcher said. ``We've done very well here, but not from
the shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The space, which was designed by the New York architect Charles
Gwathmey, never attracted the steady traffic that Pace
Wildenstein's two New York galleries _ on 57th Street and in SoHo _
have, even though Glimcher is particularly well connected in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A part-time producer and director for movies that include
``Gorillas in the Mist'' and ``Mambo Kings,'' he knows the many
modern and contemporary art collectors who make their money in the
movie business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still an art-buying life in Los Angeles,'' Glimcher
said. ``Just not a gallery-going one. People in Los Angeles prefer
to go to the gym.''

CURLING UP WITH A GOOD E-BOOK
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday July 8.)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been reading about electronic books, not the ones you order
by computer but the kind that you read on computer, and it's
starting to make me nervous. I feel like I should throw myself in
front of my bookshelf, clutch my book bag to my chest and shout,
``get back.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been talk for some time about online versions of books,
whole novels we can read off our computers and eventually little
hand-held computer books. But they always seemed so easy to
dismiss. Who's going to want to haul a computer to bed, to the
beach or balance one in a hammock?
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, as long as they are books, whether they're
on paper, tape or computer screen, maybe we shouldn't get too picky
about what form they take. At least people are reading.
</P>
<P>
   But I worry about my hard and softback friends and become
defensive when someone talks up the coming ease of e-books.
</P>
<P>
   Books on paper have personality. The ones on computer are
virtual books, digital versions of the real thing, one step removed
from an actual living, breathing book.
</P>
<P>
   I'm preparing my protest to convince myself. I know how fickle
we consumers are in terms of machines. We vow we will never give up
chatting with our favorite teller at the bank and look at us now,
disgustingly ATM-dependent.
</P>
<P>
   It happens. You read about some new cool, time saving, efficient
techno marvel and think ``nice, but who needs a car phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then you start to wonder if what you're really displaying is
curmudgeonly disdain for the modern world. Did they not also once
scorn the electric light bulb?
</P>
<P>
   But you like the old way. Why spend all that money on a CD
player when you have a perfectly fine tape deck?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, did they really think they could convince
people to give up their typewriters for video display terminals?
</P>
<P>
   So, there it is. Progress happens and before you know it you've
bought into it and you're telling the relatives they'd hear from
you a lot more if they'd get e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But e-M.F.K. Fisher?
</P>
<P>
   At this point I can't grasp the advantage of reading electronic
books over ones in paper except you don't have to turn the page. I
like turning pages. And then turning back. I like underlining and
writing comments in margins, which is blasphemous to some but it
makes the book even more my own. How do you make a computer book
your own?
</P>
<P>
   You can move words from a piece of paper to a screen but there's
something else that isn't transferable.
</P>
<P>
   How does a computer book smell? It doesn't smell clean and sharp
like a new book or have the dusty musk of an old one. But I worry
that there will be people someday who may not know to miss the
smell of books.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they also won't know to miss free floating in a book
store, waiting for something to jump out and say read me. Or how it
is to find a used book, creased and worn from another who loved it
and passed it on.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of computer books what will people put on their walls
and stack next to their bed? What will they lend to a friend?
</P>
<P>
   They're working hard to streamline electronic books so that you
can read them in the subway, even in the tub. Right now the
complaint is that the online choice of books is limited and that
the devices are heavy. In terms of real books, they weigh about the
same as a fat hardcover. But I bet they aren't as welcome in bed.
Hey, what happens if you fall asleep with the thing turned on?
</P>
<P>
   Improvements are being made, they say.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like the sound of it.

 &HT;    GORE PRESENTS EVERGLADES PLAN
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Let's get it done,'' Vice President Al Gore urged
Congress on Thursday as formally presented the administration's
$7.8 billion, 20-year plan for restoring the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, Gore declared the
10-volume, 4,000-plus-page plan ``reasonable and flexible'' and
predicted future generations would look at the result ``in awe and
wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Also taking part in the presentation, held in a meeting room a
few steps off the Senate floor, were a handful of committee
chairmen whose panels could determine the fate of the ambitious
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal aims at reversing decades of water management
efforts by diverting to the Everglades 80 percent of the water that
now flows to the ocean, while providing the rest to populous areas
along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of study, argument and negotiation, the
restoration plan presented Thursday _ called a ``restudy'' of the
Central and Southern Florida Project that built hundreds of miles
of canals and levees from the late 1940s to the early 1970s _ is
merely the latest step in the restoration process.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will probably hold hearings on the plan this year
before incorporating it into next year's Water Resources
Development Act. If authorized then, money for the initial projects
would not be provided before the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said getting congressional support will
be difficult because the plan changes the usual relationship
between Congress and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Usually corps projects are authorized after detailed plans are
presented to Congress _ a process Graham compared to building a
house after seeing the architectural blueprints. In this case, the
Everglades plan is more like a road map, with the corps laying out
the destination and asking Congress to give it latitude to reach
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably going to be the biggest thing we have to
convince our colleagues, is to give the corps greater latitude,''
Graham said. ``What we're going to do is hold the corps answerable
to performance rather than a pre-approved process.''
</P>
<P>
   A key player in determining whether the Everglades plan will be
authorized in next year's water bill is Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.,
chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who
was one of the few non-Floridians participating in Thursday's
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to act is now,'' Chafee said. ``We will do everything
in our committee to move this along swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chafee noted that the plan's price tag might cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a program that is going to cost some money. Even for
someone in Washington, $7.8 billion is a fair sum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate hurdle looms this summer. Congressional
appropriators have earmarked far less for Everglades-related
spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 than the $151 million
the Clinton administration has requested. A House subcommittee this
week put the amount at $114 million; the Senate Appropriations
Committee has penciled in $90.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tipton, director of U.S. Ecoregion Conservation for the
World Wildlife Fund, noted that in previous years the
appropriations bills have initially set low levels for Everglades
spending but that the final amounts have been increased in
conference committee action. Tipton said he hoped for a repeat of
that pattern this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Clinton administration's point-man on Everglades
restoration, acknowledged the difficult path the restoration
project faces. The task now, he said, is to ``build a coalition
that brings everybody on board.''

THE UPS AND DOWNS OF RESTRICTOR-PLATE RACING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Mark Martin has had his troubles at
Daytona and Talladega, doesn't even really like to race there,
really.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely frustrating to know you, as a driver, can't
help out the car,'' Martin said as preparations began for Saturday
night's Pepsi 400 at the Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, the driver plays a part in it,'' Martin went on.
``But I don't care what anybody says, certain drivers have good
restrictor-plate cars every single time.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been the case with Martin and the other four
teams in owner Jack Roush's stable of cars.
</P>
<P>
   If the Roush teams have a weakness, it has been their
performance in restrictor plate races.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's through no fault of their own. Other times, they
simply haven't had enough power to run up front.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Martin and the other strong Roush entry, driven by
Jeff Burton, were both caught up in the massive wreck started by
Dale Jarrett in February's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Burton ended up 35th, Martin 31st as a result of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Both had better luck at Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega,
Ala., Martin finishing third and Burton 11th although Burton had an
engine problem that affected the car when he had to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won Talladega twice. I've won, and I've run in the middle of
the pack and I've gotten lapped,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've run all over the place and I know that it has a ton to do
with your car,'' Martin declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help the car, as a driver, nearly as much as you can
anywhere else where you have to let off the gas to get through the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, driver skill and experience plays about five times as
much a part of it as when you can hold it wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (racing at Daytona and Talladega) like driving down the
interstate,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has had a lot of ups and downs at the two
restrictor-plate tracks, which use metal inserts between the
carburetor and the intake manifold to limit the mixture of gas and
air reaching the engine, thereby cutting horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers complain that slows acceleration, making it difficult to
avoid wrecks and making crashes more serious because the cars tend
to bunch up in packs.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the drivers don't care for the plates, something
had to be done to slow the cars when they began running more than
200 mph at both Daytona and Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, the concern was keeping them from flying into the
stands if they wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   But the plates can cause problems for the drivers, and Martin is
one of those who has experienced the highs and lows of
restrictor-plate racing.
</P>
<P>
   He has been in bad wrecks, like the one at this year's Daytona
500, and he also won the fastest stock car race ever run, averaging
188.354 mph in the 1997 Winston 500 at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ``A restrictor-plate race is so unique, the win is such a unique
win because it's 100 percent credit to my team,'' Martin said.

NOTARO: THIEF HAS IT MADE IN MY SHADE

   PHOENIX - ``Please sit down,'' my husband said as soon as I
walked through the front door. ``I have something . . . disturbing
to tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another cat died underneath the house,'' I said, taking a
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. The smell is still from the one that's already under
there,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find the scissors again, so you trimmed your
eyebrows with a lighter,'' I said as he just looked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steak knife,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, something disturbing . . . I know, I know! You
accidentally put on a pair of my underwear and ended up liking
it,'' I said, hoping that wasn't it, because I won't share things
like that.
</P>
<P>
   He just furrowed his brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you be quiet for a minute?'' he finally said. ``What I
wanted to tell you is that someone _ ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Left a Chinese baby on our doorstep!'' I said hopping up.
``I'm a MAMA!!''
</P>
<P>
   `` _ stole your carport!'' my husband released in one, rushed
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   I stood there for a moment, then sat back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are LYING,'' I said as I stared across the room. ``That is
completely unbelievable!''
</P>
<P>
   It WAS unbelievable. The carport/shade structure was a good 10
by 10 feet, rose nearly 9 feet into the air, consisted of
metal-tube construction and was covered by striped canvas, and was
nearly big enough to park two cars under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious,'' he replied. ``Somebody just hopped the fence
and TOOK it. All of the gates in the back yard are still locked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me get this straight,'' I said slowly, thinking about it.
What this meant, essentially, was:
</P>
<P>
   a) Someone scaled my 6-foot block wall, THEN
</P>
<P>
   b) pulled up the stakes that had secured the carport, which had
been hammered a foot into the ground, THEN
</P>
<P>
   c) tossed the shade structure over the wall as a whole unit (I
know this because I put it together and knew that it would have
taken nearly 20 minutes to disassemble in the dark), THEN
</P>
<P>
   d) ran down the street with what basically looked like a
campsite with no fire, OR
</P>
<P>
   e) threw the cabana into the bed of a waiting truck and stole
away into the night to attend a BYOS (Bring Your Own Shade)
midnight barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who steals a cabana?'' I wondered aloud. ``Picnic pirates?''
</P>
<P>
   And if someone saw this, did any of my neighbors think it was
odd that someone was running down the street, dragging a festive
white-and-green-striped cabana behind them? Did they think it was
the circus, or a disoriented parasailor?
</P>
<P>
   And then I remembered where I live, and what lives several
blocks from me. Oh yes, my neighbors. My fellow man. In fact, 47 of
my fellow men were all living in the same apartment a couple of
blocks away before the INS busted up that hoppin' party several
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On certain streets, it means you're rich if you have a broken,
torn couch AND a recliner on your front porch. By those standards,
I suppose I'm the Bill Gates of my ghetto, flaunting my boundless
and extreme wealth by pitching a carport in the dirt of my back
yard. Shame on us, putting on airs. Filthy, greedy bourgeois!
</P>
<P>
   How pretentious we were when we decided to remove asbestos and
flaking lead paint before we moved into our house! Living like the
kings of Fancy Pants Land, we were! That's right, we're too good
for cancer and blood poisoning! But we snobs were sure taught a
lesson when we arrived one morning and the house had been
completely cleaned out, including the bounty of contaminated
dropcloths and the bathroom sink.
</P>
<P>
   It was very unsettling to know that someone had been going
through our things, and at that time I wasn't sure whether it was
more unsettling for me to have robbers or the DEA ransack my house
(long story), because, in hindsight, I've learned that neither one
comes back to clean up. After the robbery, we used our
air-conditioning savings to install a security system, and slept in
pools of our own sweat for the next two summers.
</P>
<P>
   My husband was admittedly being a show-off when he left a
10-speed with dented rims and two flat tires in our back yard,
because someone also felt the need to relieve us of that little pot
of gold. That's when we used our Christmas savings to get bars on
the windows, and I was forced to give ``hug coupons'' to my family
for holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the really sad part of the story. Pity the poor little
thief who mistook the disintegrating circa-1985 Pier One wicker
chair that was missing a seat for the ancient throne of Cleopatra,
because despite its four, unraveling legs, it had a little outside
assistance walking off our porch. That's when I used the money I
was saving for a trip to the gynecologist to get metal security
doors and got a hand-held mirror instead.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, what bravado we, Mr. and Mrs. Livin' Large, exuded by
driving around in a truck with a dented, scratched tailgate,
because someone also helped themselves to that morsel from the
car-part buffet, unhinging it from the bed and simply walking away
with it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, we started parking in the back yard, under the
shade cabana I bought with my own money, money I had saved and
earned from working.
</P>
<P>
   That was an American Dream short-lived, wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what to do now. Skip a mortgage payment and build a
fire pit around my house, dig a moat or smear something gooey and
moist on top of the wall?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should take a tip from my old neighbor Bill, who laced
his yard with a tripwire that had ``enough volts to knock a horse
on its ass'' after a 7-foot Barney Santa was shanghaied from his
yard during Christmas of '95.
</P>
<P>
   Bill would also chop down trees in his front yard after he had
fights with his wife, so I'm not too sure how realistic that option
truly is.
</P>
<P>
   An hour ago, though, I took a black Sharpie marker and wrote
``THIS WAS STOLEN FROM LAURIE NOTARO'' on everything I thought was
worth more than $10, including the replacement bathroom sink and a
rug that smells like pee.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would deter the kind of thief who was brazen enough
to steal something as big as, say, a bedroom from my back yard, but
at least I get the last word.
</P>
<P>
   It's a disturbingly small reward, especially since someone out
there still owes me a Pap smear. &QL;

 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ The family, visitors one Sunday to
Gainesville's Emmanuel Mennonite Church, told the pastor after
worship that they felt welcome and had appreciated the service. But
they never returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We have just one problem, and that is that you're
a woman,' '' said Heidi Kreider, 37, Emmanuel Mennonite's pastor
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   That experience isn't uncommon among female clergy, a new
University of Florida study indicates. Other clergywomen tell
similar stories of on-the-job bias.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist church near Tampa in which Valerie Storms
grew up, and where she was ordained in 1985, declined her offer to
preach while the regular pastor recovered from a heart attack.
Later, while between pastors, the same church also passed on her
offer to lead the flock until a replacement was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even got a reply,'' said Storms, 44, a chaplain at
Shands Hospital at the University of Florida since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Storms and other female clergy acknowledge that such resistance
to their ministries has eased over the years. Still, the findings
of a UF study of females in the ministry suggests the sanctuary
remains a bastion of sexism, or at least a place where
opportunities aren't always equal for women and men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clergywomen face the same conflicts as (other) professional
women, those of balancing work and family, social isolation and
having to win acceptance from peers and superiors,'' said Jesse
Schultz, a graduate student in sociology who did the study for her
thesis. ``But they also must interpret Scriptures that are biased
against women and struggle with a traditional male model in their
denominations.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on a 1995 survey of 190 ordained United
Methodist clergywomen. Schultz wrote the study with UF sociology
professor Constance Shehan and Marsha Wiggins Frame, former
associate pastor at Trinity United Methodist Church now at the
Denver campus of the University of Colorado, where she's a
professor in counseling psychology and counselor education.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said the findings likely are similar for women clergy in
other denominations. The Rev. Melana Scruggs, ordained 12 years ago
in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience has been that to lay people, once they know you,
there's not much difference whether you're a female or male
minister,'' said Scruggs, 38, pastor of Faith Presbyterian Church
in Melrose. ``Some of my colleagues in the ministry, however, are
still a bit slower to include women as colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   She said women today make up about half the graduates from her
denomination's seminaries. Yet women graduates are more likely to
get a chaplaincy or interim pastorate, she said, while men more
often go to a church either as a fellow pastor or an associate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If men go to a chaplaincy, it's usually their choice,''
Scruggs said. ``That's not to say anything against chaplaincy ...
I'm just saying that for women it's difficult to get the first call
to a church. In our presbytery, I have until three months ago been
the only solo woman pastor in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clergywomen's limited opportunities has been called the
stained-glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Anne Robertson, however, is moving up.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson has left Trinity United Methodist Church, where she
has been associate pastor since 1997, and is headed to Dover, N.H.,
to pastor her own church. Before joining Trinity as minister of
nurture and discipleship, her first appointment after graduating
with honors from seminary in 1994 was as pastor of Cross City's
First United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Robertson spoke to the Gainesville Rotary
Club about the challenges of being a woman minister. She talked
about the difficulty of parking in a Gainesville hospital lot
reserved for clergy, and the frustration of having to justify her
right to park to attendants who thought she was a minister's wife
even though her name was on the pass and she had a clergy tag on
her car.
</P>
<P>
   Her second Sunday in Cross City, she said, a bra ``the size of
the Titanic'' was draped across the front steps of the church. A
male church leader earlier had told her, ``I don't believe you
belong here. I don't believe women should be preaching, and there's
a lot of us who believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice in her ministry, once in Cross City and once in
Gainesville, she said, she was told, ``If you preach in the nude, I
will (attend).''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said her Cross City congregation doubled during her
three-year ministry, and she was warmly accepted at Trinity. But
the successes she's had, she said, ``have come at a greater cost
because of my gender.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have to do more than convince a congregation they have
the gifts and graces to do the job,'' she said. ``They have to
convince a congregation they have a right to even try.''
</P>
<P>
   As a chaplain, Storms said, she has noticed that gender doesn't
matter so much to the sick. Although in her office she sometimes
has been mistaken for a secretary by a patient or family member,
she said, in a more clinical setting her ministry is what matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are in the hospital, they're so vulnerable and
sometimes scared,'' Storms said. ``I think in this setting it's
different because people are in a place they're not used to, and
they will talk to anyone who will offer a comforting word.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that clergywomen sometimes have to fight not
only people's attitudes, but Scripture itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Scriptures are used as a firm argument that women
have no place as church leaders, clergywomen must take extra steps
to be taken seriously and earn trust,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you preach on passages that seem to exclude you?''
Kreider said. ``While that's a challenge I think women need to
confront, I choose not to preach on those passages. It seems like
it would be saying I have an ax to grind. But if people come to me,
I am willing to dialogue with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the study, clergywomen rated balancing work and family as
their biggest challenge. One minister surveyed said the thing she
wanted most to change was the expectation that the pastor is on
call 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs, a mother of two young children, said that while the
balancing act can be difficult, she hasn't found the same
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the congregation honors the fact that I'm a mother,
more than maybe it would for a male minister who is a father,'' she
said. ``I rarely get interrupted at home. I don't think that's as
true for men.''

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS VOW TAX RELIEF, BUT ARE UNSURE HOW MUCH
 &HT;    520&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gleeful over forecasts of a deluge of budget
surpluses, House Republican leaders celebrated Thursday with
promises of tax breaks for virtually every taxpaying household.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the good economic news, the leaders have yet to
forge a consensus among their own Republican members, and may have
to settle for more modest reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty was apparent as House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., described the reductions in only general terms at a rally
complete with red, white and blue balloons and catchy tunes from a
local fife and drum corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we commit ourselves to find a way to secure our retirement
programs, we all hope to commit ourselves to bring fairness to the
American tax code,'' he said without mentioning a precise amount.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican leadership set a goal of returning to
taxpayers all surplus revenues that are not part of the Social
Security trust fund. The Congressional Budget Office on Thursday,
coming close to rosy predictions made earlier this week by the
White House budget office, forecast the non-Social Security surplus
at $996 billion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, such upbeat news has yet to persuade moderate
Republicans to accept more than the $778 billion in tax cuts
already in the congressional budget, said Hastert spokesman John
Feerey. He said that the tax proposal would not be laid out until
after the leaders have struck a compromise bringing all of the GOP
members on board.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing
Ways and Means Committee and a passionate tax-cutter, promised to
unveil major tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason for the surplus is that taxpayers are paying
too much, and they deserve a refund,'' Archer said. Otherwise, he
said, ``the politicians will most certainly spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the biggest reduction would be an unspecified
across-the-board reduction. ``I believe that it's wrong to deny
relief to everyone who has made this surplus possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also listed as targeted cuts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ending the so-called ``marriage penalty'' under which an
estimated 42 million people pay higher taxes than they would as
single people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax breaks for localities that put aside money for building
new schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax breaks to make health insurance more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ending the earnings cap for people who receive Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Greatly'' reducing taxes on capital gains (for transactions
as of Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   _ Cutting inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican tax-cutters face united opposition among Democrats in
the House. Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., promptly dismissed
the GOP proposals as ``totally irresponsible'' and charged that the
plan would make it ``impossible to deal with Social Security and
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, ``How amazing that the same
House Republicans who claim we cannot afford prescriptions for
seniors and cannot afford to hold the managed health care insurers
accountable can now promise a trillion-dollar tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The House tax cuts also face opposition in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But the new economic forecasts increased the prospects for a
bipartisan effort led by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   With co-sponsorship of Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., the plan
would put many middle-income families who are now in the 28 percent
bracket into the 15 percent level for paying income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is ``very supportive'' of the House efforts for more
substantial tax relief, according to his spokeswoman Laura Cox.
``But it is not particularly realistic,'' she said. ``That's the
reason we're pushing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coverdell plan has received broad backing from the business
community, from the Senate leadership and from some Democrats, and
a companion bill has won bipartisan backing in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see a bill that moves,'' the aide said. ``The only
way we'll see any tax relief is if it gets passed and signed into
law. A little bit is better than nothing.''

 &HT;    `Desert' elevates small-town blahs to hip state of cool

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue'' is one of those movies in which the lack of
anything interesting happening is presented as a badge of Gen-Y
integrity and coolness. Written and directed by Morgan J. Freeman
(``Hurricane Streets''), it introduces us to tiny Baxter, Calif., a
little hunk of nowhere driven primarily by teenage angst.
</P>
<P>
   Blue (Brendan Sexton III) is the leader of the small-town blahs,
a moody guy who hangs out with chubby pal Cale (Ethan Suplee); Pete
(Casey Affleck), who spends his free time preparing for
all-terrain-vehicle races; and Pete's girlfriend, Ely (Christina
Ricci), a raccoon-eyed malcontent whose expertise in explosives
results in unexpected detonations all around Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   The main point of local interest is a giant artificial ice cream
cone on the roadside, built to attract tourists. There's also a
sandy gulch, designed by Blue's now-deceased father, who had hoped
to somehow fill it with water and turn Baxter into a lake resort.
These broad strokes of Americana kitsch weigh the movie down with
an early sense of condescension toward its characters. You can't
help siding with young TV star Skye (Kate Hudson), who's passing
through town with her dad (John Heard) and can't wait to leave.
</P>
<P>
   When a soft-drink truck crashes, authorities fear that the pop
is toxic, and they quarantine the town. Your reaction is bound to
be like that of the Baxter residents: At least something has
finally happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue'' isn't intolerable. As it unfolds, Freeman
elicits some sweet performances from his young stars. Ricci does
her patented surly routine, Affleck makes a swell hothead, and
Hudson is clearly an actress to watch. Only Sexton throws scenes
out of whack; too often, his awkwardness seems to be more a matter
of stiff acting than character development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Sexton III, Kate Hudson and Christina Ricci.
Rated R for strong language and teenage alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A small-town study of teenage attitude.

 &HT;    Girard's latest, `The Red Violin,' strings together cultures and
eras
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Francois Girard didn't mean for his new film to have
such a high body count. The instrument made him do it.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for ``32 Short Films About Glenn Gould,'' an
elliptical study of the Canadian pianist, Girard returns to a
musical theme with ``The Red Violin,'' a melancholy, intimate epic
spanning three centuries as it follows the fate of a masterpiece of
carved wood and catgut.
</P>
<P>
   As Girard and co-screenwriter Don McKellar began to invent the
trajectory of the violin, they realized that its fictional history
was requiring human fatalities. ``There is a cumulative effect with
all those deaths, and in a way it is something we fought,'' he said
during a recent visit to Atlanta. ``This violin is so precious and
powerful and beautiful, nobody would give it away or sell it. So
the only way for it to move to the next character is to actually
kill the previous owner.'' He laughs. ``That's how we turned into
serial killers.''
</P>
<P>
   A Montreal Wunderkind who earned his rep as a savvy director of
art and music videos, Girard, 36, shot the concert film ``Peter
Gabriel's Secret World'' and directed an episode of ``Yo-Yo Ma:
Inspired by Bach.''
</P>
<P>
   Music has always been big in his life. He grew up playing the
piano but was never trained. ``I'm a self-taught piano bum,'' he
says. ``But in my work, since the very beginning, music has always
had a very important part. It's a very important language that can
carry a number of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of languages, ``The Red Violin's'' multiple locations _
the English and Italian countryside, Shanghai, Vienna and finally
Montreal _ resulted in a UN-like set of multiple languages. Girard
and McKellar had to find writers to translate their script into
Italian, Chinese, German and French, taking into account linguistic
conventions of time and place. The movie took 65 days to shoot,
stretched over five months.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the actors who play the violin in the film really could
play, including German child prodigy Christoph Koncz. For the
Chinese segment, actress Sylvia Chang took lessons until she could
knock off a tune on the instrument. ``I didn't care, because (the
character) was not a virtuoso, but the daughter of a virtuoso.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Jason Flemyng, playing a lusty British composer called
Frederick Pope, had probably the hardest challenge. ``For Pope, I
had to go for the best actor and fix the musical problems after,''
Girard says. ``We used all sorts of (cinematic) tricks to sell him
as a virtuoso.'' Violinist Joshua Bell, who plays the solos on the
film's soundtrack, also gave Flemyng lessons in how to ``dance''
with the music.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were Flemyng's scenes that required him to pretend to
play the violin while simultaneously making love. ``The sex part he
didn't need to learn,'' Girard cracks. ``He had been there before.
But the two together, that was a bit of a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Glenn Gould,'' ``The Red Violin'' plays as a sort of
enigma, a layered exploration of a mystery that can't quite be
explained. ``The last thing I wanted to do was to come to some sort
of explanation,'' Girard says. ``I was more interested in the
opposite. I wanted to nourish the enigma.''
</P>
<P>
   So what, in the end, does the wayward violin represent? ``My
take on it is that it is a lost soul looking for understanding and
peace,'' he says.

GOV. GEORGE W. MONEYBAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every other presidential candidate, including Vice
President Al Gore, would love to be in Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
generously-buffered boots.
</P>
<P>
   In four months, Bush raised an astounding $36.25 million in
campaign funds. Merely calling this amazing feat a record doesn't
do it justice.
</P>
<P>
   This is twice as much money as Gore has collected, nearly twice
as much as President Clinton raised for his re-election three years
ago during a similar period, and considerably more than the 11
other Republican candidates combined.
</P>
<P>
   No prior presidential candidate has ever raised this much money
this fast. No one has come even close.
</P>
<P>
   Money attracts other money. On the whole, it is better to have
money than not to have it. And Bush's fund-raising has only begun.
Heaven knows how much he will have in hand by the time the
Republican convention rolls around next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gobs of dough, which unsuccessful 1996 GOP presidential hopeful
Sen. Phil Gramm once called ``the mother's milk of politics,''
matters a lot in a campaign. (Gramm raised $20 million, remarkable
for a Texas senator of no particular achievement. It got him taken
seriously at first but didn't do him much good in the long run. The
milk went sour when the voters got a good look at him.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, blessed with an attractive personality, is no Gramm.
Voters haven't yet had a good look at the candidate, but so far
they like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is awash in so much cash that he is likely to reject
the federal matching subsidies and accompanying spending limits
that have governed previous presidential campaigns. This will
enable him to conduct an expensive polling operation, saturate the
airwaves with commercials, rig straw polls, pay for expensive
strategists and fly first-class all the way.
</P>
<P>
   This independent route is virtually uncharted territory,
although megabucks media magnate Steve Forbes is underwriting much
of the cost of his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The few who have ignored the familiar federal campaign finance
system have not done well. Voters want their candidates to follow
bipartisan rules that standardize the political skirmishing and
offer the atmosphere of campaign fairness.
</P>
<P>
   There is bound to be some backlash against a guy on top who has
so many marbles he can end the game for everyone by refusing to
play. We do like underdogs in this country, unless they are the
hapless Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush's riches may not turn out to be the automatic
advantage they now appear to be. In politics, as in other areas of
life, there can be too much of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already is in danger of looking as though he is trying to
buy the election. If GOP rivals like the formidable Sen. John
McCain of Arizona can make money the central issue, Bush is in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Voters still don't have a very clear idea of who Bush is or
where he stands. Campaign funds that may now demonstrate widespread
support within the Republican establishment could later suggest
subservience to special interests impervious to the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could quickly slip from being a vague ``compassionate
conservative'' into the role of shill for positions that happen to
please big contributors like the tobacco, gun and insurance
industries.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Bush campaign memo outlines the organizing plans of
zealous, well-heeled Washington lobbyists to tilt the Aug. 14 Iowa
straw poll toward Bush. Will Iowans be offended? We'll see. Busing
in workers and passing out goodies to stack straw polls is an old
political trick, known to work in the past for those with money to
throw around. It even worked briefly for Gramm in the last
election.
</P>
<P>
   But such highhandedness may be losing its charm. Voters like a
contest, not a coronation. This is not a monarchy, no matter how
distinguished the family dynasty from which Bush sprang.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush loses that straw poll, all his money will not compensate
for the loss of a sense of presidential inevitability that has been
the motor driving his momentum. He has been hauling in the bucks
because people want to be on the train before it leaves the
station. If they begin to suspect the locomotive lacks traction,
they will look for another train.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other GOP engines idling nearby, needing only the
oil of more campaign funds themselves. Chief among them is McCain,
whose campaign not only oozes leadership vibes but is centered on
his widely-cheered but unsuccessful legislative crusade for
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   McCain doesn't accuse Bush of doing anything wrong in raising
all that money. McCain, running a distant second in the GOP
moneybags sweepstakes at just over $4 million, would like to raise
more himself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain specifically targets the unlimited donations known as
``soft money'' that have distorted the election process by allowing
candidates to duck responsibility for issue-advocacy advertisements
touting their positions. So far, most of Bush's money appears to be
of the old-fashioned direct-contribution variety.
</P>
<P>
   But when McCain speaks, it is worth listening. And if he keeps
yapping about corrupt influence-peddling that ``sells the country
to the highest bidder,'' he is going to put the evils of big money
front and center in this campaign. And Bush, the candidate with big
money, is going to be on the defensive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy
</P>
<P>
   Who Shagged Me'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers
</P>
<P>
   and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's fave dentally impaired British superspy, Mike
Myers goes back to the '60s to save his mojo from Dr. Evil and a
giant slob in a kilt (Myers and Myers, respectively). Shaggy but
still shagadelic, this worthy sequel also stars Heather Graham as a
curvy CIA operative, Seth Green as Dr. Evil's brooding son Scott
and Jerry Springer (don't ask). (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest money-maker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue'' R (profanity and teen alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Sexton III,
</P>
<P>
   Kate Hudson and Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those movies in which the lack of anything
interesting happening is presented as a badge of Gen-Y integrity
and coolness. Written and directed by Morgan J. Freeman
(``Hurricane Streets''), the movie introduces us to tiny Baxter,
Calif., a little hunk of nowhere driven primarily by teenage angst.
While the movie isn't intolerable, little really happens. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 26 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' R (profanity, sexuality and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a
</P>
<P>
   bittersweet ode to the everyday lies people tell themselves to
justify their actions. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. He's got to.
Somebody's got to turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and
disguised as an A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is a slick,
over-directed, over-written and ultimately underwhelming whodunit
B-grade thriller. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' R (profanity, adult sexual issues)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Silverstone
</P>
<P>
   and Brad Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Needs to get over itself. This gay-themed film about two British
male teens and their coming-out conflicts might have been of some
interest 15 years ago. Now, it's so obvious that the only ones
who'll be interested are gay 15-year-olds. As is, ``Get Real''
bravely goes where too many films have gone before. (ERG) 1 hour,
48 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett,
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett,
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Northam and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a blackmailer who knows a secret from his past. The
fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's literal-minded
approach. What remains is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' R (intense violent behavior)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins
</P>
<P>
   and Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Resist your instinct to see it. Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins
plays an anthropologist locked up in a psychiatric prison
surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates. It seems that, after living for
months with gorillas in the African wilds, he went berserk and
killed two natives. Why? It's up to a psychiatry student (Oscar
winner Cuba Gooding Jr.) to pick his mind. It's twaddle. (SM) 2
hours, 4 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' R (language, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years
in this sometimes hilarious and racially poignant prison comedy.
How they landed in a Mississippi correctional facility with life
sentences isn't nearly as important as the knack these talented
performers have for taking turns at generating laughs out of a
throwaway script. (Bob Longino). 1 hour, 49 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Strathairn
</P>
<P>
   and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.
</P>
<P>
   Independent filmmaker John Sayles is at his most
independent-minded in this intriguing and inherently honorable
movie whose parts don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's as if he
set out to make one film _ a tender, middle-aged romance told
against the backdrop of encroaching tourism in Alaska _ and then
got interested in something totally different: an unsettling
metaphysical survival tale. (ERG) 2 hours, 6 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne
</P>
<P>
   and Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure
</P>
<P>
   starring Keanu Reeves that should please comic book fanatics and
mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with stunning special
effects and action, it's a movie that earns its explosions, high
kicks and cascades of spent
</P>
<P>
   bullets. (SM) 2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' PG-13 (pervasive adventure violence
</P>
<P>
   and partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Mummy, make it stop! Please! Just because a movie has desert
scenery, a hunky action hero (Brendan Fraser), hissable bad guys
and supernatural hoodoo doesn't make it an Indiana Jones flick.
You'll miss Steven Spielberg's masterful touch watching ``The
Mummy,'' a petrified mixture of retro adventure, clumsy slapstick
and minimal chills. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours, 4 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' Not rated, but contains
</P>
<P>
   nudity and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's centuries-spanning saga follows the fortunes
and misfortunes of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. (ERG)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours, 10 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' R (profanity, gross-out
humor, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Trey Parker,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   It offers what you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's
probably the most offensive (and also funniest) bit of celluloid to
ever make moviegoers shell out $7. But in its timely, sly,
self-referential way, the movie is more than that. It's a witty
cultural artifact that captures the here and now of American media
obsessions, circa June 30, A.D. 1999. It should be put inside a
time capsule. (SM) 1 hour, 21 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi
action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM) 2 hours, 11
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' R (profanity, sex, violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Leguizamo,
</P>
<P>
   Mira Sorvino and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Summer'' is definitely long, but it's not so hot. Psycho
David Berkowitz's killing spree in New York's summer of '77 is just
one of many stories director Spike Lee tries to tell. Also in the
mix are Reggie Jackson's World Series and rising tensions among
some Italian-American homeboys in the Bronx for whom it would
already be a long, hot summer without the added stress of a killer
among them. (ERG) 2 hours, 22 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film with voices
</P>
<P>
   by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close and Nigel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap up this movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters.1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thirteenth Floor'' R (profanity, sex and violence)

   A ``what is reality?'' sci-fi thriller that doesn't measure up
to earlier and better films such as ``The Matrix'' and ``Dark

then walks around in, a digitized version of 1937 Los Angeles.
Murder, intrigue and too much flat acting follow. Your ultimate

   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional

   Like ``The Avengers'' last summer, this tale of 1800s agent

leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

 &HT;    Foul ... and funny, crude and clever, nasty as it wants to be,
wickedly on target
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to the predictably unpredictable Trey Parker and Matt
Stone to deliver the first multiplex, pop-culture, blockbuster art
film.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut''
offers what you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's
probably the most offensive (and funniest) bit of celluloid to ever
make moviegoers shell out $7. But in its timely, sly,
self-referential way, the movie is more than that. It's a witty
cultural artifact that captures the here and now of American media
obsessions, circa June 30, A.D. 1999. It should be put in a time
capsule.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Stan, one of the interchangeable lumps of
foulmouthed animated childhood who wobble onscreen, ``This is about
more than fart jokes.'' (But without those jokes, this movie would
run only about 22 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park'' is a postmodern artifact, a movie about itself.
It will inevitably provoke the very kind of firestorm that its plot
revolves around. Simply put: Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny sneak
their way into an obscenity-driven Canadian flick starring comics
Terrence and Philip. (The movie-within-a-movie's centerpiece is a
filthy, very catchy song, whose lyrics include virtually only one
printable word: ``uncle.'')
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, the kids go back to school and share their newfound
language skills with their classmates. This allows the filmmakers
to expand the potty-mouth vocabulary of their schoolkids into
smutty riffs of mind-blowing inventiveness and shock value. ``That
movie has warped my fragile little mind,'' Cartman says. It's a
tongue-in-cheek moment you know reflects Parker and Stone's own
disdain for the fad of blaming Hollywood for all social ills.
</P>
<P>
   The ``South Park'' movie doesn't work hard to upgrade its
proudly primitive animation on the big screen, though a couple of
computer-generated effects pop up. The movie is bigger mainly in
its escalation of gross-out and sexual humor. (It could double as a
psychological study on Parker and Stone's equal mix of fascination
and repulsion with homosexuality and anal sex.)
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park'' serves up a heaven full of big-breasted, naked
angels, lets Big Gay Al go full-frontal nude and takes us to a hell
populated with the likes of Adolf Hitler and George Burns. It's in
hell that the ever-slaughtered Kenny offers relationship advice to
a sensitive Satan and his sexually aggressive boyfriend, Saddam
Hussein. Satan's plans to conquer the earth result in a musical
number that splits into a quartet, genially mocking the first-act
finales of ``Les Miz'' and ``West Side Story.'' (The movie's many
sardonic song-and-dance numbers represent the final shovel of soil
dumped on the corpse of Hollywood's bright-eyed musical past.)
</P>
<P>
   As gleefully nasty as it is clever, ``South Park'' takes
potshots at Brooke Shields and Winona Ryder and those acting clans
the Baldwins and the Arquettes. It has a couple of dull stretches
in the last half-hour, and the ugly animation is wearing after a
point. But most of the movie is so irreverently wicked, it makes
you shudder to imagine the two minutes of footage that had to be
snipped to escape an NC-17 rating.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, kids are going to be scheming nonstop to see it.
</P>
<P>
   While it's doubtful that outraged American parents will launch
an actual war, as happens in the movie, ``South Park'' will likely
be the latest battlefield in the current war of words concerning
school violence and freedom of speech. In the past month we've seen
Louisiana legislation requiring public school students to address
adults as ``sir'' and ``ma'am'' and, more crucially, a move to
crack down on underage teens trying to sneak into R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park'' looks to be the ground-zero test case on whether
even the most aggressive box office workers and ushers can keep
kids away from stinky, irresistible candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Mary Kay
Bergman. Rated R for profanity, gross-out humor and animated
nudity. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Foul and funny in equal parts.

 &HT;    As a movie, `West' was a great TV show
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't second-guess Hollywood's recycling habits. Hey, a
``Brady Bunch'' movie? It seemed like a lousy idea, but the result
was smart and funny. An updated computer-generated version of
``Godzilla''? It sounded swell, but it stunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Wild West'' retooled for the multiplex didn't seem like
either a great or a godawful idea. It was just a head-scratcher.
Did anybody really want to see the adventures of trigger-happy
James West and his inventor partner Artemus Gordon on the big
screen? Even with those roles played by Will Smith and Kevin Kline,
directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (``Men in Black''), and lavished with
a rumored $180 million budget, the resulting movie is a mediocre
mess.
</P>
<P>
   The flick opens with Smith romancing a young lovely in a water
tower, circa 1869. Establishing the movie's expensive slapstick
style, that tank gets knocked over, spilling Smith into the path of
some redneck white boys who start to address him using the ``n''
word before he clocks them quiet.
</P>
<P>
   That an African-American is playing the role created on TV by
white actor Robert Conrad becomes a forced, unfunny joke, steering
Smith into face-offs with folks who sling words like ``slave,''
``boy'' and worse at him. The plot hinges on an unrepentant
Southern aristocrat named Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), who
lost his legs, and other body parts, in the Civil War, and now
intends to dominate the United States with the aid of a giant
mechanical spider. (His delivery of veiled racist epithets at Smith
has to rank as the low point of Branagh's screen career.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's possible to harness racism as the engine of a
blockbuster action-adventure-comedy. But ``West'' can't pull it
off. By the time it's trying to wring humor out of a scene pitting
Smith against a lynch mob, you know the movie's four screenwriters
don't have a clue what they're doing. It's an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Queasy racial politics aren't the only problem. Absolutely
nothing clicks. Kline and Smith spark zero sparks of buddy
chemistry, and Salma Hayek is wasted as a spunky beauty searching
for her scientist dad. The jokes land with almost audible thuds.
The blue-screen work and the computer generated effects are obvious
and underwhelming. Oh, and the fight scenes are dull.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Avengers'' last summer (another big-budget Warner
Bros. project), the movie is a bizarre mix of overproduced camp,
sloppy pacing and tepid scripting. ``Wild Wild West'' is anything
but wild. It's a washout.

 &HT;    Too many plot lines spoil Lee's overheated `Summer'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the ``Star Wars'' movies, Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam'' is
set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically: New York City during the summer of 1977.
</P>
<P>
   That was the summer when a psycho named David Berkowitz finished
his killing spree. Berkowitz, who called himself the ``Son of Sam''
in notes that found their way to the press (in particular columnist
Jimmy Breslin, who appears here as a kind of soothsayer-narrator),
wasn't a very sophisticated killer. His modus operandi was
outlandishly simple _ mostly, he walked up to people in their cars
and blew their brains out _ but it was also very effective. And it
set off a frenzy of fear among the Big Apple's residents,
especially those living in the Bronx, Berkowitz's preferred
stalking ground.
</P>
<P>
   In this ``Sam,'' Berkowitz himself (Michael Badalucco) is a
veritable minor character. He's mostly shown rolling around his
cramped, trash-filled apartment screaming at the neighbor's dog to
quit barking.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Lee focuses on the guys (and a few gals) in a
predominantly Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx for whom
it would already be a long, hot summer without the added stress of
a serial killer in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny (John Leguizamo), a womanizing hairdresser who's
constantly cheating on his sweet wife, Dionna (Mira SorvinoCQ),
happens to see two of Berkowitz's victims up close and becomes
convinced he could be next. Meanwhile, Vinny's best friend, Ritchie
(Adrien Brody), has traded John Travolta and disco for the Sex
Pistols and punk. He now sports spiked hair and affects a British
accent. This doesn't go down well with the neighborhood regulars,
who're becoming bat-wielding, list-keeping vigilantes as the Son of
Sam body count rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 8 million stories in the naked city,'' Breslin tells
us. ``This is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If only. ``Summer of Sam'' is at least five or six stories; the
summer of '77 is also, in Lee's mix, the summer of the blackout, a
crippling heat wave, Reggie Jackson's World Series, etc., etc.,
etc. The filmmaker wants to convey the feel of that time and place
by showing us everyone from the local mafioso (a wonderful bit by
Ben Gazzara) to an I'm-here-so-it-must-be-important TV anchor (Lee
himself, hilarious in an Afro and with an Afro-sized attitude).
</P>
<P>
   It's a nifty idea, one that Lee carried off to perfection in his
masterpiece, ``Do the Right Thing.'' But here it seems scattered
and unresolved, as if Lee had somehow gotten it into his head that
he ought to make a Robert Altman movie. He and his co-writers,
Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli, have the tough-funny
ambience of Vinny and his pals down pat. They achieve a real sense
of the city as it was in 1977 _ a mishmash of different scenes
ranging from CBGB's to Plato's Retreat to Studio 54. But they've
failed to give us anyone to care about. Vinnie, Dionna, even
Ritchie are as much caricatures as they are characters. When we
finally realize that Vinny and Ritchie's friendship is supposed to
really mean something _ a la Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro in
``Mean Streets'' _ it's too late. The supposedly explosive ending
just hangs there without much effect.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, ``Summer of Sam'' is a badly flawed film full of
good intentions. By the time we get to what must be called the
movie's Mr. Ed Moment _ Berkowitz taking orders from a slobbering,
English-speaking black pooch _ Lee has lost his way and his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Film buff note: As he did in ``Do the Right Thing,'' John Savage
has an ultrabrief cameo, as a guy rooting for the wrong sports team
in the wrong neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Leguizamo, Mira Sorvino and Adrien Brody. Directed
by Spike Lee. Rated R for sex, violence, language and nudity. At
metro theaters. 2 hours, 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This ``Summer'' is definitely long, but it's not so
hot.

   KOSOVO-SERBIA (Kosovo Polje, Yugoslavia) _ The destruction

   CANADA-IDENTITY (Halifax, Nova Scotia) _ Certain countries find
celebrating their own birthdays a bit awkward. Canada is one.
Canadians shoot off fireworks, and they hold parades, though they
never get as boisterous as their noisy neighbors to the south. That
may be because national birthdays like the one they mark Friday

   COMPUTER-EXPORTS (Washington) _ President Clinton ordered a
sweeping easing of export restrictions on computers and computer
chips, including to China, after determining that machines that

David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SUV (New York) _ Despite congested streets, narrow roadways,
aging bridges and tunnels and polluted air that, in some respects,
make the New York area uniquely inhospitable to light trucks, the
region has become one of the nation's hottest markets for sport
utility vehicles. Now, state regulators are on the verge of
proposing new registration rules that could further increase the
number of heavy vehicles on area roadways. By Keith Bradsher.

   There is an audience, almost a congregation, for whom the work
of Patricia Hampl is received with something close to devotion. It
is not the largest audience in publishing, but you wouldn't call it
a cult of any sort. Cults gather round shamans and sorcerers,
conjurers of sundry mysticisms. But mysticism _ need it be said? _
is not mystery, any more than mere reminiscence can claim to be a
memoir. The personal mysteries on which the memoir draws are
Hampl's abiding subject, and, as she writes in ``I Could Tell You
Stories,'' they lay upon us an impossible command. They impel us to
find in our experience a meaning whose truth is provisional at
most, never final and often in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Hampl tilled this rich soil in two earlier volumes, ``A Romantic
Education'' and ``Virgin Time,'' seeking the self-knowledge that
Augustine sought in his ``Confessions'' and Montaigne in his
``Essays.'' If this seems an exaggeration, consider the familiarity
of Augustine's aim. In the midlife crisis that produced his
``Confessions,'' Augustine wrote not so others would understand; he
wrote so he himself would understand: ``I come to meet myself,'' he
tells us, and who among us hasn't, at one point or another, set out
on the same journey?
</P>
<P>
   Journey from the outside in
</P>
<P>
   And for us, that journey opens to view the interior of a life we
had seen only from the outside, like a house that seemed tidy
enough but whose shades were half drawn. But we see, of course,
only what the inhabitant chooses to reveal, and that is the point
of her title. It traces back to a memory of riding a Greyhound bus
when she was in college. In the ``still-dark morning of a small
Missouri river town where the driver had made a scheduled stop at a
grimy diner,'' Hampl sees a handsome young man and a ``stout,
middle-aged woman in a flowered housedress'' kissing passionately
on the boarding platform. It seemed a ``conjunction of beauty and
improbability.'' They couldn't be lovers _ or could they? Moments
later the woman boards and, sure enough, plumps herself into the
seat beside Hampl. She leans out the window to blow a final kiss,
puts ``her arms snugly around her bag,'' gazes off and says, as if
to herself, ``Oh, I could tell you stories.''
</P>
<P>
   But what were those stories, and why has the memory stayed?
</P>
<P>
   As a literary form, the memoir has filled a vacuum created by
the inconsequentiality of so much of our fiction. But memoirs fall
into gradations like novels and other art forms, and we betray
something of ourselves by the choices we make. Where writer after
writer today lines up outside the public confessional, impatient to
unfurl the soiled linen of a private life, Hampl sits quietly in a
pew off to the side. Her voice is at once reflective and
conversational, and funny in ways that take you by surprise.
Describing her introduction to the birth control pill (``the
lozenge of personal revolution''), she writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I held the plastic circle in my hand. Enlightenment welled up
in me, the hilarity of revelation: It's so simple. The little pill
_ I marveled at its tininess, I bowed to medical science _ popped,
eagerly it seemed, out of its Day 1 slot. Imitating this
exuberance, I popped Day 1 lightly into my mouth, took a swallow of
water and let technology have its way with me. Today is the first
day of the rest of your life, right?''
</P>
<P>
   An intimacy in the first person
</P>
<P>
   As those words should suggest, enthusiasms of the moment are not
always what they seem. Hampl grew up Catholic in the Midwest,
coming of age in the '60s, and religion and politics are the
coordinates that have mapped her experience. The passage about the
birth control pill, for example, comes by way of introducing us to
her reading of Walt Whitman, one of her heroes. The transition is
not an obvious one, and I cannot say with assurance what the link
is (something about ``the idea of America''). But _ and this is the
important thing _ you have the double sense of Hampl's speaking to
you alone while writing (mostly) of herself.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary memoir, Hampl writes, ``has reaffirmed the
primacy of the first-person voice in American imaginative writing
established by Whitman's `Song of Myself.' Maybe a reader's love of
memoir is less an intrusive lust for confession than a hankering
for the intimacy of this first-person voice, the deeply satisfying
sense of being spoken to privately.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken to privately: That is precisely Hampl's effect. Not
everyone uses the first person winningly, but (and contrary to
everything you were ever told in school) it connects writer with
reader. The two are bound by a certain charm, a word unfairly
suspect but one whose real meaning Hampl understands. ``Whitman
charmed me,'' Hampl writes. ``To speak, to write, without charm is
to make utterances without references to a reality outside
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hampl's is the companionable charm that makes a bridge
between one self and another. If you had to list the details of her
life _ the isolated, chronological line items of a resume _ you'd
come up with surprisingly few. And yet you feel like you know her.
She has sorted through the ``broken, obscured images'' of that life
and given shape to what had been mystery. And then you realize how
familiar that mystery is. Much of it has been at the heart of your
life as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The potential for severe weather will rise Friday across parts
of high Plains as a volatile mix of ingredients come together
across the western Dakotas and northern Nebraska. With an
unseasonably strong jet stream flowing over the northwest quadrant
of the nation, a developing low pressure system will draw added
strength as it emerges from Wyoming Friday afternoon. In turn, very
warm and humid air will surge northward over the Plains, setting
the stage for clusters of potent thunderstorms to erupt across the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The sole check-and-balance on the system will be a layer of warm
air aloft that could act as a lid to suppress widespread
development. Nonetheless, large hail, damaging winds and heavy rain
are possible in spots. A few of the thunderstorms may develop into
`supercells,' giant, rotating storms with the capability of
spawning tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   These clusters of storms may consolidate into a large complex of
damaging storms as they move eastward, raising the risk of severe
weather and heavy rain across parts of the upper Mississippi Valley
Friday evening and night.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated but potentially strong thunderstorms will develop in
the Northeast as a weak disturbance pushes eastward. In its wake,
the stage will be set for a heat wave with high humidity to
commence over the weekend into early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, steamy, sultry weather will continue to stifle much
of the Southeast, with isolated by heavy thunderstorms offering
spotty, temporary relief but also raising the risk of flooding
rains.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wet Streak
</P>
<P>
   Three hundredths of an inch of rain fell at Atlanta on
Wednesday, marking the city's eighth consecutive day with
measurable rain. This string matches the record for the city's
longest rainy streak in June. Previously, matching June wet streaks
occurred in 1884, 1886, 1900 and 1927. The longest streak of
consecutive days with measurable rain in Atlanta, independent of
month, is 14, occurring twice in the month of July in 1916 and
1994. Late this June, the unwavering Bermuda high continually
pumped moist air into the Southeast from the Gulf of Mexico,
providing ample fuel for frequent rain.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AFTER LIFE,' starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika Oda.
Written, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated, 118
minutes). Much of this transcendently compassionate, gently
humorous Japanese film is set in a drab office building where
courteous caseworkers welcome the week's new clients. The place
turns out not to be a social service agency but a metaphysical way
station where the newcomers are people of all ages and types who
have just died and have three days to select one memory to take
with them into eternity. Before they depart, those memories will be
filmed. As they tell their stories and make their choices (those
who can't choose remain at the processing center as caseworkers),
the movie becomes a profound meditation on life's meaning and value
and the relationship of movies, memories and dreams (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME,' starring Mike Myers,
Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13,
95 minutes). There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of
the words ``Oh, behave!,'' but it isn't here yet. Although the
sequel with the fab title is several love beads short of its
predecessor and more than a few scenes play like outtakes, this is
still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy. Myers' neo-Sellers
multiple-personality act is fine even when the material is less so,
and this sequel makes the most of Dr. Evil, his most inspired
creation. A scatological Scotsman, the film's walking id and
bathroom joke, is more of an acquired taste. Costumes and pop
references are still a hoot, as is the adorably benighted Austin.
Ms. Graham makes terrific eye candy, but doesn't share Ms. Hurley's
quick-witted air of being in on the joke (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BIG DADDY,' starring Adam Sandler, Cole and Dylan Sprouse, Joey
Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart and Leslie Mann. Directed by Dennis Dugan
(PG-13, 95 minutes). It's awfully early in the career of Adam
Sandler to find him sharing the screen with a scene-stealing
6-year-old (actually the Sprouse twins). Besides, the cute kid in
Sandler's movies is usually the star himself. But he's in a
position to do whatever he likes, even if it's a flimsy sentimental
comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have
been hoped for. Having greatly expanded his following with the
romantic comedy and 80s kitsch of ``The Wedding Singer,'' not to
mention the inspired rustic lunacy of ``The Waterboy,'' he falls
back on much less inventive material this time. And the barrage of
brand-name junk food is enough to make skin break out in the
audience (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,' starring John Travolta, Madeleine
Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton and James Woods. Directed by
Simon West (R, 118 minutes). Murder on a military base was once
enough of a pretext for a detective thriller, but nowadays it takes
more. The prevailing sleaze quotient calls for kinks, and this
galling adaptation of a Nelson DeMille best seller is happy to
oblige. So the title character, a pretty young officer whom the
film thinks has no place in the military, is the victim of a lurid
crime. Travolta and Ms. Stowe affably investigate whodunit, though
the unraveling of the crime is laughably arbitrary. The real point
of their ponderous investigation is that the victim asked for what
she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AN IDEAL HUSBAND,' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam. Written and
directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best thing about
Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego Lord Arthur
Goring. In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually
wise, witty and caring) rake, Everett makes him all the more
charming. Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician
and his priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting
the right notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they're almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `LIMBO,' starring Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and David
Strathairn. Written, directed and edited by John Sayles (R, 126
minutes). Part survivalist drama, part satirical portrait of
contemporary Alaska, Sayles' powerful new film is almost as vast as
the great outdoors it contemplates. Ms. Mastrantonio, as a
well-traveled folk-rock singer working Alaskan lounges, and
Strathairn, as the brooding local fisherman with whom she becomes
involved, make one of the most compelling adult couples to be seen
in an American film in quite some time. When they find themselves
castaways along with her teen-age daughter on a remote Alaskan
island, the movie becomes both a suspense thriller and a sorrowful
meditation on survivalism, civilization and the ties that bind.
Though marred by an abrupt ending and glaring literary devices,
``Limbo'' is eminently worthwhile (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX,' starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the
film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with
a big debt to ``The X-Files.'' But the storytelling is intricately
bizarre and the special effects are indeed special, notably when it
comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And
Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while behaving
like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an
inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a
couch-potato epiphany; while the characters seem to be performing
marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of
virtual reality (Maslin).

 UNDATED: virtual reality (Maslin).

   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   `THE MUMMY,' starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold
Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134
minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent
spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror
classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an
unwieldy hybrid of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Abbott and
Costello Meet the Mummy'' via ``Night of the Living Dead.'' The
intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that
carries a fearful curse are Fraser (playing a swashbuckling
American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed
English librarian) and Hannah (as her twitty older brother). It's
all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming
scarabs that burrow under the skin and do awful ``Alien''-like
things (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `NOTTING HILL,' starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Directed
by Roger Michell (PG-13, 105 minutes). The most romantic notion
here may be that a Hollywood star as famous as Ms. Roberts might be
out, unassisted, browsing for a book. But it's enough to bring her
together with Grant's bashful bookseller and let two
extraordinarily charming actors play out an intelligent flirtation.
As written by Richard Curtis with frequent wit and welcome echoes
of his ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' this is a bright, winsome
romantic comedy that's as teasing as the characters themselves,
inviting the audience to ponder the movie star's burdens of being
world famous and desperately attractive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE RED VIOLIN,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to Communist
China, the instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly
photographed historical tableaux. If the movie's narrative energy
is undermined by a plodding screenplay and wooden acting, the
music, composed by John Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and
the London Philharmonia Orchestra, is sublime (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TARZAN,' with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Rosie
O'Donnell and Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris
Buck (G, 88 minutes). No need to wonder how this animated Tarzan
movie could improve on the 47 others that preceded it. Disney
animation turns the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk, lets the
apes talk to him, and whooshes through lush jungle settings with
exultant agility. This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in ways
that are hard to resist, with lively vocal performances, excitingly
kinetic animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in the
background. Parents will stay awake, and children will be charmed
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TEA WITH MUSSOLINI,' &UR;  &LR; starring Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan
Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco
Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Smith)
who give ``Tea With Mussolini'' a patina of class obviously relish
chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted from a
chapter of Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of English
expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War II.
Smith, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of the pack,
nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are shattered when
the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves carted off to a
Tuscan hill town, where they are held under house arrest. Cher is
her usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving wealthy
American heiress and art collector who befriends the group
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `WILD WILD WEST,' starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth
Branagh and Salma Hayek. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG, 107
minutes). Another big, lavish movie with no there there. This
post-Civil War James Bondish contraption-happy sci-fi film is hard
to categorize, a quality not to be confused with originality.
Directed by Sonnenfeld without the deadpan-alien sensibility that
worked for ``Men in Black,'' this stylistic grab bag is similarly
kinky but a lot more chaotic, however heroically Smith, as a newly
hunky and debonair action hero, tries to save the day. Good-looking
but dopey, with an emphasis on toylike but vaguely ghoulish special
effects. A movie with that much potential kiddie appeal didn't have
to start in a bordello, either (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WINSLOW BOY,' &UR;  &LR; starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon
and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110
minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial
that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its
essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with
unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works
as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a
cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of
that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully
lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets
the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge
(Maslin).

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yet another name-brand star of the small screen is
taking his bows on a New York stage this summer. He's visiting
through August, or in other words, until he is due back on the set
of his long-running, Emmy-winning police series, Tuesday nights on
ABC. In the interim you can catch him in a little theater off Union
Square, where he is delivering just the sort of sensitive
performance that landed him a juicy part in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking, of course, about Bill Brochtrup.
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say? Name doesn't ring a bell? If there were any
justice, it would. Brochtrup plays the empathic, sad-eyed clerk
John Irvin, who greets the perps and the prosecutors at the squad
room door in ``NYPD Blue.'' (He took a bullet during a courthouse
shootout in the season's two-part finale and earned a promotion to
the opening-credits roster of stars.)
</P>
<P>
   If the television role is not proof enough of this actor's
gentle strength, his knockout work in ``Snakebit,'' David Marshall
Grant's deeply satisfying Off Broadway comedy-drama about days of
waning love and friendship in Los Angeles, should provide the
supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Brochtrup recently stepped into the play at the Century Theater,
replacing Geoffrey Nauffts in the pivotal role of Michael, a gay
Angeleno mourning the breakup with his lover and playing host to
his closest friends, a warring New York couple, an actor and his
wife. It is, simply put, a beautifully calibrated performance that
fits as snugly as cork to wine bottle with those of the superb
Christopher Garten as the actor and the sublime Jodie Markell as
the wife.
</P>
<P>
   The portrayal also taps nicely into an intensifying current in
New York theater: the deployment of actors more familiar from the
pages of TV Guide than Playbill, in productions across the city and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart, moonlighting from ``Ally McBeal,'' caught a
wave of favorable response to her portrayal of a jilted lover
driven to psychotic revenge in Neil LaBute's ``Bash.'' Scott Wolf,
the ``Party of Five'' heartthrob, is using his down time this
summer to draw a young crowd reared on Fox serials to Warren
Leight's Tony-winning ``Side Man.'' Wayne Knight, without his
television uniforms _ he played Newman the mailman on ``Seinfeld''
and is now Don the policeman on ``Third Rock From the Sun'' _ is a
vision in black as a vital part of the latest threesome in ``Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Attaching a television name to a theater venture is often a
marketing ploy. And while there is plenty of wonderful acting
across the cable channels, a veteran New York playgoer remains a
bit of a snob about the tube. You can't help wondering when you see
a famous television name on a Broadway marquee, ``Can that guy
really act?'' (``The Odd Couple,'' for instance, did wonders for
Tony Randall's pocketbook and visibility, but it was an impediment
to his being taken seriously in sophisticated theater circles when
he began reviving the classics for his National Actors Theater.)
</P>
<P>
   For whatever the reason television stars are attracted to the
stage _ to flex old muscles, to retool an image, to rekindle the
flame of professional passion _ they must overcome the vast impact
they have already made. Whether widely recognizable like Ms.
Flockhart or hovering in our peripheral vision like Brochtrup,
their transitions to the stage require them to erase even as they
create.
</P>
<P>
   How successful is this season's class from the coast in making
us forget how well we know them? Pretty darned successful, it
seems.
</P>
<P>
   A few have had a bumpy time. Lisa Gay Hamilton, a stage-trained
actress who now has a major role on ABC's acclaimed legal series
``The Practice,'' was ill served by ``Angelique,'' a muddle of a
play that she left in June. The show closes July 11 at the MCC
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   And others seem in a bit over their heads. The winsome Wolf is
not yet playing at the level of the rest of the exemplary ``Side
Man'' actors. But to be fair, they have been at it a lot longer
than he.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part the casting of the familiar faces has proved
felicitous; in some cases, surprisingly so. Here, in alphabetical
order, are five of the cannier recent placements onstage of figures
from our evenings in front of the set.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brochtrup
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Brochtrup to play Michael, a decent but forlorn
gay man who faces a series of personal crises in ``Snakebit,'' was
inspired. That is in part because the role is really not that much
of a stretch for the actor, who portrays John, a tenderhearted gay
man facing a personal crisis or two on ``NYPD Blue.'' The major
difference is one of emphasis. John's concerns are background noise
on the television show; onstage Michael's are front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Brochtrup handles the step up in responsibility with a leading
man's aplomb and a keen ear for the playwright's acidly funny
dialogue. There isn't as much attitude in his performance as there
was in Nauffts'; the character's edges have been softened a bit,
which alters the balance of the relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Michael now seems more of a confidant to the Jenifer of Ms.
Markell, the sole holdover from the original cast. And Brochtrup's
more serene demeanor meshes nicely with the work of Garten, a
revelation as Jonathan, a would-be star of action movies who
browbeats Michael and reduces his anxious wife to tears.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The contributions of all involved in ``Snakebit'' reflect such a
high degree of accomplishment _ Guillermo Diaz, the fourth member
of the ensemble, is another worthy replacement _ that an audience's
past associations with these actors seem to melt away. And
Brochtrup wins our hearts anew because he wears his with such
refinement and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Danza
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a disaster. With a stage crowded with
unforgettable characters _ among them James Hazeldine's thrilling
Harry Hope, Michael Emerson's tragic Willie Oban, Katie Finneran's
wild-eyed Cora and perhaps most affectingly Paul Giamatti's
heart-rending Jimmy Tomorrow _ an audience member might be forgiven
for gazing up at the actor in fighting trim behind the bar and
wondering, ``What's the boxer from `Taxi' doing there?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Danza is an authenticating presence in the huge
``Iceman'' cast; when he speaks, Flatbush Avenue rolls right up to
your seat. Yes, as others have pointed out, he isn't the subtlest
performer. His barkeep, Rocky Pioggi, has perhaps a tad too much of
the gladhanding politician about him. Yet you want to believe that
Rocky has the oily charm to control the prostitutes he swears he
doesn't pimp for, as well as the thuggish toughness to back up the
threats in lines like ``I'd like an excuse to give you a good punch
in the snoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Danza, so accustomed to ensemble work from his years on
television, conveys these attributes with ease. You have to admire
this actor's willingness to extend and challenge himself. After a
long run in sitcoms, he has performed on Broadway in plays by
Arthur Miller, credibly replacing Anthony LaPaglia in ``A View From
the Bridge,'' and now a play by Eugene O'Neill. In what other ways,
one wonders, does Danza plan to push the envelope?
</P>
<P>
   Polly Draper
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Draper's trajectory is the opposite of Danza's. Her training
is stage-based, and it was only after years of theater work that
she was cast as the high-powered, heat-seeking Ellen on
``Thirtysomething,'' the signature yuppie drama series of the late
'80s and early '90s. Now she is back onstage in New York, replacing
Natasha Richardson in ``Closer,'' Patrick Marber's partner-swapping
precis of sexual mores in the bedrooms and chat rooms of
contemporary London.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the casting of an American, Marber tinkered with
his play, modifying the Britishisms and even tweaking the staging
of the final scene. The changes, alas, do not alter the perception
that ``Closer'' has lost some of its seductive vileness in the
metamorphosing journey from the West End to Broadway. Still, Ms.
Draper settles comfortably into Marber's world of sex and
faithlessness, a morally decayed revision of the dating universe
she inhabited in ``Thirtysomething.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anna, the fickle photographer drawn into the competing beds
of a dermatologist played by Ciaran Hinds and the obituary writer
portrayed by Rupert Graves, Ms. Draper looks smashing; you believe
that civilized men might start a fistfight over her. But it is in
her fleeting opportunities at comedy that she shows herself off to
best advantage. For all the play's sexual intrigue, what works best
for Ms. Draper is a funny speech about the secret baggage men bring
to a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flockhart, by the magnitude of her stardom, had more to lose
than most television stars in hazarding a return to the stage. She
had a potent weapon, though; she  &UR; can &LR;  act. This was clear to
anyone who knew her work before she landed on the cover of Time.
Her Natasha in Scott Elliott's ``Three Sisters'' at the Roundabout
in 1997 stamped her as a classical performer to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Now that everyone is watching, what's the result? A hit play. In
LaBute's monologue-driven ``Bash,'' she portrays two women with
opposing perspectives on homicidal violence: one who relishes it,
another who wishes it away. Although the excellent Ron Eldard, as a
bland businessman making a horrific hotel-room confession, is
handed a more rewardingly complex story line, it is Ms. Flockhart's
performances that pack them in nightly.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of disturbance evolves slowly; the triumph of her
turn as the disintegrating interrogation-room subject of ``Medea
Redux,'' the first of the monologues, is in the sense of
misdirection. Ms. Flockhart's dead-eyed recounting of the story of
a life, couched in defensive language, casts her as victim. The
portrayal is so alive that you imagine her in motion constantly,
when in fact she is glued to the interview table.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Knight
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that Knight could work in such delicate brush strokes?
On ``Seinfeld,'' his Newman was a sort of Penguin to Jerry's
Batman, a mischievous comic-strip character with a demonic grin and
a compulsion not to deliver the mail. As Knight reveals so
touchingly in his carefully modulated performance in ``Art,''
Newman is history.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the audience wouldn't like him back; a chord of happy
familiarity was struck during the play when Knight let slip an evil
laugh, Newman style. ( Wolf triggered a similar buzz among younger
playgoers, mostly female, at ``Side Man,'' whenever he smiled
boyishly. ``Soooooo cute,'' cooed a young woman behind me who
seemed to want to take him home.)
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Art'' trio also includes Buck Henry and George Segal
(these days a sitcom star himself, on ``Just Shoot Me''), both of
whom are limber and playfully into the game. But it is Knight who
makes the most intriguing impression here. His Yvan _ the one with
the breakneck-paced monologue about the controversial wedding
invitation _ builds almost imperceptibly in power, up to the moment
Henry's Marc and Segal's Serge turn their anger at each other on
him.
</P>
<P>
   When Knight dissolves suddenly in tears, immobilized by the
feeling that his world is collapsing, it is unthinkable that there
ever was a Newman at all.

ANTICIPATION: THE NEXT MOVIE  
 SUMMER OF '77  
 A MYSTERY DEEPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Forget the summer! The most talked-about film of the
moment is ``American Beauty,'' a drama about a suburban family, set
to open in the autumn. Although only a few people have seen the
movie, the buzz about it has startled even Dreamworks, which made
it and has spent the last few weeks debating the details of how and
when to release it.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' is the film directorial debut of Sam Mendes,
who staged the recent London and Broadway revival of ``Cabaret''
and directed ``The Blue Room'' with Nicole Kidman. Mende, 33, a
British director, has already been offered several projects by
Steven Spielberg, one of Dreamworks' founders, but his next project
is to direct a new Stephen Sondheim musical, ``Wise Guys,'' on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't quite believe this is happening,'' Mendes said,
referring to the interest in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as an
upper-middle-class couple in an anonymous suburb whose marriage _
and lives _ are unraveling. Spacey's character works for a media
magazine from which he is about to be dismissed. His wife, an
ambitious real estate broker, treats him with indifference, if not
contempt, and has her eyes on a successful businessman played by
Peter Gallagher. Their daughter, a high school student, barely
talks to him.
</P>
<P>
   Their neighbors range from a strict Marine colonel with a
near-catatonic wife whose son is a drug dealer to two gay men. In
the film, which includes some very funny moments, the Spacey
character, called Lester, lusts after his daughter's seductive best
friend. He pursues his own personal makeover _ lifting weights,
telling people what he really thinks of them _ and, almost happily,
pays the price for it.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg has told colleagues it's one of the best films he's
seen in years. After Ms. Bening saw the film, the actress was so
overcome that she is reported to have burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   The movie cost a relatively modest $15 million (the stars and
director lowered their fees but will earn a percentage of the
profits). The film will be released in New York, Los Angeles,
Boston, San Francisco and Toronto in late September and then open
on Oct. 1 in 700 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ball, a successful television comedy writer who wrote the
film, said the project began about two years ago when he switched
talent agents in an effort to break into movies. His new film
agent, Andrew Cannava, at the United Talent Agency, suggested he
write a ``spec'' script to show producers and studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted a new career in feature films,'' said Ball, a
producer and writer on the television show ``Cybill'' as well as
story editor of ``Grace Under Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball, who has a new ABC series, ``Oh, Grow Up,'' starting in the
fall, said he gave Cannava several ideas. ``They were pretty
standard romantic comedies, and then I told him a third idea, a
film difficult to define but one that interested me,'' Ball said.
``He said, `Go with the one that you have the most passion
about.'''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he finished writing the script, two producers, Dan
Jinks and Bruce Cohen, who knew Ball, took it to several companies,
and Dreamworks immediately expressed interest. ``It surprised me,''
Ball said. ``It did not seem to be the kind of script Dreamworks
would do. It was a little dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball, who is 41, grew up in Georgia, attended school in Florida,
``waitered tables and hung out on the beach in my 20s,'' then moved
to New York, where he worked as an art director at Adweek magazine.
In 1993 he wrote a play, ``Five Women Wearing the Same Dress,''
which was staged at the Manhattan Class Company in Chelsea and
caught the attention of Tom Werner and Marcy Carsey, the television
producers. They offered him a job as a writer on ``Grace Under
Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball, who is unmarried, said quietly: ``This film has some
deeply personal stuff. Frankly, I never thought it would get
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes said he was offered any number of movies after
``Cabaret.'' ``Because I'm a Brit I kept getting costume dramas and
anything with royalty,'' he said. ``Spielberg saw `Cabaret.' He
asked for a meeting in L.A. He handed me the script of `American
Beauty.' He said: `We just bought this. I can't explain what it is,
but you've got to read it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone who has seen the film or been involved with it,
Mendes said: ``It's a difficult movie to describe. When anyone has
a go at describing it, it sounds like some dreadful sitcom on
speed. It's not at all. It's so filled with loneliness. And beneath
the surface it's very funny. I read it straightaway twice. I
couldn't quite see how it could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the atmosphere after the school shootings in Littleton,
Colo., the film is also remarkably resonant; none of the portraits,
especially the teen-agers, are quite what they seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no judgments about any of these characters. They all
are deeply sympathetic and are never patronized,'' Mendes said.
``And this is hardly a film about suburban America. It could be
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where Were You in '77?
</P>
<P>
   John Leguizamo, one of the stars of Spike Lee's ``Summer of
Sam,'' which opens Friday, was 14 years old in the summer of 1977,
when a psychopath dubbed ``Son of Sam'' by the tabloids went on a
killing spree that terrorized New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 14, living in Jackson Heights (Queens), it was a crazy
summer,'' recalled Leguizamo, a versatile film, television and
theatrical performer who plays a tormented and drug-addled Bronx
hairdresser in the movie. ``I had a three-piece rust suit. I was
trying to get into clubs in Manhattan like Roseland and Casablanca.
It was scary, though. He had shot some women in Queens. He had gone
after women with long dark hair. I still remember. Women were
cutting their hair short and dying it blond.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrien Brody, another star of the film who also grew up in
Queens, plays a spike-haired punk rocker struggling to escape the
confines of the Bronx; he was only 4 that summer and on a trip
across the country with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We escaped the heat,'' he recalled. ``But I remember people
talking about the Son of Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was an outgrowth of conversations between Lee and
Michael Imperioli, an actor who has appeared in several Lee films,
and Victor Colicchio, who has written and performed on the New York
stage for over a decade. All three share the writing credit for the
film. Leguizamo said the film was somewhat autobiographical for
Colicchio; it deals with people in Queens, mostly Italians,
reacting to the suspicion and panic generated by the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike made us do a lot of research,'' Leguizamo said. ``He got
documentaries about that time. We read books. We hung out with cops
who were on the case. Frankly, I was having nightmares while I was
doing this movie. These were such senseless crimes. Nothing to do
with money or revenge. You can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his role, which called for considerable sexual candor, the
actor spent time studying Marlon Brando in the film version of ``A
Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to be as alive and free and instinctive and animal as
he was in that movie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leguizamo, whose character in the film dances at clubs with his
wife, played by Mira Sorvino, also watched videos of John Travolta
in ``Saturday Night Fever.'' He laughed. ``Me and Mira actually
wanted to do better than that,'' he said. ``But I was kicking her a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody, whose character also works as a porno dancer, said that
losing his inhibitions on film was probably the most difficult
element of the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you learn early on is that, as an actor, you
have to overcome being self-conscious,'' he said. ``That ruins your
performance. When you're self-conscious, you're not free to have a
natural moment. And that's devastating for an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody, 26, was set to be one of the stars of ``The Thin Red
Line,'' Terrence Malick's World War II drama. But his role was
virtually edited out, which devastated him. ``It was a huge blow,''
he said. ``But maybe it's for the best. Maybe it all would have
been too quick for me. You have to suffer setbacks early on to keep
you humble. I'm humble now.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for `Eyes'
</P>
<P>
   The mystery that surrounds Stanley Kubrick's last film, ``Eyes
Wide Shut,'' deepens. Although the film opens on July 16,
practically no one has seen it, except for some top executives at
Warner Brothers, which produced it, some Kubrick associates and a
few editors and writers at Time magazine. The magazine put the
movie's stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, on its cover this week
and made some rapturous comments about the film.
</P>
<P>
   But studios that believe in a movie generally show it early and
often to promote interest. When studios are nervous, they delay
early screenings as long as they can. And Warner Brothers is
showing the film to the press only two days before it opens.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, publicity people connected with the film said the
American version was still being edited to be less sexually
explicit than the European version. But the film has actually been
completed _ or nearly completed _ for months.
</P>
<P>
   Could ``Eyes Wide Shut'' be a disappointment, despite all the
hoopla?

BUSH VOWS TO PROMOTE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, making some of
his most specific promises so far in his Republican presidential
bid, told Silicon Valley's high-technology leaders Thursday that he
would protect and promote their industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wealth is created by Americans, by creativity and enterprise
and risk-taking. These are the hallmarks of Silicon Valley, where
the great engine of wealth has become the human mind,'' Bush told
about 400 high-tech executives at a Palo Alto breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of government is to create an environment in which
entrepreneurship can flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will fight to reduce lawsuits against high-tech
companies, expand trade and raise caps on the numbers of highly
skilled workers allowed to immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took aim at Vice President Al Gore _ the Democratic
front-runner who has promoted the use of high technology to improve
lives _ by portraying the current Democratic administration as a
roadblock to technology expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's promise of a positive business environment
appealed to many of the high-technology executives almost as much
as the specifics Bush proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at issues like the Internet, we should be very
apprehensive about doing things that constrain us,'' said Robert
Herbold, chief operating officer of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lane, president of Oracle Corp., said Gore ``has certainly
been friendly to the Internet.'' But Lane said the Clinton
administration in general has not promoted the high-tech industry
aggressively enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said Bush's high-tech support is based in disappointment in
the Clinton administration. He said Bush is not well known in
Silicon Valley, ``but now there is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he comes from the Republican side of the aisle and
being pro-business, we will see him taking stands important to us,
such as immigration caps and foreign tax credits,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Kvamme, a high-technology venture investor who supported
Sen. Bob Dole in the 1996 elections, said most people in Silicon
Valley, a high-tech corridor that stretches from San Francisco's
southern suburbs to San Jose, shun politics.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Bush has drawn out guests to fund-raisers who have
never been involved in politics before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valley is about 15 percent Democrat and 10 percent
Republican and 75 percent who wish it would go away, more
Libertarian,'' Kvamme said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of those folks are recognizing that government is
involved with us. There are 67 some bills before the House and
Senate right now regulating the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kvamme said high-technology businessmen are busy enough
developing their industry and do not want to waste time explaining
every issue to a less-than-enthusiastic presidential
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Colella, another venture capitalist, added in regard to
Bush: ``This guy relates to the new economy better than Gore
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Halla, chief executive officer of National Semiconductor,
said many high-technology executives already have gotten to know
Bush through their dealings with the Texas Legislature. Halla said
Bush regularly met with executives and was willing to listen to
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for some of us who already have campuses in
Texas,'' Halla said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got one of his best responses in Palo Alto when he poked
fun at Gore for saying he invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Clinton administration) no more invented prosperity
than they invented the Internet,'' Bush said to a round of
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush fund-raising events in Palo Alto and San Jose were
expected to add more than $800,000 to the $36.2 million that Bush
announced Wednesday he has raised since he launched his campaign
March 7.
</P>
<P>
   That unprecedented monetary haul apparently has affected Bush's
thinking. Bush told his Palo Alto audience that this was not his
first trip to Silicon Valley, but ``it's my first visit as
president of the United States _ soon to be president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Buttons were handed out in Palo Alto that said ``W2K,'' a play
on Bush's middle initial and the computer glitch that may not allow
some software to correctly understand dates after the Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the crowd that as president he would fight for
``meaningful tort reform'' to slow down lawsuits against
high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that recently Texas became one of the first states
to enact a law restricting lawsuits based on the so-called Y2K
problem, which Bush described as ``the biggest potential ambulance
chase in a millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave faint praise to President Clinton for saying he will
sign federal Y2K legislation that has been opposed by trial lawyers
who are major Democratic political donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this administration, wisdom comes so rarely that we
should not complain even when it comes too late,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's high-technology initiatives also included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Making the Internet duty and tariff-free worldwide and promote
international standards of electronic commerce. Additionally, he
wants to step up efforts to stop piracy of American intellectual
property such as software.
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop an export control system to protect military secrets
while promoting the export of computers and software, including
encryption software. There have been questions about whether the
Clinton administration's policies have allowed missile guidance
technology to be transferred to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be smart enough and flexible enough to distinguish
between technologies that guide enemy missiles and the technology
that animates childrens' games,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration Thursday said it would ease
restrictions on the types of technology U.S. companies can export
to nations like India, China and Russia. Unless Congress takes
action to block the changes sought by manufacturers, most will take
effect in about six months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raise the cap on immigration of high-skilled workers under
H-1B visas. Bush's campaign said the current cap of 115,000 such
visas a year is creating a shortage of highly skilled workers from
other countries. However, Bush did not say how high he would raise
the cap.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improve education in the United States. Bush said the need for
skilled foreign labor could be lessened by improving the education
of all children in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make federal tax credits for research and development
permanent. Bush said temporary tax credits disrupt corporate
planning.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush's speech, John Chambers, chief executive officer of
Cisco Systems, said Bush is transcending partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's Republican or Democrat. It's a leadership
sale,'' Chambers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pretending to have a good time can be awfully taxing.
And no place does the task appear more onerous these days than on
the stage of the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, where the
gamely energetic actors of ``The Taming of The Shrew'' are huffing
and puffing and all but pulling hamstring muscles in a strained and
groping struggle for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   They writhe and they whoop it up, trade punches, prance, dance,
screech, shriek, croon and caterwaul. Wouldn't you know it, they
even do cartwheels. Petruchio, who also gets a swift kick in the
groin once or twice, arrives for his wedding on a giant hobby
horse, dressed in spandex tights and toting a championship
wrestling belt. This proves entirely apropos. Although the
direction is credited to Mel Shapiro, this ``Shrew'' might indeed
have been put on the card by Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous physicality is thoroughly compatible with the play; one
need only recall the voracious film version with Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor for a demonstration of how feverishly Petruchio
and Kate can be made to gnaw and paw at each other. But the New
York Shakespeare Festival's new ``Shrew,'' which opened Thursday
night, the first of its two summer offerings in the park,
completely loses touch with the weirdly wonderful love story in the
obscuring tendencies of Shapiro's compulsive use of sight gags and
prankish improvisations. No dust settles on the production, it's
true. No meaning adheres to it, either.
</P>
<P>
   The actors become so caught up in their attention-craving
``moments'' that their characters wallow in shtick. Certainly,
``Shrew'' can be played for broad farce, yet when the farcical
elements are used as mere excuses for clownish snippets of
overacting, the play dissolves in a pool of cheap tricks, ruses the
director employs again and again. Why allow that crafty stage
veteran, Tom Mardirosian, playing Baptista, to perform a
ludicrously intricate jig not once but twice on the news of his
daughter's nuptials? Why encourage the priceless comedian Mario
Cantone, as Petruchio's servant, to deliver, in a voice that sounds
like monkeys being strangled, a shrill parody of his
last-angry-gay-man standup persona? And why, oh why, squander the
formidable skills of Allison Janney, whose Kate fulfills no
requirement of the story other than girl-beats-boy?
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who staged the hugely successful musical version of
``The Two Gentlemen of Verona'' in the park for Joseph Papp in the
early 1970s, clearly relishes the opportunity to reinvent in the
open air. His ``Shrew'' is a jazzed-up adaptation of Shakespeare's
bruising battle of the sexes that takes to heart the allusions to
the ``mad marriage'' at the play's core. All is indeed madness in
Shapiro's madcap Padua, camouflaged warmly by the designer Karl
Eigsti as the sloped patio of a grand palazzo, paved in Italian
tile and ornamented by a cupola.
</P>
<P>
   The noisy goings-on belie the courtyard's muted surface. Among
Shapiro's amplifications is a quartet of monks who sing lustily in
Italian. Electronic zippers flash an insipid English translation of
the lyrics, which include references to Viagra. The music, composed
by Mark Bennett, is supposed to get the audience in a carnival
mood, but what these religious characters _ who sound excellent, by
the way _ are doing in the play is never explained. They are
expediently dropped in, as if we were indiscriminate diners who
would feast on anything placed in front of us.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro finds more resonance in his retooling of the Christopher
Sly subplot, and that is thanks largely to Max Wright's canny
portrayal. The framing tale of Sly, the drunken tinker for whom the
players perform the story of the taming of the shrew, is often
excised by directors eager to cut to the sexually charged chase.
But here the director goes the opposite route, enlarging
Christopher Sly's role by borrowing from a contemporaneous play,
called ``The Taming of a Shrew,'' that completes the subplot in a
way Shakespeare's version does not.
</P>
<P>
   Wright seems to be developing a side business in lesser
Shakespearean clowns. His Andrew Aguecheek was a standout in
Nicholas Hytner's ``Twelfth Night'' for Lincoln Center Theater last
summer. His groaning Sly is not as crisply comic, but it's a more
physically deft performance. Padded and stuffed into oversize
trousers _ one of the seeming hundreds of garish costumes from the
sketch pads of Marina Draghici _ he looks like Humpty Dumpty in a
bad toupee. (Somehow, in the execution of an elegant collapse to
the floor, he compels the wig to flip cooperatively onto his face.)
</P>
<P>
   Although many of his colleagues are well spoken, few pull off
anything as accomplished. In Ms. Draghici's prom-gown vision, Erika
Alexander's Bianca looks fetching even if the portrayal is on the
neutral side. Peter Jacobson's dandy of a Tranio, a one-man fashion
show, seems prominent by default, and MacIntyre Dixon's old suitor
Gremio at least exudes the smoothness of accumulated stage wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't that much to say about the lackluster matchup of Ms.
Janney's Kate and Jay O. Sanders' Petruchio. They don't have much
chemistry, which is pretty fatal to ``Shrew.'' Sanders, a big lug,
offers a diligent, technically proficient performance; he hits his
marks without ever making much of one. His scenes with Ms. Janney
are no more or less passionate than those with, say, Cantone. He's
five parts bluster for every one of romance, and so he never really
manages to arouse our empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone acquainted with Ms. Janney's work, in plays like ``A View
From the Bridge'' and movies like ``Big Night,'' knows of her
acting range. What's advertised less is her gift for physical
comedy; her amazing pratfall on the stairs of an inner-city school
was one of the scene-stealing moments in Mike Nichols' ``Primary
Colors.'' In ``Shrew,'' her agility is on display in the stampede
of Kate's anger, but all Shapiro knows to do with it is to unleash
it over and over. In the humiliating scene late in the play in
which Petruchio starves her and then demands she thank him, Ms.
Janney drops to the ground for yet another protracted tantrum. It's
a tiresome, and tiring, episode.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It may be that in egging on such histrionics, Shapiro intends to
distract us from the uglier and more controversial aspects of the
play, that is, the brutality of Petruchio's taming of Kate, and the
famous concluding speech in which Kate advocates wifely submission
to one's husband, ``such duty as the subject owes the prince.'' Ms.
Janney's delivery suggests a woman blissfully in love, whose
declarations surprise even her blushing Petruchio.
</P>
<P>
   The unironic treatment makes about as much sense as anything
else in this over-the-top ``Shrew,'' which runs nearly three hours
and, along the way, turns every character, highborn and low, into a
rude mechanical. The production is no heavy lift for an audience,
but it's no picnic, either. Or rather, it's the kind of picnic
where the host tells bad jokes and a boom box drowns out the
conversation.

CLINTON, MUBARAK SAY `TIME IS RIPE' FOR PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said Thursday they see new opportunities for peace in the
Middle East as Israel establishes a government more open to
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Mubarak called on Israel's new Prime Minister, Ehud Barak,
to stop expansion of Jewish settlements and halt the retaliatory
bombings against Lebanon as a way to improve a soured atmosphere in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during a joint news conference with Mubarak, declared
the ``time is ripe'' for peace and hinted the United States will
offer new ideas for reviving stalled negotiations. Clinton said he
hopes to meet with Barak soon, perhaps in days, as the Israeli
prime minister completes the formation of his coalition government
and assumes power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, we now have a real chance to move the peace
process forward in the Middle East,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak bemoaned the time wasted during the stalemate but added,
``Today, there is an opportunity which should not be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak said he also intends to meet soon with Barak,
Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad
in hopes of ``creating the necessary atmosphere for resuming the
peace process without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's landslide victory in May was widely viewed as an
endorsement for a resumption of peace negotiations throughout the
region. Barak has expressed a willingness not only to resume
negotiations with the Palestinians but to return the Golan Heights
to the Syrians as part of a peace pact and to withdraw Israeli
troops from South Lebanon, where they patrol a security zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way for the Israelis to have lasting security is a
negotiated peace based on mutual respect. That is also the best way
for Palestinians to shape their own future on their own land,''
Clinton said. ``A negotiated peace is the best way for all the
people of the region to realize their aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak called for a moratorium on Jewish settlements on
occupied lands until talks resume. He said such an action would be
a step toward improving the atmosphere between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will pave the way for the starting of final status
negotiations,'' Mubarak said, referring to the long-delayed talks
on the most delicate of issues such as the status of Jerusalem and
the status of a Palestinian state. Clinton also said the United
States opposes ``provocative settlement actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Various phases of the talks have been off track since Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli extremist in
November 1995 following his approval of peace terms with the
Palestinians that returned some occupied lands. A series of suicide
bombings staged by Arab extremists helped usher in a more cautious
and conservative Israeli government, and negotiations lagged.
</P>
<P>
   After marathon negotiations at the Wye River meetings last year
in Maryland, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat
agreed to a series of land-for-peace provisions but Netanyahu
suspended the pact within weeks because of internal opposition from
his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall work closely with the United States and coordinate
our joint efforts in order to have the parties break the stalemate
and restore movement towards peace,'' Mubarak said. Egypt was the
first Arab nation to sign a peace accord with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak called on Israel to open negotiations with Syria while
it is still negotiating with the Palestinians. ``Progress on each
track facilitates movement on the other. The goal is to achieve
just, comprehensive and stable peace in the whole area,'' Mubarak
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Egyptians ``were alarmed'' by Israel's recent
bombing of civilian targets in Lebanon. The Israeli strikes were in
retaliation for attacks by Hezbollah agents in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak said Israel's actions ``only poison the atmosphere'' in
the region and he called on the nation ``to apply maximum
self-restraint in the crucial months ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   An Egyptian reporter congratulated Clinton on the president's
successful efforts in Kosovo to stop the ouster of ethnic Albanians
and to return the refugees to their homes. Perhaps, the reporter
asked, Clinton would do the same for the Palestinians who once
lived in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really good,'' Clinton said, acknowledging the
difficulty of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just look at it as a practical matter, the agreement
that is made in the end, whether refugees go home depends in part
on how long they've been away and whether they wish to go home,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like it if the Palestinian people felt free and were
free to live wherever they liked, wherever they want to live,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration pressured Arafat in May to avoid the
unilateral declaration of an independent Palestinian state on lands
formally occupied by Israel, but White House officials also have
made clear there is no opposition to a Palestinian state if it is a
negotiated issue with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also urged financial support for nations such as Jordan
which have absorbed large numbers of Palestinians over the decades.
The majority of Jordan's population is now Palestinian and the
oil-poor nation faces severe economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak praised Clinton for his efforts to secure a Middle East
peace accord. ``Under his leadership, the American contribution to
the cause of peace has reached a new high,'' Mubarak said.

 &HT;    CONGRESS APPROVES FINAL Y2K COMPROMISE
 &HT;    712. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress unfurled a legal umbrella Thursday over
the nation's high-tech companies to protect them from a potential
shower of lawsuits if they make a good-faith effort to solve the
Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and the House approved the limited shield
legislation by lop-sided margins after President Clinton agreed to
sign a revised version that offers more protection to consumers who
fall victim to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this bill is critical to meet a national priority,
and the president is prepared to sign it into law because it is
narrowly tailored to deal with litigation dealing with the Y2K
problem,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   If not properly updated, some older computer systems could break
down in six months' time because they use only the last two digits
of the year to set dates. Some could read dates starting next
January as 1900, or perhaps shut down altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows at this time whether the Y2K issue is the most
exaggerated or the most understated problem of our time,'' Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, said on the floor of the House shortly before the
House cleared the bill on a 404-24 vote. Some three hours later,
the Senate approved the bill, 81-18, and sent it to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fair bill that reflects a bipartisan compromise,''
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the Senate floor manager. ``It is a
victory for our nation and for our economy as we enter the new
millennium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But one opponent, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, ``This bill
tells industry, 'don't worry, be happy.' It raises serious
constitutional questions and caters to the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., ``The consumers are getting
the shaft. ... This is a shabby performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Moran, D-Va., noted that U.S. corporations will spend
upwards of $50 billion to reprogram computers to meet the Y2K
challenge. However, they might still be held liable for causing
economic damage, incurring legal burdens that Moran estimated
``could be in excess of $1 trillion.''
</P>
<P>
   Within some well-defined curbs and limits, involving 20 major
changes inserted at the last minute at the insistence of the White
House, the legislation is designed to deter a litigation bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal, said its House floor manager, Rep. Bob Goodlatte,
R-Va., is to have ``good working systems on January 1 of next year,
not a good lawsuit on January 1 of next year, and that's what this
legislation accomplishes.''
</P>
<P>
   In offering them a ``safe harbor'' from a variety of Year 2000
litigation claims, the bill won ardent backing from such trade
groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as from most
sectors of the high-tech industry. Some consumer groups, however,
objected.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sherman Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform
</P>
<P>
   Association, ``the White House and Congress should be commended
for putting aside their differences to reach an agreement on a
problem that could have been a disaster for America's courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bipartisan compromise enacted by Congress:
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies will get a 90-day grace period to fix a Year
2000-related failures. That consists of a 30-day notification
period and another 60 days ``to complete the proposed remedial
action or alternative dispute resolution'' before they can be sued.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most class-action suits would be heard in federal courts to
prevent plaintiffs from seeking out a friendly state venue to hear
the complaint. The class-action suits could still be heard in state
courts, however, if the plaintiffs do not seek punitive damages, if
they limit their claims to $10 million and if there are fewer than
100 members in the class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Punitive awards for Y2K damages would generally be capped at
$250,000 for defendants with a net worth of below $500,000 and
firms that employ 50 or fewer workers. But the cap would be waived
if ``the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence
that the defendant acted with specific intent'' to cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homeowners are ensured that nobody will lose a house by
missing a mortgage payment as a result of a Y2K glitch.

<HEADLINE>
JUDGE MAY ALLOW TAPED CONVERSATIONS IN CISNEROS TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge hinted strongly Thursday that he
would allow taped telephone conversations to be used as evidence
against former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros when the
government's conspiracy case goes to trial after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Angered at the pace of a pre-trial hearing, District Judge
Stanley Sporkin dismissed objections by defense lawyers that the
tapes made by Linda Jones, a woman with whom Cisneros had an
affair, were inadmissible because they are copies and not the
originals.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin said certain statements by Cisneros that were captured
on tape are being sought as evidence by the government to ``support
its case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a right to do that,'' said Sporkin, who accused
defense lawyers of ``complicating a simple case.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are crucial to Independent Counsel David Barrett's
case against Cisneros, 52, who is accused of orchestrating a
conspiracy with aides John Rosales and Sylvia Arce-Garcia to cover
up $250,000 in hush money he paid Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The three have pleaded not guilty. They have not attended the
two-week hearing here, which is expected to continue next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Cisneros sought to hide the financial
arrangement with Jones, also known by her married name, Linda
Medlar, to protect his 1993 nomination to head the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is the second Clinton administration Cabinet member to
face trial on charges of unethical behavior. Former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy was acquitted in December 1998 on charges of
bribery and accepting illegal gratuities.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 50, testified last week that she taped telephone
conversations with Cisneros out of fear that he would cut off the
payments.
</P>
<P>
   When Cisneros ended the payments, Jones went public with her
charges that he broke a verbal pledge to provide her $4,000 per
month. She filed a civil lawsuit claiming a breach of contract and
later settled for $49,000.
</P>
<P>
   She also went on a national television show in a paid interview
and accused Cisneros of lying about the payments to FBI agents
conducting a routine background investigation into his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Jones kept 88 tapes of telephone conversations made over the
course of several years. Prosecutors want to introduce 26 tapes
into evidence at the Sept. 7 trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was housing secretary from 1993 to 1996. He is
currently president of the Spanish-language television network
Univision, based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, the former mayor of San Antonio, was considered a
rising star in the Democratic Party until he publicly announced his
extramarital affair in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is the government's key witness in the Cisneros case. She
is serving a 3-1/2-year federal sentence for bank fraud, money
laundering and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Simon, a lawyer for Cisneros, solicited testimony Thursday
from the government's tape expert, Bruce Koenig of Manassas, Va.,
that the tapes were duplicates, and in some cases, ``copies of
copies of copies.''
</P>
<P>
   Koenig said alterations were difficult to detect on third-and
fourth-generation copies of tapes produced on non-professional
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Simon is urging Sporkin to throw out the 26 tapes the government
wants to use, arguing they were illegally made and then tampered
with by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court cannot conclude with a reasonable probability that
the tapes haven't been tampered with,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Replied Sporkin: ``I can't accept your position here that,
because some tampering has gone on, there cannot be the
introduction of any tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge has signaled to prosecutors and defense lawyers that
portions of the tapes will not be published to protect the privacy
of third parties. Sporkin said conversations where third parties
were discussed were ``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   But he pointedly told the defense that Cisneros' statements
about the payments were relevant and might be allowed into
evidence.

 &HT;    CONGRESS APPROVES FINAL Y2K COMPROMISE
 &HT;    712. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress unfurled a legal umbrella Thursday over
the nation's high-tech companies to protect them from a potential
shower of lawsuits if they make a good-faith effort to solve the
Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and the House approved the limited shield
legislation by lop-sided margins after President Clinton agreed to
sign a revised version that offers more protection to consumers who
fall victim to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this bill is critical to meet a national priority,
and the president is prepared to sign it into law because it is
narrowly tailored to deal with litigation dealing with the Y2K
problem,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   If not properly updated, some older computer systems could break
down in six months' time because they use only the last two digits
of the year to set dates. Some could read dates starting next
January as 1900, or perhaps shut down altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows at this time whether the Y2K issue is the most
exaggerated or the most understated problem of our time,'' Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, said on the floor of the House shortly before the
House cleared the bill on a 404-24 vote. Some three hours later,
the Senate approved the bill, 81-18, and sent it to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fair bill that reflects a bipartisan compromise,''
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the Senate floor manager. ``It is a
victory for our nation and for our economy as we enter the new
millennium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But one opponent, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, ``This bill
tells industry, 'don't worry, be happy.' It raises serious
constitutional questions and caters to the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., ``The consumers are getting
the shaft. ... This is a shabby performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Moran, D-Va., noted that U.S. corporations will spend
upwards of $50 billion to reprogram computers to meet the Y2K
challenge. However, they might still be held liable for causing
economic damage, incurring legal burdens that Moran estimated
``could be in excess of $1 trillion.''
</P>
<P>
   Within some well-defined curbs and limits, involving 20 major
changes inserted at the last minute at the insistence of the White
House, the legislation is designed to deter a litigation bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal, said its House floor manager, Rep. Bob Goodlatte,
R-Va., is to have ``good working systems on January 1 of next year,
not a good lawsuit on January 1 of next year, and that's what this
legislation accomplishes.''
</P>
<P>
   In offering them a ``safe harbor'' from a variety of Year 2000
litigation claims, the bill won ardent backing from such trade
groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as from most
sectors of the high-tech industry. Some consumer groups, however,
objected.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sherman Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform
</P>
<P>
   Association, ``the White House and Congress should be commended
for putting aside their differences to reach an agreement on a
problem that could have been a disaster for America's courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bipartisan compromise enacted by Congress:
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies will get a 90-day grace period to fix a Year
2000-related failures. That consists of a 30-day notification
period and another 60 days ``to complete the proposed remedial
action or alternative dispute resolution'' before they can be sued.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most class-action suits would be heard in federal courts to
prevent plaintiffs from seeking out a friendly state venue to hear
the complaint. The class-action suits could still be heard in state
courts, however, if the plaintiffs do not seek punitive damages, if
they limit their claims to $10 million and if there are fewer than
100 members in the class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Punitive awards for Y2K damages would generally be capped at
$250,000 for defendants with a net worth of below $500,000 and
firms that employ 50 or fewer workers. But the cap would be waived
if ``the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence
that the defendant acted with specific intent'' to cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homeowners are ensured that nobody will lose a house by
missing a mortgage payment as a result of a Y2K glitch.

 &HT;    Preparation key to safe holiday trip
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sunday will be the last Fourth of July this century.
You can bet that not only are the highways going to be
exceptionally crowded and the weather exceptionally hot, tempers
will be rising to triple digits as holiday travelers begin their
return home.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are making an out-of-state car trip or just a short
ride to a nearby lake or mountain retreat, don't spoil your or your
family's holiday by letting the summer heat and the boil of traffic
get the best of you. Try to remember that the real purpose of a
holiday is to give us all a chance to relax.
</P>
<P>
   That especially includes the time you spend behind a steering
wheel. Even if the thermometer is close to 100, the driver's seat
is a place where you not only can but should chill.
</P>
<P>
   While you can't control the behavior of other drivers, you can
do a lot to control behavior in you own vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with children? Smaller children will be entertained
with games or those slick new in-car video systems. Aftermarket
video systems can be found at many discount outlets for about $100.
While that may seem like a lot, it is significantly less than your
insurance deductible if you lose your cool, become distracted and
end up in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Older kids might find that individual CD players with earphones
are the ticket to a peaceful and tranquil trip. Remember, both
video players and personalized CD players are for passengers only.
Driving is an active activity, not a passive one.
</P>
<P>
   As always, spend a few minutes checking your vehicle, before you
leave your house and before you start your return trip. Make sure
your gas tank is full, especially if you are traveling at night,
and be aware that 90-degree temperatures affect your fuel
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Also be sure to check your tires' air pressures. An
underinflated tire on hot pavement is a flat waiting to happen.
Give a quick glance to your coolant level, and check your oil.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, getting the oil changed for the trip wouldn't be a bad
idea. Heat is one of the prime causes of breakdown in lubricants.
As you are under the hood, take a peek at your belts and hoses.
Belt and hose failures are the No. 1 cause of breakdowns on modern
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   You think you've got emergency service covered just because
you've got a cell phone? You'd be surprised how many vacation areas
are out of cell range.
</P>
<P>
   Take a few moments to take care of car business before you hit
the road, and you'll not only have a happier Fourth, but a safer
one.

MILOSEVIC'S BRUTAL TACTICS DESTROYED HIS NATIONALIST VISION

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia _ On the eve of the NATO bombing of
Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic turned to the U.S. envoys facing him.
``You are a superpower,'' he said. ``You can do what you want. If
you want to say Sunday is Wednesday, you can. It is all up to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hill, one of the officials present, was struck by
the words, because they seemed to capture the fatalism of the
Yugoslav president as he led his people to the abyss. ``It was a
form of the old Serbian megalomania,'' Hill, the U.S. ambassador to
Macedonia, observed, ``the one that says, You can destroy us, but
we will be right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Three months and tens of thousands of NATO sorties later, that
destruction is evident in this ragged central Kosovo town where the
bleary Serbian faces speak of a sea change in the Balkan equation:
A decade after Milosevic envisioned it here in a speech that
whipped up Serbian nationalism and helped cement his power, Greater
Serbia is dead.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, a new group of largely ethnically homogeneous
states has emerged, with the help of Milosevic's consistent
brutality from Vukovar in Croatia through the Bosnian capital,
Sarajevo, to Kosovo towns like Djakovica and Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been the midwife of his enemies' ascendancy. Over
the past decade, his tactics of mass killing and eviction of
civilians have helped forge a separate Croatia, a new Bosnian
Muslim identity and now an embryonic Albanian nation state in
Kosovo. Serbia, meanwhile, one of the first Balkan nation states to
emerge in the 19th century, is still casting around for stable
borders, unable to resolve the dilemma of how to unite Serbs in one
country now that the old Yugoslavia is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo and the Balkans
as a whole has prompted concern in the West. A Greater Albania _
embracing Albania, Kosovo and the western part of Macedonia, whose
population is heavily Albanian _ is the avowed goal of some Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent the 1990s worrying about a Greater Serbia,'' Hill
said. ``That's finished. We are going to spend time well into the
next century worrying about a Greater Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Greater Serbia was always a project pursued with
ruthless violence. There is no evidence that Albania has similar
will or might. But the buoyant ascendancy of the Kosovo Liberation
Army is unmistakable, and some of the weapons it wields come from
the military arsenals of Albania that were looted during the
country's descent into economic mayhem in spring 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bosnia, Kosovo has no model of a multiethnic state, and
Pristina has none of the cultural openness that once marked
Sarajevo. The remnants of peaceful coexistence here were snuffed
out in the last two decades: first, the Albanian majority wielded
power, then Milosevic stripped away that broad autonomy, and his
police ruled Kosovo harshly for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   This history will complicate and continually undermine one of
NATO's aims in Kosovo, allowing Serbs and Albanians to live
together in peace.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Albanian question is the Serbian question in a
broken mirror. Like the Serbs, the Albanians are a people scattered
in several countries, harboring a deep sense of historical
injustice, marked by a pattern of disunity, still in search of
stable contours for their nation and stable institutions to govern
it.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Kosovo, the Albanians' red flag with a double-headed
black eagle flutters on smashed factories and city halls, hoisted
there by the young men of the Kosovo Liberation Army in their
camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   After long and harsh Serbian domination, their joy is the joy of
the liberated. From time to time, a NATO patrol passes beneath the
flags.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could scarcely be more fantastically remote from the
nationalist vision offered by Milosevic a decade ago when he came
to Kosovo's Field of Blackbirds _ scene of a Serbian defeat by the
Turks in 1389 _ to proclaim a glorious Serbian future, one in which
the Serbs _ no longer ``humiliated'' _ would do battle for their
``state, national and spiritual integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been lost. Defeat is now real, bitter as ash.
``Milosevic has used us and betrayed us,'' said Radovan Delibasic,
a Serb from Kosovo Polje. ``He came here 10 years ago to inspire us
with our history in Kosovo. But we have learned that you cannot
live from history. Americans have no history, and they live
wonderfully well.''

CONFIDENCE RUNNING HIGH IN BUSH CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Confidence is apparently running high in
George W. Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raising event that drew high-profile Silicon Valley
executives on Thursday, the GOP front-runner got a little ahead of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He told the crowd he had been to California before, but this is
``my first trip as president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor quickly caught himself and corrected, ``the
soon-to-be president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up his first tour of California as a presidential
candidate, Bush courted the titans of Silicon Valley by criticizing
White House policies on high-tech industries and laying out a
series of proposals to bolster America's computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed making the Internet a ``duty- and tariff-free
zone.'' He also called for expanded visas for skilled foreign
workers and legislative curbs on lawsuits stemming from the Y2K
bug.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Y2K computer problems, expected to cause some
computers to fail because they will interpret the year 2000 as
1900, could be ``the biggest potential ambulance chase in the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, I will take the side of innovation
over litigation every single time,'' Bush told a packed crowd of
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused the Clinton administration of being tardy in
getting behind legislation on Y2K litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Thursday, the House voted 404-24 and the Senate
81-18 to approve legislation to shield businesses from a potential
flood of Y2K computer-related lawsuits. The White House said
President Clinton will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had threatened to veto the bill unless it had more
consumer protections, but a compromise was announced earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this administration, wisdom comes so rarely that we
should not complain even if it comes too late,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also pledged that, if elected, he would raise the number of
visas _ called H-1B visas _ allotted each year to highly skilled
foreign workers. Many high-tech companies say such a measure is
needed to combat labor shortages. The cap for 1999 is 115,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs to be able to benefit from the immigration of
skilled workers,'' Bush said. ``The limit on H-1B visas should be
raised, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.''
</P>
<P>
   Another change that Bush said he would pursue in the White
House: easing export controls to allow American companies to sell
encryption technology that is already available from foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current technology export system doesn't work,'' Bush
said. ``We need to be smart enough and flexible enough to
distinguish between technologies that guide missiles and the
technologies that animate children's games.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming to Silicon Valley, Bush is going after an industry
that has been largely supportive, and provided campaign money, to
the Clinton-Gore team. Vice President Al Gore, who could face off
with Bush in the 2000 race, has been to California more than 50
times.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the executives who paid $1,000 each to hear
Bush speak were Republicans, many more have never been involved in
the political process, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Lane, CEO of Oracle, a California-based software
company, said many technology company heads feel disillusioned with
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's much more what the administration has not done,''
said Lane, a Republican. ``I think we're rushing to a new
candidate.''

   DESTRUCTION OF AN EAST-WEST BRIDGE
</P>
<P>
   Pec was once a beautiful town, threaded by bright streams,
backed by mountains. Like Mostar in Bosnia, and all that was most
lovely in the Balkans, it expressed the delicate interweaving of
Islamic and Christian architecture and traditions that was the
legacy of the Ottoman Empire, a power once referred to as
Turkey-in-Europe.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Pec is gone, another Balkan bridge between East and
West devoured in one of those paroxysms of destruction that have
made charred, shattered ruins the most pervasive symbol of
Yugoslavia's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Gjevdt Zajmi and his wife, Ganimete, trudge home, past abandoned
gardens with trees full of unpicked cherries, capsized trellises
with vines still clinging to them, dead animals and the blackened
windows that are the baleful eyes of so much Balkan ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians, the Zajmis were driven out on March 28, four
days after the NATO bombardment began, by three Serbian
paramilitary thugs in black masks. The same old story: from
Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia to Prizren in southwestern Kosovo,
``ethnic cleansing'' has few nuances.
</P>
<P>
   A painful odyssey through a mountain village, Montenegro and
finally Albania ensued, before this return. ``We know everything
has gone from the house, but we hope the house is still there,''
Zajmi says.
</P>
<P>
   As they turn into their street, however, hope evaporates.
Ganimete Zajmi takes in the scene and says simply: ``Vukovar.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Yugoslavia has now been sufficiently drawn-out for
certain acts, like the Serbian obliteration of the mixed Croatian
town of Vukovar in 1991, to pass into popular lore. Mrs. Zajmi is
right: The ruin is as unmitigated as in the town on the Danube.

   The house was built 30 years ago. The couple's three children
were raised in it. The family planted the cherry tree that shades
the area behind what was the kitchen. Shared memories, a life,
really, lie in pieces in the rubble, and the thought of all this
abruptly causes the couple to break down in sobs.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall, the perpetrators have scrawled another conspicuous
emblem of Serbdom, the Orthodox cross with four C's (the Cyrillic
letter S) and standing for ``Samo Sloga Srbina Spasava'' _ ``Only
Unity Saves the Serbs.''

   ``The Serbs were killing before,'' Zajmi, a mild man who worked
in an engineering plant, said. ``But when NATO came, they went
wild, screaming that we all had to leave. Only independence is
possible now. Nothing else.''

   Walking back toward the center of town, they encounter a friend,
Alma Dreshaj. She is one of few ethnic Albanians to have remained
in Pec throughout the NATO bombing, protected, as she explains, by
a kind Serb neighbor, Slavo Dedovic.
</P>
<P>
   Two men pass and overhear her words. They turn on her in rage.
``There are no good Serbs,'' one screams. ``How can you say such a
thing? They send our children to have their throats cut, and you
talk of a good Serb.'' He seems on the verge of striking Ms.
Dreshaj, but is restrained by the other man.

<P>
   SYMBOLISM OVER SUBSTANCE
</P>
<P>
   As the time for negotiation ran out last March and Hill
explained that NATO would begin bombing, Milosevic shot back at
him: ``Anyone who does that _ bomb _ is going to spend the rest of
his life on a psychiatric couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Hill found the words extraordinary, coming, as they
did, from a man who has appeared so consistently destructive.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism was apparently more important than the substance.
Just as the Serbs were ready to go to war in 1914 for the principle
that no Austro-Hungarian police be allowed onto their territory to
investigate the murder in Sarajevo of the Habsburg heir Archduke
Franz Ferdinand, so they would fight _ even suicidally _ to stop a
NATO deployment.
</P>
<P>
   During the bombing, the Serbian leader tried every ploy to stop
the bombardment _ making mischief with the Russians, co-opting the
mild-mannered Albanian intellectual Ibrahim Rugova, destabilizing
Macedonia, dividing the allies by playing on Serbian sympathies in
Greece and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But he also did the one thing _ the brutal eviction and killing
of Albanians _ that kept Western public opinion solidly behind the
78-day bombing and cemented the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real question whether, in the absence of the ethnic
cleansing, NATO would have been able to keep it up after a couple
of weeks,'' a Western official said. ``In a sense, his brutality
saved the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a possibly fatal misjudgment by Milosevic _ leading not
only directly to the Western protectorate that masks and in some
ways promotes the provisional Albanian government by the KLA in
Kosovo today, but also, perhaps, to his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have seen Milosevic recently _ including Hill, Gen.
Wesley Clark and the Swedish financier Peter Castenfelt _ have
found him extraordinarily out of touch, surrounded by mediocre
aides, living in a world of complete unreality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic kept saying to me, we just need seven days to wipe
out the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' said Clark, the commander of NATO
forces in Europe. ``He absolutely failed to see that this kind of
movement does not work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Hill informed the Yugoslav president of Serbian
atrocities he had observed in the Kosovo town of Malisevo,
including paramilitary forces systematically burning Albanian homes
and stores.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic looked very upset. He stood up, put his hands in his
pockets and started pacing. Hill recalls him saying: ``There is no
excuse for that, even if the Serbs in Kosovo are very angry. I
accept responsibility. One of the most important tasks of a
democracy is to protect its minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of discourse has been part of Milosevic's rule for 12
years now. For in the end _ beyond the all-important media control
and the propaganda, beyond the secret police and the loyal
kleptocracy _ his survival can only be explained by his
extraordinary ability to convince many Serbs that they are victims,
that others, not they, are to blame for all that has befallen them.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of Yugoslavia's breakup and Milosevic's legacy
is a hard one: while Slovenia, Croatia and probably now Kosovo have
carved ethnic states out of the ruins, the land of the Serbs
continues to shrink. On Kosovo field today, a patch of land sacred
to the Serbs, a French parachute regiment has deployed, but most
Serbs are too poor, isolated and misinformed even to care.

   ANOTHER MIGRATION
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Serbs now huddle at the church of Pec, the old
Serbian patriarchate with its frescoes that speak of the great
flowering of medieval Serbian civilization in this region.
</P>
<P>
   Their cars are lined up, ready to leave for good if and when
Italian NATO forces in Pec are ready to escort them out. And many
of their minds, it seems, are made up.

   ``We have been here for 700 years, and now NATO bombs and the
Albanians have driven us out,'' said Dragutin Martinovic, the
director of a factory for medicinal alcohol. And what of the
rampage against Albanians' homes? ``All the homes were destroyed by
NATO bombs,'' Martinovic said. ``We did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a terrible sadness in the sight of all these Serbs
slumped over old stones in the grounds of their church, their
bundles beside them, awaiting some new migration in the long
Serbian history of migrations.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   More than 300 years ago, in 1689, Patriarch Arsenije led tens of
thousands of Serbs north and west from Pec to escape the Turks in
an earlier flight that has become part of Serbian myth.
</P>
<P>
   The themes of such myth remain unchanged _ long suffering,
heroic isolation, irrational valor, victories in defeat. Perhaps
the Kosovo debacle will now be added to the panoply of heroism and
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   But unchanged, too, it seems, after 12 years of Milosevic's
rule, is the inability to make these myths coincide with a reality
that is stable rather than one that is merely destructive and
self-destructive because it exists principally to preserve
Milosevic's own power.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Milosevic came to Kosovo exactly a decade ago and spoke to
hundreds of thousands of Serbs gathered in a frenzied celebration
of rediscovered post-Communist identity, his inspiration was a
battle lost by the Serbs to the Ottoman Turks but later turned into
a beacon of Serbian national redemption through defeat. The battle
marked the start of the Serbs' successful struggle to preserve
their Orthodox faith during centuries of Islamic rule by the Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the time, with communism collapsing, it was a clever
speech that Milosevic made to us in 1989,'' said Jovo Popovic, a
former president of the Pec town council also waiting to leave.
``He said we deserved glory because from the Turks to Tito, we had
suffered injustice. As for the speech's effects, however, just look
around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mauro del Vecchio, the Italian general commanding NATO
troops in Pec, believes these ``effects'' can still be reversed.
``We will not take Serbs out,'' he said. ``In fact, we are
escorting them back from Montenegro. We cannot allow one form of
ethnic hatred to replace another now that the Albanians are back.''

   His sentiments are noble enough. But the future of Kosovo seems
to lie more in the determined expression of Ramiz Norici, who has
left his restaurant in the Bronx to fight for the Kosovo Liberation
Army in his native Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the legal army of a soon-to-be-independent Kosovo,'' he
said, squatting by the ruins of his family's home. ``The Serbs have
always killed us. Why should we trust them now?''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In effect, because the West waited for years to decide that
Milosevic was at the heart of the problem in the Balkans, it has
ended up trying to build a Western model in one of the corners of
the Balkans where multiethnicity and tolerance are least
conspicuous and on the back of the victory of what amounts to an
Albanian peasant uprising led by orphaned Marxists and a motley
crew of others.
</P>
<P>
   But these are heady times in the Balkans. They bring Javier
Solana, the secretary general of NATO, to dismal Pristina to be
mobbed in the streets and to say: ``We want to include this area in
the beautiful house of Europe, a place of tolerance, looking to the
past rather than the future.''
</P>
<P>
   His words reflect a unanimous Western decision to invest
massively in the Balkans and to try, after many years, to treat the
problems of Yugoslavia's destruction in an overall rather than a
piecemeal manner and so extend the zone of European stability
southeastward. But can it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to work,'' Hill said. ``Balkan fatigue in Western
nations is at an extreme level. We are all sick of it and we know
this is the last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, both Milosevic and President Franjo Tudjman of
Croatia were made partners in the Dayton accords that ended the war
they had helped to prosecute, despite records of atrocities
committed by both their forces. Now the West has changed tack in a
way that suggests it means business in the Balkans, and has stated
straightforwardly that Milosevic must go.
</P>
<P>
   But the residue of eight years of destruction is bitter indeed
and the moderate center in Kosovo hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has been marginalized. Another moderate, Fehmi Agani, has
been murdered by the Serbs. The victory of the Kosovo Liberation
Army has been the victory of Drenica farmers and expatriate
hard-liners over the urban intellectuals of Albanian society in
Kosovo. It has been a victory of the
independence-then-perhaps-democracy school over the few who held
that democracy should come first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albanian history is in many ways the history of clans and
families and an inability to establish relationships, loyalties or
institutions beyond them,'' a Western official said. ``How you
steer this society into the Western family is not easy to see, but
we are going to have to try.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Much turns on whether the Kosovo Liberation Army will give up
all its weapons to NATO as it has promised to do.
</P>
<P>
   Clark believes that the Albanians fighters ``are about 70
percent OK'' But he added that there were many hard-liners of whom
NATO had to be wary, adding, ``We are not out of the woods in this
part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Zequir, who will not give his last name and calls himself the
commander of the 134th brigade of the Kosovo Liberation Amry, has
left his wife and two children in Switzerland to come and fight. He
stands in his brand new flak jacket beneath a ``UCK-NATO'' sign in
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is certain that Western countries will assist
Albanians _ but not, it seems, in the way the West envisages.
``NATO countries will help us with arms,'' he says. ``That is no
problem. I came to fight so that my children could live in one
country, together with all Albanians, and know their language and
culture.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, MUBARAK PLEDGE TO JUMPSTART STALLED MIDEAST PEACE
PROCESS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying Israel's incoming government offers the best
chance in years to end four decades of Arab-Israeli bloodshed,
President Clinton and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak pledged
Thursday to mount a coordinated diplomatic offensive to seize the
fresh momentum for Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hopes to welcome incoming Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to the White House later this month.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Barak, whose Labor Party won a decisive
parliamentary victory in elections May 17, to ``take a deep
breath,'' and grasp the fresh possibilities for Mideast peace
created by the shifting political winds sweeping Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know you've got to do something, without which you
cannot succeed in serving your people in the long run, it's better
to do it sooner rather than later,'' Clinton told reporters during
a joint White House news conference with Mubarak, considered a key
figure in the success of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the difficulty that lies ahead for Barak, Clinton
added, ``It's better to just take a deep breath and go on and do
what you think has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   As a starting point, Clinton said Barak should put an end to
controversial Jewish settlements in disputed West Bank territories
to send the signal that he is prepared to translate political
support for peace into concrete measures aimed at restoring
confidence and building trust between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also urged Barak to move quickly to enter into so-called
final status talks with the Palestinians, saying the parties should
be able to hash out the contentious issues of Jerusalem's future
and Palestinian statehood within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Israel have sent us a loud message that they
want the (peace) process to be kept alive, and they want it to be
seen through,'' Clinton said. ``I think the chances of success are
now greater.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Barak added new support to the pro peace coalition
government he expects to put into place next Wednesday, and he
extended an olive branch to Yasser Arafat, saying he wants to meet
with the Palestinian leader immediately after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who was in Lisbon, responded to the offer with caution,
saying he would watch Barak's actions over the next few days for
signs of a good-faith effort to move forward with the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, Barak's emerging coalition government claimed a
solid majority of 75 seats in Israel's 120-seat Parliament, the
Knesset. Additional Knesset members not expected to join the
coalition but regarded as likely to support Barak's policies on the
peace process would bring his voting strength to a commanding 90
members.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Clinton, should lend a forceful constituency to
Israeli measures aimed at resolving the territorial disputes near
the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed Barak's support for the six-year-old Oslo peace
accords, which provided a blueprint for a comprehensive Mideast
peace based on Israel handing over occupied territories on the West
Bank and Gaza to Palestinian control in return for Palestinian
efforts to combat anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Oslo process, which was essentially reaffirmed during
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations Clinton hosted last fall at the
Wye River Plantation in rural Maryland, has been stalled for most
of the past 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, valuable time has been wasted,'' said Mubarak.
``Today, there is an opportunity which should not be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding his vote of confidence in the goodwill of the incoming
Barak government, Mubarak said he hopes to meet soon with Barak,
Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to try to generate a
groundswell of diplomacy on several fronts at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake to assume that movement should be
confined to one track at a time,'' said Mubarak, the most
influential leader in the Arab world. ``Progress on each track
facilitates movement on the other. The goal is to achieve just,
comprehensive and stable peace in the whole area.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Egypt took the first perilous step toward peace with Israel 20
years ago, when then-president Jimmy Carter brokered the Camp David
accords between the two countries' leaders, Menachem Begin of
Israel and Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, who was elected following Sadat's assassination by
Islamic militants in 1981, is regarded by the Clinton
administration as critical to advancing the peace process. He is
particularly valued as a moderating influence capable of helping to
bridge gaps among Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, Israeli and
American positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt is where the peace process started,'' said White House
spokesman P.J. Crowley. ``They are, in many ways, the cornerstone
of the peace process, and we have no doubt that President Mubarak
himself can play a very pivotal role ... once Barak is sworn in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak ripped the outgoing Israeli government headed by lame
duck Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, saying ``we were
alarmed,'' by Israel's aerial bombing of Lebanese positions last
week in retaliation for rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon by
the militant Islamic group, Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such actions only poison the atmosphere in the region,'' said
Mubarak. ``We call upon Israel to apply maximum self-restraint in
the crucial months ahead.''

TEXAS GOVERNOR TAKING HEAT FOR HIS PRODIGIOUS FUND-RAISING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that Gov. George W. Bush has been crowned the
fund-raising king of Campaign 2000, his rivals want to make sure
that he pays a price for financial success.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush collected more checks for his record-shattering $36.3
million campaign war chest Thursday, critics tried to turn his
achievement into a negative. President Clinton questioned Bush's
commitment to campaign finance reform. Some Republican rivals cast
Bush as a tool of special interests and ridiculed his claim to be a
Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is self-mutilation that Bush is engaged in. He's stepped
into a big bear trap,'' said Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman
for candidate Steve Forbes. She said Bush will enter the year 2000
nominating contests with ``all the special interests and lobbyists
hanging around his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to other Republican candidates and outside observers
scoffed at the notion that Bush could suffer a voter backlash for
raising more money than any candidate in U.S. political history.
</P>
<P>
   ``With $36 million, you've got to look real hard and deep to
find a downside,'' said an aide to conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush added to his financial advantage Thursday with a
fund-raiser for high-tech executives on the final day of a four-day
swing through California.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline, a daily political newsletter, noted that a
minimum-wage worker would have to spend more than 7 million hours
on the job to match Bush's total. If the candidate's dollars were
laid end to end, they would stretch 3,438 miles, enough to go from
New York to San Francisco with more than 400 miles of bills left
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fund-raising success is breathtaking,'' said Russ Verney,
chairman of the Reform Party. ``He's got all the infrastructure and
all the money to coast over the finish line with nobody even in his
wake. I don't see how anybody in that field can put a dent in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, himself no slouch at fund-raising, downplayed the
impact of Bush's campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money may be important,'' the president said at a news
conference, ``but ideas are even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also served notice that Bush can expect to come under
fire from Democrats if he follows through with plans to ignore
federal campaign spending limits. Bush is expected to escape the
restrictions by turning down federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision would cost his campaign about $16.8
million in federal dollars, it would free him to raise and spend as
much as he wants from individual donors. Clinton said a decision by
Bush to avoid federal limits would show that the Texas Republican
is ``hostile'' to campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people will have to make up their minds about
whether this is an important issue or not,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of the campaign, the only candidate who competes
with Bush financially is Forbes, a millionaire publisher who spent
about $37 million of his own money on his unsuccessful 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates who are at the low-end of the fund-raising
scale will probably be gone soon,'' said Jack Pitney, a political
science professor at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.
``Forbes is the exception because he can write his own checks.''

JOSHUA NKOMO, LEADER IN ZIMBABWE'S FIGHT FOR INDEPENDENCE, DEAD AT
82 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Joshua Nkomo, the once-fiery
African nationalist and guerrilla leader who was father to
Zimbabwe's struggle for independence, died early Thursday in the
Zimbabwean capital, Harare. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent his final decade as the country's vice
president, he had long ago been outmaneuvered and crushed by his
former junior aide, President Robert Mugabe, and had become a
bitter and nearly silent figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   He had prostate cancer, and had largely withdrawn from political
life in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Because he still had influence among his people in southern
Zimbabwe, there are fears of unrest after his death. The whole
country is suffering as food and gasoline prices have soared, but
people from his area say Mugabe discriminates against them.
</P>
<P>
   The president paid tribute to Nkomo on state radio Thursday,
saying: ``We grieve the loss of a father figure, a founder of our
nation, this great man whose life was spent in struggle. The giant
has fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Mqabuko Nyongolo Nkomo was born in 1917. As a youth,
Nkomo, the son of a teacher and lay preacher for the London
Missionary Society, worked as a truck driver and carpenter to pay
for his schooling in South Africa. In 1952, as a 35-year-old union
leader, he was elected president of the Southern Rhodesian African
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He soon helped the colonial authorities win support for
confederation plans, but then stormed out of a London conference
that endorsed them. Heavily criticized, he briefly retired to work
as an auctioneer, but was called back into liberation politics as a
moderate leader who could work with whites. That indecisiveness,
his critics said, was to dog him for the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades, he began by negotiating for
independence, then fighting for it as British rule was superseded
by the Rhodesian government of white colonists headed by Ian D.
Smith that broke with Britain in 1965. Sabotage of railways, crops
and cattle gave way to killings of farmers and drivers on lonely
roads as the white government increased its oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Nkomo and other leaders were repeatedly imprisoned. Arrested in
1964, he spent the next 10 years in a prison camp. In proposing to
release him and begin talks about reconciliation, Smith hectored
him about terrorism, and Nkomo became enraged, shaking his stick,
and saying: ``He was so arrogant and rude. I told him he was the
biggest terrorist ever and asked him to put me back on the plane to
Buffalo Range,'' where he was imprisoned, ``and forget about me.''
Instead, he was soon let go, but the peace effort collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 Mugabe and others left his party. Over the next two
decades, alliances between different leaders shifted, but the split
was essentially tribal: Nkomo led what became the Zimbabwean
African People's Union, most of whose members were Ndebele.
</P>
<P>
   The Ndebele, who occupy the southern quarter of the country,
called Matabeleland, form about 20 percent of the population. They
are descended from a branch of the Zulus who were led into the area
by their chief, Mzilikazi, in the 19th century and fell upon,
slaughtered, raped and dispossessed the local Shona people.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwean African National Union,
represents the Shona-speaking 70 percent. The old hatreds still
rankle.
</P>
<P>
   The two men could hardly be more different. Nkomo was loud,
burly and egocentric but sometimes jolly; Mugabe was slim,
intellectual, cunning and a dandy. Though they joined their efforts
as the Patriotic Front in 1976, they never merged their armies.
Mugabe, based in Mozambique, relied on China for arms; the Soviet
Union gave Nkomo's smaller force better weapons, leading to
suspicion that it was grooming him to stage a coup once
independence was achieved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, from exile in Zambia, Nkomo briefly negotiated
separately with Smith, leading to accusations that he was selling
out. In 1978, a particularly brutal incident vilified him in white
eyes. His troops shot down an Air Rhodesia flight with 56 civilians
aboard; 18 survived the crash, but guerrillas reached the site and
shot 10 in cold blood.
</P>
<P>
   In a BBC radio interview, Nkomo chuckled about it. White
Rhodesians, furious, mounted ever more brutal counterattacks, but
the end for them was clearly nearer.
</P>
<P>
   At independence in 1980, the victors split again. Mugabe swept
to an electoral victory, taking 57 parliamentary seats to Nkomo's
20. By agreement, whites retained 20.
</P>
<P>
   Nkomo was made home affairs minister in Mugabe's government, but
was dismissed in 1982, accused of coup-plotting. Nkomo's fighters
deserted the army and went home. Mugabe sent his Presidential Guard
and North Korea-trained Fifth Brigade into Matabeleland; they
killed more than 10,000 people, including many villagers, in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Nkomo fled to Botswana and then London, saying Mugabe's
troops had raided his home and killed his driver in an
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, he was persuaded to return to negotiate peace.
Talks dragged on for years. In a 1986 interview, embittered and
speaking in a raspy whisper, he sat in his modest house in a suburb
of Bulawayo, the old Ndebele capital whose name means ``the place
of killing.''
</P>
<P>
   He dandled the carved stick that had become his symbol, and said
of his relationship with Mugabe: ``The prime minister seems to be
hostile toward me. I've suffered much more in the last four years
than in the 30 years of my struggle for independence. I have
nothing against him myself. Why should I?''
</P>
<P>
   An accord was signed in 1987 under which Mugabe, seeking a
Marxist one-party state, absorbed Nkomo's party. He became vice
president; Mugabe's party ended up with 147 of the seats in the new
150-seat Parliament. Mugabe celebrated the accord, saying they
could ``move into the future hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nkomo's enthusiasm was more subdued. He urged his followers
``not to look to who has gained and not gained'' but to take pride
in a more united nation.
</P>
<P>
   He had himself favored one-party rule, but said that declaring
it ``when you preach tribalism and when you attack people because
they speak a language which is not your own'' was tantamount to
``putting gunpowder under your feet _ one day you will be blown
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he was a largely ineffectual figure, rallying support
for the government in Matabeleland but doing little else as
Mugabe's rule became more autocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Praise for Nkomo came from all over Africa Thursday. Former
South African president Nelson Mandela, who knew him decades ago as
a social work student in Johannesburg, praised him as ``one of
those freedom fighters who stood up for justice at the most
difficult time in our struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nkomo is survived by his wife, Johanna, and three children. His
body will lie in state until Saturday, and he will be buried in
Heroes' Acre in Harare.

PANEL SEES NO SHORT CUT TO A LESS VIOLENT MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The topic before a packed auditorium at the New
School in Greenwich Village was ``Violence in America: Reel Life
vs. Real Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion Wednesday evening by a panel of seven mostly
arts-oriented writers, lawyers and creative types was more First
Amendment versus Second Amendment, with a clear bias in favor of
curbing guns rather than free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, sponsored by the Creative Coalition, a nonprofit
advocacy group representing members of the arts and entertainment
sector, was a reflection of the growing unease about violence in
the media since the killings at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo. But if the gathering revealed anything, it might have been
that it is much easier to express anxiety about violence in the
media than reach a consensus on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling around the country, you get the clear sense that
parents are upset and confused and that people who have been
apathetic are beginning to become vocal,'' said John Fund, an
editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal who described himself
as the panel's token conservative. ``Maybe it doesn't go any
further than that. But I think a conversation is definitely
starting.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation Wednesday was a somewhat chaotic one that
veered from guns to V-chips to one audience member's question about
whether it was an immoral act to be a guest on the Bob Grant or Don
Imus radio shows.
</P>
<P>
   The other panelists were actor, producer and director Stanley
Tucci; television producer Linda Ellerbee; Deborah Forte, executive
vice president of Scholastic Entertainment; film director and
writer Peter Bogdanovich; Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a psychiatrist at
Harvard Medical School, and lawyer Martin Garbus.
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint said there was ``overwhelming evidence'' that violence
in the media had real-world reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like air pollution, it affects the most vulnerable part of
society _ it's like asthma,'' he said. The problem, he said, is the
``lethal mix'' of guns, violence, other social ills and a society
drenched in violent media.
</P>
<P>
   But Garbus and others said that there was no way to censor
violence in the media except through self-censorship by people in
news and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the conversation turned to curbing guns rather than
curbing violence in the media, with several of the panel members,
particularly Garbus and Bogdanovich, questioning the practicality
in today's world of the Second Amendment's protection of private
ownership of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gun sparring, there were condemnations of the degree to
which violence has become an accepted part of the entertainment
mix. Tucci lamented the disparity in resources between the small,
personal films he tries to make and the shoot-'em-up blockbusters
that open on thousands of multiplex screens each week.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdanovich compared the megatonnage of violence in modern films
with the understated use of it in the Fritz Lang film ``M,'' in
which Peter Lorre plays a child murderer. He said that the 1931
film, with its off-screen violence and chilling, dramatic staging
(a child's ball rolling out from behind a bush, a balloon flying
into the air), was far more powerful and effective than the
explicitly bloody movies of today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as pointed out by actor William Baldwin, one of the
co-hosts of the gathering, it will be hard to change the situation
as long as there is an economic incentive for violence-drenched
blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called show business, and the operative word is
business,'' said Baldwin, president of the Creative Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even given American society's short attention span, Poussaint
said, there is something striking about the current mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between Columbine and other events is that it's
about white suburban kids,'' he said. ``We have 21,000 homicides a
year in this country, but this time we can't say it's ghetto kids,
it's poor kids, it's single-parent households. We can't explain it
away in the usual ways.''

`SLEEPING BEAUTY': A TALE OF THREE AURORAS AND OF MANY `BEAUTIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Had the Kirov Ballet opened its season with Diana Vishneva and
Andrian Fadeyev leading the cast of its new production of ``The
Sleeping Beauty,'' the initial impression might have been somewhat
different. Nor would it have been wrong to start off with Altynai
Asylmuratova, New York's favorite Kirov ballerina since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As the second and third performances of ``Sleeping Beauty''
showed, these are superb and nuanced performers, careful to remind
the audience that beneath the sprawling visual richness of newly
restored parades of courtiers and fairy tale characters lies the
story of Princess Aurora and her awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vishneva and Fadeyev made their New York debuts as Aurora
and Prince Desire on Tuesday night, after the opening on Monday at
the Metropolitan Opera House; Ms. Asylmuratova was seen with
Fadeyev on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All knew how to inhabit their roles and, more important, to
bring the focus back to classical dancing. Tchaikovsky, as
composer, and Marius Petipa, as choreographer, certainly had
spectacle in mind when they created ``The Sleeping Beauty'' in 1890
in St. Petersburg. But if the ballet has survived as the jewel of
the Russian Imperial Ballet, it is not because of its story or its
decor in different productions; it has endured because of its
glorious score and its set pieces of classical choreography by
Petipa. These may vary in detail from company to company, but no
one will claim that the Rose Adagio, for the young Aurora and four
suitors, does not come down from Petipa.
</P>
<P>
   It is Petipa's already modern abstraction of emotion through
pure classical dance, so different from the style of Romantic
ballets, that these casts understood perfectly. Ms. Vishneva's
dramatic Aurora was imbued with the dynamism and force of her
strong technique; unlike the first Aurora, Svetlana Zakharova, who
would probably be more at home in Balanchine's ballets, she used a
loose-hipped high leg extension not for effect but as part of a
clearly shaped classical phrase, and knew the value of a soft plie
in landing from a jump. In this case, the idiom was not distorted,
only made to look contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   High leg extensions are not essential to Ms. Asylmuratova.
Thinner and more mature than when her youthful mystery first cast a
spell in her dancing with the Kirov and as a guest with American
Ballet Theater, she retains her gift for pulling the viewer into
her poetic world. Her Aurora was a princess from the start, regal
but not affected, a modest child. As a vision in Act II, she was
different, careful not to push but still articulate in her dancing.
She knew how to emphasize the difference between our first and last
view of Aurora. In Act III, her style was grander, showing us the
beauty awakened to maturity and love in her wedding pas de deux.
</P>
<P>
   A baby-faced Prince wreathed by a wig of golden ringlets,
Fadeyev made the Desire interesting. His mime and expression
defined a seeker, an innocent in quest of an ideal. An attentive
and fine partner, he was also admirably precise in his double air
turns and fluent classicism in Act III.
</P>
<P>
   The divertissement in that act Wednesday afternoon offered a
surprise. In the Bluebird Pas de Deux, given here in choreography
that resembles Soviet versions more than those seen in the West,
Anton Korsakov suddenly came into his own with a series of powerful
leg beats and the height he had not shown on opening night. He
partnered Irina Zhelonkina, whose refinement and amplitude of shape
made the most of choreography that plays down sparkle in favor of
lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as elsewhere, one can question the lack of stylistic unity
in this production. Although the attempt was to restore
19th-century passages, the mime is often out of the codified
classical canon and the notation used as a tool derives from
productions after 1903. On another level, the fairies in the
prologue keep to an uninflected style that clashes with the way the
principals dance.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography for Aurora's variation in Act I, moreover,
adhered to the Royal Ballet version when Ms. Asylmuratova danced,
but this was not true in other performances. The blandness of the
Lilac Fairy's new solo in the Prologue did not hinder the gracious
acting of Daria Pavlenko (Tuesday) and Veronica Part (Wednesday).
In Act II each wore the lilac-decorated helmet and chiton of the
old photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The production's impact is visual, thanks to the elaborate sets
and the added variety of differentiated units of dancers. Young
violinists kneel to support Aurora in her arabesques in Act I, and
the retinues of the fairies and guests in the prologue and Act III
add to the charm in the storybook divertissement. Polina Rassadina
and Maxim Khrebtov are excellent in the Cinderella vignette, and
the ogre has been restored to a Tom Thumb episode.
</P>
<P>
   The newly acquired layers of music and character dance tell us
how full the stage of ``Beauty'' once looked. The effect is rich
and less than dynamic: how to make the classics come alive to a
modern audience is still the question.

SENATORS GRILL NATO SUPREME COMMANDER ABOUT KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's triumphant general in the Kosovo war
received less than a hero's welcome Thursday from US senators, who
criticized the lack of readiness for a ground invasion, poor
intelligence estimates and the now open-ended mission of American
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extensive public assessment of NATO's 11-week air
war, Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark told the Senate
Armed Services Committee that the allied troops believed the war
was a ``very just cause.'' He called the battle ``a testament to
political unity and the will of NATO members to stand up to the
humanitarian tragedy'' inflicted on ethnic Albanians by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the four-star general said the future of the Balkans depends
on the whether Milosevic remains, and his assessment was the
Yugoslav leader retained ``formidable power.''
</P>
<P>
   In his review of the lessons of the war, Clark underscored the
potential difficulties of politicians interfering with generals. In
perhaps the most dramatic example, Clark revealed that political
leaders prevented NATO forces from intercepting some 200 Russian
troops who made their way to the Pristina airport on June 11,
causing a diplomatic and military impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said others ``at levels above mine'' decided against
blocking the Russians, even though NATO had enough advance warning
to do so. When the hearing ended, Clark pulled two senators aside
and apparently expressed his displeasure about the decision. The
Russian move led to negotiations that gave Russia a larger role in
the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, told the Globe that US officials were among those who
asked NATO not to stop the Russians. ``There was a fair amount of
push, especially from the State Department, in not wishing to
create a situation for (Russian President Boris) Yeltsin that would
untenable for him domestically,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing NATO-Russian airport standoff was emblematic of the
uncertainties of the conflict, which ended suddenly after 78 days
of bombing and widespread atrocities committed by Serb troops
against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's still unfinished work in bringing peace to the province,
coupled with deep animosity toward the Clinton administration among
many Republicans and lingering doubts about NATO's tactics,
contributed to Clark's mixed welcome.
</P>
<P>
   It stood in absolute contrast to the standing ovations given by
Congress to the last returning American war commander, Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, who delivered a stirring 20-minute tribute on
May 8, 1991 to both houses of Congress. Schwarzkopf told lawmakers
then the American forces ``were the thunder and lightning of Desert
Storm. We were the United States military and damn proud of it!''
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Clark suffered through the indignity of being
caught in Washington traffic and then entered a huge Senate hearing
room a few minutes late to find only six of the 19 committee
members at their seats. (Thirteen eventually appeared.) And when
Clark finally answered the last question more than three hours and
no ovations later, only two senators were left. Spectators numbered
11.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the hearing was set from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job well done,'' said Senator John W. Warner, committee chair
and Virginia Republican.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Warner barreled ahead with a series of critical
questions about the decision not to ring Kosovo with NATO ground
troops before the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did that send a message to Milosevic of less than full resolve
on the part of NATO? Would so many Kosovar Albanians have died or
been driven from their homes if a NATO invasion force had not only
been planned, but also prepositioned and ready to strike? Would the
air campaign have been less than the 79 days?'' Warner asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he presented a ground troops option to the alliance,
but ``there was simply no consensus on the part of the nations'' to
assemble an invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's Republican counterparts poured on other doubts, even as
they offered their personal praise for Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma: ``I do think that we have
abused and we have lied to the public as to the atrocities that
(were) taking place'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama: ``I think it is important to
note that the horrible ethnic cleansing, the destruction and
devastation rendered by the Serbian military, did, in fact, occur
after the bombing started, after we had made threats for weeks
about bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats, in contrast, lavished praise upon the
general. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was perhaps the
most effusive, saying of Clark, ``it seems to me . . . that the
good Lord endowed you with some extraordinary personal
capabilities. . . .And they were all tested here: your ability as a
military strategist and leader, tactician, but also honestly your
ability as a diplomat to work within NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, leaning forward in his chair, his voice filling the hall,
didn't shy away from the critiques. He acknowledged that the job is
far from done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do recognize that in many respects, the hardest part of the
job lies in the days ahead,'' he said of NATO's peacekeeping
mission, which will include 7,000 Americans among about 55,000
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The general declined numerous times to estimate the length of
the peacekeeping mission. He indicated that much depended on the
future of Milosevic. For now, he said, Milosevic didn't appear to
be seriously threatened by any opposition inside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Under close questioning by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine
Republican, about the state of the Yugoslav military, Clark said
that NATO bombers struck only one-third of Milosevic's forces. The
rest of the army ``was deployed, dispersed, and in hiding
throughout the rest of Serbia, or in some cases in Montenegro, in
many cases close to civilian targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, said Clark, ``retains formidable power in Yugoslavia,
and he's an expert at dividing the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe also questioned battlefield damage assessments. A Globe
reporter, in two weeks of extensive travel throughout the province,
saw only three destroyed Yugoslav military vehicles _ two tanks and
one armored personnel carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by the figures that we released on confirmed battle
damage,'' Clark said. ``That was 110 tanks, 210 armored fighting
vehicles and 449 artillery and mortar tubes.'' He did say that
pilots hit some ``dummys,'' or fake military equipment built by
Yugoslav troops as decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Clark answered his last question close to 1 p.m. and stayed for
a few minutes to discuss the Pristina airport situation with Warner
and Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat. The general threw his
arms in the air and had a hard time keeping his voice down, despite
the presence of a group of reporters nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Then he strode out. He had arrived late Wednesday after a
13-hour plane ride. He had taken his usual morning swim Thursday.
He had only come to Washington in the first place for a few
consultations and his annual four-hour physical, which he will
undergo Friday at Walter Reed Medical Hospital. The senators were a
late addition to the schedule. And here they had grilled him, even
made him miss lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It must have rankled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know,'' Clark said, ducking his head into his
chauffered black sedan. ``I think some nice things were said. Maybe
the difference here was that we didn't have the buildup that we had
leading to Desert Storm. Maybe I need to provide greater
clarification in the days ahead.''

   NEW MARKET, Va. _ The aroma of frying onions is wafting out from
the concession stand and the Eagles are singing ``Take It Easy''
over the PA system. Carrying the accordion he will use to play
``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
retired FBI agent Sol Quinn sidles by a flower box of red geraniums
to reach his seat behind home plate. Players from the New Market
Rebels are raking and lining the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Another evening of baseball bliss is set to commence in the
Shenandoah Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' exclaims Julio Chinea, 22, who grew up in
Naples, Fla., and pitched for Miami Dade Junior College and
Bluefield College in Virginia to earn his spot on the Rebels.
``Since I was in about the ninth grade, I'd heard about it (from
older players) and I just always wanted to play in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   For the college players who have come for 37 summers, the dusty
diamonds of the Shenandoah Valley League are fields of dreams. They
know that Mo Vaughn of the California Angels and Steve Finley of
the Arizona Diamondbacks and scores of other major leaguers played
here in summers past. They know that baseball ``bird dogs'' with
radar guns and stopwatches sometimes sit amid the friendly fans
behind the chicken-wire backstops.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of scouts come to games and the coaches have pretty good
connections,'' explains Tom Perrin, 21, a shortstop from West Palm
Beach, Fla., and the College of Charleston. ``That's what you're
here for.''
</P>
<P>
   They see the Valley as a step toward million dollar contracts
and prime-time play. But even those who will never draw a baseball
paycheck can gain from a summer spent living with a local family
and working on a farm or corner grocery. Many experience an America
that they knew only from TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda like Mayberry here. Everybody knows everybody,''
marvels Charlie Wentzky, 20, a pitcher from Anderson, S.C., and the
College of Charleston. ``It's amazing that there are people like
this left in the world _ with all the shootings and robberies and
stuff. They don't lock their doors. Basically, they don't live by
the watch. They come and go as they need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Players learn about social networks by watching the community
unite to finance a season and welcome a team of strangers into its
midst, explains Larry Strawderman, the Rebels' volunteer general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learn life.''

<P>
   Two of the teachers are ``Mama Jean'' and ``Big E.''
</P>
<P>
   New Market Rebels of several seasons ago gave the nicknames to
Jean Morse, a wife, mother, hairdresser, school bus driver, cook
and hostess, and her husband, Everett, a husky state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five seasons, after every game, home and away,
``Mama Jean'' has fed the team. She cooks for 25 players _ plus
coaches and an occasional visiting parent or girlfriend _ at her
house with an inviting front porch located a few of blocks from
Rebel Field. Afterward, players watch TV, play cards and talk for
hours, often spending the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My policy: I go to bed when I'm ready,'' said Jean Morse. ``I
woke up the other morning to find that nine players had slept
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered along Interstate-81, there are six teams in the Valley
League: the Winchester Royals, Front Royal Cardinals, Harrisonburg
Turks, Waynesboro Generals, Staunton Braves and the Rebels. With a
population of 1,500, New Market is the smallest host community. It
is a town without taverns or other late-night establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team needs a place to group, bond, hang out and get to
know each other,'' said Morse. ``It's a home away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer grocery bill is ``astronomical,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food she puts out is amazing,'' said Chinea.
</P>
<P>
   The menu after a recent Friday night home game included fried
chicken, macaroni and cheese casserole and coleslaw. Sometimes
there is pizza or spaghetti or lasagna or cold cuts for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 2 o'clock, I'm cleaning up the mess,'' said Morse, whose
efforts are voluntary and self-financed.
</P>
<P>
   There's one ironclad rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any have been drinking, they don't drive from the house. I
take their car keys,'' she said. ``And anybody who thinks college
students don't drink beer is kidding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the deterrent of ``Big E,'' with his state patrol
car parked in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there have ever been problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college coaches don't send bad boys up here,'' says Jay
Zuspan, who has hosted players on his Christmas tree farm outside
of New Market for six summers. ``They won't send us trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't meet a more polite group of young men than these
baseball players,'' echoes Morse, declining to name the only two
exceptions in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players keep in touch after they leave. Others
don't. She follows all their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marshall McDougall from Florida State hit six home runs
in one game this year, I said, 'Why, he slept on my couch','' she
recalled. ``I keep telling them, when they get to the big leagues,
don't forget about Mama Jean in Virginia.''

   During the early innings, the setting sun warms the backs of the
400 or so fans who paid the $3 admission to Rebel Park. Massanutten
Mountain looms above an outfield fence painted with advertisements
from local merchants. Giggling teen-aged girls lean over the
railing near the third base dugout to gaze at their favorite
Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Wentzky is the cutest player, agree Kim Leitzel and
Katelyn Linski, both 13. They come to most games, as do their
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   School is out, so ``you get together at the game,'' explains
Katelyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the green chairs behind home plate sit the ``grandstand
managers,'' club members who pay $75 a year for this prime position
for viewing, socializing and grousing at the umpire. Many are
retirees from the nearby Bryce Mountain Resort. Visiting fans _
mostly host families from other league towns _ sit in bleachers
near the first base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebel Park announcer welcomes by name and hometown the
visiting moms, dads, grandparents and girlfriends of players on
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings, some fans cut through a neighboring yard to get
black raspberry sundaes or fresh peach shakes at Pack's Frozen
Custard stand. Others spend $1.25 for a Rebel Park hot dog topped
with those fried onions. Kids chase foul balls and return them for
a pack of baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy watching the town turn out for games. The whole summer
schedule is wrapped around this ball park,'' said Martha Sims. She
and her husband, George, are both Lutheran ministers as well as
family hosts for a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is baseball the way it was in the 1950s,'' says Mo Weber,
the Rebels' 76-year-old batting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from coaching at the College of William and Mary, he
banters easily with players who kid him about personally knowing
Abner Doubleday or coaching Joe DiMaggio in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are flat-out better today,'' he says. ``They are
physically bigger, stronger, faster, better conditioned. They know
more about anatomy and physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades or so of baseball, he loves to hear the ump
say ``batter up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate to still be in the game.''

   ``You don't have time for much except baseball,'' says Carson
Wiggins, 20, a pitcher from Waynesboro, Ga., and Georgia College in
Milledgeville who is spending the summer with the Winchester
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The league schedules 40 games in 55 days. Then there are
playoffs for the top teams. The longest road trip _ between
Staunton and Winchester _ takes about 90 minutes by bus. The
players are not paid, although the league picks up the tab for
their airfare from home and back and helps to find them summer
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Wiggins and the rest of the Royals are visiting
Bing Crosby Field in Front Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The crooner was grand marshal of the 1949 Apple Blossom
Festival, explains Linda Keen, the Cardinals volunteer president.
The next year, he hosted a movie premier in Front Royal and
performed at a benefit and even donated his own money for the white
cinder block stadium that now bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is spending the summer about 20 miles away in
Winchester, a bustling community known for its apple orchards and
as the hometown of Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchester is big compared to Waynesboro,'' jokes Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying with the same family that hosted his brother,
Daniel, two summers ago. Daniel just signed a contract with the
Chicago Cubs organization.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Wiggins is philosophical about his own future. If it
includes a big league career, fine. For now, though, he is happy to
spend his days working in Martin's Grocery and his nights playing
baseball in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players are hopeful of playing professionally, but
they know the odds are long.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal since Little League _ and the main goal of most
of the players here _ is just to keep playing as long as we can,''
said Jeff Reardon, a New Market Rebels pitcher from Siena College
in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every kid's dream,'' said J.C. Bunch, a Front Royal
Cardinals catcher from Austin, Texas, and Trinity College in San
Antonio. ``The league provides an opportunity to be seen by
scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, they are enjoying the culture shock of living
slow in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think California has a town this small,'' says Tom
Adinolfi, a New Market pitcher from San Jose State. ``I'd been here
two days and already people on the street were saying, 'Hi Tim'.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Biery, who works at an auto parts dealership in Staunton,
is president of the Valley League. The position pays $200 a year.
Only coaches and umpires receive real salaries. Most everybody else
is an unpaid volunteer. About 20 percent of the league budget comes
from Major League Baseball through an NCAA program. The NCAA
sanctions several such summer leagues scattered from Alaska to Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team does its own recruiting. They compete with each
other for players _ as well as with other leagues,'' said Biery.
``The main selling point is the quality of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Since admissions pay the bulk of the bills, promotion is an
important element of the league. There are contests for the best
decorated lawn chairs, for instance. And New Market has an
incongruous Chicken Man who cavorts during some games.
</P>
<P>
   The team got a good deal on the suit through the Internet,
explained GM Strawderman. ``He's a Rebel chicken.''

AT BERTELSMANN, A SLIGHT TILT AWAY FROM FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUTERSLOH, Germany _ Reinhard Mohn, the 78-year-old patriarch
who has controlled Bertelsmann AG for nearly four decades, began a
cautious process Thursday of making the world's third-largest media
conglomerate less of a family business.
</P>
<P>
   But only slightly so.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to keep the empire firmly in private control, Mohn
turned over his voting rights to a new six-person board that
includes two Bertelsmann executives and at least one member of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The move ensures that Bertelsmann, which owns properties as
diverse as European television broadcasters, the American publisher
Random House and interests in online services like
Barnesandnoble.com, retains one of the world's most curious
corporate structures.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's stock was transferred by the Mohn family
to a charitable foundation in 1993. But Mohn, a fifth-generation
descendant of the founding family, kept control of all voting
rights. The charitable foundation is entitled only to a stream of
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mohn turned over his voting rights to a new company
that will in some ways resemble an American board of directors: It
will have a mix of Bertelsmann executives and outsiders and set the
basic strategic direction.
</P>
<P>
   That is different from standard German companies, where a
management board of top executives holds most of the power and the
``supervisory board'' _ made up of executives, union
representatives and outside directors _ is usually quite weak.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new structure at Bertelsmann, control will rest with
six people: Bertelsmann's chief executive and another top
executive; two outside directors from Bertelsmann's supervisory
board; one family member and one employee representative.
</P>
<P>
   Mohn, a trim and energetic man who looks younger than his years,
will also be on the board.
</P>
<P>
   The new design means that over time the Mohn family will have
very limited say over the company. Much of the power will reside
with Bertelsmann's top executives, who have been drawn from outside
the family since Mohn retired in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike typical German supervisory boards, each member of the
Bertelsmann group will have a veto on major strategic decisions. As
a result, nonexecutives could wield considerable influence.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's current chief executive is Thomas Middelhoff, 45,
who rose through the company and took over the top position in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Mohn said his main purpose was to preserve Bertelsmann's
``continuity and independence,'' arguing that the company's
structure and culture are unique in Germany and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's most prominent feature is its decentralization.
Neither Mohn nor his successors have run Bertelsmann's collection
of businesses like an investment portfolio; instead, they have
championed the idea that each business should be managed as an
individually accountable entrepreneurial venture.
</P>
<P>
   During his own reign as chief executive, Mohn was famous for
delegating authority. When facing a major decision, he demanded
one-page summaries of the issues and was known to complain when
they stretched to two pages.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bertelsmann has accumulated more than 300 separate
business units and about 600 ``profit centers,'' which generated a
large cash flow and allowed the company to finance its growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the soaring stock values for Internet companies are forcing
Bertelsmann to adopt new approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann recently sold part of its stake in the online
bookstore Barnesandnoble.com, and it is considering similar public
offerings of minority stakes in other subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Mohn and other Bertelsmann executives Thursday reiterated
their longstanding refusal to turn Bertelsmann itself into a public
company. They even fretted over the implications of letting
subsidiaries go public.

<P>
   ``There are a lot of consequences from taking a company on the
stock exchange, and we have to consider them very carefully
beforehand,'' said Siegfried Luther, Bertelsmann's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the public offerings, Luther said, was to
create a form of currency other than cash that could be used to
finance other acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Internet companies, it only makes sense to make
acquisitions through stock swaps rather than cash,'' he said. ``But
that isn't at all the case with a book publisher. We bought Random
House for cash and that worked wonderfully well.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Bertelsmann's decentralized operations, Mohn made it
clear that the corporation would remain very closely held.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could imagine himself outvoted, he said, ``I think
it is improbable.''

BREAKING OF MAINE DAM CELEBRATED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Maine _ For the first time in US history, a government
demolition crew began destroying a dam against the wishes of its
owner, bringing down a barrier that for 162 years had prevented
salmon, sturgeon and other fish from going upstream to spawn.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of often bitter legal disputes over the future of
the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River, a single backhoe finally
struck the killing blow, punching a hole Thursday in a temporary
earthen stretch of the dam as 1,000 specators cheered or stared in
awe at the torrent of silty brown water rushing through the breach.
</P>
<P>
   And, while environmentalists, sportsmen and Maine politicians
celebrated a rebirth of one of the Northeast's most ecologically
important rivers, federal officials said the breaching of the
Edwards Dam signals a new era in which hundreds of dams whose
environmental damage outweighs their economic good could be removed
when their licenses expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big national story,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, watching the Kennebec surge through the newly cut gap in
the 915-foot long dam. ``It's the beginning of a totally new
chapter of river restoration . . . All of Maine is entitled to a
victory lap today and I hope they'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the dam, expected to be completed around
Thanksgiving, will be a boon for 10 species of fish that live at
sea but swim up the Kennebec to spawn, opening up 17 miles of river
until the next dam upstream in Waterville. In addition, fish-eating
birds such as the osprey and eagles that circled over the
proceedings Thursday should eat better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the Kennebec River, the fish, Maine's
recreation economy, and everyone who appreciates a free flowing
river,'' said Brownie Carson, executive director of the Natural
Resources Council of Maine, which helped lead the coalition that
pushed for the dam's removal.
</P>
<P>
   But Maine Gov. Angus King, a longtime supporter of the dam's
removal, warned that the transition to a free-flowing river will
take time. Initially, he said, the water level above the dam will
drop, exposing mud flats and washing debris such as the remnants of
long-ago log drives downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next four or five years are going to be ugly,'' he said,
``But, in time, nature will heal.''
</P>
<P>
   In important ways, Thursday's celebration reflects how much
American attitudes toward rivers have changed since the 19th
century Industrial Revolution, when rivers were a source of both
power and a place for waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta itself was once a mill town, with a main street whose
businesses faced away from the river, while the nearby Edwards Dam
powered a cotton mill that provided 700 jobs. The Kennebec was so
polluted that windows in the state Capitol building had to stay
closed on hot summer days, and a paper company conducted log drives
on the river until the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards Manufacturing closed in the early 1980s, leaving
nothing but empty brick buildings and the dam, which generated a
modest 3.5 megawatts of power, barely enough juice for a town of
2,000. As the remaining industries on the river reduced pollution,
biologists began to question the wisdom of allowing a dam that
provided so little benefit to block so many fish from getting
upstream.
</P>
<P>
   The only concession to the fish was a 12-inch-wide polyvinyl
chloride pipe that literally sucked fish out of the water with a
vacuum pump and dumped them into an open bin to be trucked to
another river. Though the rudimentary system worked for alewife,
bigger fish such as salmon and sturgeon that can grow up to eight
feet simply didn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of organizations and top politicians called for the
dam's removal in 1989, but the owners, blessed with a contract to
sell their power at well above the market rate for electricity,
didn't want to give up their license. Instead, Edwards
Manufacturing applied for a new 50-year federal license that would
allow them to triple the electricity output.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Edwards Dam became a protracted test case for the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which licenses the nation's
75,000 dams and, before Edwards, had never ordered one removed.
Though 126 dams had been removed across the country in modern
times, according to the group American Rivers, none were ordered
removed by FERC.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Kennebec Coalition _ comprised of the Natural
Resources Council of Maine, American Rivers, Trout Unlimited, and
the Atlantic Salmon Federation _ turned the tide with a 7,000-page
report that documented the value of removing the dam. A
free-flowing Kennebec would produce at least $48 million worth of
economic benefits a year from increased sportfishing alone, the
coalition argued, while boosting the population of endangered
salmon and sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the turning point. FERC had never seen anything like
that,'' said Carson, referring to the 1996 study.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, FERC ordered the dam removed at the expense of
Edwards Manufacturing Company. But, under a compromise, Bath Iron
Works agreed to pay the $2.5 million dam removal cost in exchange
for the right to expand its shipworks downstream in sturgeon
habitat. In addition, upstream dam owners on the Kennebec agreed to
pay $4.75 million for fish restoration in exchange for delays in
installing fish ladders at their dams.
</P>
<P>
   Some denounced the compromise as an environmental sellout, but
Gov. King said the deal was actually an act of generosity by the
Edwards Manufacturing Company. ``They had a strong legal case that
could have extended the process for years,'' said King. ``Instead,
they chose the path of statesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, King said, the removal of the dam is a bittersweet
occasion because the Edwards Dam is a symbol of Maine's industrial
past. ``We are celebrating a removal, but we also should celebrate
the history as well,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, as music from a folk trio filled the air and
Augusta residents crowded the riverbanks to see the
much-anticipated dam breaching, the atmosphere seemed mainly
festive.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation, H.E. Sargent had knocked out a 70-foot stretch
of the concrete and timber dam and replaced it with an earthen
cofferdam that would be much easier to demolish on cue. Then, a
backhoe dug a trench to allow water over the cofferdam, and the
river's swift current quickly swept it aside, turning the whole
river downstream milky brown from the silt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river today is being returned to the people,'' said Terry
Garcia, assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere,
predicting that other dams will eventually follow suit. ``There are
many others, perhaps hundreds, who have outlived their
usefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   However, neither Garcia nor Babbitt wanted to talk specifics,
perhaps because the next dam controversy is on Oregon's Snake
River, where four big hydro-electric dams prevent the salmon from
spawning. The administration has not yet taken a position on
environmentalists' call for the dams' removal.

OFFICIALS SAY AIRLINE COMPUTERS 95% READY FOR YEAR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials of the US airline industry said Thursday that 95
percent of the computer systems used to move passengers _
everything from maintenance records to reservation systems _ have
been repaired to deal with the Year 2000 problem, and the rest
would be finished by summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline industry is in really great shape, and we will be
ready to fly on Dec. 31, and Jan. 1,'' Carol Hallett, president and
chief executive of the Air Transport Association, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration, which is
responsible for certifying planes, pilots, airlines and keeping
planes safely separated in the sky, said that it appears it had met
its June 30 deadline of making all 628 computer systems Y2K
compliant. Of that number, 424 are considered ``mission critical.''
Some 65 alone involved air traffic and needed changes to make them
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has hired an independent auditor to review the
compliance, and is also waiting for the Department of
Transportation's inspector general's office to ``validate'' the
work. Once those reviews are complete _ sometime later this month _
the FAA will formally announce its year 2000 progress, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   While on-board aircraft computer systems had already been deemed
compliant by Airbus and Boeing, airlines and airports had hundreds
of computer systems to check. Hallett said that the airlines spent
more than $700 million and two years solving ``small problems as
well as big problems'' related to how computers will function when
they read the year date change from ``99'' to ``00''. Some
computers, unless repaired beforehand, may malfunction when the
year changes because they will read the date change as the year
1900 instead of 2000. Hallett said the industry's joint task force
will spend the rest of the year testing the repaired systems.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, President Clinton's assistant and chairman of the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, said the airline
industry _ often ruthlessly competitive _ came together quickly and
cooperated to solve the problems. ``One of the secrets of their
success is their willingness to work together, sharing experiences
with products and fixing things and testing.''
</P>
<P>
   One area where less information is available is overseas
airlines and airports.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the US State Department is expected to begin issuing
travel advisories about specific countries and the ability of their
airports and air traffic control systems to o deal with the Year
2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   And the International Air Transport Association, which represent
more than 200 airlines, is surveying its members. That information,
however, will not be made public and passengers may not know which
foreign airlines are having problems until they start canceling
flights when they print new schedules later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hallett, however, said US and Canadian airlines will be ready to
fly within the United States and Canada, and will not fly to any
place that is not safe.
</P>
<P>
   Hallett said major airports have been working hard to make sure
everything from jet bridges to airport lighting functions properly
and said she believes the nation's airports will have finished
their work by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston's Logan International Airport 90 percent of the
aviation-related systems have been made complaint, and 88 percent
of those have been tested. The airport expects to have every
aviation system but two finished this month. The remaining ones
will be finished in the fall when a vendor is scheduled to work on
them.

CANADA CELEBRATES BIRTHDAY WITH A PARTY FOR IMMIGRATION LANDMARK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Certain countries, like certain people,
find celebrating their own birthdays a bit awkward. Canada is one.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians shoot off fireworks and hold parades, though they
never get as boisterous as their noisy neighbors to the south. That
may be because national birthdays like the one they marked Thursday
inevitably invite reflections on a nation's character. That can be
a squirmy subject for Canadians, who may not be sure what their
vast land is, but who are certain what it is not _ the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   This birthday, Canada's 132rd since Queen Victoria declared it a
nation, could have been a particularly difficult one for Canadians
to enjoy. Public debate in recent days has focused on a proposal to
dump the weak Canadian dollar and replace it with the American
buck. That led Canada's most prominent news magazine to lament,
``Say It Ain't So.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, then, that Canadians would devote so much
attention this year to a squat, ugly pier in Halifax's bay that
Thursday morning was officially designated the soul of this good
land.
</P>
<P>
   Pier 21 is Canada's Ellis Island. It is the last surviving
immigration shed in Canada. It was here that more than a million
immigrants, refugees and World War II war brides and displaced
people first set foot in North America, first felt the velvety
freedom of being given a second chance. Many of those people
settled in Canada and so changed the country that today the history
of 20 percent of all 30 million Canadians can be traced to this
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The people-processing center was shut down in 1971, and the shed
was largely left to deteriorate. But after a $6.5 million (U.S.)
renovation done with government money and private donations, it was
officially reopened Thursday as the country's first historic site
dedicated to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   At least in this place, on this day, there was no doubt about
what Canada is: not only a big country but a big-hearted one, built
in part on the backs of small people from more than 200 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they found here was a new land, a new life, a new hope
and a new destiny,'' said Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who spoke
by a broadcast link from Ottawa during the inaugural ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on immigration in this way actually makes Canada seem
more than ever built of the same stuff as the United States. But no
one seemed to mind Thursday, not even when the Canadian Maritime
Forces Atlantic Band played an American classic like ``This Land Is
Your Land'' during the inaugural ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first sight of Pier 21 really wasn't mch to look at,''
said Hana Gartner, a nationally known broadcaster who came through
Pier 21 from war-torn Europe with her parents in 1951 when she was
a child. ``But it was our new home, and we did feel lucky that we
were given that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canada as in the United States, however, attitudes toward
immigration are not always positive. Immigrants continue to arrive
at the rate of about 200,000 a year, though they now come by plane
rather than old boats.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of this decade, public opinion polls have
shown that Canadians are less and less tolerant of high levels of
immigration. The real irritant, said Jeffrey G. Reitz, a
sociologist at the University of Toronto, is not the rising number
of immigrants so much as ``the changing racial composition'' of
those who come.
</P>
<P>
   While Pier 21 was the principal port of immigration to Canada,
from 1928 to 1971, roughly three-quarters of all immigrants came
from Europe. Today, only 20 percent of immigrants are European.
More than half the total come from Asia, and the rest from widely
scattered countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   That is quickly giving Canadian cities like Halifax, Toronto and
Vancouver a far more diverse character while presenting far greater
challenges to the multicultural mosaic that Canada considers itself
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The project to establish the Pier 21 National Historic Site did
not escape this thorny trend. The organizers were criticized for
focusing on the period of European immigration, while ignoring
contemporary Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Like the renovated Ellis Island, the sophisticated exhibits
inside Pier 21 allow visitors to experience some sense of what it
was like to be on a ship that emerges from the fog of war, poverty
and persecution into a land of freedom. Photographs, documents and
re-creations help convey the stomach-churning combination of fear
and hope that immigrants felt.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Goldbloom, the granddaughter of immigrants from Russia and
the catalyst behind the Pier 21 renovation, said the displays had
to cover only the period that ended in 1971 if they were to be
historically true to what happened at Pier 21.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the story did not end there. She said that ``what
we're doing with our Pier 21 is raising awareness of immigration
and the contribution of immigrants'' whenever they came.
</P>
<P>
   Pier 21's only concession to the critics is the double row of
mostly third-world flags hanging above a lecture hall to reflect
some of the countries from which today's immigrants come.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants like the 56 people who on Thursday were given the
chance to become the newest Canadians of all. They came from 22
countries, from Albania and Bosnia, Egypt and Libya, from
Mozambique and from Uganda, where Herman Ssebazza was born 57 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the same hall where so many Europeans had landed, Mr.
Ssebazza and his family Thursday swore allegiance to Queen
Elizabeth, who is also Queen of Canada. They sang the national
anthem, ``O Canada,'' in both English and a halting French. They
received small Canadian flags and tiny evergreen seedlings, which
they planned to plant in their backyard in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   And they learned a basic lesson in North American life.
``Canadians are not flag wavers,''said Ssebazza, who suggested
that, in itself, that might not be such a bad thing at a time when
the passion of nationalism has left so many countries in ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish Canadians would market themselves a little bit
more,'' Ssebazza said. ``Canada has so much to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   And as he said that, his 10-year-old daughter, Karen, one of the
newest Canadians, took the small maple leaf flag she had received
during the citizenship ceremony and waved it with new-found
exuberance.

<P>
   PARIS _ Twenty people died Thursday when a gondola in the Alps
in southeastern France ran off a supporting cable and plunged 262
feet to the ground.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victims were on their way to work at the Plateau de Bure
radiotelescope observatory 7,952 feet up a mountain, said Dominique
Germain of the tourist office in St.-Etienne-en-Devoluy, near Gap.
The accident occurred shortly after 7 a.m. on a clear day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cable car, installed in the early 1980s and said to have had
a safety inspection a year ago, broke loose 1,500 feet into its
20-minute run up the mountain, Remi Caron, the senior French
administrative official in the area, told reporters there. The car
was fully loaded and was smashed to bits when it fell on a rocky
slope below. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims are workers and employees of local companies who
were going up there for the day,'' Germain said. ``We are all in
mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said only observatory workers used the car.
</P>
<P>
   St.-Etienne Mayor Jean-Marie Bernard said officials did not know
why the car had fallen. The authorities began a formal
investigation of possible criminal negligence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the worst cable car disaster in France.
Interior Minister Jean-Claude Chevenement and Employment Minister
Martine Aubry flew to the village Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory belongs to a French company, the Institute of
Millimetric Radio Astronomy, which is jointly run by the
government-financed French National Scientific Research Center, the
Max-Planck-Gesellschaft of Germany and the National Geographic
Institute of Spain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its five interferometer radiotelescopes, high above most
atmospheric pollution in a part of the Alps that receives extremely
little precipitation, pick up radio emissions that let scientists
learn about the formation of stars and galaxies and interstellar
matter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The crash followed a series of Alpine disasters over the winter
and into the spring, including a snowslide Feb. 9 near Chamonix
that killed 12 people and a fire in the highway tunnel March 24
under Mont Blanc in which 41 people died. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty skiers died last year when a U.S. Marine plane flew into
a cable in Cavalese in northern Italy and sent the gondola carrying
the skiers crashing to the ground. A military jury acquitted the
pilot of manslaughter charges but convicted him of obstruction of
justice and conspiring to destroy a cockpit video that could have
provided evidence in the case.

ENTREPRENEUR READY TO REVIVE LAURA ASHLEY BRAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Just because his newly formed company completed its
purchase of Laura Ashley's North American retail chain for only a
dollar Thursday, don't think that Laura Ashley fashion is passe or
worthless, said company president Paul Ng.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 years after the death of designer Laura Ashley, the
brand she created with floral prints and an English countryside
feel is poised for a comeback, Ng claims _ and a comeback means
Laura Ashley's US headquarters should stay in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Though it lost $64 million in 1997 and 1998, Ng predicts the 94
stores that will now be operated by his Laura Ashley North America
Inc. can be profitable in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura Ashley was the first lifestyle brand,'' he said.
``Before Tommy Hilfiger and J. Crew, there was Laura Ashley.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics say middle-aged American women won't buy Laura
Ashley apparel and home furnishings as they did 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura Ashley's image is outdated,'' noted John Macht of the
Macht Group, a retail consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ng and a company that employs 50 people in Boston
think they have a strategy for a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Partly with the backing of affiliates of the MUI Group, a large
Malaysian conglomerate, Ng helped form his private company, which
bought the North American stores from Laura Ashley Holdings, the
British company founded by designer Ashley. MUI is also a big
shareholder in publicly traded Laura Ashley Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, the sale was partly motivated by
a lenders' ultimatum to Laura Ashley Holdings: Sell the
unprofitable North American retail chain or no more loans.
</P>
<P>
   Above the $1 sale price, Ng will pay the British retailer, which
retains its European stores and manufacturing operations, royalties
on North American sales and licensing revenues.
</P>
<P>
   During some of the company's uncertain days, there was talk that
Ashley's Boston office might move to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans for any moves now, according to Ng, who said
the Laura Ashley brand still has cachet; its problems were
logistics, marketing, and management.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1990s, Laura Ashley Holdings made a series of
blunders when it centralized planning and rapidly opened larger
stores without upping manufacturing capacity, Ng said.
</P>
<P>
   The results were often a shortage of merchandise _ or the wrong
kind of merchandise. Woolen sweaters meant for damp English winters
wound up in Texas stores in August, Ng said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Laura Ashley clothing often came in English sizes.
Those sizes, which are measured differently from US sizes, left
American customers confused and dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Once stores relied on Laura Ashley Holdings for nearly all
merchandise. But under Ng, the newly independent chain plans to
farm out some manufacturing to other apparel plants.
</P>
<P>
   That should end shortages. It should also mean broader

   While the new company formally took over retail operations only
Thursday, Ng has been running the chain for a year, brought in
after MUI bought a stake in Laura Ashley Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Ng has closed 15 underperforming stores, narrowing the chain's
losses from $39 million in 1997 to $25 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sales fell from $132.2 million in 1996, the chain's last
profitable year, to $107.6 million in 1998. The chain may near the
break-even point in 1999 on projected sales of $65 million. Once it
gets lean and mean, the chain plans to grow again, possibly to 200
stores. An e-commerce site is also in the works.
</P>
<P>
   But some wonder whether the brand can be revived.
</P>
<P>
   London retail consultant Richard Hyman told the Associated Press
last month: ``If someone can come along and turn around Laura
Ashley, it will be one of the most incredible turnarounds I'll have
seen in my time in the industry.''

 &HT;    Tailwind producer sues CNN
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ April Oliver, the former TV producer fired by CNN
after it retracted her report on Operation Tailwind last year, sued
CNN and parent company Time Warner Inc. in Fulton County State
Court on Thursday, seeking $106 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Oliver claims she was wrongly dismissed and alleges
defamation, intentional interference with contract, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, fraud and conspiracy. She is
seeking $6 million in actual damages and $100 million in punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is similar to one Oliver filed in May against CNN
and a countersuit she filed against a retired Army general who was
a source for the story, both in federal court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any suit she files has to be filed here, (according to) terms
of her employment agreement,'' said her lawyer, Neeli Ben-David.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and co-producer Jack Smith were fired by CNN in July 1998
after CNN aired their story ``Valley of Death,'' alleging use of
nerve gas by U.S. military personnel in Laos in 1970. CNN
apologized for the story but has never said it was false, and
Oliver and Smith maintain that it is true. Several other lawsuits
have been filed against CNN by Tailwind veterans; some have been
settled and some are pending.

WEAPONS TURN-IN WILL COST SINN FEIN LEADER SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Martin McNulty spent time on the HMS Maidstone, the
same British prison ship that once held Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams, so he is partial to the former IRA commander who now heads
the republican movement's political operation.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty, 44, is a strong supporter of the peace process into
which Adams has steered his former comrades-in-arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-five percent of the people around here don't want to
see the guns back on the street,'' McNulty said, referring to his
West Belfast neighborhood, an Irish Republican Army stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   But wanting the guns to stay silent is not the same thing as
turning them in. And if Adams delivers on the promise he made
Thursday, he will lose some longtime supporters like Martin
McNulty.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Adams and Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, Martin
McGuinness, McNulty says, ``If they say, `Turn in the weapons,'
that's the end of their political careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Felons Club, a private bar and social club where
membership is gained by serving time for IRA activity, McNulty's
conditional loyalty underscores the difficulties facing Adams and
McGuinness as they try to coax their former comrades in the IRA to
turn in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process is stalled over the demand by the Ulster
Unionists that the IRA begin turning in weapons before Sinn Fein is
allowed to sit in a power-sharing cabinet that will oversee the
work of the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein argues that under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998,
the power-sharing government should be formed before the disarming
of paramilitary groups is completed. But the IRA has repeatedly
ruled out any prospect of turning in weapons, saying that would
amount to a surrender it never made.
</P>
<P>
   Adams Thursday confirmed that, in an effort to break the
stalemate, Sinn Fein was committing itself to getting the IRA to
turn in its weapons by next May, as called for in the Good Friday
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair called Sinn Fein's gesture
part of a ``historic, seismic shift in the political landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams described it in different terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created huge difficulties for ourselves,'' he said.
``Republicans are asking, `What have Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness done?' ''
</P>
<P>
   They have, it could be answered, broken the last republican
taboo by saying the IRA must disarm to keep the peace process
alive. They are arguing that Sinn Fein's gaining political power
will do more for its constituents than guns could ever do.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with former and current IRA members suggest that the
republican leadership has not prepared ordinary rank-and-file
members of the organization for the prospect of turning in weapons.
As one IRA man put it, ``It's never been brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   But republican sources insist that the people who lead the
movement, from the seven-member IRA Army Council to mid-level IRA
leaders, have been briefed on the strategy and support it.
</P>
<P>
   So determined was Sinn Fein to gain international support for
its gesture that McGuinness traveled to Washington May 5 to explain
to President Clinton what Sinn Fein was prepared to do to end the
dispute over IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers here are divided on Sinn Fein's intentions.
An Irish diplomat said he believed Sinn Fein had made a commitment
it cannot deliver because it was so confident that the unionists
would reject the compromise and be blamed for intransigence by
Blair and the rest of international opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, believe Sinn Fein would not gamble on something
as sensitive within the movement as weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinn Fein would not make a commitment it can't deliver,
especially on this,'' says Stephen Grimason, political editor of
the BBC in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Within the IRA, there is no issue right now more sensitive than
its weapons, which go to the core of the group's existence. In
1969, when the Troubles exploded, loyalist mobs simply walked in
and took over Catholic neighborhoods in Belfast. Nationalist
families were burned out while the mostly Protestant police stood
back and did nothing. The IRA, which had been dormant for years,
consisted of a bunch of old men with a few rusty guns. Graffitti
went up in nationalist areas suggesting that IRA stood for I Ran
Away.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyhanded treatment by police of civil rights marchers and
the refusal of the police to stop loyalists while simultaneously
cracking down on nationalists breathed life back into the new
Provisional IRA, which built up an arsenal and vowed never to be
caught unarmed again.
</P>
<P>
   But senior members of the republican movement recognize that the
political muscle that awaits in a power-sharing government eclipses
anything that 30 years of guerrilla war could achieve.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it took the IRA 30 years to kill some 300 members
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which it blames for imposing a
system slanted against Catholic nationalists; by ending its war,
the IRA can cut the need for more than half of the 13,000-member
force without firing a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of thinking that Adams, McGuinness and the rest
of the Sinn Fein leadership have been pushing on senior members of
the IRA, paving the way for turning in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Felons Club, Martin McNulty and other men who have
served prison sentences for IRA activity said they believe
unionists are using the weapons issue as an excuse for not sharing
power with Catholic nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want us back on our knees,'' said McNulty. ``The
nationalist people will never be back on their knees.''

HONG KONG TO CONTINUE TALKING TO DISNEY ABOUT BUILDING THEME PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Keeping its people in suspense, Hong Kong announced
Thursday that it would extend talks with Walt Disney Co. on
building a theme park here until the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Disney and Hong Kong confirmed that they were in
negotiations to build a park. It would be Disney's second theme
park in Asia, and would signify a major expansion of the company's
dealings with China, which regained sovereignty over this former
British colony two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While officials said they had made significant progress in the
talks, they were not in a position to sign an agreement by June 30
_ the date the government had hoped to have a definitive deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say there have been holdups,'' said Mike Rowse,
Hong Kong's commissioner of tourism and the chief negotiator with
Disney. ``But we're talking about hundreds of pages of documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowse declined to say what needed to be resolved. But he noted
that the two sides had to agree on many questions: the design of
the park, the surrounding roads and rail links, and the land
reclamation needed to build a park on a remote bay on Lantau
island, west of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   And that leaves out the most critical issue: How much would
Disney pay for the land? Newspaper reports here said it has
demanded the 430-acre site free of charge _ in addition to low-cost
loans, electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rowse said the extension was not a setback, he had been
pushing hard to complete a deal by June 30. One official involved
in the talks said that if Hong Kong missed that date, it would
delay the project a year. The reason is that the project requires
the endorsement of Hong Kong's legislature, which is about to go
into recess.
</P>
<P>
   The extension did not surprise some experts here, who have
watched Hong Kong's efforts to woo Disney with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult, complicated negotiation that involves
more people than just Disney and Hong Kong,'' said Ian K. Perkin,
chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Perkin said a deal would probably have to include a consortium
of local property developers. One developer, Sun Hung Kai
Properties, has been rumored to be in preliminary talks with
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Disney and Hong Kong would have to clear a deal
with the Chinese government. Several other Chinese cities _
including Shanghai and Hong Kong's neighbor, Zhuhai _ have
expressed interest in a Disney park. It is not certain that the
authorities in Beijing have decided to give Hong Kong preference.
</P>
<P>
   If officials here seem sensitive about a Disney deal, it is
because they have stoked public expectations. A Hong Kong
Disneyland has come to be regarded as an elixir for the depleted
economy. Announcing a deal with Disney Thursday would have carried
an extra dose of symbolism since this is the second anniversary of
Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
   To sustain the momentum of the talks, Rowse said the city's
government would submit a revised zoning plan for Lantau island,
which would turn it into a tourist center with a brand-name theme
park. It has shelved plans to build a container port on the site
where the park would go.
</P>
<P>
   With Hong Kong's economy showing signs of recovery, that could
be a costly trade-off. ``If there is a sudden surge in trade, and
traffic in the port picks up again, where are you going to put the
capacity?'' Perkin asked.

   Joe Camel for Adults? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people who brought you Joe Camel, eager to fend off
accusations of marketing to children, are now sponsoring
explorations of the art world's farthest frontiers. The line
between philanthropy and marketing, however, can be as hard to find
as the sites of some of the cultish events they underwrite.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, for example, the Camel brand was ubiquitous at an
art-and-fashion installation (don't ask) organized by the Creative
Time arts group inside the cool, eerie spaces of the Brooklyn
Bridge Anchorage on the Brooklyn side of the East River in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   A Camel logo was projected onto the floor and printed on
brochures and cocktail napkins. Signs announced that smoking was
allowed. A woman with a clipboard asked those entering whether they
were smokers; if so, she gave them T-shirts, note pads and
schedules of other events, all for answering a few questions about
their smoking habits and signing up for mailing and e-mail lists.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, R.J. Reynolds, through its Camel brand, has
backed events in four cities. ``This is about sponsoring innovative
artists, and it is also about marketing our product,'' said Carol
Crosslin, a Reynolds spokesman. In about 10 minutes, she noted at
least five times that the events were restricted to those 21 and
older.

   How to Corral an Expanding Tax &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The alternative minimum tax, enacted 30 years ago to make sure
that every rich person pays some income taxes, is increasingly a
burden on the middle class. But fixing it is easy, according to a
report by the staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on
Taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Years of inflation have so distorted the tax that taxpayers with
as little as $27,404 in adjusted gross income can be subject to the
AMT. this year, but that gets little play from Washington
politicians polishing their images as tax cutters.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, virtually no one making $75,000 to $100,000
paid the tax. But this year, the committee estimated, one in eight
AMT taxpayers will be in that income group. Some middle-class
taxpayers who are affected by the AMT will not get the full
$500-a-child tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   The fix? Index the tax for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If that is done now, the committee estimated, the 823,000
taxpayers who will pay the AMT this year will grow to just one
million in 2009, instead of the nine million projected otherwise.
If no changes are made, AMT revenues in 2009 will be $19.8 billion,
up from $3.6 billion this year. But if indexing is adopted now,
revenues will rise to only $5.9 billion.

THE GROWING ROSTER OF THE UNRETIRED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ariz.)   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1983, Jack and Elaine Wyman sold their advertising agency in
San Francisco and retired to Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 62 and she
was 57; they looked forward to relaxing after a lifetime of work.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months later, they were back in San Francisco, starting
a new ad agency from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We retired because we thought it was the thing to do,'' Wyman
said. ``But it wasn't for us. We were bored.''
</P>
<P>
   They're still going strong. In 1997, they moved the business
back to Scottsdale, a city they had always liked. Although they
still have a few advertising clients, their major interest has
shifted to writing and publishing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, they started Doer Publications to publish their first
book, ``Retired? Get Back in the Game!'' Their second book,
``Married ... in Business,'' is a guide for husbands and wives who
want to start a business together. They are now preparing to
publish books by other authors.
</P>
<P>
   Do they plan to retire a second time? ``No, never again,'' said
Wyman, who is now 77.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wyman, 73, added, ``We learned our lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Wymans have more in common with the baby
boomers than with their own generation. According to a 1998 survey
by AARP, 80 percent of boomers plan to keep working at least part
time after they retire. Only 12 percent of those over 65 who are
still working full time say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   A Social Security Administration survey on the issue _ based on
beneficiaries who retired between mid-1980 and mid-1981 _ was done
in the early 1990s by Dr. Howard Iams, a demographer with the
agency's research office. He found that only 10 percent of the
retired men and 8 percent of the women had returned to work after a
year of not working. If the AARP survey of boomers is even a
general indicator, however, those percentages could swell.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reasons for returning to work are boredom, as in
the case of the Wymans, and financial need.
</P>
<P>
   But those who are under 70 and collecting Social Security might
think twice: For every $3 that retirees between 65 and 70 earn
beyond $15,500 this year, their Social Security payments will be
cut by $1 _ essentially a penalty tax on working. The earnings cap
will rise to $17,000 next year and to $30,000 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Those retiring early _ between 62, the minimum age to receive
Social Security, and 65 _ lose $1 for every $2 they earn beyond
$9,600, until they reach 65. That cap is also scheduled to rise,
but not as fast; it is projected to be only $10,680 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Only people who are at least 70 are entitled to full benefits,
no matter how much they earn.
</P>
<P>
   For self-employed retirees, there is a greater burden,
regardless of age. They must pay not only the usual Social Security
taxes of 7.65 percent of net earnings, but also an equal percentage
as the employer's share, for a total of 15.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So those who work after retirement because they need the money,
especially if they are not enamored of their jobs, could wind up
with lower incomes and less satisfaction than they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   The Wymans, who love what they do, have never much worried about
any of this. ``I know people are concerned about taxes,'' Mrs.
Wyman said. ``But wouldn't you rather have the income that requires
you to pay the taxes than to not have it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Wyman added, ``it's important that you love what
you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who avoid the Wymans' mistake by never
retiring. They put off collecting Social Security until 70 and can
keep earning with no penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the former New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, now 74, spoke
at New York University's journalism school shortly before embarking
on yet another career _ as a television judge on ``The People's
Court.'' His talk was laced with comments on the virtue of work.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, packed into a crowded elevator with some of the
students and faculty, Koch continued to answer questions. ``When
are you going to retire?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never!'' Koch bellowed. ``It's a terrible idea. Don't ever do
it. You'll be sorry.''

CLINTON SAYS HE'D BE UNPERTURBED BY GORE CAMPAIGN CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Thursday promised to ``take no
offense'' if Vice President Al Gore begins criticizing Clinton's
decisions in the course of his campaign for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also acknowledged that if his wife, first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, decides to run for the Senate from New York, some
of their private disagreements over policy matters might become
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way democracy works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president, speaking at a joint news conference with visiting
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, promoted Gore as the more
qualified choice as his successor. And, while careful not to knock
Gore's Democratic challenger, former New Jersey Senator Bill
Bradley, Clinton did not praise him either, saying Bradley has not
told the American public what he would do if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   During some of his most expansive public comments to date on the
shape of the 2000 presidential race, Clinton took a swipe at Texas
Governor George W. Bush, who this week smashed all fund-raising
records by raising nearly $36.3 million in four months. In the
process, Bush left Gore supporters, who have Bradley nipping at
their fund-raising heels, worried. Bradley raised $11.5 million,
narrowly trailing Gore's $18.2 million for the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said if Bush opts out of accepting matching federal
funds for his campaign _ and the spending limits that go with that
money _ then he would be in lock step with a Republican Party that
is ``unanimously hostile'' to overhauling the campaign finance
system. ``They don't believe in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the American people are going to have to make up their
minds whether this is an important issue to them or not,'' Clinton
said. ``Money may be important, but ideas are even more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   On that score, he said Gore is ``as nearly as I can determine,
the only candidate of either party who has yet actually told the
American people what he would do if he got elected.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mubarak standing beside him as the two leaders pledged new
energy at reigniting peace efforts in the Middle East, Clinton was
relaxed and verbose when the questions turned to presidential
politics, clasping his hands and resting them atop the lectern and
crossing his feet.
</P>
<P>
   When an Egyptian reporter asked Clinton a question by referring
to ``so little time before the next American elections, which are
just around the corner,'' the president frowned and mouthed,
``seventeen months?'' indicating that he indeed was counting the
time before the November 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied recent news articles about tension between him
and Gore _ brought about by the vice president's efforts to
distance himself from the scandal-tarred president _ saying he was
``frankly bewildered by those reports.''
</P>
<P>
   After those articles appeared, aides to Clinton and Gore
directed their staffs to ``knock it off,'' with respect to talking
about problems with Gores's campaign or offering opinions about
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly do not know what the source of the stories are. But
they are not in my heart or my mind,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore formally announced his campaign for president two
weeks ago, he told Tennessee reporters that there had been many
occasions when he has disagreed with Clinton over the past 6 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Clinton said that if Gore ``disagrees with a decision
that I make as president during the next year and a half, then, of
course, he will have to say so. And I will take no offense at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he didn't ask Gore to become vice president so he
would always agree with him. ``It would be a dreary world, indeed,
if we all agreed on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``If my wife decides to run for senator from New
York, then some of the disagreements that we've had in the past
over decisions I've made as president'' may become relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he seemed to give Mrs. Clinton a chance to put some
distance between herself and his administration on Medicare policy,
acknowledging disagreements among some teaching hospitals in New
York, Massachusetts and California over proposed budget cuts. Those
hospitals and other health-care providers complained the cuts would
be too severe and make it difficult for them to maintain quality
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would encourage the senators from New York or anyone else
who's concerned about this to bring those concerns, bring the facts
to the table,'' Clinton said. He added: ``I do think that's a
legitimate issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he wasn't surprised that Bradley had raised a
respectable $11.5 million. And he denied that he was trying to get
in a dig at Bradley by mentioning his failure so far to outline his
vision as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said himself that he has not laid out his case for
being president and said that he wants to wait till the fall to do
it,'' Clinton said. ``I am not `digging' him. I have nothing bad to
say about him. That is a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say that Gore deserved credit for saying why he
wanted to be president and what he would do if elected.
</P>
<P>
   But, he was asked, is Bradley qualified to be president?
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people will have to decide who's qualified and
who's not,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a unabashed endorsement of Gore, he added, ``There is
nobody in the race who is running, or who could run, who has had as
much experience in as many different ways'' as Al Gore.

FLEETWOOD AMERICAN EAGLE: PROOF THAT YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH YOU

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4)

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIGHTON, Mich. _ When Americans take to the road, a lot of them
want a home away from home. Consider that recreational vehicles are
not just hot, they are sizzling like the burgers on the nation's
grills this holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, sales of these vehicles, including pop-up campers and
luxurious travel trailers, reached the highest level since 1978.
Within the segment, sales of motor homes _ those big, bus-like
modules designed specifically as living quarters on wheels _ had
their best year in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And studies of consumer trends suggest that RVs will grow more
popular as baby boomers age. Already, people in their 30s and 40s
are outnumbering senior citizens among buyers, according to the
Recreational Vehicle Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   After my one and only test drive of a motor home _ the
38-foot-long, $250,000 Fleetwood American Eagle, I understood the
attraction. A vehicle like this provides most of the creature
comforts of a suburban home even as one attempts to commune with
nature. But I found it much easier to enjoy my motor home when it
was parked safely rather than ominously on the move. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Eagle is a product of Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. of
Riverside, Calif., and is assembled in Decatur, Ind. When it
lumbered up in front of my house I was struck by its size.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was twice the length of the 2000 Ford Excursion,
which will supplant the Chevrolet Suburban as the longest
noncommerical vehicle on the road. And the American Eagle is nearly
nine feet wide _ broader than the Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot of space to accommodate all of the amenities of
this rolling road house.
</P>
<P>
   Though the floor space is only 350 square feet, it feels roomier
than most apartments I've lived in. And it was far more elegantly
decorated than my own suburban home. (Of course, it costs almost as
much as some four-bedroom Colonials in my neighborhood.)
</P>
<P>
   Belying motor homes' crushed-velvet, shag-rug stereotype, the
test vehicle was outfitted in warm beiges and browns accented with
splashes of green. Creamy leather sofas that convert into beds
lined both sides. The floor of the living room was covered with
plush carpet. The galley had marble tile; hardwood is optional. For
privacy, the windows had miniblinds; a drape pulled across the huge
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The cushy driver and passenger seats swiveled to make them part
of the living room. Between them, a 20-inch Sony television
electrically glided up from its wooden cabinet. Above, a Sony audio
system was stowed behind glass doors.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen had all the necessities of a luxury home: oven and
cooktop, microwave, double sink, side-by-side refrigerator with ice
maker, Corian countertops and a large pantry with slide-out baskets
and adjustable shelves.
</P>
<P>
   A two-seat breakfast nook unfolded into a table for five. And
speaking of expanding: Park the American Eagle on a flat area, push
a button and one wall extends out several inches to add interior
space.
</P>
<P>
   Black walnut cabinets, like an airliner's overhead bins, lined
the upper walls. A cedar wardrobe was built in near the bathroom,
which had a commode, sink and shower stall as well as a combined
washer-dryer. Air-conditioning and dual propane furnaces promised
year-round comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The king-size bed consumed most of the bedroom. In contrast to
the dark wood of the living room, the bedroom had whitewashed oak
cabinets. Depending on the furniture configuration one orders, the
American Eagle sleeps up to six people.
</P>
<P>
   Space was brilliantly used throughout the cabin, and no nook or
cranny was wasted. Huge, roll-out storage trays beneath the motor
home, like those on a Greyhound bus, accommodate coolers, bikes and
canoes.
</P>
<P>
   I gained even more respect for the Fleetwood's size when I slid
into the driver's seat. The large, flat steering wheel and hissing
air brakes reminded me of a school bus. Indeed, it is about that
large, and as the longest vehicle I have ever driven, the American
Eagle also was the trickiest to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Fleetwood was kind enough _ or smart enough _ to send a company
representative to give me some training. I hope that the people
buying these motor homes are getting some driver's ed as well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing various operations, from flushing the waste
holding tank to unrolling the outside awnings, my instructor
insisted that we go for a spin. It was no quick trip around the
block, despite the potent 8.3-liter, 325-horsepower diesel engine
(with an incredible 915 foot-pounds of torque) and six-speed
automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour-long practice session which included the basics of
cruising, parking and backing up, my teacher declared me ready to
hit the road. I was not so confident.
</P>
<P>
   I still crept along, never comfortable with the sensation of
this heavy vehicle swaying from side to side like a boat. Turning,
which requires meticulous care and long-term planning, was a
genuine adventure. I prayed that no cars would be at the stoplight
when I had to perform one of these sweeping maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   The large outside mirrors and rear-view camera (which displays
images on a TV screen where a rear-view mirror would ordinarily be,
and also transmits sound from outside) helps you keep tabs on your
surroundings. Still, a Volkswagen could easily get lost in the
blind spots. I shuddered at the thought of driving one of these if
I were two or three decades older, when I presumably would have
even less less peripheral vision.
</P>
<P>
   In possession of this latter-day Conestoga wagon, a trip to the
wilderness seemed in order. But first, a practice run to the gas
station. My 11-year-old daughter served as front-seat spotter,
making sure I didn't wipe out any mailboxes or gasoline pumps.
</P>
<P>
   A $50 diesel purchase did not appreciably move the needle on the
fuel gauge. The vehicle has a 150-gallon tank, a necessity since it
goes less than 10 miles on a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   With my two children, my neighbor and her two boys aboard, we
headed out at dusk to the Brighton State Recreation Area, where
officials had assured me there were spots large enough for this
motor home. An hour later, after a few wrong turns, it was
pitch-dark. Yet another wrong turn put us on a narrow, tree-lined
dirt path that proved to be a dead end. I had to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Near tears, I said, ``I can't do this.'' The children,
frightened by what I had gotten us into, were wailing. But my
neighbor, serving as calm, collected co-pilot, leaped out and
reassured me ``You can do this,'' her enthusiasm transmitted
through the rear vision system. She patiently guided me as I inched
forward and backward. And, yes, I did it _ what a sense of
accomplishment!
</P>
<P>
   We meandered through the campground in search of a spot that
looked large enough. None did, but we pulled into one anyway.
Campers huddled around bonfires, staring and shaking their heads.
No doubt they were muttering about my novice driving and about our
mobile mansion, ostentatiously out of place among their pup tents
and pop-up trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated tries, I couldn't pull close enough to the
electrical outlet and septic receptacle to hook up, so I gave up.
The holding tank would have to hold out, or public rest rooms would
suffice. We cranked up the generator, but the noise was so
embarrassingly loud that we shut it down quickly. We roughed it on
battery power.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we rumbled past the tents as people gawked, and
took the route home with the fewest turns. I was thrilled to pull
up to the curb at my house, leaving the American Eagle for a driver
to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   The rolling house on wheels provided all the first-class
comforts one could want, but for me, there is no place like home _
a home permanently anchored to a foundation. &QL;

PART TIME, FULL SPEED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)After being on maternity leave for six months, I
have returned to work half time for half pay _ in theory, at least.
My company, however, has something of a workaholic culture, and I
have two fears: first, that I will face pressure to work nearly the
full week despite the reduced salary and, second, that even after I
return full time in a few years, I will forever be on the Mommy
Track, with raises and promotions scarce. Any advice?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would love to tell you that in this age of two-career and
one-parent families, telecommuting and increased productivity, the
business world has mastered the issue of part-time and flexible
work. But that would be a lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of part-time workers who, in actuality,
work more than a 40-hour workweek,'' said Ellen Galinsky, president
of the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit group in Manhattan
that researches changes in the workplace and the family.
</P>
<P>
   The problem crops up even in companies with the best intentions,
said Jacqueline Church, a consultant with WFD, a human resources
firm in Boston. The cause, she said, is often that companies have
no idea how to evaluate performance: ``The boss says, `Well, that
person looks really busy and she works long hours, so she must be a
good employee.'''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to part-time workers, said Sara Horowitz,
executive director of Working Today, a Manhattan organization that
promotes flexible work arrangements, ``there is often the subtle
but present feeling of, `Is she pulling her weight?'''
</P>
<P>
   To combat misperception, talk to your supervisor about his _ and
your _ expectations. Focus on concrete goals, Ms. Horowitz said,
and define how you will be evaluated on them. If your boss and
colleagues have evidence that you are meeting these goals, they
won't fret so much about whether you are working 20 hours a week or
50.
</P>
<P>
   When talking with the boss, try to focus on the benefits of your
arrangement for the company, not just for you. ``You may even be
able to offer the company some sort of lessons in streamlining work
or reducing redundancies,'' Ms. Church said.
</P>
<P>
   You will need to work harder to stay in touch with co-workers.
``So much in life is about personal relationships you build up,''
Ms. Horowitz said. ``This is something you have to worry about. So
much of a promotion is dependent on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And look for ways to keep people informed of your achievements _
a particularly important point for women, since men are often
better at self-promotion. ``When you do something that makes a
contribution, let it be known that you are the one who did it,''
Ms. Galinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, balancing is likely to remain difficult after you
return full time. ``Once you have children, you want to be able to
have balance in your life,'' Ms. Horowitz said. And, in a company
that values workaholism, an unwillingness to work 70-hour weeks
could indeed keep you on the Mommy Track. It may be time, she said,
to start looking for more flexible employers. &QL;

HARRIS-LEWIS HINTS AT WILLINGNESS TO SETTLE MALPRACTICE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Donna Harris-Lewis said Thursday she is ``open'' to
the idea of settling the malpractice case against her late
husband's chief cardiologist, Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., but that a
settlement offer would have to be high enough to secure her
children's future and cover the cost of the just-completed trial.
</P>
<P>
   Any additional money, she said, would be donated to the Reggie
Lewis Foundation and to research the cardiac condition that killed
the Celtics star at age 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been cast as being greedy, but that isn't true,'' said
Harris-Lewis, who has accused Mudge and two other doctors of
failing to diagnose her husband's heart condition. ``I'm not
looking for anything for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for exactly how much she would be willing to settle for, she
said, ``I haven't thought about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis spoke with reporters in a series of back-to-back,
one-on-one, 30-minute interviews at the Boston hotel.
</P>
<P>
   There was a shrine-like aura to the rented hotel suite, stocked
with pastries and orange juice, where Harris-Lewis sat from morning
until late afternoon, facing the press corps that for the past week
has prodded her to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Resting on one easel was a color poster of her late husband, his
muscular physique rippling as he dribbled down the Boston Garden's
parquet floor. On another, an oversized black-and-white photo
showed the smiling couple in younger days.
</P>
<P>
   And seated in front of them was Harris-Lewis, wearing a
conservative beige suit and the same crucifix that hung around her
neck every day of the seven-week trial prompted by her husband's
death.
</P>
<P>
   The case ended in mistrial last week after a jury cleared two
doctors of malpractice but deadlocked on whether Mudge provided
negligent care.
</P>
<P>
   A deadlock resulted because some jurors ``didn't have the
courage'' to find Mudge negligent because they were ``worried about
not ruining his reputation,'' Harris-Lewis speculated.
</P>
<P>
   She rebutted speculation that the threat of a retrial is simply
a legal strategy meant to encourage an out-of-court settlement,
insisting that her vow to try the case again is ``not a ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis denied that Mudge ever told her and her husband
that he had reached two diagnoses _ one, the benign fainting
disorder he announced at a press conference, and the other, a more
serious heart arrythmia.
</P>
<P>
   Had the couple been told such news, she said, they would hardly
have been so jovial at the public event, where television cameras
captured the pair chatting happily and waving at friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie and I were there laughing and talking,'' Harris-Lewis
said. ``Do you think for one minute that if there was a chance he
had a life-threatening arrhythmia we would be laughing? There's no
way.''
</P>
<P>
   She also called Mudge's claim that Lewis confessed his cocaine
use to him two weeks before his death ``highly suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would Mudge be the one person Reggie would make this
confession to?'' she said. ``He had a mother who had a substance
problem, he had friends, he had family.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what had been accomplished by the trial, despite its
inconclusive outcome, Harris-Lewis said that ``the Reggie that we
all know and love remains that same person,'' a caring husband and
father, a talented athlete, a committed philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   What has yet to be achieved, she said, is ``the doctors taking
accountability and responsibility for Reggie's death.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, she added, is why she is willing to endure the mental
toll of returning to court: ``No emotional or psychological damage
could be worse than losing your husband.''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
(af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   But can they invest in the real world?'' That is the question
that uncharitable money managers use to dismiss successful
investment newsletter editors. After all, it is one thing to beat
the market on paper. It's quite another to do so when running a
mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of charity notwithstanding, the question is important;
many newsletter editors also run mutual funds. If successful
editors do not perform as well in the real world as they do on
paper, their strategies should be called into question.
</P>
<P>
   But if their real-world performances match those of their
newsletters, it means that their funds can be convenient vehicles
for investors who otherwise would have to assemble portfolios,
stock by stock, to match their gurus' picks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are many reasons to avoid the do-it-yourself
approach. First, the sheer length of some newsletters'
``recommended'' lists can be daunting: there are 100 stocks, for
example, on the ``buy'' list of the Value Line Investment Survey, a
top-performing newsletter. Even though it is possible to match a
newsletter's performances without buying every recommended stock,
many people would jump at the chance to invest in a mutual fund
that would do all the work for them _ if they could be assured of
the same return.
</P>
<P>
   The frequent changes in newsletter recommendations also pose a
difficulty for investors. Many editors update their advice between
issues, sometimes daily, by recording telephone messages that
subscribers must call in to hear. Few investors have the time or
the discipline to check all those updates _ even though doing so
could be rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   For those and other reasons, it is good news that, with only a
few notable exceptions, newsletter editors who manage funds do as
well in the real world as they do with their model portfolios _ or
even better.
</P>
<P>
   I was able to identify 20 mutual funds managed by newsletter
editors that use investment approaches with at least a family
resemblance to those recommended in the newsletters. Seven of the
funds have done better than the corresponding newsletter's
performance over the same period, as calculated by The Hulbert
Financial Digest, while 13 did worse.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence was greater than 10 percentage points a year in
only five cases, and in all but one of those five, the fund did
better than the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that does not mean that all funds managed by
newsletter editors beat the market. Many of them don't _ just as
many newsletters don't. Rather, the point is that the performances
of most of these editors' funds are in line with those of their
newsletters' model portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some of those funds lag behind the market may
reflect the difficulty faced by all advisers in sustaining good
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But what about funds whose performances are significantly
different from their newsletters' portfolios'? Consider the three
mutual funds managed by Michael Murphy, each of which has performed
much better than the model portfolios he maintains in his
newsletter, California Technology Stock Letter.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Hulbert Financial Digest, the model newsletter
portfolios lost 19.9 percent to 30.2 percent, annualized, from
early 1997 through May 31. By contrast, the annualized losses of
the funds have been in the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively poor performance of the model portfolios can be
traced to a large investment in late September 1998 in stock index
put options, which turned out to be hugely unprofitable. Murphy's
funds did not make the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy says he misstated the amount of recommended puts when he
recorded a phone message that subscribers called in to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Absent that particular trade, the performance of the model
portfolios in his letter would have been much closer to that of his
funds.
</P>
<P>
   (Because many funds managed by newsletter editors have less than
$30 million in assets, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher, they are not listed in the mutual fund tables
in The New York Times.)
</P>
<P>
   Another example of diverging performance is seen in some of the
funds managed by Louis Navellier. whose flagship newsletter is MPT
Review. One fund performed better than the newsletter, the other
three worse. That is because MPT Review covers a range of stock
sizes while each of Navellier's six domestic funds focuses on a
particular market capitalization category or investing style.
</P>
<P>
   His other newsletter, Louis Navellier's Blue Chip Growth Letter,
which focuses on large-cap stocks and combines growth and value
characteristics, returned 27 percent, annualized, from January 1998
through May 31 of this year _ landing between the performances of
his two large-cap funds, Navellier Large Cap Growth and Large Cap
Value, which returned 31.9 percent and 25 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The divergence in performance was relatively small in the
remainder of the cases I studied. And there are myriad factors to
explain the differences, like the necessity of managing cash flows
in an open-end mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Also, newsletter editors who manage funds have fiduciary
responsibilities to both their subscribers and their fund
shareholders, though in practice they have broad latitude in
deciding whether their fund acts before or after their newsletter
publishes a stock recommendation. Another consideration is mutual
fund expenses, which drag down returns.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, editors do not always buy the same stocks for their
funds that they recommend in their newsletters. Value Line's equity
funds are an example. While Value Line's flagship publication, the
Value Line Investment Survey, is one of the top long-term
newsletter performers, the mutual funds offered directly by Value
Line follow only loosely the service's stock-ranking system. On the
whole, the performances of the funds have trailed the newsletter's.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't the funds pay more attention to the ranking system?
One reason, said Samuel Eisenstadt, research chairman of Value
Line, is diversification, which sometimes requires owning stocks
that are not in the top ranking. Another is the potential market
impact if the funds acted immediately upon every change in the
stock rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the 100 Group 1 stocks have small market caps, and we
couldn't buy them without driving the market for them crazy,'' said
Eisenstadt, referring to the newsletter's top-ranked stocks. Stocks
that have recently joined Value Line's Group 1 would shoot up even
more than they already have, while downgraded stocks would suffer
even more.
</P>
<P>
   The underperformance of Value Line's funds, however, should not
make you doubt the real-world value of Value Line's ranking system.
Consider the performance of another Value Line mutual fund that is
available only through a variable annuity or other insurance
product.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Value Line Centurion fund, it can be bought only
through Guardian Investor Services. Its return is quite close to
what The Hulbert Financial Digest calculates for a portfolio that
invests in the 100 top-ranked Value Line stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The fund started in November 1983, and from the beginning of
1984 through May 31 of this year produced a 15.7 percent annualized
return, versus 14.3 percent for the ranking system itself and 16.9
percent for the Wilshire 5000.
</P>
<P>
   Given the difficulties in following a newsletter, and the only
modest outperformance they generally report, why not opt for the
convenience of a mutual fund? Concern about funds' market impact is
the primary reason. Yet this is a significant worry only when
investing in the smallest-cap stocks, where a fund's market impact
will be greatest.
</P>
<P>
   You might therefore want to follow Jim Collins's newsletter, OTC
Insight, with an annualized return of 23.7 percent from Oct. 31,
1992 through May 31, rather than invest in his Dominion Insight
Growth fund, which returned 16.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   How to decide if a newsletter editor's funds are right for you?
Assuming that the fund's performance is in line with the
newsletter's, your decision should be based on the newsletter's
entire record. That is because the letter will have a longer track
record than the fund. &QL;

COMPUTERS PASS Y2K CHALLENGE AT BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND HEATHER KAMINS AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- State-operated computers suffered a few glitches
Thursday as fiscal year 2000 got under way, but officials said they
remain comfortable with the progress of work to overcome the
software problem known as the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the new fiscal year in Massachusetts and 45 other
states was seen as a key test of progress in work to protect
against disruptions come Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the date change seemed to go unnoticed in most states and
many municipal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, information systems director Bill Hannon said city
computers worked without a hitch despite a new software package
that had just been installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fired it up at 8 a.m. and it's been fine,'' Hannon said.
Cambridge and Quincy city officials also reported smooth
operations, and errors seemed rare nationwide as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had any issues at all, that I know of,'' said Gloria
Timmer, executive director of the National Association of State
Budget Officers, which surveyed many members Thursday afternoon.
``It was a good sign'' that most state remediation plans are on
track, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Y2K problem relates to software applications that
use only the last two digits of each year to keep track of the
date. Left unrepaired, such programs might misinterpret the last
two digits of Jan. 1, 2000, and cause systems to malfunction or
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent that outcome, Massachusetts state agencies are
spending $103 million to upgrade programs. Mostly those efforts
prevented major problems Thursday, said Val Asbedian, an official
in the state's division of information technology who is monitoring
Y2K preparations.
</P>
<P>
   But exceptions were discovered at a state computing center in
Chelsea, Asbedian said. One application used to track legislative
action on a mainframe apparently misinterpreted the ``00'' of the
new fiscal year as a previous date. In a second case, Asbedian
said, a mainframe program wasn't able to allocate costs properly
because of the unfamiliar year.
</P>
<P>
   Asbedian said he couldn't provide more specific descriptions of
the problems, but said they were quickly spotted and repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The glitches were troublesome because they appeared in large
mainframe applications that had already been certified as
``Y2K-compliant,'' meaning they were already thought to be prepared
for the date change.
</P>
<P>
   But Asbedian said he was satisfied the two problems didn't
indicate broader weaknesses in the state's remediation work.

IN THE WILD FUND KINGDOM, ANYONE CAN WEAR A CROWN  
 FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In kindergartens these days, all the children are special.
You're special if you have blue eyes, but also if you have brown
eyes. You're special if you like cookies. You're even special if
you live in a house, although not any more special than if you live
in a car.
</P>
<P>
   The world of mutual funds is not so very different. Nowadays,
more and more funds are finding ways to trumpet their specialness.
Thanks in part to the proliferation of mutual fund categories and
rating services, more funds than ever can portray themselves as
excelling at something while keeping a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, Lipper Inc., which tracks mutual funds,
expanded from 8 to 14 the number of categories it uses to classify
funds. In doing so, it followed in the footsteps of Morningstar
Inc., another provider of mutual fund data, which scrapped its 36
fund ``objectives'' three years ago in favor of 50 fund
``categories.'' They include flavors like specialty technology,
high-yield bonds and small-capitalization value.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the moves eliminated some ambiguities. (Weren't all
funds, after all, interested in ``capital appreciation''? And how
did ``growth and income'' differ from ``equity income''?) And they
permitted fairer and more useful comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   But like the subdivision of baseball's National and American
Leagues into regional divisions, the better to produce more
champions and more playoff games, the subdivision of funds helps
players that need to show they're near the top of the heap _ by
simply providing more heaps.
</P>
<P>
   Categories aren't the only area where mutual fund information is
expanding. Ratings of funds abound, too, and seem to be growing in
direct, if not geometric, proportion to the number of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings are published not only by Lipper and Morningstar, but
also by Business Week and a host of other publications. Value Line,
which once confined itself to stocks, ranks funds these days, too,
as do a passel of newsletters, some of them focusing on single fund
families. Standard &AMP; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service once
jousted over bond ratings: now they do the same over funds.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a tendency to focus on ever shorter periods of
time: Some newspapers give prominent display to one-month, or even
one-week, returns.
</P>
<P>
   But does it really matter whether a fund is first in its class
in Grasping Magazine's rating of Southeast Asian mid-cap value
funds for the three-year period ended April 30?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. For all the sound and fury over who is No. 1 in
any year or any category, a growing body of discouraging evidence
suggests that it makes little difference.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that funds that outperform for a year or two
rarely maintain any lead over their peers. Most funds tend to
revert to the mean; hardly any consistently trump unmanaged index
funds over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Burton Malkiel, author of ``A Random Walk Down Wall Street'' and
an advocate of index investing, wrote recently that ``the fund
managers who beat the index in one period are unlikely to do so in
the next.'' Among other things, he noted that broad market indexes
regularly outperform about two-thirds of actively managed mutual
funds and that the the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, in particular,
beat 9 of 10 active managers over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To put this in stark perspective, he wrote, ``Over the past 30
years, a $10,000 investment in the index would have grown to
$311,000 (after expenses); in the average general equity fund, the
same investment would have grown to $171,950.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies confirm that obsessing over mutual fund
performance is largely a waste of time. One report, issued in March
by the Financial Research Corp. of Boston, found that from 1988 to
1998, the average performance of funds placing in the top 10
percent of their peer groups in one year almost invariably fell
back toward the middle the next year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' the study found, ``out of the 40 quarterly periods
measured, only once did the average performance of top-decile funds
place into the first quartile in the subsequent year.'' (That was
in the first quarter of 1991.)
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Research study also found that Morningstar's
closely watched five-star rating system didn't matter much either,
because there wasn't much difference in the subsequent performance
of funds awarded three, four or even five stars. The study's
conclusion: ``Past investment performance fails miserably as an
indicator of future performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study, by Christopher R. Blake, an associate professor
of finance at Fordham University's Graduate School of Business and
Matthew Morey, assistant professor of economics at Fordham, found
Morningstar ratings of equally dubious usefulness, except for funds
given one star. Such rock-bottom ratings, over several different
five-year periods, turned out to be reliable indicators that a fund
will continue to underperform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this research, several avenues of academic inquiry
remain unexplored. For instance, if all the money spent by
investors on fund information were invested in a low-cost index
fund, how much would it be worth after 10 years? Or 20? Or 30?
</P>
<P>
   And given the apparent futility of professional fund management,
how much would America's gross domestic product increase if all the
spending on active mutual fund management were diverted to more
productive ends? Just think of all the costs associated with
fund-switching, not to mention 800 numbers and Web sites,
record-keeping and postage.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by a patriotic impulse to safeguard our nation's
economic health, I decided to look into this question. Based on
average cost and fund asset data from the Investment Company
Institute, I calculated that Americans will spend about $60 billion
this year on mutual fund management fees, sales loads and other
charges. Assuming that $10 billion of this is well-spent (a
generous assumption, based on the performance of most funds), that
translates to $50 billion a year in waste, or more than half of 1
percent of GDP _ roughly the entire annual output of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some characteristics of funds do appear to have
value as indicators of future performance, although they are not
the factors many funds crow about. For example, the study by the
Financial Research Corp., which looked at 766 funds from the former
Lipper categories of Growth, Growth and Income, and Capital
Appreciation, found that size really is important.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, the study showed, stock funds with
smaller asset pools have outpaced their larger competitors by 0.8
percent annually. ``Portfolio size is indeed an effective screening
tool,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The same study also found that funds less than five years old
tended to turn in above-average performance and that those older
than 10 years turned in below-average returns. The authors suspect
that this is a corollary of the size issue, since newer funds tend
to be smaller.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, small funds tend to become large, perhaps in
part because of that very performance advantage. The small funds
that remain small tend to be the underperformers, which can't draw
much new money. But while strong performance brings in new assets,
the study found that ``top-selling funds deliver slightly
below-average performance downstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, all this makes me wonder why fund marketers don't trumpet
the ``world's tiniest mid-cap blend fund with a mediocre decile
record since its inception less than three months ago.'' Maybe they
should.

SPORTS COLUMN: GRAF SHOWING SHE'S NOT YET OVER THE HILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Germany)  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Conventional logic, and even John McEnroe's
convoluted brand, suggested that Steffi Graf was not going to have
enough fluidity in her muscles and fuel in the tank at the end of a
long, soggy day. She walked out onto Center Court, into the
gloaming, the sky offering only enough time to finish a set. But it
happened to be the third set with Venus Williams, 19, finely tuned,
long-limbed and ready to run.
</P>
<P>
   A tall order, even for Graf, McEnroe's ``tennis goddess'' and
mixed doubles partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, it was easier to suddenly get up and play,''
McEnroe had said, as the rain fell Thursday and Graf whiled away
another Wimbledon afternoon. ``As you get older, you have to keep
on revving up, do your stretching, figure out when to eat. I think
it affects the older guy more.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf, on the other hand, is obviously no old tennis guy and no
ordinary aging gal. Indisputably one of the greats in tennis
history, she gave us another demonstration of why she could, by
Sunday, join another elite club: the association of 30-year-old
Grand Slam champions. In the twilight, in a drizzle, she cranked up
the engine for the fourth time in seven hours, broke Williams'
serve and landed in her 10th Wimbledon semifinal with a 6-2, 3-6,
6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   She also insisted on keeping her mixed doubles date with
McEnroe, making no rare concession to age. ``No way,'' she said,
when asked if she would drop out.
</P>
<P>
   This persistent second-week rain has made life hard on everyone.
I heard it poured back home in New Jersey, but my rain is worse
than yours. When it rains at Wimbledon, there is nothing to do but
eat and feel old.
</P>
<P>
   They make you feel droopy around the eyes by showing classic
Wimbledon matches on BBC. As the tarps were being rolled on and off
and back on the various courts Thursday, Martina Navratilova was
trying to take the net against Chris Evert again in the 1978
women's final. If Graf wasn't reading and Williams watching her own
first-set rerun on another channel in the women's locker room,
these two might even have shared a few laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Wood racquets. Patty-cake serves. Soft ground strokes landing
three feet short of the baseline. I often brag about having covered
some of the great Chris-Martina wars, but I wouldn't share this
information with, say, Alexandra Stevenson, simply on the ground of
dating myself. And come to think of it, maybe Graf wouldn't have
found the old stuff so funny, either. I seem to recall sitting on
Center Court for Evert's last Wimbledon appearance, a 1989
semifinal against a stalwart young German whose forehand made sure
Chrissie had no doubts.
</P>
<P>
   From one era to another, the high quality of Thursday's match
was a tribute not only to the racquet technology but also to the
evolution of women's conditioning. After all the numbing starts and
stops, there were Graf and Williams in a tense third set, in severe
conditions, conducting a grass-court clinic. The moon ball, thank
goodness, is as dead as the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the many breaks that we had, I think it's unbelievable
tennis today,'' said Graf, and even Williams agreed it was the best
losing match she had played.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Boris Becker was of the opinion that the weather
disruptions had robbed him of his service timing. The three-set
defeat to Patrick Rafter sent Becker, at 31, home to look for the
perfect German sunset. Graf wasn't getting any younger waiting in
the locker room Thursday, having turned the Big Three-Oh on June
14, days after she unmade Martina Hingis' psyche and summer in the
French Open final.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. No matter how Graf has reinvented herself after numerous
ailments and setbacks, that doesn't officially qualify her for the
30-and-Over club. These memberships are becoming increasingly rare.
The last time a 30-plus woman won a Grand Slam was in 1990, when
Navratilova won here, at 33. Evert's last Grand Slam victory was in
1986, at 31, in Paris. Jana Novotna, 29 when she broke through here
last year, Thursday looked like a tennis geriatric in her
straight-set surrender to Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Lendl was 30 when he won the Australian Open in 1990, as
was Andres Gomez, who that year won the French. The oldest
modern-era player to win a Grand Slam? Ken Rosewall was 37 when he
won the Australian in 1972, which is encouraging news for Patrick
Ewing more than it is for the modern male tennis star.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked Graf about outslinging a young gun, she
laughed and said, ``You're really on about this age thing, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added: ``I don't think very often about age. The body
tells me sometimes, but otherwise I go out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   She made a startling play in the ninth game of the final set,
charging clear across the court to bend low and lift the perfect
lob over a 6-foot-1-inch opponent who was poised for a volley. Graf
didn't win that game, but within minutes the chair umpire was
saying, ``Time,'' and the remaining fans cheered and Steffi Graf
stood tall and served herself out of a seven-hour ordeal. Then more
rain began to fall, and the ``tennis goddess'' went home to bed.

 &HT;    S.C. sets referendum on video poker for Nov.
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Voters in South Carolina will decide Nov. 2 whether
the state should keep more than 30,000 licensed video poker
machines, derided by critics as the ``crack cocaine'' of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   If voters decide to keep video poker, new laws would tax the
license holders 25 percent on their gross profits. Last year, video
poker made a gross profit of $729 million on total sales of $2.5
billion, according to reports the industry made to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, video poker will die June 30 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, South Carolina makes $60 million off the games _ all
of that on license fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great we're finally recognized as a legitimate business,
legitimate enough to have regulations,'' said Fred Collins of
Greenville, whose company is a titan of the video gambling
industry. A recorded message for callers on hold tells potential
customers they can be instructed how to maximize ``every square
foot in your business.''
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous video poker machines are found in nearly every
convenience store, restaurant and bowling alley in the state.
Several operators run video malls dedicated exclusively to the
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entertainment,'' Collins said. ``They identify with the
video aspect of it. We grew up with television.''
</P>
<P>
   State legislators agreed on a ballot question in the wee hours
Thursday morning after the House had failed six times to pass the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue for gambling opponents is the daily payout. Current
law limits players to $125 a day per gambling session. The lower
the payout, the lower the temptation to play for long stretches,
opponents argue.
</P>
<P>
   But the law is ``widely'' flouted, said Frank Quinn, a Columbia
doctor who testified on the effects on video gambling before the
federally funded National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Two
players, he said, played every day for almost a month, pumping in
$20 a hand and hit a $22,000 jackpot. Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat
whose fall campaign received millions from the gambling industry,
vowed to reform what he called a ``video poker mess.''
</P>
<P>
   If residents vote to continue video poker, the limit would rise
to $500, which opponents said was tantamount to deregulation.
Hodges, among others, said the $125 ceiling was unenforceable. The
referendum would require license holders to plug their machines in
to state monitoring systems, which would check for violators.
Republicans considered the measure to be deregulatory but, despite
a slim majority in the House, couldn't block the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get it and this is the next best thing,'' said
Speaker David Wilkins, a Greenville Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, whose business generates more than $100 million a year
in video poker income, said the taxes threaten license holders. He
said people doing a marginal business with the machines already are
moving on to other things.
</P>
<P>
   An average machine generates $25,000 in gross profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that are against video poker are primarily the
politicians and the print media,'' Collins said. ``The general
public could care less. They say let me spend my dollars on
entertainment the way I choose, don't tell me what's good for me.

TELLING THEM WHAT THEY'LL PAY TO HEAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I once knew a woman who couldn't seem to get her career off the
ground. Her personal finances were a shambles, and she had little
experience in the world of business. Naturally, she became a
management consultant.
</P>
<P>
   It crossed my mind to short the stock of any companies she
visited, but I was afraid I'd get in trouble with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   We live in paradoxical times. Executive compensation is
spiraling out of control, yet the more companies pay their chief
executives, the more help they seem to need with basic questions
like ``What business are we in?'' and ``Where do we go from here?''
</P>
<P>
   Companies appear to be equally at sea about how to organize
themselves _ hardly surprising, given that so many of their workers
seem to produce nothing tangible.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is an army of management consultants, ready to feed
what The Wall Street Journal recently called ``the business world's
seemingly insatiable desire to engage in organizational
self-analysis.'' Kennedy Information Research Group, which tracks
management consulting, says the global market grew 22 percent last
year, to $89 billion, three-fifths of it in the United States; in
1980, the figure was just $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry, if you'll pardon the expression, isn't sitting
on its laurels. ``Management consulting continues to hunt for the
`next big idea,''' says a report on Kennedy's Web site.
``Re-engineering has faded, replaced by ERP integration, Knowledge
Management, EVA and supply chain work.'' Don't ask _ by the time
you figure out any of these fads, they'll be over.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to be a spoilsport. Hiring a consultant makes sense
for many specialized tasks, from writing an annual report to
designing a parking lot. But why do so many companies need
outsiders to tell them how to run their businesses? It's as if top
management, which lives in the same therapy-crazed culture as the
rest of us, has decided that it must pay someone in a nice suit to
nod sagely and tell it what it already knows, because it has
trouble hearing the same message from anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 70,000 management consultants in the United
States, and about 150,000 executives at sizable companies in the
kinds of jobs that would bring them into contact with consultants.
That comes to just over two consulters for each consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures come from a paper by Staffan Canback, himself a
consultant, published last year in The Journal of Management
Consulting. ``The tremendous growth of the management consulting
industry over the last 20 years cannot be easily explained,''
Canback wrote. But he has a theory: The complexity of business
today leads to high ``costs associated with organizing economic
activity,'' as he puts it, accounting for as much as 45 percent of
gross domestic product in developed societies, according to one
estimate he cited. Controlling these costs devours management
attention and generates demand for consultants.
</P>
<P>
   But what good is done by paying millions to a chief executive
who then turns for help to a bunch of wet-behind-the-ears MBAs?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hardest to justify are the executive compensation
consultants, some of whom are said to charge $750 an hour. Graef S.
Crystal, a critic of excessive executive pay and a sometime
consultant himself, thinks compensation consultants may be best of
breed when it comes to getting paid for smoke and mirrors, since
they invariably recommend raises for the executives whose
compensation they are hired to assess.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, consultants who flog ``organizational
development'' are a bargain, offering services that, if no more
useful, at least cost less. The thirst for their services seems
impossible to slake. Crystal cites a remark by Eugene Zuckert, a
former secretary of the Air Force: ``The perfect organization is
the one you don't now have.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes' surfing of the Web, I found a consulting firm
that says its strength is ``analyzing and re-engineering the
Emotional Economics of our clients' workplaces.'' Another ``offers
programs and services in organizational change and development,
facilitation, strategic planning and leadership training.'' The
sites don't say what these firms charge, but I can't imagine
they're cheap at any price.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, all societies pay dearly for their shamans. Why
should the world of business be any different? &QL;

 &HT;    Power to video poker machines cut off in Louisiana
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONZALES, La. _ At one minute before midnight Wednesday, Eula
Ordoyne was punching the plastic buttons of a video poker machine
at the Cajun Circus Casino, a truck stop east of Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   At one minute after midnight, she was staring at a black screen
where a message glowed in green letters: ``Temporarily out of
order: $0.00.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing temporary about the machine's shutdown.
More than 4,800 of Louisiana's 15,000 video poker machines went
dark and became illegal just after midnight Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 local elections, 33 of the state's 64 parishes voted to
outlaw video poker as of July 1, 1999. Despite numerous court
battles that stretched into Wednesday afternoon, the machines are
illegal in a patchwork of parishes around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling opponents are claiming a small victory. This is
believed to be the first time since legal gambling spread from Las
Vegas that any community has kicked it out once it became
entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy they are turned off,'' said C.B. Forgotston, a New
Orleans attorney and a vocal gambling opponent. ``I would be much
happier if we had voted out poker in the entire state. But this is
a victory of historic proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   For regular customers and employees at the soon-to-be-closed
truck stop casinos, it was a somber night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' Ordoyne said. ``I come here two or three times a
week. I like the atmosphere, and I've won quite a bit. I've lost
more than I've won, but the odds are better here than in some
places. But I'll just go to another parish and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cajun Circus Casino _ a smoky room with 50 machines and a bar _
had a party for its regulars, with jambalaya and free drinks.
Employees hugged each other and said goodbye to favorite customers.
</P>
<P>
   The machines went dead despite several lawsuits and appeals to
the Legislature to keep the games going. Local governments, fearing
the loss of revenue, asked the Legislature for a new vote, but were
denied. The video poker industry went to court arguing that the
1996 vote was unfair because the Legislature barred the industry
from pooling resources to campaign. That law was struck down by the
state Supreme Court, but only 17 days before the election. The
industry says there was not enough time to mount a successful
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No court would agree to stop the scheduled shut-off of the
machines, but state judges have agreed to hold hearings on the
claims in two lawsuits. One hearing is set for today. The U.S.
Supreme Court will decide in October whether to hear arguments in
yet another suit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, places like Cajun Circus must close. ``We put nine
people out of a job tonight,'' said Andrew Flood, director of
gaming for Silver Bear, which owns Cajun Circus and two other truck
stop video poker outlets. As of Thursday, only one of the three
remained open. ``And Ascension Parish is losing $1.4 million in
revenue from gaming here. This was important to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The machines remain legal in 31 parishes, including much of the
New Orleans metro area. Voters elected to keep the large riverboat
casinos in Baton Rouge, Lake Charles, Shreveport and outside New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Marcus, a supervisor at Cajun Circus, said she will move
to Port Allen, about 30 minutes away, to work at the remaining
Silver Bear casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here almost 10 years,'' she said. ``I have kids in
school here, but it's just too far a drive. We have to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The gamblers are losing one of their favorite hangouts. One
couple met and eventually got married in the casino, Flood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big disappointment,'' said Pete Weidlein, a traveling
salesman who stops here when he's in the area. He smoked a cigar
and greeted some friends as they walked to the bar. ``We still have
Indian casinos, riverboat casinos, and the lottery, but now many of
our local places are gone. This is where people meet and see each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   To gambling opponents, however, video poker is one of the more
insidious forms of gambling. Where they are legal, the machines are
everywhere, from truck stops to convenience stores, bars and
restaurants. In New Orleans, most people are within walking
distance of a video poker machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the crack cocaine of gambling,'' Forgotston said. ``It is
so pervasive and so readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wednesday turned to Thursday, there were only a few
gamblers left inside Cajun Circus. Flood took a microphone and bid
farewell.
</P>
<P>
   A minute after midnight, the Louisiana State Police, using a
computer program in Baton Rouge, shut off 4,847 machines statewide.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't know when to fold 'em and walk away, a
ticket was issued so they could collect any earnings won before the
machines cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boom, that's it,'' Flood said with a sigh. ``It's as
anticlimactic as that.

INDIA DENIES IT IS IN TALKS WITH PAKISTAN ON KASHMIR CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ India is not involved in ``any negotiations''
and ``not even consultations'' with Pakistan, said Indian External
Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh on Thursday, rebutting speculation
in both nations that behind-the-scenes diplomacy was under way to
end the violent crisis in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Such speculation gained credence in the news media after former
Pakistani Foreign Minister Niaz Naik went to New Delhi on Sunday
and met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to Islamabad, Naik said his visit had been a
private one, but then he spoke in the manner of an envoy in a
Tuesday interview on a BBC radio program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that a deal is in the offing, but efforts are
being made in that direction,'' he said, referring to measures that
might end the fighting between Indian troops and about 700 invaders
who have crossed the so-called Line of Control into India's side of
Kashmir. Those soldiers are holed up in bunkers well-concealed in
the rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   India asserts the interlopers are mostly Pakistani army regulars
aided by Islamic militants. Pakistan denies any part in the
incursion.
</P>
<P>
   During the radio program, Naik grew increasingly specific,
saying that he and Vajpayee had discussed having the two nations'
directors of military operations ``prepare a schedule of a
so-called withdrawal, the timing, and the methodology, et cetera,
and once that's done, if the two prime ministers can agree with the
time frame, the whole thing can be wrapped up as early as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, in an interview, said Naik's comments amounted to little
more than wishful thinking, that the former official had ``gone
back and given a certain interpretation of what he hopes, what he
wishes to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far as India is concerned, its position has been explicit:
the present escalation has been caused by armed intruders mounting
aggression from north of the Line of Control and the easiest way to
de-escalate it is for Pakistan to pull back the intruders,'' Singh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if some understanding could ever be reached about a
scheduled withdrawal, he answered, ``No understanding is required
about pulling back to where you have come from.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani response to any suggestion of an orchestrated
pullout has been equally acid. ``Withdraw from where?'' Zameer
Akram, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks of Singh, who is the guiding hand in India's foreign
policy, seem to indicate that seven weeks of intense fighting and,
by Thursday's count, 207 dead Indian soldiers have not brought New
Delhi toward any mood for conciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Indian battalions continue to launch painstaking attacks up the
forbidding mountains in efforts to wrest the invaders from places
whose names have in a short time become part of the nation's
vernacular: Tiger Hills, Tololing, Three Pimples.
</P>
<P>
   To date, India has kept its forces from crossing the Line of
Control, an act of restraint that has been applauded by the United
States and other nations, many of which have been open in blaming
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   These reins ``place us under grave military and tactical
handicaps,'' Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, too, has been eager to win international support
during the crisis. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif returned
from China late Wednesday after ``very productive'' meetings,
according to Pakistani Foreign Minister Shamshad Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
   However productive the sessions, a statement released Thursday
by China's Foreign Ministry pointedly refused to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely hope that both India and Pakistan can earnestly
respect the Line of Control in Kashmir, resume negotiations as soon
as possible and seek a fair and reasonable settlement of all their
differences,'' it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors and psychologists are bracing themselves for a rise in
millennium-related mental breakdowns as they report the number of
patients suffering from stress, panic attacks and depression linked
to the arrival of the year 2000 has doubled in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   They predict the figure will continue to rise as the condition,
described as ``Pre-Millennial Tension,'' becomes more acute as Dec.
31, 1999 approaches, with the danger of increased suicide rates and
family distress.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of technological chaos caused by the millennium bug _ the
danger that some computer programs, especially older ones, might
fail when the date changes to 2000 _ and religious associations of
the year 2000 with an apocalyptic event are the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalist Christians, for whom the apocalypse is a firmly
entrenched belief, and members of extreme cults are most at risk,
but secular people are also suffering severe depression and anxiety
because of the warnings of possible technological collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome is confined mostly to the Christian world; for
Jews, Muslims, Hindus and other faiths the year 2000 has no
significance.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are acute in countries with mass associations of
strict religious groups, such as the United States and countries
subject to rapid social change, such as Russia and other Eastern
European nations.
</P>
<P>
   China is thought to have some 200 million evangelical Christians
while the Venezuelan government is talking to psychologists and
psychiatrists about the millennium bug ``in order to know how to
reach people in the right manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Cults and extreme religious sects have been predicting an
apocalyptic conclusion to the 20th century for some time. In 1993,
Branch Davidian leader David Koresh was killed together with 80
followers in a shoot-out at Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another 12 people were killed when the doomsday cult Aum Shinri
Kyo launched a sarin nerve-gas attack in Tokyo in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems occurred 1,000 years ago, with debates within
Christian and druid circles about whether the world would come to
an end either on or around the 1,000th anniversary of Christ's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if something isn't really going to happen,''
said Martyn Shrewsbury, a British psychotherapist who has seen the
number of clients suffering from Pre-Millennial Tension double
since Christmas. ``If enough people really do believe it's true
then they'll act as if it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrewsbury receives up to 25 calls a week and treats 10 patients
a month. Some are from members of strict religious sects brought up
with a firm belief in judgement day, but many are people with no
religious leanings who have ``difficulty'' coping with the concept
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts an increase in suicides and greater domestic tension
within families before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the religious groups, and others, all the ingredients are
here right now,'' he said. ``There have been predictions of
business failures attributable to the millennium bug. We've heard
that health authorities and the police are cancelling all leave for
the period. If you are vulnerable and stressed then all these
things happening together may push you over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural implications of the date 2000 may worry otherwise
rational people, said Shrewsbury. ``It's a date that has always

<P>
   Doctors and psychologists are bracing themselves for a rise in
millennium-related mental breakdowns as they report the number of
patients suffering from stress, panic attacks and depression linked
to the arrival of the year 2000 has doubled in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   They predict the figure will continue to rise as the condition,
described as ``Pre-Millennial Tension,'' becomes more acute as Dec.
31, 1999 approaches, with the danger of increased suicide rates and
family distress.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of technological chaos caused by the millennium bug _ the
danger that some computer programs, especially older ones, might
fail when the date changes to 2000 _ and religious associations of
the year 2000 with an apocalyptic event are the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalist Christians, for whom the apocalypse is a firmly
entrenched belief, and members of extreme cults are most at risk,
but secular people are also suffering severe depression and anxiety
because of the warnings of possible technological collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome is confined mostly to the Christian world; for
Jews, Muslims, Hindus and other faiths the year 2000 has no
significance.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are acute in countries with mass associations of
strict religious groups, such as the United States and countries
subject to rapid social change, such as Russia and other Eastern
European nations.
</P>
<P>
   China is thought to have some 200 million evangelical Christians
while the Venezuelan government is talking to psychologists and
psychiatrists about the millennium bug ``in order to know how to
reach people in the right manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Cults and extreme religious sects have been predicting an
apocalyptic conclusion to the 20th century for some time. In 1993,
Branch Davidian leader David Koresh was killed together with 80
followers in a shoot-out at Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another 12 people were killed when the doomsday cult Aum Shinri
Kyo launched a sarin nerve-gas attack in Tokyo in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems occurred 1,000 years ago, with debates within
Christian and druid circles about whether the world would come to
an end either on or around the 1,000th anniversary of Christ's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if something isn't really going to happen,''
said Martyn Shrewsbury, a British psychotherapist who has seen the
number of clients suffering from Pre-Millennial Tension double
since Christmas. ``If enough people really do believe it's true
then they'll act as if it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrewsbury receives up to 25 calls a week and treats 10 patients
a month. Some are from members of strict religious sects brought up
with a firm belief in judgement day, but many are people with no
religious leanings who have ``difficulty'' coping with the concept
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts an increase in suicides and greater domestic tension
within families before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the religious groups, and others, all the ingredients are
here right now,'' he said. ``There have been predictions of
business failures attributable to the millennium bug. We've heard
that health authorities and the police are cancelling all leave for
the period. If you are vulnerable and stressed then all these
things happening together may push you over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural implications of the date 2000 may worry otherwise
rational people, said Shrewsbury. ``It's a date that has always
fascinated everyone. We worry that underneath it all that if the
technology goes up in 2000 we'll have to go back to being cavemen
and cavewomen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jehovah's Witnesses _ formed in the expectation that the end
of the world was due in 1914 _ appear to be unfazed by the
impending millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe the world system will come to an end but not
necessarily in the year 2000. Jehovah's Witness businessmen are
probably worried about their computers crashing,'' said a spokesman
for the sect. &QL;

<P>
   The Disney animated film `Tarzan' is at the top of the American
box-office charts, but you would hardly know it in the small town
of Tarzana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As the name strongly suggests, this modest community on the
western edge of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles is where the
legendary ape-man sprang from the imagination of his creator, Edgar
Rice Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   So successful were the original Tarzan novels that they inspired
Burroughs to rename his property Tarzana Ranch and, in due course,
prompted the town to take the same name. But that is where all
local identification with the jungle hero stops.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Johnny Weissmueller look-alike statues, much less
any memorials to Edgar Rice Burroughs himself. And now that the
Disney movie is out, there is no tie-in merchandise in the stores
and not so much as a banner proclaiming Tarzana to be the film's
spiritual home.
</P>
<P>
   Even the local multiplex cinema is spurning the opportunity to
cash in on a splash of local color, advertising the film with no
more fanfare than its sister cinemas in Hollywood, or Westwood, or
Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple, if ugly truth behind this curious reluctance
to jump on the great American marketing bandwagon: Tarzana has
never been much fond of old Tarzan, and the feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   This was a town conceived and developed by hard-nosed real
estate speculators, one that remains far more attached to the
niceties of property values and middle-class living than to the
romance of a connection to the literary jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzana _ or Runnymede, as it was originally called _ was part
of the great land scam on which modern Los Angeles is based.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor of the Los Angeles Times newspaper, General
Harrison Gray Otis, bought it on the cheap when it was still
pristine farmland, in the second decade of the century.
</P>
<P>
   He then sold it at a massive profit after the city fathers had
successfully stolen enough water from central California to develop
it as a residential suburb.
</P>
<P>
   It was General Otis's ranch that Burroughs bought in the early
1920s as he moved west from his native Chicago. He too had a sharp
business sense, making sure his literary creations were not just
copyrighted but trademarked too _ meaning that they would belong to
his estate in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   Whether through jealousy or personal friction, the townsfolk
never paid Burroughs another compliment after renaming their
community in his honor in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   The public library banned his books, with the excuse that Tarzan
and Jane indulged in immoral premarital acts in the jungle. As late
as the 1960s, the local council refused to countenance a Tarzan
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the trademark, Tarzana has been essentially powerless
to exploit the jungle theme without either having to pay large
royalties to the Burroughs estate or else risk being sued.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the town has preferred to do nothing at all except
put up a lame little display in the local post office that greets
queuing customers at knee-level and passes most of them by
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   While Burroughs' grandson, Danton Burroughs, still lives in town
selling the rights to Tarzan products around the world, he has
never made a dime from his own community.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzana has grown into the most generic of suburban communities,
a drab patchwork of cheap box-style architecture and chain-store
outlets _ about as far from Lord Greystoke's jungle as is
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who want to change all that. The Tarzana
Chamber of Commerce has now expressed interest in plugging the
connection more effectively, if only to pull in some tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of the Disney film has added further
complications, since the Tarzan name has been taken over _ for the
duration of the animated feature's theatrical life, at least _ by a
mouse with remarkably large ears.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone rash enough to sport a Tarzan bumper sticker risks being
sued at least once. The local gift stores do not enjoy a commercial
relationship with Disney so they are completely out of the loop.
Only McDonald's sports Tarzan posters, and that is because of a
marketing deal made at national, not local, level.
</P>
<P>
   The only business brave enough to make the connection is
Greystoke Furniture on Ventura Blvd. ``You have to embrace the
kitschiness,'' enthuses the manager, Lorenda Starfelt. ``I'd like
to have vines hanging above the entrance way and Tarzan yells
echoing down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, this being Tarzana, she isn't allowed to. &QL;

<P>
   GREENWICH, CONN. _ America has an awful lot of shoreline,
enough, you would imagine, to give everyone a spot to plonk down
their deck chair and crack open the Igloo cooler on hot summers
days like these.
</P>
<P>
   You would be wrong. Nearly every oceanside state _ Oregon is the
loan exception _ allows private homes, associations and indeed
whole towns to section off beaches and headlands for the exclusive
use of residents and locals.
</P>
<P>
   One place more than any other has grown infamous for this
less-than-democratic practice and it happens to be the one in which
we live.
</P>
<P>
   It is Greenwich, Conn., a place that has perfected the art of
repelling the unwashed masses. (New York City is awfully near.)
</P>
<P>
   I remember the first week we arrived, setting out for a run in
the direction of the ocean in search of a seaside route. I never
got near the water. Every roadway was blocked by security posts and
barriers declaring ``Private, Residents Only.''
</P>
<P>
   I was angered then, but nowadays my feelings about such
obstacles are more mixed. The reason is simple and inexcusable: it
is called Greenwich Point, a beautiful finger of land that curls
out into Long Island Sound that only Greenwich inhabitants are
allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a 147-acre park with tranquil walks, a stunning view of
Manhattan 35 miles away and, best of all, a fine stretch of gently
sloping beach.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course we want it all for ourselves. And so, every
spring, we follow the town's instructions and apply for our little
beige beach passes.
</P>
<P>
   For $16 a season ($5 for children), the pass gives us access not
just to Greenwich Point but also on to the ferry that scoots out
twice an hour in high summer to the small island that belongs to
the town way out in the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   It too has a beach, an even better view of the city, soothing
breezes and, best of all, a grand little bar with draft beer and a
well-stocked jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   These passes, you will begin to understand, are somewhat
precious. True, we are allowed to take guests, as colleagues from
several rival British titles discovered to their pleasure (I hope)
when we barbecued lunch and sipped Buds on the island recently.
</P>
<P>
   But if your address is not in Greenwich and you have no friends
here to accompany you, you can forget about trying to share in such
sandy delights.
</P>
<P>
   It nonetheless came as a shock recently to read that our
inestimable police department had resorted to entrapping folk who
were attempting _ God forgive them _ to buy passes on the black
market.
</P>
<P>
   A black market in beach passes? Are you serious? Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   The sting was set in motion when an enterprising local of the
neighboring town of Stamford named Victor Consoli placed an ad in
the classifieds of our town newspaper, the Greenwich Time.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was a solicitation for beach passes ``for prof'l Stamford
cpl w/child. $100 + expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Consoli was quickly treated with a reply and invited to meet the
would-be vendor at our local McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   How was he to know that some Greenwich busybody had spotted his
ad and alerted the police or that the man who met him with a smile
and a handshake in the restaurant was actually an undercover cop?
</P>
<P>
   He duly handed over the $100 and then he got his surprise.
``That's when I advised him I was, in fact, a police officer,'' our
plainclothes hero later told the Time. ``He was more disappointed
that anything else. Disappointed and shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Consoli was also slapped with a $60 fine. His crime? Violating
some town ordinance that bars anyone who is not a town resident
from acquiring or possessing a beach pass.
</P>
<P>
   Consoli has not been answering his phone. Maybe he should.
Surely there is some Greenwich beach-lover with the heart to invite
him and his wife and child to tag along with them to the Point from
time to time? Perhaps I should be that person. (I do have a guilty
conscious about all this, honest.) &QL;

   While we are talking beaches, tourists on the Outer Banks of
North Carolina have been flocking to watch an engineering feat in
motion. Actually, it is the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse that is in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Painted with a barbershop black spiral, the 4,800-ton, 208-foot
tower is the largest and most beloved of all of America's aging
lighthouses. Wave erosion has left it precariously close to a
watery demise, however, and earlier this month, the National Park
Service began the delicate task of moving it half a mile inland.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all is well. Elevated onto wheels and a giant rail
track, it is being nudged away from the surf by hydraulic pistons
at the rate of about 70 feet a day. And the moving crew is
confident that by late summer, the lighthouse will be happily
bedded down on its new site.
</P>
<P>
   Big structures have been moved before, after all. Didn't that
large bridge I saw recently from an airplane window down in the
Arizona desert once span a river called the Thames?

   GREENWICH, CONN. _ America has an awful lot of shoreline,
enough, you would imagine, to give everyone a spot to plonk down
their deck chair and crack open the Igloo cooler on hot summers
days like these.
</P>
<P>
   You would be wrong. Nearly every oceanside state _ Oregon is the
loan exception _ allows private homes, associations and indeed
whole towns to section off beaches and headlands for the exclusive
use of residents and locals.
</P>
<P>
   One place more than any other has grown infamous for this
less-than-democratic practice and it happens to be the one in which
we live.
</P>
<P>
   It is Greenwich, Conn., a place that has perfected the art of
repelling the unwashed masses. (New York City is awfully near.)
</P>
<P>
   I remember the first week we arrived, setting out for a run in
the direction of the ocean in search of a seaside route. I never
got near the water. Every roadway was blocked by security posts and
barriers declaring ``Private, Residents Only.''
</P>
<P>
   I was angered then, but nowadays my feelings about such
obstacles are more mixed. The reason is simple and inexcusable: it
is called Greenwich Point, a beautiful finger of land that curls
out into Long Island Sound that only Greenwich inhabitants are
allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a 147-acre park with tranquil walks, a stunning view of
Manhattan 35 miles away and, best of all, a fine stretch of gently
sloping beach.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course we want it all for ourselves. And so, every
spring, we follow the town's instructions and apply for our little
beige beach passes.
</P>
<P>
   For $16 a season ($5 for children), the pass gives us access not
just to Greenwich Point but also on to the ferry that scoots out
twice an hour in high summer to the small island that belongs to
the town way out in the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   It too has a beach, an even better view of the city, soothing
breezes and, best of all, a grand little bar with draft beer and a
well-stocked jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   These passes, you will begin to understand, are somewhat
precious. True, we are allowed to take guests, as colleagues from
several rival British titles discovered to their pleasure (I hope)
when we barbecued lunch and sipped Buds on the island recently.
</P>
<P>
   But if your address is not in Greenwich and you have no friends
here to accompany you, you can forget about trying to share in such
sandy delights.
</P>
<P>
   It nonetheless came as a shock recently to read that our
inestimable police department had resorted to entrapping folk who
were attempting _ God forgive them _ to buy passes on the black
market.
</P>
<P>
   A black market in beach passes? Are you serious? Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   The sting was set in motion when an enterprising local of the
neighboring town of Stamford named Victor Consoli placed an ad in
the classifieds of our town newspaper, the Greenwich Time.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was a solicitation for beach passes ``for prof'l Stamford
cpl w/child. $100 + expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Consoli was quickly treated with a reply and invited to meet the
would-be vendor at our local McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   How was he to know that some Greenwich busybody had spotted his
ad and alerted the police or that the man who met him with a smile
and a handshake in the restaurant was actually an undercover cop?
</P>
<P>
   He duly handed over the $100 and then he got his surprise.
``That's when I advised him I was, in fact, a police officer,'' our
plainclothes hero later told the Time. ``He was more disappointed
that anything else. Disappointed and shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Consoli was also slapped with a $60 fine. His crime? Violating
some town ordinance that bars anyone who is not a town resident
from acquiring or possessing a beach pass.
</P>
<P>
   Consoli has not been answering his phone. Maybe he should.
Surely there is some Greenwich beach-lover with the heart to invite
him and his wife and child to tag along with them to the Point from
time to time? Perhaps I should be that person. (I do have a guilty
conscious about all this, honest.) &QL;

<P>
   AT THE SHINGO RIVER, Pakistan _ The Pakistani and Indian
soldiers eye each other warily from observation posts on jagged
Himalayan mountain ridges that scratch across the soft blue sky
like an electrocardiogram.
</P>
<P>
   They are arrayed on either side of the so-called Line of Control
that divides the Pakistani- and Indian-held portions of the
disputed territory of Kashmir. For almost two months now, they have
been engaged in an ever-intensifying exchange of ear-splitting
artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   They occupy one battleground in the armed conflict that has
embroiled these most hostile of neighbors since India accused
Pakistan of sneaking into Indian territory and occupying some of
the majestic peaks that tower over a crucial military supply line
just a few miles from here.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani and Indian soldiers are so close that they can
shout to each other across the dry stream bed that separates them.
But since this latest conflict over Kashmir _ a breathtakingly
beautiful place that both countries want _ the Pakistanis have only
called out once to the Indian side, and that was to say they had
the bodies of six Indian soldiers to hand over.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the only sounds that have echoed through the
mountain ranges are the booms of artillery and mortar fire, from
percussive explosions that sound like a fireworks finale to a deep
rumbling like thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only guns are speaking now, not we,'' said Lt. Col. Nawaz
Herl, who commands a unit of 800 men here for the Pakistani army
along a 20-mile-long stretch of the Line of Control that is just
north of the worst of the fighting in Indian-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   His remark could just as well apply to the governments of India
and Pakistan as to the soldiers in this spot. Up to now, the
leaders of the two nations, which both became declared nuclear
powers a year ago, have found no common ground for resolving a
conflict that they fear could escalate to a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   India insists that Pakistan must withdraw the forces it says
Pakistan is supporting in Indian territory before any progress can
be made. But Pakistan denies that it has any control over the men
who are battling India for control of mountain peaks in the Kargil
and Dras sectors of Kashmir. Rather, Pakistan says, these men are
Muslim freedom fighters seeking Kashmir's right to
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread skepticism in Western capitals over
Pakistan's assertions, officers stationed here say their intense
shelling across the Line of Control into Indian territory is not
intended to provide cover for hundreds of holy warriors battling
thousands of Indian troops. Rather, the Pakistanis say, they have
more than tripled the number of rounds they fire each day in
retaliation against India's increasingly heavy pounding of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not assigned any task to assist the mujahideen,'' said
Herl, as a representative of the Pakistan army's public relations
office stood on the sidelines listening. Pakistan, an Islamic
state, only offers the Muslim warriors inside Kashmir its political
and diplomatic support, not its military might, Herl added.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani and Indian soldiers have been posted here on peaks
around the khaki-colored Shingo River since the early 1970s after
India and Pakistan signed a detailed series of maps that defined
the Line of Control following India's defeat of Pakistan in 1971 in
the third war that the two nations have fought.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Pakistani soldiers wearing jaunty berets loaded
artillery shells into cannon-like guns and fired into Indian
territory, shouting, ``God is Great'' with each blast.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a mile from here, in the tiny, impoverished hamlet
of Basal Chu, refugees from the shelling talked of their miseries.
Ten-year-old Ali Mohammed, playing with a group of raggedly dressed
boys, said mournfully, ``I used to go to school, but not anymore
because we left our village.''
</P>
<P>
   Men said the fighting has hurt their ability to earn a living by
harvesting the barley they grow on small, jewel-like terraced
plots.
</P>
<P>
   ``My village has been emptied because of heavy shelling by
Indian forces,'' said Mohammed Hussain. ``We didn't lose any men.
We holed up in caves. We were not able to cut our crops.'' He ran
away from his home in the village of Bethel to stay with relatives
in Basal Chu.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the shells have landed in Basal Chu's barley fields and
the river that shushes past it, but have not hit the homes that
cling to the mountainside. Herl said he sees little point in the
endless shelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fire is not of any much purpose, except destruction and
harassment,'' he said. But he blamed India for starting the
fighting, and said, ``Naturally, I have to respond. I have to give
a befitting reply.''

LOTT SAYS HOLBROOKE IS LIKELY TO BE CONFIRMED DESPITE SNAGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Miss.)   (rk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With at least three senators blocking a final vote
to confirm Richard Holbrooke as the chief American diplomat at the
United Nations, Senate majority leader Trent Lott said Thursday
that the nomination ``has some problems right now'' but that
Holbrooke was still likely to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of only one of the senators blocking the nomination
is known publicly: Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who has said that
he will prevent a vote on Holbrooke's nomination until the State
Department resolves an unrelated dispute with an employee described
as a whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Lott, apparently referring to the move by
the senators to block a vote, said that Holbrooke ``has some
problems right now and we'll have to see how that works out.''
Asked if he believed Holbrooke would be confirmed eventually, he
replied, ``Eventually, I think he probably will be.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Mississippi Republican said that at least
two other senators had followed Grassley's lead on Wednesday in
requesting a hold on Holbrooke's long-stalled nomination. The
nomination had been approved by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on a voice vote only hours before.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, John Czwartacki, said he did not know the
identify of the other senators, nor their reasons for blocking a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules intended to encourage consensus, individual
senators can ask the majority leader to put a ``hold'' on a
nomination indefinitely. And they can ask that their identities not
be made public.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said the administration
was unsure why lawmakers aside from Grassley had decided to block a
vote on the nomination but described the holds as the ``typical
horse-trading'' that comes before a congressional recess. The
Senate is expected to begin its July 4 recess on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of folks up there trying to break him loose,''
the official said of Holbrooke, adding that White House officials
``don't really know what's behind some of the holds that have been
put on him; they're not national security issues for the most
part.'' He said he suspected that lawmakers will try ``leveraging
Holbrooke for things they want in particular bills.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Grassley said the senator was insistent that
his hold will remain in place until the State Department reaches an
accommodation with Linda S. Shenwick, a budget analyst at the U.S.
mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shenwick, a $120,000-a-year lawyer, has said she is being
transferred out of her job in New York against her will because she
repeatedly leaked damaging information to members of Congress and
to reporters about waste and abuse at the United Nations and at the
American mission.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Jill Kozeny, said that Grassley had received a
letter from the State Department this week in which the department
said that ``Senator Grassley should not be involved in the Shenwick
matter because a process is established to resolve it and is
currently under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shenwick has filed protests over her transfer with the Merit
Systems Protection Board, a federal agency that is supposed to
protect whistle-blowers.

 &HT;    Magic continues with paperback `Midnight'
 &HT;    By Don O' Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after its publication in 1994, ``Midnight in the Garden
of Good and Evil'' went from being a book to a phenomenon. John
Berendt's Gothic tale of a Savannah murder in the midst of
eccentrics, drag queens and society folks sold 2.5 million copies
in hardback and set a record by staying on The New York Times
Bestseller List for 216 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It also spawned a Clint Eastwood film and a documentary and
boosted tourism in the city by an estimated 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the paperback edition of ``Midnight'' set to be
launched Tuesday during a daylong celebration in Savannah, Berendt
is still a little puzzled by his enormous success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to analyze it,'' Berendt said in a telephone interview
from his home in New York. ``Apart from the book itself, which I
think was a good story, it was the word of mouth. The promotability
of the characters and the city was very important. When you have
extraordinary characters who are living and who are willing to talk
to the press, and you have a great historic, American city _
beautiful, magical _ that the country is basically unaware of, then
they want to go there. That may be why the book became an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Books hopes the magic continues. The publisher has
printed 400,000 copies of ``Midnight'' in a $13 paperback edition
and is sending Berendt on yet another national tour. (He'll be at
Borders Books &AMP; Music in Buckhead at 7 p.m. July 19 to sign books
and meet fans.) After that, Berendt says, he will continue to
search for his next project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been researching some ideas without committing myself,''
he said. ``I'm still looking at a story I found in Venice. I'm not
sure whether it's a book or part of a book or a long article for
The New Yorker. It's along the lines of that great novella by Henry
James, `The Aspern Papers.' That was fiction, of course, and this
is nonfiction, but it's remarkably similar.''
</P>
<P>
   (In the James novella, an unscrupulous American editor is
obsessed with obtaining a dead poet's papers from his mistress by
seduction, deception, burglary or any other means.)
</P>
<P>
   Berendt admits that the success of ``Midnight'' looms large over
his choice for his next book, but he insists that that is not the
reason he hasn't started another project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fun I had was the seven years it took me to write the
book. What happened since has been extremely rewarding, but that
book was a labor of love. I hope to find something else that does
the same. It would be foolhardy to go into the next book with the
idea that it would be another `Midnight.'''
</P>
<P>
   And what were his thoughts on the Eastwood movie, which bombed
with critics and moviegoers alike?
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' he said. ``It bought me a townhouse in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Repackaged Morrie: When Morrie Schwartz's book ``Letting Go''
was published in 1996, it sold 6,000 copies. A respectable number,
but not a best seller by any means. So why is Walker &AMP; Co.
reissuing the book with a new title _ ``Morrie: In His Own Words''
_ and a new cover? Well, because Morrie is now famous. Schwartz, a
professor who died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's
disease), is the subject of Mitch Albom's best seller, ``Tuesdays
With Morrie.'' The book of reminiscences with Schwartz about his
philosophy of life and his views on death has sold nearly 1.9
million copies and occupies the No. 2 spot on The New York Times
Bestseller List. Walker &AMP; Co., counting on the popularity of
Albom's book to boost sales, has printed 30,000 copies of ``Morrie:
In His Own Words.''
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting a sex symbol: Marilyn Monroe has been the subject of
numerous biographies and photographic books, but now the film
legend will be the central character in a novel by Joyce Carol
Oates. Scheduled for publication in April by HarperCollins' Ecco
Press, ``Blonde'' is described as a fact-based fictional account of
Monroe's relationships with the Kennedys, Joe DiMaggio and Arthur
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   More ``GWTW'': Fans of ``Gone With the Wind'' can read even more
about the movie this fall when Herb Bridges, an author and
collector of items relating to the book and film, comes out with
``Gone With the Wind: The Three-Day Premiere in Atlanta.'' The
Georgian's book will focus on Dec. 13-15, 1939, when Atlanta was
invaded by Hollywood. The photographic essay includes Clark Gable,
Vivien Leigh and other stars, as well as Atlantans who turned out
for the premiere and the grand ball.

 &HT;    Florida tourism back after costly '98 fires
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The thick black clouds hovered on the
horizon before splitting suddenly, dumping torrents of rain that
sent tourists dashing for cover.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody here was complaining.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, everyone was praying for rain as the worst outbreak
of wildfires in Florida's history turned one of the summer's most
lucrative months into a smoke-shrouded tourist no-show.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 crisis climaxed the July Fourth weekend with the
cancellation of the Pepsi 400 stock car race at Daytona
International Speedway, wiping out an event that annually attracts
more than 250,000 free-spending race fans. Worried officials shut
down a 125-mile stretch of Interstate 95 and evacuated an entire
county as thousands of exhausted firefighters struggled to contain
the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, hoteliers and merchants are relieved to report that
the summer rains _ and the stock-car racing fans _ are back.
``We're back to normal with a lot of people in town,'' said Patrick
Welsh, owner of the Beach House motel. ``That's good, because last
year we more or less lost July, and normally that's our busiest
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments are echoed around town, where the memory of
1998's disaster still lingers in the minds _ and pocketbooks _ of
many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was going great for the first six months,'' said
Darrell Hunter, a city commissioner who runs a bar and arcade on
the beachfront boardwalk. ``But I dropped 80 percent in July, and
you just can't get that back. You can never make that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's normally dry winter and spring turned as arid as
Arizona in 1998. Temperatures hit record levels, with unheard-of
highs in the 90s in April and May and triple digits in June.
</P>
<P>
   By June, hundreds of wildfires sparked by lightning or arsonists
raged from the Panhandle to the Everglades, although large areas
were spared.
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida's Atlantic coast was hit hardest. Blazes raced
through the timberlands, threatening and, at times engulfing, new
housing developments sold to buyers attracted by the forested
landscape. The firefighting army came perilously close to losing a
major battle when three large fires converged just north of Daytona
Beach in late June. Gov. Lawton Chiles closed I-95 from
Jacksonville south to Titusville, and ordered Flagler County's
40,000 residents out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really frightening,'' said Daytona Beach shopkeeper Avi
Nachmani, who saw sales at his T-shirt store plummet. ``It really
killed our business. There was smoke everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis passed in mid-July as firefighters managed to contain
the most dangerous blazes. Slowly the dry weather pattern broke and
afternoon deluges returned _ although lightning from the storms
continued to spark new fires.
</P>
<P>
   Race officials rescheduled the Pepsi 400 to October, allowing
merchants to recoup some of their losses. But many reported they
lost business anyway, as families weren't able to take kids out of
school for an October vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year later, some businesses are still feeling lingering
effects from the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't booking ahead like they normally do,'' said Jody
Kinberger, whose family owns the 20-room Dream Inn. ``They're
waiting until the last minute to make sure nothing happens like
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest casualties of fire-scared 1998 was the
fireworks business, which normally rings up a Fourth of July
bonanza. Officials outlawed the sale of all fireworks during the
crisis, and towns across the state canceled their displays out of
fear of sparking new blazes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was like closing the mall the week before
Christmas,'' said Pat Moran, who manages Phantom Fireworks in
Daytona Beach. ``But fortunately this year we've had plenty of
rain. We're gearing up for the mad rush.

 &HT;    Yes, DragonCon's cultists anything but conventional
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a meeting room on the lowest level of the Hyatt
Regency on Thursday, two kids were playing dueling Jedi knights
with imaginary light sabers. ``Tchoo! Tchoo!'' went young Jedi Nick
Mimms, a 10-year-old from Tucker, mimicking the sound of clashing
``Star Wars'' weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the lobby, George Lukach had a real saber, and a
real plumed hat, and a leather vest, and everything else the
well-dressed musketeer is wearing to DragonCon '99, the enormous
fantasy convention and festival running in downtown Atlanta through
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Normally an assistant manager at a Barnes &AMP; Noble in Norwalk,
Ct., Lukach is 35 but was enjoying his play-acting every bit as
much as Nicholas. When women approached for a posed photo, Lukach
would bend to one knee and chivalrously kiss an outstretched hand
while Instamatics flashed.
</P>
<P>
   DragonCon is almost literally its own universe, a black hole
that sucks in everything in pop culture that has ever been labeled
``cult following,'' populated by people who put the fan in fanatic.
It's ``Star Wars'' and ``Star Trek,'' Pokemon and ``Xena,'' comic
books and the Internet, Monty Python and Austin Powers, ``Buffy''
buffs and fairy worshippers, Dungeons &AMP; Dragons and GWAR, a
high-camp, high-decibel rock band that plays ``Carnival of Chaos''
at midnight tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the biggest (fantasy conventions) in the
country, because it's not just one thing, like just 'Star Wars' or
just comic books,'' said Cindy Haverfield of Bloomington, Ind.
``Everybody and his brother comes to DragonCon.'' Haverfield was
selling swords and knives at her booth, the Dragon's Claw, and had
a small metal dragon peeking out of her cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kramer, chairman of DragonCon, who has a black beard so bushy
an Ewok could hide in it, says 40,000 fans are expected this year.
Admission is $25 for a one-day pass and $60 for a four-day pass.
Registration is in the Hyatt Regency, and the ever-growing festival
sprawls between the hotel (home of panel discussions and guest
speakers like revered sci-fi writer Anne McCaffrey) and the Atlanta
Apparel Mart's Exhibit Hall (home of miles of aisles of stuff for
sale, from ``Twin Peaks'' posters in Spanish to Dr. Who dolls).
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother has been going for five years, and I'm tired of him
rubbing my face in all the cool people he's met,'' said Emily
Livingston, a 15-year-old sophomore from Douglasville (GA.). She
sported a sprinkling of face glitter, a curly swirl of blue
eyeliner out to one temple and a Sailor Moon T-shirt. Her friend
Amber Sloan, checking out a huge display of comic books with Emily,
wore a small button that read ``Free Your Inner Alien.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of author McCaffrey, who rarely makes convention
appearances, is one of the big buzzes this year. Also appearing are
three stars of the ``Batman'' TV series: Adam West (Batman), Yvonne
Craig (Batgirl) and Frank Gorshin (the Riddler.)
</P>
<P>
   ``After the costume party Saturday night, that's when it really
gets pretty wild,'' said Lara Putnam, who drove to Atlanta from
Phenix City, Ala., to put on a wig and an enormous blue ball gown
and pretend to be ``Morgana Firehair,'' an Irish sorceress based on
a Dungeons &AMP; Dragons character. Identity can be a shaky concept
sometimes at DragonCon _ ``What's your real name?'' is something
heard among people meeting in the Hyatt Regency lobby _ and the
idea of being in and/or out of costume is rarely a simple one for
many of the fans in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban moms in Disney World T-shirts wheel kids in strollers
past guys with multiple piercings and Charles Manson T-shirts.
Claire Gray of Venice, Fla., is her own creation, ``Drama Queen'' _
white mask, cardboard crown and homemade red velvet robe. There are
men in vinyl pants and makeup; a woman in fairy wings and elf-ears;
bustiers, fishnet stockings, lace-up boots, Goth-punk crossover and
a black T-shirt that reads, ``I'm Not Shy, I'm Just Studying My
Prey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mainly just come to people-watch,'' said Lukach, the
musketeer in the lobby. In his 18th-century rig, he seemed like a
man from another time. But one in the right place.

 &HT;    Old trick speeds lighthouse relocation
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is moving at the speed of
slippery soap.
</P>
<P>
   On the black and white-striped beacon's unexpectedly rapid
journey inland to safety, workers are using bars of Ivory soap to
grease the steel tracks along which the lighthouse is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Bar soap is handy, of course, on stubborn zippers and squeaky
kitchen drawers. House movers have used it for years to slide
buildings onto truck trailers.
</P>
<P>
   On North Carolina's Outer Banks, moving officials credit the old
trick with helping speed the lighthouse past the halfway point in
its 2,900-foot trip away from crashing Atlantic waves.
</P>
<P>
   The 128-year-old lighthouse is now beyond the oceanfront dunes
that would be vulnerable to overwashing by waves during a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is moving so well with the Ivory soap as a lubricant
that it almost rolls itself,'' said Randy Knott, chief engineer
with Atlanta-based Law Engineering and Environmental Services Inc.,
the lead engineering consultant on the lighthouse project.
</P>
<P>
   The steel track's beams are so slippery, Knott said, that the
4,800-ton lighthouse has had a tendency to roll backward in its
slightly uphill trip, until it is braced by hydraulic jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Initially crews planned to use a graphite-based dry lubricant.
Officials feared that sand would blow onto the sun-softened soap,
creating friction between the steel beams and the steel rollers on
top of which the lighthouse is riding.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't been a problem, and officials aren't sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know whether it is the heat or humidity or what, but
we are not getting sand on the rollers,'' said Joe Jakubik, project
manager for International Chimney Corp., the project's contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The 108-foot-tall landmark's $11.8 million rescue has gone so
smoothly that officials are predicting it will arrive at its new
foundation about July 10.
</P>
<P>
   When the move started June 17, officials said the trip would
take four to six weeks, with hydraulic jacks pushing the tower 70
to 100 feet a day. But some days the lighthouse has traveled more
than 200 feet, cutting its travel time by a week or more. It is
scheduled to reopen to the public Memorial Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Expert House Movers, a subcontractor, has saved time in the way
it resets the hydraulic jacks, Knott said. The jacks push the
lighthouse along the steel tracks for a distance of 5 feet, at a
virtually imperceptible speed of 1 to 2 inches a minute. At that
point, the jacks move forward for the next 5-foot move, and
hydraulic plates hold them in place.
</P>
<P>
   Expert House Movers had planned to carry out that process
manually, a time-consuming effort requiring workers to unbolt and
rebolt the jacks to the steel tracks. ``It is now a tremendously
efficient process,'' Knott said.

CLINTON DENIES TENSIONS WITH GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mad at Al Gore? Whatever gave you that idea?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Thursday that he was ``bewildered'' by
reports of personal and political friction between him and the vice
president but said there were bound to be disagreements between
them on matters of policy as the presidential campaign unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The president was responding to recent accounts of tension
between the two men over Gore's efforts to distance himself from
the president's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and advisers to Clinton said he was angered and hurt by
the apparent zeal with which Gore has disavowed the president's
personal conduct. Clinton knows he did wrong with Ms. Lewinsky and
does not need to be reminded of it by the vice president, one close
Clinton adviser said in an interview with The New York Times last
week. Another adviser described Clinton as ``livid'' at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asked Clinton about the accounts at a news conference
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly do not know what the source of the stories are,''
Clinton said. ``But they are not in my heart or my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised Gore's announcement for the presidency two weeks ago
and said the vice president was doing a good job of explaining what
he would do if he were elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I want him to get out there,'' the president said.
``And if he disagrees with a decision that I make as president
during the next year and a half, then, of course he will have to
say so. And I will take no offense at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, while disclaiming any role as a ``political
handicapper,'' said that Gore's rival for the Democratic
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, had shown an impressive
ability to raise money but had not put forward any ideas about how
he would govern the country. Bradley raised about $11 million for
his campaign in the first six months of the year; Gore brought in
more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he didn't intend his remarks as a ``dig'' at
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said himself that he has not laid out his case for
being president,'' Clinton said. ``I am not `digging' him; I have
nothing bad to say about him. That is a fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I personally have always believed that you should begin by
saying why you want the job because you are asking people to hire
you to do things _ and I think the vice president deserves a lot of
credit for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then went on to list Gore's qualifications for the
presidency, including service in Congress and in the executive
branch, expertise on foreign policy and arms control matters and
``vast experience'' on domestic policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides that,'' Clinton said with a laugh, ``he's been a
journalist _ the vice president! You've got to think that counts
for something.''

COCA-COLA ANNOUNCES PARTIAL RECALL IN POLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.) (rk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following the discovery of mold inside one batch of glass
bottles earlier this week, the Coca-Cola Co. is recalling all of
its soft drinks in the same-sized bottles in Poland, the company
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The recall affects an estimated 170,000 cases of Coca-Cola,
Coca-Cola Light, Fanta and Kinley tonic water, as well as Bonaqua
mineral water, where the problem was originally noticed in 0.33
liter bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mold was discovered first in Bonaqua, but it turns out
it's in the bottles,'' said Rob Baskin, a Coke spokesman in
Atlanta. There have been no reports of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bottles were in warehouses when the recall began, he
said. Still, about 25 percent of them had to be retrieved from
stores and other places that stocked them. ``It's largely in the
hotel, cafe and restaurant trade,'' Baskin said. The recall affects
about 12 percent of the Coke soft drinks sold in Poland, he added,
and the recalled bottles will be replaced with plastic bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The company that bottles Coke products for the Polish market is
Coca-Cola Beverages, which last month said it would merge with
Hellenic Bottling, a longtime Coke bottler based in Athens, Greece.
The merger would create the second-largest bottler in the Coke
system. The largest is Coca-Cola Enterprises, which has
responsibility for Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg,
where Coca-Cola had the biggest recall in company history last
month after hundreds of people reported feeling ill after drinking
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of in shock that all these things are happening
simultaneously,'' said Caroline Levy, a beverage analyst for
Schroder &AMP; Co., who lowered her second-quarter earnings estimates
for Coca-Cola to 39 cents from 41 cents on Thursday. ``It's a blow
to the brand equity, at least in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said Wednesday that the recalls in Europe reduced
second-quarter sales by 1 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coke products are to begin appearing again on Belgian store
shelves Friday, the company said. It will be four to six weeks
before products are as widely available as they were before the
government-ordered recall, which removed and destroyed 15 million
cases of soft drinks.

TAYLOR STILL LOOKING FOR A CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Taylor was home Thursday, his first day of free agency,
patiently awaiting to hear about his future. Boston? Still a
possibility. But with 27 other National Hockey League teams in the
mix, there are many possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to my agent yet,'' said Taylor, reached in
the afternoon by telephone, ``but we've heard there are a few teams
interested. I've heard Rangers, and a few others, too . . . but I'm
going to leave all that to my agent.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Taylor, he wants to sign a three- or four-year
pact, be it in Boston or elsewhere. He can't pinpoint the money,
but suspects it will be between $1 million per year at the low end
and twice that at the high.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 priority is to come back to Boston,'' said Taylor,
the pivot in the Bruins' checking line, with wingers Rob DiMaio and
P.J. Axelsson. ``But I think, given the situation, I have to look
at all options.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is this: Taylor made $675,000 last year, which is
approximately 50 percent below the league's average pay. Given that
he is a 10-year pro, making less than the league average, as of
12:01 a.m. Thursday he became a Group 5 free agent _ free to cut a
deal anywhere, with the Bruins retaining no right to match the
offer or receive compensation if he were to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other clubs are going to talk to him,'' said Bruins president
Harry Sinden. ``I've talked to some of those clubs myself, and I'm
sure they're asking themselves what we did: can they afford to pay
a checking center much more than he's already making?''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins recently made Taylor a one-year offer with a 10
percent raise over last season, a standard qualifying offer for
someone of his age (30) and with his time in the league. He didn't
respond to the offer and the sides haven't negotiatied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it, really,'' said Taylor. ``Maybe they
want to see what the market is . . . I'm kind of at a loss to know
what they're thinking. I'd hoped we would have had something done
by now, but maybe they didn't want to outbid themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bruins have made plans to move forward without
three other veterans, including forward Ken Baumgartner and
defensemen Grant Ledyard and Dave Ellett.
</P>
<P>
   Baumgartner had one year left on his deal, worth $675,000 for
the 1999-2000 season, as did Ellett ($1.6 million). Cutting them
free will save the club approximately $760,000. Ledyard, who made
$750,000 last season, did not have a deal in place for the upcoming
season. All three now are free to sign elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sinden, coach Pat Burns, who in general favors
veterans over inexperienced players, was not troubled by the roster
moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat suggested part way through the year that I ask waivers on
Ellett, because he wasn't using him much,'' said Sinden. ``We did
that, and he cleared. He likes both (Baumgartner and Ellett) a lot,
and feels they're the kind of character players he needs on the
team. We're going to lose that now, and the question is, do we have
the people to sustain it? They're both excellent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Up front, the Bruins will look to the likes of Shawn Bates Eric
Nickulas, Landon Wilson, and perhaps a couple of other Providence
Bruins, Marquis Mathieu and Andre Savage, to fill the Baumgartner
and perhaps Taylor voids.
</P>
<P>
   In back, they have Mattias Timander ready to plug in to Ellett's
spot and will audition Jonathan Girard, their top pick in the '98
draft. If signed, Nick Boynton, their top choice in last Saturday's
draft, also would get ample opportunity in September's training
camp to fill Ellett's job.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Bruins continue to emphasize youth. After bottoming
out in the 1996-97 season, they've restructured their club around
the draft, which costs less and, they believe, pays bigger
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden sounded doubtful that the Bruins will extend offers to
any of the high-profile free agents, the most intriguing of whom is
Theo Fleury, the electrifying forward who finished the season with
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scared away by the $8 million or $9 million a year he's
looking for,'' said Sinden, referring to Fleury. ``I'd be very
surprised if we did anything, but I'll talk to Pat (Burns) and get
his input on a couple of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendel Clark and Dave Andreychuk, both of whom played for Burns
in Toronto, are unrestricted free agents. Sinden said he'll talk to
Burns about both. If either wanted to come to work for, say, a low
base salary and performance bonuses, then something could be worked
out here in the Hub of Hockey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baumgartner figured he had a day of reckoning coming with the
Bruins. ``But I expected that would be at the end of September, in
training camp,'' he said. ``Neither Dave (Ellett) or myself
expected to be bought out.'' The Bomber has a few options: 1. find
another playing job; 2. play in Switzerland (he played there years
ago and still has a Swiss passport); 3. apply to business school;
4. explore opportunities with the NHL Players Association . . .
Sinden said the club explored trade opportunities for Dmitri
Khristich during Saturday's draft at the Vault. ``We tried a number
of scenarios,'' he said. ``But nothing so far. Everyone tells me
what a good player he is, but no one wants him. And he is a good
player, but you just never know how he'll play on a given night.''

GOP OUTLINES TAX CUTS AMID PROJECTED BUDGET SURPLUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans beat the drum Thursday for
cutting capital gains, inheritance and income taxes, a package
Democrats criticize as favoring the wealthy and harmful to critical
federal programs such as health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leadership outlined a proposal to cut government revenue
an estimated $1 trillion over the next decade as the Congressional
Budget Office reported that the federal budget surplus over the
next 10 years will total $996 billion _ not counting Social
Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO report, which shows trends similar to forecasts earlier
this week by the administration's Office of Management and Budget,
says the budget surplus over the next decade will total $2.9
trillion when Social Security surpluses are included.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason for this surplus is because taxpayers are
paying too much, which is why they deserve a refund,'' said Rep.
Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and
chief architect of the GOP's proposed tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a fife and drum band, Archer and about 60 GOP lawmakers
marched out of the Capitol behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, crossed
Independence Avenue and filed into a House office building where
the Ways and Means Committee Room had been decorated with red,
white and blue balloons, and rows of U.S. flags.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans denounced President Clinton's plans for spending
the $1 trillion surplus, although the president said he would
discuss a tax cut. Then, they outlined their plan to cut tax rates
across the board and provide relief from estate taxes, capital
gains taxes and the so-called ``marriage penalty'' paid by
two-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't cut taxes now and the money stays in Washington,
the politicians surely will spend it,'' said Archer, R-Texas, whose
tax-cut plan also would increase the amount people could contribute
to Individual Retirement Accounts and would extend soon-to-expire
business tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the largest surplus in history,'' Hastert said, a
small U.S. flag hanging from his breast pocket. ``As we commit
ourselves to finding ways to secure our retirement programs, we
also commit ourselves to bringing fairness to the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on earlier budget-surplus forecasts, Republicans had
agreed to push for $778 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years.
With the higher, revised estimates by the CBO and the
administration's Office of Management and Budget earlier this week,
Archer and the conservative House leadership decided to boost their
proposed tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the details are fleshed out, Archer's expanded tax
package drew fire from Democrats who want to increase spending on
education and defense after securing long-term funding for Medicare
and Social Security. In addition, the sheer size of the
trillion-dollar bottom line of Archer's proposed tax cut faces
problems from the White House, the Senate and moderate House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., called the plan
``totally irresponsible and misplaced in terms of its goals''
because it does not attack the national debt and would not put
additional money into education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have left out the important priorities that we
ought to be dealing with,'' Gephardt told reporters. ``We do need a
tax cut. It can be far less expensive than this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats have proposed tax reductions, but not
across the board. ``It's a responsible tax cut. It's targeted to
middle-class families. (The Republican's) trillion-dollar tax cut
is designed primarily for the wealthy,'' Gephardt said. ``We don't
think that's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat's tax-cut plan, similar to one proposed by
President Clinton earlier this year, includes targeted tax cuts
such as a $1,000 credit for taxpayers who care for a disabled
family member and a $500 credit for parents who care for infants at
home. The Democrat's package would total about $300 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, director of the president's National Economic
Council, said the White House would not support parts of the
Republican plan, such as the capital gains tax cut, which favors
upper-income Americans who can afford to invest in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tax cut that helps more moderate families increase their
personal savings rates is a far-higher priority,'' Sperling said.
``We have no intention at this time of supporting a new capital
gains tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton remains open to negotiating a cut in taxes once
the future of Social Security and Medicare are guaranteed and the
national debt is factored into any plan for spending the projected
surplus. ``Within the framework of achieving these objectives,
obviously I'll be working with the Congress to achieve them,''
Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch Wednesday, moderate Republican House members
cautioned Hastert that they could not support basing the fattened
tax package on the improved budget-surplus projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do a tax cut, you're going to have to live with the
consequences of that,'' said Rep. Michael N. Castle, R-Del., a
leader of the House moderates, regardless of whether the
projections come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have a very large tax cut,'' Castle said, referring
to the $778 billion tax package previously agreed to by
Republicans. ``My own personal vote is we should not increase the
tax cut at all.''

NEGOTIATORS FOCUS ON REACHING ARMS COMPROMISE BY FRIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Frustrated yet again in their attempt to break the
political stalemate here, the British and Irish governments said
they will make one final push Friday to fashion a compromise that
would revive the stalled peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   While Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, pledged to get the IRA to disarm, the Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble insisted he needed the IRA to make a statement
promising to turn in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The offer by Sinn Fein to guarantee that the IRA would disarm
was widely seen as a major shift in principle, but unionists
dismissed it as an empty promise. Unionists demanded that Sinn Fein
put the promise in writing, something Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said was not possible because of ``the delicate nature of these
negotiations.'' After the talks adjourned Thursday night, however,
Sinn Fein released a written declaration to undertake disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Amid recrimination on both sides, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, said they would wrap
up their weeklong effort to save the Good Friday Agreement before
Saturday. Blair had insisted the final deadline was two days ago,
but government officials said the two leaders believed there was
enough chance of success to extend the deadline to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, government officials said a long-awaited report will be
released Friday on whether disarming of paramilitary groups,
including the IRA, is possible. The report by John de Chastelain, a
retired Canadian general, had been delayed since Monday while Blair
and Ahern tried to get a deal between Sinn Fein and the unionists.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process has been stalled, and the Good Friday
Agreement threatened, by a long-running dispute between Sinn Fein
and the Ulster Unionists, the largest party in Northern Ireland.
Unionists refuse to allow the formation of a power-sharing
government with Sinn Fein until the IRA begins turning in its
weapons. Sinn Fein says their participation in government is not
linked under the Good Friday Agreement to disarming, which is
supposed to follow the creation of the 12-member cabinet to
administer local government.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern have sought to find a compromise to the dispute,
which threatens to kill the agreement they brokered last year,
ushering in the most peaceful period in Northern Ireland in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   As London handed power back to local parliaments in Wales and
Scotland Thursday, Blair tried desperately to do the same in
Northern Ireland. The devolution of power to local assemblies is a
major aim of Blair's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Blair canceled plans to attend the opening of the Scottish
parliament in Edinburgh to remain here overseeing negotiations,
demonstrating the commitment to finding a settlement in Northern
Ireland that has been his biggest domestic priority since taking
office in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Blair reconvened the negotiations at Castle Buildings on the
grounds of Stormont in East Belfast by proclaiming there had been
``huge progress,'' despite the stalemate that had led him and Ahern
to work beyond the ``absolute final'' deadline he had set for
midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern suggested the parties were close to agreement, and that
only a few more hours were needed. But his prediction proved overly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The two protagonists _ Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists, who
represent middle-class Protestants _ began the day by accusing each
other of being disingenuous. Trimble insisted that his party had
received no formal offer by Sinn Fein committing itself to disarm
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But while admitting he had not written down Sinn Fein's offer
because of the sensitivity of the arms issue among IRA activists,
Adams said the unionists were lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rejected our proposals hours before the deadline,'' Adams
said. ``We have moved our position, and it has not only been
rejected but misrepresented.''
</P>
<P>
   While Trimble is said to be demanding guns up front to hold off
mass defections from his own party, Adams said that agreeing to
work actively for disarming the IRA created ``huge difficulties''
for Sinn Fein within its own constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said unionists were using weapons as a smokescreen. He
said several of the unionist negotiators were opposed to the Good
Friday Agreement and were trying to wreck it by making the arms
dispute unresolvable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about guns,'' he said. ``This is about those who
are against change. We have met with a negotiating team that
includes people who are against what they are supposed to be
negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said all parties had said they were committed to forming a
power-sharing government, and bringing about the disarmament of
paramilitary groups. But he said the manner of disarming would be
left to the commission headed by de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the gestures being made by unionists and republicans
amounted to ``historic, seismic shifts in the political
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the governments were ``prepared to give legislative
backing'' to sanctions that would be applied if unionists balked at
sharing power or the IRA balked at disarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If decommissioning doesn't happen, they are out,'' he said of
Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   But, seeking to reassure nationalists, Blair insisted that
unionists do not hold a veto over progress in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire civilized world won't understand if we can't put
this together and make it work,'' said Blair. ``This is the thread
by which the future of Northern Ireland hangs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern said it would be ``unforgivable'' to let the peace process
unravel over the timing of the formation of a power-sharing
government and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has been in telephone contact with party
leaders, agreed, saying, ``It is a very difficult problem for the
parties, but it will be very hard for the world to understand if
this breaks off. To call it a tragedy would be a great
understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke with Adams by telephone Thursday, had been
briefed on Sinn Fein's plan to seek IRA disarmament on May 5, when
Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness visited Washington.

 &HT;    Sydney Olympics officials renege on invitation to high school
bands
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett and Diane Stepp

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than 400 metro Atlanta student musicians have
been counting on being part of the 2000 Olympics' opening ceremony,
but Australian national pride may have shattered their travel
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizing officials in Sydney decided against including
1,500 American and Japanese amateur musicians in a U.S.-style
marching band after Australian citizens protested, the leaders of
two Georgia high school bands have been informed via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Students from Walton High School in Cobb County and Fayette
County High School wereto perform before 115,000 people _ and a
television audience of more than 1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two bands were the only ones from Georgia participating, and
joint rehearsals were to begin next month for the September 2000
event.
</P>
<P>
   Then came an e-mail from World Projects Corp. of California,
contracted by Sydney officials to recruit the musicians. The
message was that there was a problem ``and it looks like we can't
go,'' said Mike Back, Walton's band director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking,'' he said. ``The minister of the Olympics,
because of pressure from the Australian people, evidently decided
not to use foreigners. Our parents are concerned and the kids are
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, the director of
ceremonies said he wanted to create a band that would play while
athletes marched. ``He wanted people aged 18 to 21 who could
perform theatrically and march to set patterns, and the U.S. was
the only place where they were available in large numbers,'' the
article said.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper article quoted a musicians union official, John
McAuliffe. saying, ``It seems to be incredible that these (Olympic
organizers) can be so crass about ignoring Australian performers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the president of World Projects said Australian
officials are now working on other ways to involve the students. An
article in today's Herald said Olympics organizers now plan to
offer the students ``lesser Olympic roles,'' such as ``performing
at the village or on the boulevard outside the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know the full details of (the organizers' plans) but
we do expect to learn those details during the site inspection
visit on July 4 in Sydney and Bathurst,'' William R. Lutt, World
Projects president, said in a faxed statement.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was to cost $3,600 per person, plus the cost of
shipping their musical instruments. The schools were to start
fund-raising efforts this fall, and some parents had begun making
partial payments.
</P>
<P>
   Because students would miss the second and third weeks of school
in September, Olympic organizers were to arrange for band members
to have tutors in Sydney, and for Internet access to their
classroom teachers back home. Study halls had been arranged between
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette County High has received corporate donations to help pay
for the trip, said Principal Gary Phillips. ``We've had a number of
calls,'' he said. ``One parent told me this morning that they'd
already paid $850. If we really are kicked out, there's a lot of
money that's going to have to be refunded.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Raney, a vice president with World Projects, said
Thursday that restitution would be made to bands that have made
financial payments toward the trip if it is canceled. ``From our
point of view we're very disappointed and a bit frustrated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Terry, 17, who plays trumpet in the Fayette band, said he
has always wanted to go to Australia and was looking forward to the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' he said. ``It would
have been really cool to go.

A LITTLE LATE, A REVOLUTION ARRIVES ON NEW YORK'S ROADS 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A promotional video for the GMC Yukon shows G. Richard Wagoner
Jr., the president of General Motors, telling his chauffeur to take
a shortcut across Manhattan. The driver cuts the wheel, and the
Yukon, a giant sport utility vehicle, responds, weaving through
traffic, slaloming between safety cones, riding up on the sidewalk
and, finally, careering around a truck on a narrow street.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and its competitors have launched marketing
campaigns to convince residents that the latest sport utility
vehicles are nimble enough for the rigors of metropolitan New York,
and local drivers apparently agree.
</P>
<P>
   Despite congested streets, narrow roadways, aging bridges and
tunnels and polluted air that, in some respects, make the New York
area uniquely inhospitable to light trucks, the region has become
one of the nation's hottest markets for sport utility vehicles.
Sales have doubled since 1994, and they show no signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators are on the verge of proposing new registration
rules that could further increase the number of heavier vehicles on
area roadways. Pickup trucks, now relatively scarce in the region
and usually licensed only as commercial vehicles, would become much
easier for residents to license, and new rules would allow them on
many roads and bridges where they are now banned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet highway engineers, safety experts and environmental
regulators say that sport utility vehicles and pickups pose special
safety and environmental issues for metropolitan New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City is going to have a problem with them,'' said
Raymond Heimbuch, retired president of Clarke and Rapuano, the big
Manhattan road design company that laid out many of the city's
parkways over the last six decades. He worries that the big
vehicles were not anticipated when the narrow lanes and tight
curves of the city's roads and bridges were built. With traffic
often bumper-to-bumper, he said, it is troublesome that sport
utility vehicles are so tall that they block car drivers' views of
7-foot stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of situations, there's no doubt about it, that
are going to be made worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no reliable safety statistics, current state
officials acknowledge that the region's older roads, particularly
those that cannot be easily upgraded, are poorly suited for sport
utility vehicles. ``It's hard to drive one down those parkways,''
especially if a driver speeds, said Robert Dennison, the state
Department of Transportation's Hudson Valley regional director.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the changing mix of vehicles could threaten the
region's air quality, which is already polluted. ``As the fleet
gets heavier, it will have more of an impact on our air,'' said
Steven Flint, state chief of vehicular air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators have imposed some of the strictest air
pollution rules in the nation for cars but have largely ignored the
larger light trucks. As a result, the state allows big sport
utilities and pickups to emit more than five times as much
pollution per mile as cars _ a wider disparity than in all but
three other states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the big vehicles have an undeniable appeal for many
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Higgins, a construction manager in Manhattan, recently
chose a black Dodge Durango sport utility as his company vehicle
because he wanted a lot of room to carry his files and laptop
computer from site to site. The vehicle has the optional four-wheel
drive, which makes it 2 inches taller and several hundred pounds
heavier, but Higgins said that he had never used it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sell it as a package with leather seats and rear air
conditioning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's most prominent user of a sport utility vehicle is
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose official vehicle is a green 1993 GMC
Suburban. ``Frequently he has staff members in there, and he
conducts meetings,'' said Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman. ``It has the
space.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles have even made inroads in New York's taxi fleet.
The city's Taxi and Limousine Commission approved the use of Ford
Explorer sport utility vehicles as taxis three years ago. Honda
Odyssey and Isuzu Oasis minivans were also approved. As of this
spring 39 cabdrivers were using Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the region's parkways, among the oldest in the nation,
have been rebuilt over the last several decades with wider lanes,
particularly on Long Island. But many of the most traveled still
have lanes that are a foot or two narrower than the federal
standard of 12 feet. Tall, wide vehicles are a problem in narrow
lanes because car drivers cannot see around them or over them.
</P>
<P>
   And some New York-area roads and bridges, notably the Garden
State Parkway and the Brooklyn Bridge, have weight limits set many
years ago to exclude commercial trucks. Still, these limits are now
flouted routinely by drivers of full-sized sport utility vehicles,
which weigh up to twice as much as mid-size cars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Dodge Durango, Lexus
LX-470, Toyota Land Cruiser, Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon,
Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevrolet Suburban all exceed the weight limit
on the Brooklyn Bridge, for example. But city officials say they
have a problem with ticketing large sport utility vehicles because
few drivers know how much their vehicles weigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I don't have an entire bridge full of stopped
Tahoes, I don't have a problem,'' said Henry D. Perahia, the city's
chief bridge engineer. Even if the 116-year-old bridge were covered
entirely by full-size sport utility vehicles, it would likely
suffer limited structural damage, he said, adding, ``I don't think
you'd have a collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes now under way in metropolitan New York's fleet of
vehicles are particularly dramatic because light trucks are late
arrivals in the city. This was the result of a combination of
regulations, found nowhere else in the country, that strongly
discouraged residents from buying pickups. Sport utility vehicles,
a recent fad, are exempt from these rules, even though most sport
utility vehicles are modified pickup trucks, and are lumped
together with pickups for many federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Since before World War II, New York state has required that all
open-bed pickup trucks be registered as commercial vehicles. At the
same time, New York state parkways and a few bridges, notably the
Brooklyn Bridge, ban vehicles with commercial plates. New York City
even requires that all vehicles with commercial plates carry the
name and address of the owner in 3-inch-high letters on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Driving an open-bed pickup in the New York area can require
lengthy detours, so few people buy them. The two most popular
vehicles in the country are the Ford F-150 and Chevrolet Silverado
pickup trucks, each of which easily outsells the most popular car,
the Toyota Camry. Yet in New York City plus Westchester, Rockland
and Putnam counties, all pickups together accounted for only 1.7
percent of new vehicle registrations last year, compared with 18.8
percent nationally, according to R.L. Polk &AMP; Co., which tracks auto
registration data.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, sport utility vehicles made up 19.2 percent of the
new vehicles registered in this area last year and 19.9 percent if
Nassau, Suffolk and Bergen are included, compared with 16.1 percent
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   With so many big sport utility vehicles already in use, Gov.
George Pataki's Office of Regulatory Reform is quietly reviewing a
proposal to give buyers of all but the largest pickup trucks a
choice of registering their vehicles as commercial vehicles or as
passenger vehicles, which is the category for cars and most
minivans.
</P>
<P>
   David Bradley, the office's acting director, said that the new
rule would probably be issued for public comment soon.
</P>
<P>
   The change would make it much easier for people in and around
New York to buy and drive pickups. Automakers have lobbied
strenuously for the rule change.
</P>
<P>
   The original notion was to restrict commercial activity and
prevent trucks piled high with merchandise from reaching
residential neighborhoods in the city and suburbs. But pickup
trucks with a hard cap over the bed have long been exempted from
these rules. They can be registered as personal vehicles and can be
taken on parkways, which were originally intended for recreational
driving and often have sharp curves so that drivers can admire the
landscape ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   Most sport utility vehicles are essentially pickup trucks with
factory-installed roofs over the bed and extra rows of seats, so
they are exempt from the current rules. Sales of sport utility
vehicles have already doubled in New York and its suburbs since
1994, rising faster than in the rest of the country, according to
R.L. Polk. Because a sport utility vehicle typically costs $10,000
more than a comparably sized car, the trend has been most
noticeable in affluent neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to keep the boom going, automakers have increased their
spending on ads for these vehicles in metropolitan New York by 119
percent over the last four years. ``In terms of driving, in New
York City a sport utility vehicle makes sense _ they're tough,
you've got good visibility, you're surrounded by yellow cabs,''
which are relatively low and easy to see over, said Mark Schirmer,
a spokesman for Land Rover, which sells more Range Rovers in the
New York area than anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   There are few statistics on the involvement of sport utility
vehicles in crashes in the region. State forms for traffic
accidents require the police officer to note whether a vehicle with
passenger or commercial license plates was involved. But if the
vehicle was a passenger vehicle, the form does not require the
officer to note whether it was a sport utility vehicle, a minivan,
a car or the occasional pickup with a covered bed.
</P>
<P>
   While engineers have tried to modernize New York's road system,
there are limits on what can be done. Construction costs are high.
Straightening some sharp curves would require tearing down homes or
even, in the case of the twisting Jackie Robinson Parkway in
Brooklyn, paving over sections of cemeteries. And several area
parkways have historic significance, notably the Bronx River,
Taconic State and Merritt Parkways, which means that
preservationists have sought successfully to limit alterations.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who speed in sport utility vehicles on these roads pose
a particular problem for highway engineers, because these vehicles'
weight and high centers of gravity make them harder to control in
turns and more vulnerable to rolling over if they strike curbs,
guard rails or other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Domenico Annese, 80, who helped design several local parkways,
said that he drove the Saw Mill River every day and routinely saw
sport utility drivers speeding and unable to stay in their lanes.
``They're straddling the yellow line and fishtailing a little bit
and they're putting on the brakes in the middle of the curves, and
that's bad,'' he said. ``People have a false sense of security in
the bigger vehicles.''

MCCAIN HINTS HE'D FILIBUSTER OVER CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain, who this week made campaign
finance reform the center of his presidential campaign platform, is
indicating he will shut down the Senate if the issue is not
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are reluctant to debate flaws in the way
campaign funds are raised, and Republican aides said Thursday that
any procedural maneuvers by McCain would be cast as a publicity
stunt. But McCain, who lags far behind Texas Goveror George W. Bush
in presidential primary polls, said he would ``make every effort''
to bring his bill to the floor in July _ suggesting he would use
the Senate procedure of filibustering other pending legislation in
the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can take it up in an orderly fashion. But we'll try
to make every effort to get the issue addressed,'' McCain, a
Republican from Arizona, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he is ready and able and willing to shut down the US
Senate,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of
Massachusetts, whose campaign finance bill is stalled in the House.
``Our original strategy was to pass the bill early in the House and
send it to the Senate. Now, I think John is just anxious to move
things along.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance measure in the House, sponsored by Meehan
and Republican Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, is
12 votes away from being brought to the floor. Last year, 51
senators voted in favor of the legislation sponsored by McCain and
Democratic Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin _ shy of the
three-fifths majority needed to overcome a threatened filibuster by
Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Many in both parties are skeptical the legislation will pass.
The first hurdle, however, is simply getting the bill to a vote.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert has said he will allow a vote on
campaign finance sometime after Labor Day. In the Senate, Lott has
not set a timeframe _ mainly, a spokesman said, because McCain
``hasn't pushed it yet, hasn't even introduced it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really schedule something that hasn't been
introduced,'' Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said. Furthermore, he
added: ``We've got a pretty full July,'' including eight
appropriations bills, a bankruptcy measure and managed health care
legislation sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional resistance may work to McCain's political
advantage, several Republican aides said. If McCain's primary goal
is to stir debate _ and to thereby draw attention to not only the
issue of campaign fundraising but also his presidential bid _ then
conducting a protracted battle on the floor of the Senate could
serve his purposes well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been his plan for a while,'' one Democrat said. And
Lott's spokesman said he would not be surprised if McCain turned
the legislation into an event. ``I know he has the courage of his
convictions,'' Czwartacki said. ``Of that we have no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted his timing was not based on strategy but on the
holdup in the House, which he had hoped would address the
Shays-Meehan bill before his version was introduced in the Senate.
As for the schedule, McCain blamed Kennedy for the jammed calendar,
after a week in which the Massachusetts Democrat held up business
to demand a hearing on his own health care bill, known as the
Patients Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But even Republican senators in favor of altering campaign
fundraising rules in theory were skittish about the idea of using
divisive procedural moves to bring it about _ especially in the
context of one senator's presidential race, as well as in the wake
of accusations that the 106th Congress has failed to accomplish
anything yet. Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, said the Senate
``should really have an opportunity to debate it without having to
engage in a filibuster because there's so little time left.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, the debate may have as much to do with
McCain's campaign as the issue of fundraising in general,
Republican and Democratic aides said. Having thrown down a gauntlet
of sorts, declaring his determination to bring campaign fundraising
to the fore, McCain will now ``have to make some kind of
demonstrable and very visible display,'' one senior Republican aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long he'll keep it up, I don't know,'' the aide said.
``But he's got to make a big deal out of it, even though nobody has
any interest right now.''

CHRYSLER, DEFYING A TREND, SAYS SALES FELL 5 PERCENT IN JUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Surprising analysts, DaimlerChrysler AG said Thursday
that sales of its Chrysler-brand vehicles declined in June, which
had been expected to be one of the auto industry's best sales
months ever.
</P>
<P>
   Combined sales of the Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth and Jeep brands
fell 5 percent from a year ago, to 255,496 cars and trucks. Sales
of the company's Mercedes-Benz vehicles, however, rose 8 percent to
create the third-best month in history.
</P>
<P>
   Minivan sales were off 19 percent, mostly because inventories
were low after strong sales in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fall-off in minivan sales accounted for the drop in
our total sales,'' Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler vice president
for sales and marketing operations, said in an interview.
``Minivans had a huge month in May, and we sold out of hot-selling
minivan models. We're restocking our shelves right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But DaimlerChrysler sales were lower in a number of categories
other than minivans. Car sales dropped 14 percent. Sales of almost
every car model, including the Neon introduced this spring, showed
double-digit decreases. Only the Chrysler 300M and LHS, Dodge
Intrepid and low-volume Plymouth Prowler and Dodge Viper posted
increases. Truck sales were flat, while sales of sport-utility
vehicles, the Jeep brands and Dodge Durango, rose.
</P>
<P>
   Jameson noted that industry sales in the similar 1998 period
were extraordinarily high because Chrysler and Ford Motor Co.
offered incentive programs to match one that General Motors Corp.
had introduced. The programs expired at the end of last June.
</P>
<P>
   A different strategy by GM last month may have hurt
DaimlerChrysler sales, said David Healy, an auto analyst with
Burnham Securities Inc. in New York. In June, GM began aggressive
incentives that Healy estimated amounted to as much as $2,000 a
vehicle. But unlike the highly publicized GM Owner Loyalty program
last year, which covered all models nationwide, the most recent
round of incentives vary by region and by model.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM has been adding heavily but quietly to its incentives, and
that might have stolen from Chrysler sales,'' Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford are due to report their June sales on Friday. Both
are expected to show sales that are flat or up only modestly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite DaimlerChrysler's June sales decline, last month was
still its second-best June in history. The automaker set records
for second-quarter and first-half sales.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sales for the month are predicted to rise. Healy
forecasts a gain of 2 percent or 3 percent, for an annual rate of
17.5 million to 18 million total cars and light trucks. ``It will
be one of the best months ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other reports Thursday, Toyota said it had its best sales
month in history, as well as best second-quarter and first-half
sales. The company's just-introduced Tundra, which is intended to
compete head-on with full-size pickup trucks from Detroit's
automakers, was off to the fastest start of any vehicle Toyota has
ever introduced, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Honda set records for June and the first six months.
Sales of its new Odyssey minivan rose 268 percent, even though the
vehicle is still in short supply for it.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, which is in the midst of a new product blitz with this
spring's introduction of a new Xterra sport utility, Crew Cab
pickup truck and midsize Maxima car, had higher sales in June, too.
</P>
<P>
   European automakers also continued to report year-over-year
sales increases. Volkswagen recorded its best June since 1973 and
its best month since May 1979. VW's sales rose on the strength of
its redesigned compact Jetta and higher sales on its midsize Passat
and New Beetle. The company's Audi unit reported its best June
sales since 1987 and its best first-half since 1986. Every model in
its line recorded sales increases.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover, a unit of BMW, reported its strongest sales month of
1999 and its best first half ever, paced by its redesigned
Discovery sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Also reporting sales increases Thursday were Kia; Isuzu; Saab,
which is 50 percent owned by GM; Subaru; and Volvo, a Ford
subsidiary. Mitsubishi sales declined.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve Board to
increase a key interest rate is not expected to slow the sizzling
vehicle sales. ``We think it's full speed ahead for the foreseeable
future,'' Jameson said.

BOSTON BUSINESSMAN MUGAR AMONG POTENTIAL ATHLETICS BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For two decades he has been considered a potential
owner of the Red Sox, but Boston businessman David G. Mugar has
decided, at least for now, to try to buy a piece of the Oakland
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Mugar, and his family, have been named as part of a long list of
investors seeking to buy the troubled American League franchise.
The Mugars, including sons Jonathan and Peter, are limited partners
in Oakland Investors LP which has been designated the prospective
owner of the team by government officials in Oakland, who have been
seeking a new owner for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But does that end the speculation about Mugar and the Red Sox?
Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Several sports business experts said Thursday that obtaining
partial ownership of one franchise before moving on to own another
one, is a well-traveled path in professional sports. And Mugar did
not close the door on that possibility Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never say never,'' said Mugar, who was busy preparing
for the fireworks display he produces annually on the Charles River
to celebrate Independence Day. ``But my main interest here now, if
our group is approved, is helping to build a championship team for
the City of Oakland. And making a commitment to provide the best
management we can for that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, the Red Sox are John Harrington's.
They belong to John Harrington and his group, and I will do
anything I can to support him and to insure that the new Fenway
Park, as proposed, is built.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Mugar and the Red Sox Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski
pursued a share of the ownership of the team, in a titanic struggle
among the late Jean Yawkey, John Harrington, Buddy LeRoux, Haywood
Sullivan, Rogers Badgett. Had LeRoux won out, Mugar would likely
have joined him as part of the partnership controlling the Red Sox.
But Yawkey, Harrington and Sullivan triumphed, and Harrington still
presides over the team today.
</P>
<P>
   As the Red Sox attempt to accumulate financing for a $545 new
stadium project, considerable speculation centers on how much of
the tab the current ownership can afford. Some observers have
suggested that the current ownership group might require a
financial partner, but Harrington has repeatedly denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need one for this project,'' Harrington said, in an
interview last month. ``I think when our financing package is
finalized you will see a significant private investment in this
project _ one of the largest private investments made by any
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mugar, a millionaire whose family's money comes from
having owned the Star Market chain and a number of lucrative real
estate deals since then as part of Mugar Enterprises, is looking
forward to his potential participation in the ownership of the
Oakland team. Leading the effort is Robert Piccinini, who owns and
operates the California-based Save Mart Supermarkets, and Andy
Dolich, a former executive of the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all arisen in the past few weeks, frankly,'' Mugar
said. ``My son John will complete his masters at Tufts in another
month or so, and a good friend of his has been Andy Dolich's son.
They played on the Tufts baseball team together for a number of
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Dolich mentioned to his son about being involved in this
group trying to purchase the A's,'' Mugar said. ``His son mentioned
it to my son John, and John mentioned it to us, as to whether we
might be interested _ and the answer was yes. And here we are. It's
that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes other, significant Boston players. Game Plan
PLC, a local investment bank that includes Robert Caporale, was
secured as a financial adviser to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum
Authority, in part, to help find a new owner for the Athletics.
Fleet Financial Group would finance the purchase for Oakland
Investors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other limited partners is Hall of Fame slugger Reggie
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The current saga of the Oakland Athletics is a tortured tale of
an ownership that wants to get rid of the team and a city and
county that want to insure that Major League Baseball stays in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Investors LP, is seeking to purchase the team for $122.4
million from Steve Schott and Ken Hoffman. The price was worked out
in a settlement with the city of Oakland and Alameda County that
stipulates the sale must close by September 21. If not, Schott and
Hofmann retain ownership, with the prospect that the team might be
moved.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the process is approval of the sale by Major
League Baseball, which could occur as soon an owners' meeting on
Sept. 16.

   CLINTON LIFTS EXPORT RESTRICTIONS ON COMPUTERS
</P>
<P>
   618. Moving on (w) washington and f(financial) wires.
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Deans
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bowing to dramatic gains in the speed and power of
computers, President Clinton took steps Thursday aimed at making it
easier for U.S. computer makers to export some of their most
advanced wares to potential foes of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With today's personal and business computers now rivalling what
were considered to be exotic supercomputers less than five years
ago, Clinton announced plans to relax export restrictions that were
designed to keep advanced information technology out of the hands
of countries such as Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The move amounted to an admission that the pace of computer
advances has simply outstripped the ability of the Cold War era
export controls to regulate the sale of machines that are capable
of performing billions of operations per second. Machines that once
were the property of spymasters and smugglers are now the domain of
shopping malls and mail-order catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the administration concluded that computers capable of
performing up to 6.5 billion theoretical operations per second have
become so widespread and easily obtainable that their sales cannot
be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reforms are needed because of the extraordinarily rapid
rate of
</P>
<P>
   technological change in the computer industry,'' Clinton said in
a prepared statement. ``The number-crunching ability of a
supercomputer that once filled a room and cost millions of dollars
is now available in an inexpensive desktop computer.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision, after months of analysis, represents a major
victory for American computer makers. They have argued that the
controls were no longer effective, as such machines are now widely
available at prices well below $1,500 from Asian and European
manufacturers. Continuing the restrictions, the industry argued,
could result in the loss of $4 billion worth of sales over the next
four years to U.S. competitors overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed that position against fears within the national
security community that relaxing export controls on powerful U.S.
computers would trigger uncontrollable proliferation of advanced
machines. Those machines could be used to assist rival nations,
pariah states and even terrorist groups in their efforts to build
and deploy a new generation of threats to U.S. interests. The
threats, many fear, would include information warfare _ the
attacking of computer systems _ high-tech espionage and the design
and production of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decided that the existing export control regime _ passed
by Congress in 1996 _ would only fence U.S. companies out of the
global market for some 5 million high-powered computers a year,
without having a decisive impact on U.S. security interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining these controls would hurt U.S. exports,'' Clinton
said, ``without benefiting our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, manufacturers must obtain federal approval to
sell advanced computers to certain countries, which are divided
into four categories according to the threat they pose to U.S.
interests.
</P>
<P>
   For example, manufacturers must obtain federal approval to sell
computers that perform more than 2 billion operations per second to
countries such as China, India, Pakistan and the states that once
made up the Soviet Union. Clinton has proposed eliminating that
requirement for machines capable of performing 6.5 billion
operations or less per second.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed no change in what amounts to an embargo on U.S.
computer sales to so-called pariah states such as Iraq, North
Korea, Libya, Cuba, Sudan and Syria.

CLINTON SAYS GORE'S IDEAS, NOT BUSH'S MONEY, THAT'S IMPORTANT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Offering his two cents on George W. Bush's $36.2
million, President Clinton said Thursday that Al Gore's ideas, not
the Texas governor's money, will win the presidential election in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton criticized Bush for considering bypassing federal
campaign spending rules, suggesting the governor would join
Republican leaders in their hostility toward campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, hosting a news conference with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, stepped into the 2000 presidential contest when asked to
comment about Bush's record-setting $36.2 million war chest and
about reports that Bush may avoid requesting federal matching funds
so he can spend an unlimited sum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush not only has raised 10 times the amount of his Republican
rivals but nearly twice as much as Vice President Gore who
generated $18 million for his Democratic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ideas, not the money, that's important, Clinton
responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of the Republican Party in general are
unanimously hostile to campaign finance reform. They don't believe
in it,'' Clinton said. ``If he (Bush) did that, he would have that
in common with the other leaders who won't permit us to bring the
(campaign finance reform) bill to a vote, or to try to pursue what
I believe are needed changes in the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are going to have to make up their minds
whether this is an important issue to them or not. I think the most
valuable commodity in an election ... even more valuable than
money, is ideas,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that the most important thing, therefore, that I
have seen in this election so far is that Vice President Gore is,
as nearly as I can determine, the only candidate of either party
who has actually told the American people what he would do if he
got elected,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton demurred when asked if Bush has wrapped up his
party's nomination. ``How do I know what the Republicans are going
to do in their nominating process? I don't have a clue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Bush, said, ``The Democrats must
be very nervous about the tremendous grass-roots enthusiasm Gov.
Bush is generating all across America to have the incumbent
president of the United States directly attack a Republican who has
not even won his own party's nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that in four months Bush has been able to attract
contributions from 75,000 Americans. Bush has voiced support for
more disclosure of campaign donations but has not embraced specific
legislation pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very unusual to attack a Republican who has not
even won his own party's nomination,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will decide next month whether to take federal matching
funds and be bound by a state-by-state spending limit. There is a
total spending limit of about $48 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's withering financial prowess sparked a bipartisan emphasis
on the ``it's the ideas; not the money'' response.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire who in
his 1996 campaign spent $37 million of his personal money, said he
will match Bush's spending. ``We'll make sure our message gets out
there. I'm not going to put a number because I want to keep him and
others guessing,'' Forbes told CNN. ``I think they are afraid more
of my ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Underdog conservative Gary Bauer, said, ``If elections could be
bought, (Texas billionaire) Ross Perot would be ending his second
presidential term. So I think, at the end of the day, ideas matter
and I think the ideas I have are much more in line with Republican
voters than this sort of mushy comments we're hearing out of
Austin, Texas, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments in support of Gore sparked questions about
whether it was a slap at former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the
vice president's only Democratic challenger. He has raised a
surprising $11 million in his challenge for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a dig at Sen. Bradley. He has said himself that he
has not laid out his case for being president and said that he
wants to wait until the fall to do it. But I personally have always
believed that you should begin by saying why you want the job
because you are asking people to hire you to do things and I think
the vice president deserves a lot of credit for doing that,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's promotion of Gore's candidacy comes amid White House
denials of any rift between the two. Gore reportedly was miffed at
Clinton for calling a New York Times reporter and offering the vice
president tips on campaigning while Clinton reportedly was steamed
at Gore for the latter's attempt to distance himself on moral
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton insisted he was bewildered by such reports. ``I
honestly do not know what the source of the stories are. But they
are not in my heart or my mind,'' he said, praising Gore's
presidential announcement address last month.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he expected Gore and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, should she run for the New York Senate seat, to
distance themselves from some of his decisions and he welcomed
their differences of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he disagrees with a decision that I make as president
during the next year and a half, then, of course, he will have to
say so. And I will take no offense of that,'' Clinton said. The
president said the same of true for his wife should she run for
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the first lady may have to state publicly her
disagreements over decisions he has made as president. ``And that's
the way democracy works,'' he said. ``It would be a dreary world,
indeed, if we all agreed on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he did not select Gore to be vice president
so he would agree with everything he did.

BOSTON BUSINESSMAN MUGAR AMONG POTENTIAL ATHLETICS BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For two decades he has been considered a potential
owner of the Red Sox, but Boston businessman David G. Mugar has
decided, at least for now, to try to buy a piece of the Oakland
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Mugar, and his family, have been named as part of a long list of
investors seeking to buy the troubled American League franchise.
The Mugars, including sons Jonathan and Peter, are limited partners
in Oakland Investors LP which has been designated the prospective
owner of the team by government officials in Oakland, who have been
seeking a new owner for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But does that end the speculation about Mugar and the Red Sox?
Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Several sports business experts said Thursday that obtaining
partial ownership of one franchise before moving on to own another
one, is a well-traveled path in professional sports. And Mugar did
not close the door on that possibility Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never say never,'' said Mugar, who was busy preparing
for the fireworks display he produces annually on the Charles River
to celebrate Independence Day. ``But my main interest here now, if
our group is approved, is helping to build a championship team for
the City of Oakland. And making a commitment to provide the best
management we can for that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, the Red Sox are John Harrington's.
They belong to John Harrington and his group, and I will do
anything I can to support him and to insure that the new Fenway
Park, as proposed, is built.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Mugar and the Red Sox Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski
pursued a share of the ownership of the team, in a titanic struggle
among the late Jean Yawkey, John Harrington, Buddy LeRoux, Haywood
Sullivan, Rogers Badgett. Had LeRoux won out, Mugar would likely
have joined him as part of the partnership controlling the Red Sox.
But Yawkey, Harrington and Sullivan triumphed, and Harrington still
presides over the team today.
</P>
<P>
   As the Red Sox attempt to accumulate financing for a $545 new
stadium project, considerable speculation centers on how much of
the tab the current ownership can afford. Some observers have
suggested that the current ownership group might require a
financial partner, but Harrington has repeatedly denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need one for this project,'' Harrington said, in an
interview last month. ``I think when our financing package is
finalized you will see a significant private investment in this
project _ one of the largest private investments made by any
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mugar, a millionaire whose family's money comes from
having owned the Star Market chain and a number of lucrative real
estate deals since then as part of Mugar Enterprises, is looking
forward to his potential participation in the ownership of the
Oakland team. Leading the effort is Robert Piccinini, who owns and
operates the California-based Save Mart Supermarkets, and Andy
Dolich, a former executive of the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all arisen in the past few weeks, frankly,'' Mugar
said. ``My son John will complete his masters at Tufts in another
month or so, and a good friend of his has been Andy Dolich's son.
They played on the Tufts baseball team together for a number of
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Dolich mentioned to his son about being involved in this
group trying to purchase the A's,'' Mugar said. ``His son mentioned
it to my son John, and John mentioned it to us, as to whether we
might be interested _ and the answer was yes. And here we are. It's
that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes other, significant Boston players. Game Plan
PLC, a local investment bank that includes Robert Caporale, was
secured as a financial adviser to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum
Authority, in part, to help find a new owner for the Athletics.
Fleet Financial Group would finance the purchase for Oakland
Investors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other limited partners is Hall of Fame slugger Reggie
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The current saga of the Oakland Athletics is a tortured tale of
an ownership that wants to get rid of the team and a city and
county that want to insure that Major League Baseball stays in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Investors LP, is seeking to purchase the team for $122.4
million from Steve Schott and Ken Hoffman. The price was worked out
in a settlement with the city of Oakland and Alameda County that
stipulates the sale must close by September 21. If not, Schott and
Hofmann retain ownership, with the prospect that the team might be
moved.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the process is approval of the sale by Major
League Baseball, which could occur as soon an owners' meeting on
Sept. 16.

HMOS WILL CULL 250,000 MEDICARE MEMBERS JAN. 1, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Blaming lower federal payment rates, HMOs nationally
will drop a quarter-million Medicare subscribers on January 1,
industry officials said Thursday. But the 228,000 Massachusetts
elders who belong to HMOs will be largely safe from such care
disruptions _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   The exception will be some residents of southeastern, central
and western Massachusetts who will have to pay monthly premiums of
$30 to $50 if they want to remain in the state's two largest
Medicare HMOs, Tufts Health Plan's Secure Horizons and Harvard
Pilgrim Health Plan's First Seniority. Up to now, Medicare HMOs
have managed on federal payments alone, without charging
subscribers any premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon's Senior Plan will continue to be premium-free for its
34,000 members. Officials of Blue Cross-Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, which enrolls about 16,000 elders in its HMO Blue,
refused to divulge details of the year 2000 plan it filed this week
with Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Except for First Seniority _ which announced last month it would
cease providing coverage to 3,500 members in western Massachusetts
_ Massachusetts HMOs are staying in the Medicare program. But all
are raising the amounts that members must pay out of pocket,
especially for prescription drugs, and some are reducing other
benefits too.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all Medicare HMO subscribers in Massachusetts _ if not
nationally _ will end up paying more out of their own pockets for
prescription drugs, as health plans struggle to tame pharmacy costs
rising at around 15 percent a year. Especially costly will be
high-priced brand-name drugs that have cheaper and equally
effective alternatives _ in the HMOs' judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Massachusetts elders will also begin to notice
higher charges and erosion of their HMO benefits beginning in
January, a trend that industry leaders said will affect virtually
all 6.2 million subscribers in Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, First Seniority's 68,000 members will pay $50 if
they go to the emergency room but don't require hospital admission,
twice the current hit. The plan will no longer pay half their
routine dental bills, either, although members will get a discount
from dentists' normal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the nation, HMOs are raising premiums, raising
copayments, raising deductibles, cutting back benefits, and blaming
Medicare payments,'' said Geoff Wilkinson of Massachusetts Senior
Action Council, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are convinced that rising prescription drug costs are
more a factor in these cutbacks than the Medicare payments, but
it's hard to cost that out,'' Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim, which may lose up to $30 million on its First
Seniority plan this year, is the most aggressive in seeking more
money from its 68,000 elderly subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   First Seniority members in Barnstable and Bristol counties will
have to pay $50 a month if they want to stay in the program next
year, while members in Plymouth and Worcester counties will pay $30
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Without those new premiums, said Harvard Pilgrim chief executive
Charles D. Baker Jr., his HMO would have had to stop offering
Medicare plans in much of Massachusetts. ``Barnstable, Bristol, and
Worcester (counties) were up for grabs,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollees in Tufts' Secure Horizons who live in Barnstable and
Bristol counties will be charged $30 a month, while those in
Hampden county will have to pay $35 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   All changes are subject to approval by federal Medicare
officials. HMOs had to file their plans for 2000 Thursday with the
federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, when HMOs announce their Medicare plans for
2001, ``it's not at all unlikely that members will have to pay
premiums'' wherever they live, said Patty Blake of Secure Horizons,
the state's largest Medicare HMO with 97,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Blake said, is that Secure Horizons projects its
federal Medicare payments to fall eight percent while its costs of
providing care will rise by five percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials insist that Medicare payments to HMOs are too
generous. ``Studies continue to show that Medicare managed care
plans are still being overpaid,'' said Nancy Ann DeParle,
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignani, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, rejected DeParle's assertion as out-of-date. ``Health plans
that are overpaid don't leave the program and cut benefits,''
Ignani said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The health plan association released results of a survey of 23
large Medicare HMOs enrolling about 4 million of the 6.1 million
Americans enrolled in such plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ignani said HMOs serving 250,000 elders will drop out of the
Medicare program January 1, bringing to about 700,000 the number
dropped since last October. ``This program is in crisis,'' Ignani
said.

CLINTON RELAXES RULES ON COMPUTER EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday sharply eased
restrictions on computers that U.S. companies can export to
countries like Russia and China, arguing that advances in
technology have made ordinary machines just as powerful as the
supercomputers of a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision marked a major victory for U.S. computer
makers, who lobbied hard for the change so they could export
products unfettered by regulations that have given foreign
competitors a big advantage in overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old regulations, exports of machines with high-speed
computer chips were restricted because they could be used for
military purposes. But those kinds of chips are now so widely
available that they are commonly installed on personal computers
sold at computer stores and over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While most elements of Clinton's order go into effect
immediately, Congress has six months to review his decision, which
will allow the Chinese military _ and military-related groups in
the Middle East, India, Pakistan and the former Soviet Union _ to
buy computers that are three times more powerful than those allowed
under current rules.
</P>
<P>
   With the rule change the administration appeared to be moving to
a different philosophy on export controls: It is virtually giving
up efforts to control mass-produced computer technology, no matter
how powerful. Instead, it is focusing its export control efforts on
the most specialized, high-end machines and software. ``We need to
focus our resources on products that are not widely available,''
John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, even some of the harshest critics of the leakage of
nuclear technology to China have not objected to the
administration's actions. The frontrunner for the Republican
presidential nomination, George W. Bush Jr., was fundraising
Thursday in Silicon Valley, among the executives who have pressed
hardest for the change.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by Bush's campaign in California, the
Texas governor appeared to be in general agreement with the
administration position, saying that ``the current system of export
controls is broken. Too often it penalizes our high-tech companies
by controlling technology that is widely available from other
countries while failing to prevent unique technology from falling
into dangerous hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement, said that maintaining the current level
of controls ``would hurt U.S. exports without benefiting our
national security.'' His commerce secretary, William Daley, held a
Sony Playstation aloft in the White House press room Thursday, and
said that unless the export controls were eased, a powerful new
version of the popular game machine available this Christmas would
be classified as a restricted supercomputer under existing U.S.
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of high-speed chips in everyday personal
computers and games forced the administration's hand in announcing
the liberalization of the rules, the first since 1996. But the fact
remains that the new regulations will allow U.S. manufacturers to
sell computers around the world, without export licenses or
government review, that are equally powerful to those used for
nuclear weapons design a decade ago. National security officials
said that the kind of machines currently used to simulate nuclear
explosions, however, will remain strictly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our security concerns were heard at every corner,'' the deputy
secretary of defense, John Hamre, said Thursday, when pressed on
whether America's commercial interests were trumping its interests
in controlling technology that clearly can be used by nations
seeking to produce advanced weapons. But, he added, ``there is no
way in which we can control supercomputers, which now are available
in the tens of thousands per month or hundreds of thousands per
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the definition of a controlled computer or computer
chip _ the kind that requires an export license to countries
considered a ``proliferation risk'' _ seems likely to change more
frequently. Podesta, said that Washington would now review its
export control limits every six months, and raise them if they have
become outdated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, amid the revelations of spying and lax
security at Los Alamos National Laboratory, it seemed unlikely that
the White House would take the political risk of liberalizing the
rules on computer exports. But the chief executives of several high
technology firms, from Lewis M. Platt of Hewlett-Packard to Andrew
S. Grove, the chairman of Intel, made the case that unless the U.S.
rules were relaxed, billions in sales would be lost to European and
Japanese manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a moment when a technology is so widely available
that the kind of limits that we put in place just a few years ago
simply don't make any sense anymore,'' Platt said during an
lobbying trip last month.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation of computers and microprocessors has long been
based on a rough measure of their speed: Millions of theoretical
operations per second, or MTOPS. As a benchmark, a fast version of
Intel's Pentium III chip, the standard in many $2,000 personal
computer systems today, is rated at about 1,300 MTOPS. New versions
of the chip, due out later this year, will top 2,000 MTOPS, and may
be connected together in computers that will run at 12,000 MTOPS or
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all computers can be shipped to America's closest
allies _ Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New
Zealand _ regardless of their speed. The White House said Thursday
that Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic _ the new members of
NATO _ and Brazil will be added to that list.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter restrictions apply to a second class of countries,
including most of South America, South Korea, South Africa, and
much of Southeast Asia. Under current rules, companies need to
obtain individual export licenses to ship computers that run faster
than 10,000 MTOPS to those nations. But companies have complained
that they are losing sales of faster personal computers and ``file
servers'' that are commonly found in ordinary offices. Clinton's
order doubles that limit to 20,000 MTOPS.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounds the third category: nations that are
considered ``proliferation risks.'' They include China, Russia,
Vietnam and most Middle Eastern countries.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rule companies must get individual licenses to
ship any computer faster than 2,000 MTOPS to a military user, and
faster than 7000 MTOPS for civilian users. But experts say the
distinction is becoming meaningless: There is no way to assure that
a fast personal computer sold to a civilian users in China does not
make its way into the hands of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal is to raise the limit for military users to
6,500 MTOPS, and for civilian users to 12,300 MTOPS. The latter
figure was proposed by the computer industry, which fears that
billions of dollars of sales to the Chinese market could be lost if
the rules are not changed by year's end.

COMMENTARY: WAS KOSOVO WORLD WAR III? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A thoughtful reader, Allan Hoving, sent me a note asking an
intriguing question: Was Kosovo actually World War III? ``OK, so it
was a short one, as world wars go, just 80 days,'' he wrote. ``But
think about it: There was genocide by indicted war criminals, and
the threat of nuclear war. Nearly every major power was involved _
even China. And historic realignments have emerged. . . . All this
without a single allied combat casualty _ not too shabby for a
world war.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is Kosovo was not comparable to World War I or II.
Those wars were earthquakes. But while Kosovo was no earthquake, it
was a bolt of lightning that certainly illuminated the new
international system we are now in, the system of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the NATO intervention in the Balkans was made
possible by the fact that the two great wars in Europe in this
century _ the great tribal war between Germany and France, which
was at the heart of World Wars I and II, and the Cold War between
the U.S. and the USSR _ had both subsided, erasing the most
important and paralyzing divisions and walls in Europe. The
German-French entente made NATO intervention to quash the Balkan
civil wars possible, and the collapse of the Soviet Union made
NATO's intervention deep into the former Soviet sphere of influence
permissible.
</P>
<P>
   The falling of walls, and globalization, played another role in
this war as well. When the war in Kosovo erupted, several people
asked whether it didn't make obsolete my Golden Arches Theory of
Conflict Prevention, which pointed out that ``No two countries that
both had a McDonald's had ever fought a war against each other
since they each got their McDonald's.'' After all, Belgrade had
McDonald's, as did every NATO country. My answer was, let's see how
the war ends.
</P>
<P>
   Look what happened. As the Pentagon will tell you, air power
alone brought this war to a close in 78 days for one reason _ not
because NATO made life impossible for the Serb troops in Kosovo
(look how much armor they drove out of there), but because NATO
made life miserable for the Serb civilians in Belgrade. Belgrade is
a modern city integrated with Western Europe, with a population
that wants to be part of today's main global trends, from the
Internet to economic development, which the presence of McDonald's
symbolizes.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO turned out the lights in Belgrade, and shut down the
power grids and the economy, Belgrade's citizens demanded an end to
the war. It's that simple. Not only did NATO soldiers not want to
die for Kosovo _ neither did the Serbs of Belgrade. They wanted to
be part of the world, more than they wanted Kosovo to be part of
them. They wanted McDonald's re-opened, much more than they wanted
Kosovo re-occupied. So, yes, there is now one exception to the
Golden Arches Theory _ an exception that, in the end, only proves
how powerful is the rule.
</P>
<P>
   This war also illustrated just how much the world is now
dominated by U.S. power. Russia and China, as much as they chafed
at this war, were unable to do anything about it. I was in the
lobby of NATO's Brussels headquarters last month when I saw a
Russian woman journalist there, walking in circles next to the Coke
machine, talking on her cell phone in Russian. She reminded me of
Russia's troops in Kosovo, trying to assert their identity in a
world of pax Americana. But that's why this war also highlighted
the backlash brewing against America, which is now referred to as
``the capital of global arrogance,'' not only by Iranians, but by
Russians, Chinese and half our NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is much that was post-modern about this war,
there was something pre-modern as well _ the barbaric
mass-murdering and rapes that the Serb military engaged in in
Kosovo. This was old-fashioned evil, although even it had a certain
bizarre 21st century twist.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs quickly realized that U.S. satellites were now so good
they could track every mass grave they dug, down to the shovels.
``So in the end they were even more brutal,'' said David Scheffer,
the U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes issues. ``The Serbs
tried to erase the evidence of their behavior by burning bodies,
excavating graves, destroying documents and even abducting Kosovar
witnesses and taking them away with them.'' But modernity may catch
up with them, notes Scheffer, because forensic technology is now so
sophisticated: at one mass grave site _ Izbica _ FBI experts have
been able to document what happened from scraps of evidence, even
though all 155 bodies were removed.
</P>
<P>
   So, no, Kosovo wasn't WWIII. It didn't change the world, but it
has illuminated how much the world has changed.

GRAF ELIMINATES VENUS WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Call it a long day's damp journey into night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a drama in four uneven acts and uncertain intermissions
for two heroines, antagonists Steffi Graf and Venus Williams,
clawing at each other. With the yellow lights of the scoreboard and
silver blinks of spectators' flashbulbs illuminating the tense,
darkening amphitheater, the match had unfolded across seven hours,
a microcosm of Graf's turbulent career _ often derailed,
ever-renewed, with yet another triumphant ending.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, at 30 the grande dame of Wimbledon's Centre Court, with
seven championships in her satchel, and itching for an eighth, had
``never gone through anything quite like it. The stopping and
starting for the rain, the hardest of my (10) quarterfinals here
because of Venus. I couldn't believe we could keep up at such a
level with the interruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, green as the grass underfoot when it comes to playing
tennis on the stuff, is nevertheless a quick study. She pushed and
prodded Graf to the heights after a flat start, came within two
points of extending the plot into Friday, but couldn't quite keep
up, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Had Williams, cornering Graf at 15-30 in the last game,
splintered the victor's serve there, it would have been a
to-be-continued situation. The clock shone 8:12 of a dim, dank
evening. But the kid made three errors and the weird day, so
frustrating to players and 30,223 patrons, squished to a close in
one more downpour.
</P>
<P>
   So much water, so much waiting _ and merely two results where
eight were intended in singles. Lindsay Davenport, showing total
disregard for royalty, deposed 1998 queen Jana Novotna, 6-3, 6-4,
to join Graf in the semis, though on the other side of the draw.
They appear destined for a championship showdown Sunday, when both
men's and women's finals are to be played if the truculent weather
behaves.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else, including five-time champ Pete Sampras, was left
hung up, some high and wet with matches in various states of
progress, others, like Pete, never out of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds and clouds converged on the venerable tennis ballpark,
and the gloomy, greasy clouds won. Again. But there was hope every
time showers relented and the heroic grounds crew responded to the
referee's command of ``Take it off!'' by removing the tarpaulins.
</P>
<P>
   This happened over and over, and each time a little more was
seen of such as Graf, Williams, the reigning Novotna, Davenport,
and the startling kiddies, qualifiers Alexandra Stevenson, 18, and
Jelena Dokic, 16.
</P>
<P>
   As persistent showers tormented the quarterfinalists, the
luckiest lady on the grassy runway was Davenport, the 6-foot-3-inch
US Open champ: she came off fairly early with the first result of
the day. Fitting her thundering groundies into openings in the
atmosphere and along the lines in Court 1, Davenport dethroned
Novotna is a crisp 67-minute performance of only two acts,
separated by a one-hour intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The rest weren't so fortunate, stranded in various states of
disarray, their emotions stripped by the disjointed
on-again-off-again rhythm. France's Nathalie Tauziat, finalist a
year ago to Novotna, leads 17-year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic, 6-4,
3-3. Stevenson started brilliantly against the intransigent Dokic,
victimizer of Martina Hingis, but is way behind in the second, 6-3,
1-5. Todd Martin and Patrick Rafter are locked at 3-3. Tim Henman,
the most famous English Tim since the tiny Cratchitt, has leaped
all the way to a 1-0 lead over Cedric Pioline by winning his serve.
</P>
<P>
   Believing in herself as never before, Davenport continued her
stranglehold (6-0) over Novotna and is ``starting to get the feel
for grass. I've lost the last two times I was in the quarters here.
I was upset with myself when I didn't serve it out at 5-3, but
really pleased I immediately broke her to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On match point, Lindsay uncharacteristically headed for the net
behind a dinky chipped forehand. ``It wasn't much, but I figured
she'd have to pass me.'' She didn't. Novotna's backhand landed just
over the baseline and the queen was dead at 3:10.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if theirs would be the sole result. At that time
Venus and Steffi were in the midst of an all-day excursion that
began at 1:06.
</P>
<P>
   Their four acts went like this:
</P>
<P>
   I _ Steffi wins the first set; trails, 2-3, in the second.
</P>
<P>
   II _ Venus wins the second set and leads, 1-0, in the third.
</P>
<P>
   III _ They're even at 2-2 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   IV _ The core, the fifth and sixth games, before Steffi emerges
a waterlogged winner.
</P>
<P>
   During their last dressing room sojourn, drying out by reading a
book about the Sahara Desert, Graf ``figured I had to be
aggressive.'' Stubborn baselining, backboned by her wondrous
forehand, wasn't enough. Streaking in for volleys on the critical
points, she cracked Williams to 3-2, and held to 4-2 through the
excitement of four deuces and three break points. She was ``happy
the way I played break points'' _ saving 12 of 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have been the aggressor in those games myself,''
Williams said correctly. ``There were more rain delays than I ever
dreamed of, but I was OK. The conditions, the lack of light didn't
bother me. But Steffi has the will; she's famous for it. But I'll
keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be No. 1 one day,'' Graf praised her adversary. ``It
was incredible the shots she ran down. I've never seen anybody with
such lateral movement.''
</P>
<P>
   They were dashing, bashing combatants who saved a miserable day
with magnificent shotmaking in the concluding stages of an
engagement that lasted 1:55 in playing time. Give them rave
notices, but can anyone take center stage from Steffi?
</P>
<P>
   A Wimbledon that began with such sunny promise the first week
has been jammed into a mess that may not end until Monday, or even
Tuesday. Sampras, thus far untested, is now faced with the
goliathan Mark Philippoussis, and the prospect of three matches in
as many days to keep his title and establish himself as the male
player of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Graf already has done that in her precinct.

 &HT;    Free PCs deals legit, but not always best
 &HT;    By Shannon Shelton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computer costs have consistently been falling over the
past few years. But at two popular computer stores Thursday, it
appeared PCs had reached their lowest price ever _ free.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy and Circuit City, the nation's No. 1 and 2 computer
retailers, have unveiled a nationwide promotion offering a free PC
with the purchase of an Internet service package from a
store-chosen provider.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to go to either store without your wallet and
walk out with a new PC. Consumers have to pay for the CPU up front,
then send for a rebate check after installing the Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   At both stores, that means buying a PC worth about $400 or more,
then purchasing a $19 to $22-per-month Internet service for three
years to get a $400 rebate. The deals also don't include monitors
or printers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stewart, national spokesperson for Richmond, Va.-based
Circuit City, said even though buyers have to send for the money,
ultimately they'll still end up with a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get Internet service, you have to pay for it
anyway,'' Stewart said. ``With this program, you get the service
and a personal computer. I don't know how you can argue this isn't
a free PC.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Fernando Mujica, an Atlanta resident shopping for a
computer at Circuit City, thought the work involved in getting the
``free'' PC wasn't worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty annoying to send for the money,'' Mujica said.
``The catch to this deal is bigger than it appears.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry McCracken, a senior writer for PC World magazine, said
``free PC'' deals usually leave a lot to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these deals look very compelling,'' McCracken said.
``You're signing up at one set price for several years when prices
are falling for Internet connection. In addition, there are hot new
technologies, such as cable modems and DSL, coming along to offer
quicker Internet connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of stiff penalties, consumers could indeed feel locked
into a contract they may want to break sooner than the termination
date.
</P>
<P>
   At Circuit City, a buyer who ends the service within a year will
have to pay back the $400 and be subject to a $50 fee. Best Buy has
similar penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Smith, president of the Atlanta Better Business Bureau, said
although this promotion is legitimate, potential buyers should make
sure that they understand all the terms and that the offer fits
their needs. ``This seems to meet the standards on the use of the
word 'free' because they have disclosed the terms of the deal,''
Smith said. ``But consumers should comparison shop to see if the
items are competitively priced and see if they are really receiving
a value.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 3 p.m. at an Atlanta Circuit City, computer department
supervisor Germaine Nash said some shoppers had been asking about
the free PC offer. He expected purchases to pick up more in the
evening and over the weekend, when store volume normally increases.
</P>
<P>
   As for the customers who were looking around at that time, none
seemed particularly drawn to the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Romain Murenzi, a Clark Atlanta University physics professor
searching for a computer to take on an educational trip to Rwanda,
said he was shopping anyway and wasn't drawn by the offer. ``I'll
be more than happy to take a look at it, but if it's not the best
deal, I won't get it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THE GIVEAWAY DEALS
</P>
<P>
   A number of Internet access providers are giving away ``free''
computers or rebates on more expensive machines. Here are some of
the deals:
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers will receive a $400 rebate for 36 months of Internet
service from Prodigy, which costs $19.95 per month. Customers must
install the Prodigy service to receive the rebate check.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Buy says the $400 price will cover the cost of many
entry-level PCs, making them essentially ``free.'' The rebate does
not cover the cost of a monitor or printer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Customers can also purchase shorter Internet plans _ one year
nets a $100 rebate, and two years earns $250.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cancellation rates apply.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers must purchase 36 months of Internet access from
CompuServe at $21.95 a month. After installing the service,
customers can then send for a $400 rebate check that should arrive
in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rebate applies to any PC purchase, as long as the
CompuServe program is installed. Circuit City is offering a PC from
emachines for $474. emachines is offering a $75 rebate. With both
rebates, the computer becomes ``free.'' Again, monitors and
printers are not included.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cancellation rates apply.

THEOLOGIANS DEBATE ETHICS OF EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is research on human embryonic stem cells ethically justified?
Theologians have a clear answer _ in fact quite a few of them,
depending both on their faith and their relative position within
it.
</P>
<P>
   The research, made possible by a discovery in November, provokes
a stark moral choice: the primordial cells can give rise to all
kinds of human tissue, making them potentially priceless as tools
to repair aging and ailing bodies. But in most cases a human embryo
must be destroyed to obtain them.
</P>
<P>
   That clash of values has generated some richly dissonant
conclusions. ``The prospect of government-sponsored experiments to
manipulate and destroy human embryos should make us all lie awake
at night,'' said a position paper issued this week by Sen. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., and endorsed by Catholic and Protestant
opponents of abortion. ``That some individuals would be destroyed
in the name of medical science constitutes a threat to us all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Patients Coalition for Urgent Research, a consortium of
more than 20 disease advocacy organizations responded that stem
cell research should proceed ``in order to speed the day when
millions of sufferers will find relief from the ravages of
catastrophic illness and disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback's statement represents only one position, though an
important one, on a spectrum of theological views. Many, but not
all, Catholics believe that from the moment of conception the
embryo merits full protection as a person. The two principal
sources of embryonic stem cells _ spare embryos from fertility
clinics and aborted fetuses _ are both unacceptable, in this view,
because they involve the intentional destruction of an individual.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish analysis, on the other hand, holds that embryos
outside the body have no moral status. In this view, spare embryos
present no problem as a source of stem cells, nor do aborted
fetuses provided that the abortion took place for ethically
acceptable reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Spare embryos, the principal source of embryonic stem cells, are
the unavoidably surplus unions of sperm and egg produced in
fertility clinics. The embryos are often stored for years and
ultimately discarded. Inside the embryo, which at this stage is
just a hollow sphere, rests a clump of about 100 cells known as the
inner cell mass. These cells, when cultured in the laboratory, are
the embryonic stem cells, and because they will grow and divide
indefinitely, a handful of embryos could provide a profusion of
stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   These circumstances may obscure but not alter the fact that an
embyro is destroyed in generating stem cells. In a draft report, in
language to which several scientific members objected at a meeting
this week, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission said, ``As
long as embryos are destroyed as part of the research enterprise,
researchers using embryonic cells (and those who fund them) will
generally be directly or indirectly complicit in the demise of
embryos.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of guilty complicity stems from the premise that an
entity tantamount to a person has been destroyed. This is the
official Catholic position, as represented by the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and is also held by some
Protestants. ``The availability of the embryos does not justify
their use,'' said Nigel Cameron, a Presbyterian at Trinity
International University in Deerfield, Ill. ``Here is one of us,
however primitive,'' he said, referring to the embryo, ``and the
question is whether members of the human species should be treated
as other than ends in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a considerable range of views among both
Protestant and Catholic ethicists who testified before the National
Bioethics Advisory Commission in May. Within both faiths, some
believed the interests of the embryo were paramount; others said
that the moral status of the early embryo was sufficiently
uncertain and that research should go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the Catholic tradition a case can be made both against
and for such research,'' Margaret Farley, professor of Christian
ethics at Yale University, told the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has argued
against the use of spare embryos and aborted fetuses on the grounds
that embryos are equivalent to people, ``a growing number of
Catholic moral theologians, for example, do not consider the human
embryo in its earliest stages (prior to the development of the
primitive streak or to implantation) to constitute an
individualized human entity,'' Ms. Farley said. The primitive
streak, which appears 14 days after conception, marks the first
appearance of the nervous system and the earliest possible
stirrings of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we are still learning about the realities of what
this entity the embryo is,'' Ms. Farley said in an interview, ``and
therefore we need to be open about its moral status.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There may be a period of time before the embryo becomes
individualized _ up to a certain stage it can split into twins, for
example. If so, ``then you can say that in those early days it
doesn't have to be protected as if it were a human being,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jewish analysis of embryonic stem cell research, there is
no problem in using spare embryos from fertility clinics, said
Rabbi Elliot Dorff, a professor of philosophy at the University of
Judaism in Los Angeles. The sperm and egg, and early embryos
derived from them, ``have no legal status whatever in Jewish law
when they are outside the womb, because they have no potential for
becoming a human being,'' he said. Medically beneficial research
with the embryos is therefore ``very much to be encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorff, who has written a book on medical ethics, noted that in
Jewish law the fetus is not regarded as a fully fledged human being
until it emerges from the womb, until which point the mother's
health takes precedence. For its first 40 days of existence the
fetus is seen ``as if it were water,'' the Talmud says.
</P>
<P>
   A second way of deriving human embryonic stem cells is from the
so-called germline cells obtainable from aborted fetuses. Abortions
are by and large prohibited by Jewish law, but there are cases when
they are required or permitted. ``If a fetus were aborted for good
and sufficient reason, we could use its stem cells for saving other
people's lives,'' Dorff said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorff, a Conservative rabbi, said there was a spectrum of
opinion from Orthodox to Reform Judaism about the permissibility of
abortion, but the differences did not extend to stem cell research.
``The Jewish tradition has had a virtual love affair with medicine
for 2,000 years because it has seen the physician as God's agent
and partner in the ongoing act of healing,'' he said.

GROWING SURPLUS UNLIKELY TO YIELD BIGGER TAX CUT, REPUBLICANS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Del., N.M., Ohio)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the projected federal budget surplus having
grown substantially since they first set their budget plans earlier
this year, Republican leaders in Congress said Thursday that they
would rethink their tax and spending proposals but would not
necessarily channel the entire windfall into a bigger tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The party's leadership in both the House and the Senate said the
new surplus projections made them more determined to pass a tax cut
of historic proportions despite the opposition of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But they backed off suggestions that they would expand their tax
cut to $1 trillion over the next decade, up from $778 billion under
their original plan. Instead, they said, the new surplus
projections provide an opportunity to divide the additional money
among a variety of needs, including a bigger tax cut, shoring up
Medicare and possibly easing a tight squeeze on spending for
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office projected Thursday that the
total budget surplus over the next decade would be $2.9 trillion,
$293 billion higher than it estimated three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the surplus comes from excess Social Security payroll
taxes, which both parties have agreed should be off limits when it
comes to financing tax cuts or new spending. The non-Social
Security portion of the surplus _ the part they consider available
for tax cuts and spending _ will be $996 billion over the next
decade, the budget office said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office's figures were slightly lower than projections
released on Monday by the White House's Office of Management and
Budget, which estimated the 10-year non-Social Security surplus at
$1.08 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laid out a plan on Monday that would allocate $250
billion over 10 years for tax cuts in the form of incentives to
low- and middle-income families to save more for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He would allocate the remaining $758 billion over 10 years to
Medicare ($374 billion), increased military spending ($127
billion), a broad array of domestic spending ($127 billion) and new
spending specifically for education and children's programs ($74
billion). An additional $132 billion would go to interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have not yet come up with a specific plan for how
they will spend the money. Prior to the new budget projections,
they had intended to use virtually all of the non-Social Security
surplus over the next decade to pay for their $778 billion tax cut.
They said they would develop a plan before Congress returns from
its July 4th recess in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said on Tuesday that he would like to use every penny of
the non-Social Security surplus for tax cuts. But on Thursday _ at
a rally where he unveiled a list of tax-cutting ideas to the
accompaniment of a fife and drums corps _ he said only that he
would use ``a major portion of the available surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., said all of the newly projected
non-Social Security surplus for next year _ estimated by the
Congressional Budget Office at $14 billion _ should go to
increasing the size of the tax cut. Before the new projections,
there was no non-Social Security surplus next year, meaning any tax
cut would not have taken effect until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the
additional money from the non-Social Security surplus in ensuing
years should be used first to help shore up Medicare and make
available a prescription drug benefit within the health insurance
system for the elderly and disabled. The drug benefit is a
cornerstone of Clinton's new Medicare proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, agreed that Congress should set aside money from the
non-Social Security surplus for Medicare. Domenici said he was also
open to the idea of using some of the new-found money to help ease
tight caps on spending that have made it all but impossible for
Congress to pass the appropriations bill necessary to keep the
government operating.
</P>
<P>
   Republican members of the appropriations committees in both
chambers have been pressing the party's leadership for months to
ease the caps, saying the alternative is gridlock. But their pleas
have only exacerbated the rift between the party's fiscal
conservatives, many of whom were elected on promises of slashing
spending, and those Republicans who consider themselves more
moderate or pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was willing to risk ``internal strife,'' Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee and a
presidential candidate, warned Republicans who are seeking to ease
the spending caps that they ``should not continue to operate under
the illusion that they can spend more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said he might be willing to negotiate a deal with Clinton
on new spending programs, but only in return for the Republicans'
getting a very large tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can give the president a few shekels,'' Kasich said, ``but
he's going to have to pay the price of giving power back to the
American people'' in the form of tax cuts.

 &HT;    Retooling Bulls one of draft's winners
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Much of the pre-NBA draft talk about trades was just
that _ talk. At least, that's how it looks. The league has a
moratorium on consummating deals until Aug. 1, meaning that team
officials can work on trades but not execute them until then.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the draft, as always, produced some winners and
losers _ and others. Here is a recap:
</P>
<P>
   Winners
</P>
<P>
   Chicago: The Bulls began their rebuilding with the solid Elton
Brand of Duke with the No. 1 pick and fortified their frontcourt
with defensive demon Ron Artest of St. John's. Those two could be
together for years to come. With about $13 million in salary-cap
space, Chicago still has room to be the big player in the
free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota: While Kevin McHale already has done a remarkable job
with the Timberwolves, considering defections by All-Star Tom
Gugliotta and Stephon Marbury in consecutive years, the team was
upgraded again with the selections of dead-eye shooting forward
Wally Szczerbiak with the sixth pick and point guard Willliam Avery
of Duke with the 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta: The troublesome position of point guard was filled by
talented rookie Jason Terry with the 10th pick. The Hawks could not
go into next season with Mookie Blaylock as the floor leader, and
Terry's presence and speed injects new blood and tempo.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland: The team with no coach did itself some good in
acquiring the backcourt of the future in Andre Miller (No. 8) and
Trajan Langdon (No.11). Miller is a point guard with poise, scoring
ability and passing skills. Langdon is the ideal complement, a
spot-up shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Miami: At No. 25, the Heat got a talented forward in Tim James,
who played collegiately at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Losers
</P>
<P>
   Dallas: Someone please explain how Don Nelson keeps a job. A
flop everywhere he has been the past five years, the general
manager/coach cast his ineptness again on the Mavericks. This time,
Nelson took Wang Zhi-Zhi of China with the 39th pick. Zhi-Zhi is
7-feet-4 with no discernible skills. Then Nelson traded with San
Antonio for the rights to high schooler Leon Smith.
</P>
<P>
   New York: With Artest available, the Knicks went for someone
named Frederic Weis, a 7-2 center from France. Call this an
overreaction to San Antonio's inside dominance in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto: Not sure what the Raptors were thinking by dealing
promising high schooler Jonathan Bender with the No. 5 pick to
Indiana for reserve big man Antonio Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Maybes
</P>
<P>
   Washington: The Wizards got insurance for a Mitch Richmond
departure by taking Richard Hamilton of UConn with the seventh
pick. Hamilton is the real deal, but he reminds some people of
former Georgetown star Reggie Williams. And that's frightening,
seeing as Williams was awful as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix: The Suns surprised everyone by taking forward Shawn
Marion in the lottery with the ninth choice. Marion has skills, but
no one projected him so high.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Clippers: By all accounts, Lamar Odom could be a force. But
he's a Clipper, which means anything can happen.

ECONOMISTS PONDER WHETHER CONSUMERS MIGHT REFUSE TO SPEND IN BAD
TIMES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who lived through the Great Depression or studied
economics in its aftermath quickly learned that even when the
government prodded people to spend more, they would not do so in
frightening times.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the prosperous decades. Americans began to spend
freely, in good times and bad, and the image of the recalcitrant
consumer faded from college courses. Now, suddenly, it is coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, is
helping to resurrect the old concept. In last-minute revisions to
the latest edition of his textbook for undergraduate economics
majors, he upgraded the discussion of the resistant consumer from a
single, skeptical footnote to a respectful consideration. ``When
you go 50 years without a phenomenon being relevant, it dies out of
the curriculum,'' he said. ``Now it's relevant again.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it relevant is the situation in Japan, where the
central bank has reduced interest rates virtually to zero, yet
consumers have stubbornly held back from borrowing or spending.
Businesses have been similarly resistant. Not since the early years
of the Great Depression has any major industrial nation gone
through such an unnerving experience of offering, in effect, to
give away money and finding few takers.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly the case in the United States, where the Federal
Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point, and where consumers continue to enjoy a long
spending spree. But even if a total collapse of consumer confidence
seems improbable in America any time soon, it is increasingly
viewed by mainstream economists as a real possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could imagine that happening here,'' said N. Gregory
Mankiw, a Harvard economist and textbook author who nevertheless
puts the odds of a consumer freeze-up in America at less than
100-1, and does not yet mention the concept in either his beginning
or intermediate economics texts. ``I deal with rules, not
exceptions,'' Mankiw said. ``My market is mainly American students,
not Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankiw, 41 and has known only economic prosperity in his
lifetime, is on sabbatical this year. But if he were teaching, he
said, he would put aside his grave doubts and, making an exception,
lecture on the phenomenon of unshakable consumer resistance _ ``in
the context of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 58, is already giving fresh emphasis in class to a
concept that has received little attention since the 1970s. And so
are other professors, although the idea of an utter consumer
shutdown runs so counter to the standard, modern-day beliefs of
their profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make my students aware of the problem; in fact, I
informally began to talk about it this past year,'' said Mark
Gertler, a New York University economist. ``A lot of students at
NYU come from abroad, and they are interested in practical
problems. When they see a connection between theory and what is
actually happening, in this case in Japan, they get quite
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The professors are, in effect, dusting off a phenomenon first
described by British economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s and
soon dubbed, in economic jargon, a ``liquidity trap.''
</P>
<P>
   It means that the demand for goods and services consistently
falls short of a nation's capacity to produce them despite
short-term interest rates as low as zero. The central bank loses
its power to steer the economy. That may be hard to imagine in the
United States today, where the Federal Reserve, with its constant
attention to interest rates, has helped to keep consumer spending
robust for the better part of a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when you flood the place with money, people will
spend it,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Gordon and other economists insist that conditions
in America will never drive interest rates on loans down to zero,
they are being prodded on two counts to raise that very possibility
in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   One prod is Japan, where rates are indeed that low, yet people
are not borrowing or spending. The other is Paul Krugman, 46, a
much quoted, traditional economist at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, who has broken with conventional wisdom and now
argues that what is happening in Japan can happen in America.
</P>
<P>
   That break did not come until Japan was already in deep trouble.
``What sensible people like me believed just a couple of years ago
was that basically demand _ the lack of it _ was not a problem;
inflation was,'' Krugman said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding to this view, he traveled to Japan to see conditions for
himself. He constructed a mathematical model, a standard tool of
modern economics, to demonstrate that printing more money and
lowering interest rates, even down to zero, would succeed in
stimulating demand and expanding an economy. ``Instead, I succeeded
in proving to myself that this was not necessarily true,'' he said.
He concluded that a liquidity trap was possible after all. It was
no longer just a historical curiosity _ a fading memory of the
Depression and the teachings of Keynes. It had happened in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Among professional economists, Krugman was not the first to
conclude that Japan had fallen into a liquidity trap. A small group
of Keynesian economists already had this in mind. And as early as
1996, some conservatives, among them John Makin of the American
Enterprise Institute, who does not consider himself a Keynesian,
wrote that Japan was caught in a liquidity trap.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates controlled by the Bank of Japan, that country's
central bank, had declined to nearly zero in 1995 from 7 percent in
the early 1990s, just after Japan's stock market and real estate
bubbles burst, shocking the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A similar shock could frighten Americans enough to freeze up
their spending, Krugman argues. A sharp and rapid decline in stock
market prices, or another hedge fund failure, like that of
Long-Term Capital Management last summer, or another big default,
like Russia's _ any of these could do the trick. American interest
rates would not have as far to fall as Japan's to get to zero. The
short-term rate controlled by the Fed is 5 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much spending would Americans do,'' Krugman asks, ``if the
Dow Jones industrial average got up above 13,000 and then dropped
to 7,000? Certainly a lot less than now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   However late he may be to come to his new position, Krugman, has
one of the loudest voices in his profession. His clout stems, in
part, from his prolific writing and his gift for explaining
economics to noneconomists in simple sentences and
easy-to-understand metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on these skills, he has been punching away at a set of
beliefs that has dominated mainstream economics since the 1970s.
With Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas at the University of Chicago
taking the lead, an old, pre-Keynesian view emerged in new
theoretical clothing.
</P>
<P>
   People were declared to behave rationally. If for some reason
they pull back as spenders, then prices drop until they buy again.
There is always a price that pleases rational shoppers, who will
then buy the existing supply of goods and services. Markets clear,
as economists put it. And if they do not clear right away _ if
companies resist cutting prices and a slowdown develops, even a
recession _ well, the government can step up spending, or the Fed
can cut rates and give the process a kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of the people getting their graduate degrees in
economics today, this explanation is comfortable,'' said David
Romer, a 41-year-old economist at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   But no serious provision is made in this thinking for what
Keynes foresaw. He theorized that consumers would stubbornly resist
spending, a sensible move for a worried, hard-pressed family but
irrational for the economy as a whole. Companies find themselves
forced to cut production, and layoffs, lost wages, debts and
defaults accelerate the slide toward a recession or even a
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman has just expressed his concerns in ``The Return of
Depression Economics'' (W.W. Norton &AMP; Co.), his fifth book for a
general audience. For his colleagues, he has explained his new
mathematical model in technical papers, including one in the
current issue of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity
entitled, not so technically, ``It's Baaack: Japan's Slump and the
Return of the Liquidity Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   That paper has become a focus of the growing debate among
economists over liquidity traps and what to do about Japan _ and
whether its problem is truly a liquidity trap.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, for one, blames
inept government policy and a damaged banking system for Japan's
dilemma _ not a liquidity trap. He asserts that the Fed, if put to
a similar test, could revive consumer spending in America's
healthier, more flexible system. For him, liquidity traps can
almost always be avoided, however possible they might be in theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan's current economic problems,'' Greenspan told a
congressional committee two weeks ago, grew out of that nation's
``failure to address the damage to the financial system in a timely
manner.'' In similar fashion, he said, ``while the stock market
crash of 1929 was destabilizing, most analysts attribute the Great
Depression to ensuing failures of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Krugman wonders whether America is so immune from the perils
of liquidity traps, even if policy-makers take the right steps.
``How can we be sure,'' he writes, ``that next year, or the year
after, our own system may not turn out to have hidden flaws, that
we ourselves may not be vulnerable to crisis?''

SPIKE LEE'S `SUMMER OF SAM' CAPTURES HYSTERIA THAT GRIPPED NEW YORK
CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNODL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since I happened to spend much of the summer of 1977 in New York
City, I feel qualified to report Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam''
nails with almost eerie perfection the particular hysteria that
gripped the city during that season's ``Son of Sam'' murder spree.
</P>
<P>
   The film is basically the latest in a succession of late-'70s
nostalgia pieces, a cycle that includes ``The Last Days of Disco,''
``Boogie Nights'' and ``54.'' (It even has ``Boogie Nights'' on the
soundtrack, and has a scene at Studio 54 _ as if to play tribute to
the growing iconography of the era.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's by far the best of these late-'70s movies: It's more
stylistically and thematically audacious than its predecessors, and
more journalistically accurate. It's easily Lee's most accomplished
and satisfying movie since ``Malcolm X.''
</P>
<P>
   The script mostly follows the plight of Vinny (John Leguizamo)
and Dionna (Mira Sorvino), a young Bronx couple whose latent
marital problems come rising to the surface after one of Vinny's
back-seat infidelities just happens to take place near the scene of
the first of a epidemic of random murders committed by a nut case
who leaves letters calling himself ``Son of Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also Vinny's childhood pal, Ritchie (Adrien Brody), who
splits from his Italian neighborhood to become a part-time male
stripper and prostitute and a full-time, grotesquely mohawked, Sid
Vicious-style punk who finds a kind of grace when he falls in love
with Ruby (Jennifer Esposito), the good-hearted neighborhood slut.
</P>
<P>
   As the ongoing murder spree and a ferocious heat wave fan the
city's paranoia throughout the summer, Vinny _ convinced the killer
is after him personally _ becomes unhinged, while Ritchie's
unorthodox lifestyle convinces his vigilante-minded neighborhood
toughs that he must indeed be the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lee traces the impact of the murders on the rest of
New York, sends his characters out to catch some of the flavor of
the period (including an orgy at Plato's Retreat) and follows the
growing madness of the real serial killer, David Berkowitz, to the
point of dramatizing his delusion that he was ordered to do the
killings by a demonic talking dog.
</P>
<P>
   As always with Lee, a good portion of the mainstream movie
audience is likely to find the movie too sexually raw and
foul-mouthed to endure; and some of his quirkier moves simply don't
work: _ his decision, for instance, to cast himself as an
incompetent, comic-relief television reporter with a 6-inch Afro.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, Lee's characters and scenes ring
amazingly true, and the film, which opens and closes with
funny-but-perceptive commentary by columnist Jimmy Breslin, does an
extraordinary job of making the late-'70s spring to life, while
making us realize that it's as psychologically removed from our own
late '90s as the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   As much as any film Lee has made, this one is filled with
wonderful supporting actors in rich supporting roles _ Patti
LuPone, Bebe Neuwirth, Mike Star, Anthony LaPaglia, Michael
Rispoli, Michael Badalucco and Ben Gazarra (as a mob boss who
orders a hit on the unknown killer) are all memorable and
multidimensional.
</P>
<P>
   In his first movie with a predominately white cast, Lee seems to
have abandoned the anger, racial stereotyping and self-righteous
moralizing that have marred so many of his earlier films. All his
characters are viewed with genuine compassion _ especially Vinny
and Dionna, whose marriage is shown to be a tragic victim of a
fraudulent macho-sexual sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the film is brilliant. Lee's control and
storytelling flair have never seemed more assured and there are
moments so powerful and thrilling we feel we're in the hands of a
master filmmaker at the peak of his powers.
</P>
<P>
   Summer of Sam. Directed by Spike Lee. Screenplay by Lee, Victor
Colicchio and Michael Imperioli. Cast: John Leguizamo, Mira
Sorvino, Adrien Brody and Jennifer Esposito. Touchstone. 137
minutes. Rated R for explicit sex and violence.

CALIFORNIA PASSES LAW LIMITING HANDGUN PURCHASES TO ONE PER MONTH 
</HEADLINE>

 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California Legislature Thursday approved a measure to limit
handgun purchases to one a month, making it the largest state to
pass a measure that gun-control advocates say would reduce the flow
of guns to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control proponents and some law-enforcement officials have
long argued that sharply limiting the number of revolvers and
pistols that can be bought at one time is a major step in helping
close off the illegal gun market. The authorities say that
intermediaries for gun traffickers often buy several firearms at
once from federally licensed dealers, and the guns are then resold
to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, a person who passes a background check can
buy an unlimited number of guns at one time and as often as they
wish. Three states _ Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina _ have
passed laws limiting handgun purchases to one every 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In California, about 41,000 of the approximately 183,000
handguns sold in 1998 went to people who bought more than one
handgun at a time, according to data compiled by state regulators.
In some instances, the purchases involved eight guns or more.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has not said whether he will sign
the bill, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the strongest measures in the country to shut
down the flow of handguns to the black market,'' said Luis Tolley,
a lobbyist for Handgun Control, an advocacy group. ``We hope
California's action will encourage other states and Congress to
adopt similar measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the legislation was the first setback for the
National Rifle Association after its recent success in defeating a
congressional proposal that would have strengthened federal laws on
firearm sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But while advocates like Tolley applauded the passage of the
California bill, the impact of similar measures elsewhere has been
mixed. The new bill, like others that exist, applies only to
handguns, not to rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement authorities in Virginia, which enacted a
one-handgun-a month measure in 1993, said that the law had reduced
the illegal trafficking of guns bought from dealers in the state.
But traffickers have simply turned elsewhere for weapons or
criminals have found other strategies to buy guns in Virginia,
federal and state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a notorious case in 1995, for instance, 15 members of the
Norfolk State University band fraternity, Kappa Kappa Psi, were
recruited by gun-runners to buy handguns one at a time from area
gun stores. The traffickers eventually shipped 100 handguns to
Washington, where many were used in crimes, according to newspaper
accounts published at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the impact of laws restricting handgun purchases to
one every 30 days has been far less harsh than predicted by dealers
and pro-gun groups like the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Marcus, the owner of Bob's Gun and Tackle Shop in
Norfolk, Va., and the president of the Virginia Firearms Dealers
Association, which opposed the Virginia law when it was proposed,
said that the law had not reduced sales. In addition, he said, the
number of customers who have complained about having to wait 30
days to buy more than one handgun has also been small.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that if the numbers bear out that there has been a
reduction in illicit trafficking, then I would have to say that
this is a positive,'' Marcus said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, licensed gun dealers must file a report with
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the federal agency
that regulates the manufacture and sale of guns, when an individual
buys two or more firearms from that dealer during any five-day
period. An ATF spokesman said that the agency receives some 1,500
to 1,800 reports each week, or up to 100,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   But connecting those multiple sales to handguns seized by the
police or recovered in connection with crimes is complicated. While
ATF data suggest that only about 1.3 percent of the crimes traced
by the agency since 1994 were determined to be part of a multiple
sale, that figure may be understated because the agency only began
to centralize multiple sales records in 1995, said Joseph J. Vince,
a former top ATF official.
</P>
<P>
   Vince said that the impact of a few states adopting such laws
would likely be small because illegal gun traffickers would either
go elsewhere or buy weapons from unregulated places like gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Helsley, the California representative for the NRA, said
that the group opposed the measure because it believed the bill did
not provide law-enforcement officials with any additional
crime-fighting tools.
</P>
<P>
   Helsley said that California already had a 10-day waiting period
before a handgun buyer can pick up a firearm, giving officials
ample opportunity to check on the buyer's background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what is arguably the most sophisticated system in the
United States, and the reason we are supposed to have this new law
is because it doesn't work,'' Helsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, California lawmakers twice defeated bills similar to
the one passed Thursday. But Tolley, the lobbyist for Handgun
Control, said that the tide turned in the bill's favor when it was
passed by the California state Assembly just days after the
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before Littleton, I was saying we were three or four
votes short,'' Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Littleton shootings, President Clinton announced that
he backed the concept of restricting handgun sales to
one-per-month. But such a proposal never received serious
consideration in the recent congressional debate over firearms.

   DAYS-BEFORE-THEATER (Modena, Italy) _ ``The Days Before: Death,
Destruction and Detroit III'' was originally conceived as a piece
about the Apocalypse, and its 12 scenes are filled with bizarre
imagery and stylized movement. Each includes an excerpt read by the
actress Fiona Shaw from Umberto Eco's novel ``The Island of the Day
Before,'' the texts seemingly unrelated to the onstage action.
Robert Wilson, who conceived, designed and directs it, calls ``The
Days Before'' ``a celebration of humanity.'' Originally
commissioned by the Lincoln Center Festival, it will have its world
premiere in New York on Wednesday. By Anne Midgette. (Moved).

   ASSAYAS-FILMS (Paris) _ Olivier Assayas is someone who believes
in spontaneity and openness to the world. One of the most
significant talents among the new generation of filmmakers working
in France, he is known for his mobile, often handheld, camera style
and for his probing explorations of young people's lives. Assayas'
new film, ``Late August, Early September,'' which opens on
Wednesday, is a loosely structured, evocative depiction of a group
of thirtyish Parisians who are drawn together by the untimely death
of a slightly older writer friend. The film, shot in the spring of
1998, has proved to be Assayas's most successful in France so far,
winning praise last fall at both the Toronto and New York film
festivals. By Laura Winters. (Moved).

   AMERICAN-BALLET-DANCE (Undated) _ Going forward by looking back

the company's recent season at the Metropolitan Opera House were
French and Russian classics created more than 100 years ago. The
20th century did intrude, chiefly through the questionable transfer
of Kenneth MacMillan's ``Anastasia'' (1971) from the Royal Ballet.

   BORIS-GODUNOV-OPERA (New York) _ Modest Mussorgsky wrote ``Boris
Godunov'' twice. The first version, composed at white heat in 1868
and 1869 to a libretto adapted from Pushkin, comprises seven
tableaux organized into four acts and lasts barely two hours. It
was submitted to the directorate of the Imperial Theaters in 1871.
The directors were impressed but asked for changes, including a
substantial female role. A second ``Boris,'' completed in 1872,
consists of a prologue and four acts, and lasts almost three hours.
Today, at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere, ``Boris'' is often
performed with Mussorgsky's original vocal and instrumental parts.
But what we usually (at the Met, always) hear is a conflation of
1869 and 1872. This results in a panoramic ``Boris'' longer than
either version Mussorgsky composed: an abundance of marvels but,
arguably, not a finished product. By Joseph Horowitz. (Moved). &QL;

written in Bellevue Hospital. He produced it himself and played all
the instruments himself. Released on May 19, 1969, ``Oar'' showed
one of the bleakest undersides of the '60s. It was a snapshot of
mental illness, a portrait of bitter isolation in a time of

Flagg painted a stern, white-haired man proclaiming,
ungrammatically, ``I want YOU for U.S. Army.'' Uncle Sam's namesake
was Samuel Wilson, a meat packer who settled in Troy, N.Y., and
supplied food to American troops during the War of 1812. According
to legend _ and to an eyewitness report published in The New-York
Gazette and General Advertiser in 1830 _ a workman joked that the
letters ``U.S.'' on Wilson's shipping crates stood for ``Uncle
Sam'' Wilson. The anecdote spread and led to the patriotic symbol

   TV-RKO-281 (Undated) _ When Orson Welles made his masterpiece
``Citizen Kane'' in 1941, it was no secret that the film's
protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, was a barely fictionalized
version of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate whose
enormous empire was then beginning to falter under a barrage of
debts. But there was a drama behind the drama, as Welles _ then
just 25 and swelled by the arrogance of youth and genius _ found
himself up against the full force of Hearst's fury. Hearst was
desperate to stop the film, no matter what the cost, and nearly
succeeded in having it destroyed before it had ever been released.
Now the story of their battle is to be the subject of its own film.
``RKO 281,'' which takes its name from ``Citizen Kane's'' working
title at the RKO studio, will have its premiere on HBO in November.

 &HT;    Professor's plants are a labor of love
 &HT;    By Meggen Lindsay
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He gently stooped and cut the last stem for his
bouquet, careful not trample on the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Bela Bognar's wife April usually would be with him in the garden
_ she plants the flowers and he does the vegetables _ but she is in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight he will take the flowers to her room, along with the
pictures he took of her garden, so she can visualize its progress.
This has been his routine all of June, after April suffered an
aneurism on the first of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hoping she will be out of the hospital by August,'' he
said. ``She misses her garden, so I bring her huge bouquets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bognar, who responded to our May 27 HomeLife survey, wrote about
his garden and his memories of gardening in vivid detail, making it
clear how much care he devotes to his vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a fixture at his wife's side, he takes time every
afternoon to return to his Casstown country home to take care of
the gardens _ the flower gardens, the small vegetable plot in the
back yard, and his own garden, spanning the size of four tennis
courts, located on his neighbor's farm.
</P>
<P>
   And what a garden it is.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with rows and rows of vegetables, or ``veggies'' as he
calls them, there are more than 200 tomato plants, 500 pepper
plants, cucumbers, zucchini and lettuce by the bushel.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter he converts his front porch into a greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very quiet and cold in the beginning (of February), but
life soon begins as over 2,000 seeds emerge,'' he said. ``Some dig
downward and some push upward, all wanting to see the light.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are species from Europe that Bognar, a native of Hungary,
gathered on his travels. Bognar is passionate, almost scholarly,
when discussing his vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm trying a new line of tomatoes not known in
America: they are the Crimean tomato, brought over by Russian
refugees,'' he said, checking his dictionary to be certain of the
spelling.
</P>
<P>
   He's not as confident when it comes to his wife's gardens,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do the the veggies only,'' he explained. ``I don't even know
the names of the flowers that April has.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the 68-year-old Wright State gerontology and social
work professor, the father of local filmmaker Steven Bognar, tends
to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Loading buckets into his pickup, Bognar fills them and waters
his garden, using a system he has perfected throughout his years of
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can empty one can before another is filled,'' he reported.
``If I time it right, I can usually water all of the plants in my
garden in three hours.'' The flowers take another two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he has had some help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone stopped by yesterday and watered the east garden,'' he
said. ``Some good Samaritan helps me. . . . Everybody has been
trying to help me. The best thing they can do is water.''
</P>
<P>
   ognar and his wife give most of what they grow away _ to St.
Vincent De Paul's homeless shelter, the Salvation Army, their
church, and to anyone else hungry for fresh vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that I grow goes to good causes,'' he said. ``I don't grow
for myself to make a profit, I grow for pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bognar's garden produces hundreds of tomatoes, he
doesn't even like them _ he feeds others with them instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturdays, I take big buckets of vegetables to (St.
Vincent's) shelter,'' he said. ``I've been doing this since it
opened 18 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bognar does sell any of his vegetables, the proceeds go to a
Hungarian scholarship fund he began for Wright State University
students. He has earned $8,000 for the scholarship from garden
sales and donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an irony in this,'' he said. ``I was to retire before
my wife took sick ... I even had my party with over 200 people
there... Now I can't afford to retire _ I have too many other
considerations and benefits to think of. But now I will continue to
raise money for my scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days, however, they don't bother to sell their vegetables.
April keeps a blackboard outside during the summer that states:
``Today's free perennials are ...'' and there is a table set up
with free vegetables and flowers for people driving past their
house, a 130-year-old schoolhouse that he and his wife restored
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' Bognar said. ``We are outside most of the time
and people always stop to talk with us. People always want
gardening advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, 'The lecture you pay for, the veggies are
free,''' he laughed. ``People want me to tell them all I know about
gardening from 60 years in just one minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Bognar knows about gardening came from his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had gardens where I grew up in Hungary,'' he said.
``I followed my mother all around her garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never stepped on a single plant, and when I asked her why,
she told me, 'You never want to hurt the ones you care for.' I have
to admit that after all my years of gardening, I have not yet
reached such a communion with my garden, but I continue to try.''

 &HT;    Keeping thermostat fan `on' costs more than `auto'
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Last week I talked a bit about energy-efficient
use of air conditioning, and we'll get back into some summer energy
issues next week.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I have an answer to three reader questions,
including one question about summer energy.
</P>
<P>
   Fan the air
</P>
<P>
   M.G. of Washington Twp. has central air conditioning, and on her
thermostats she can set the fan on either ``on'' or ``auto.'' She
wanted to know which setting was most energy efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Forced-air heating and cooling systems have fans that
blow to circulate air around your house. In the summer, the fan
blows cool air into rooms and helps draw unheated air out. When the
thermostat switch is in the auto position, the fan comes on only
when the system is active and producing cool air. When the switch
is in the on position, the fan blows continuously.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Hibner, program manager for Dayton Power and Light Co.'s
Energy Resource Center, said running the fan continuously uses
energy, but it may also help you feel more comfortable. He said
when the fan is off, cool air settles near the floor in your house
and warm air rises toward the ceiling. Turning on the fan mixes the
air in your rooms, and lifting the cool air from near the floor may
make you feel cooler.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, it costs about $98 to run a fan continuously
through the cooling season. You'll spend only about $31 for fan
energy if the system is left on auto.
</P>
<P>
   M.G. pointed out correctly that the most important consideration
is the temperature setting on the thermostat. If you can live with
a slightly higher temperature setting with the fan running, it's
probably a good trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is using ceiling fans. A ceiling fan set to pull
air up from the floor does the same air mixing job an
air-conditioning system fan does. And Hibner said a ceiling fan may
cost only $4 or $5 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad ties
</P>
<P>
   R.M. of Dayton has a small vegetable garden surrounded by
railroad ties. He wondered if the creosote that is used in the ties
could find its way into food grown in the garden and threaten his
family's health.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Finding a definitive answer to this one proved
difficult. Creosote, an oily substance produced by distilling wood
tar, once was used for treating bronchial ailments and, later, as a
treatment to protect wood from insect attack. It is a toxin that is
no longer available to the general public, but it was widely used
to preserve railroad ties and telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   I contacted several sources who had conflicting opinions, but
Pete Lane, an agent for the Ohio State University Extension Service
in Dayton, had what seemed to be the most reasonable answer. He
said creosote is water soluble and washes out of the wood over time
as it is exposed to the elements. Most of the railroad ties being
sold for landscaping have been outdoors long enough that a lot of
the creosote is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said if enough creosote is left in the railroad ties to be
harmful, the most likely effect will be that it kills the vegetable
plants. The chance that significant creosote will be taken into the
plants and reach the people eating the vegetables seems slim.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-treated lumber is probably a better choice for a
vegetable-garden border than railroad ties. Treated lumber also has
toxins, but they are less likely to leach out into the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you should never use treated lumber on a surface
where it touches food you are preparing.
</P>
<P>
   Roosting pigeons
</P>
<P>
   E.B. of Kettering has a two-story house with vinyl siding. A
piece of siding is missing at a point where the eaves meet the
roof. That created an opening about 6-by-6 inches into which a pair
of pigeons has built a nest. Residents can hear baby birds moving
around through the walls. E.B. wants to know what to do to get rid
of the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Dan Frevert, the assistant wildlife manager for the
Ohio Division of Wildlife office in Xenia, said the best approach
probably is to keep eyes and ears on the nest and wait for the
young to leave on their own. E.B. called in early June, and Frevert
said the hatchlings probably were just about ready to fledge. Once
the birds are out of the nest, Frevert said the hole where the
parents entered must be sealed tight to keep the birds from
returning and to keep other birds and small animals out. The reason
he suggested waiting for the young to fledge before sealing the
hole is that if the hole were sealed with the young birds inside
they would starve, leaving their rotting bodies inside the walls.
</P>
<P>
   E.B. had heard of a type of spike that could be placed where
pigeons land to keep them away, but Frevert said using a spiky
barrier would have the same effect as covering the hole; the
parents wouldn't be able to reach the chicks and the chicks would
starve. Noise and other repellents don't work well against nesting
pigeons, Frevert said. Pigeons are not a protected species in Ohio,
so it's not illegal to kill them if necessary.

HMO'S PLAN TO RAISE PREMIUMS OR DROP BENEFITS FOR MEDICARE
SUBSCRIBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health maintenance organizations will increase
Medicare premiums or cut benefits for most of their 6 million
elderly subscribers next year because they consider federal
payments to them inadequate, a trade association for the managed
care industry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the association said, at least 250,000 Medicare
beneficiaries will be forced out of HMOs because their plans are
curtailing service areas or dropping out of Medicare. Some of these
beneficiaries may find other HMOs, as the health plans continue to
enroll new members, but many people will find their old doctors are
not members of their new health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions seem to undercut a key part of President Clinton's
latest Medicare proposal, which depends on competition among HMOs
to make the program more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The political centerpiece of Clinton's proposal is a plan for
Medicare to cover prescription drugs. But many health maintenance
organizations that already provide such coverage said they intended
to cut back drug benefits for Medicare patients next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the deadline for HMOs to tell the federal
government if they plan to participate in Medicare next year.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs surveyed by the trade group reported that they were
increasing premiums for 1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries next
year. Richard I. Smith, vice president of the association, said
that premiums would increase by more than $20 a month for 930,000
beneficiaries, including 400,000 people who will see increases of
$40 or more.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, federal auditors have repeatedly
asserted that Medicare was overpaying HMOs, which now care for
about 16 percent of the program's 39 million beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   However, Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association
of Health Plans, said: ``Overpaid plans don't leave the program.
Overpaid plans don't cut benefits to beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Federal
Health Care Financing Administration, said, ``We're disappointed
that HMOs are making decisions that will force some Medicare
beneficiaries to change their health coverage and at the same time
scaring them about their Medicare benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The association conducted a survey of its members to ascertain
their plans for next year. HMOs pulled out of more than 300
counties in 22 states early this year. The changes directly
affected more than 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   With next year's withdrawals, Ms. Ignagni said, HMOs will have
dropped more than 650,000 people _ about one of every 10 Medicare
beneficiaries in such plans.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials insist that health plans are simply making
business decisions. Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the
Medicare agency, told Congress last month that ``a certain amount
of market volatility must be expected when relying on the private
sector to serve beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle said HMOs that remain in Medicare ``will be paid
more in 2000 than in 1999 _ about 5 percent, on average,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have found that Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs are,
on the average, healthier than those in the original
fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs receive a fixed amount of federal money for each Medicare
beneficiary, regardless of what the person's care costs. Consumer
advocates say some HMOs try to fatten their profits by selectively
recruiting healthy beneficiaries and shunning sicker patients.
Health plans deny that they engage in this practice.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries dropped from an HMO can return to the
original fee-for-service Medicare program or enroll in another
managed care plan if one is available where they live. But Medicare
beneficiaries say the experience of being dumped by an HMO is
traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., who is chairman of the Health
Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, said the Medicare HMO
program was facing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Congress takes action to correct this problem, the
consequences will be devastating for Medicare beneficiaries,
especially low-income seniors,'' Bilirakis said. ``Many will lose
the option of participating in a Medicare managed care plan
altogether. Others will face increased out-of-pocket costs or a
reduction in benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   About 55 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs have incomes
less than $25,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   HIP Health Plans is pulling out of the Medicare program in the
Tampa, Fla., area represented by Bilirakis.
</P>
<P>
   Some Medicare beneficiaries join HMOs even as others leave.
Government data show a small net increase in the number of people
in Medicare HMOs this year, but the industry says enrollment is
growing much more slowly than in the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has sharply reduced its
projections of Medicare HMO enrollment. Elderly people have become
acutely aware that HMOs can drop out of the Medicare market, and
that is ``likely to reduce the willingness of some Medicare
beneficiaries to enroll in plans in the next few years,'' the
budget office said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Congressional Budget Office said that
unanticipated cutbacks in Medicare payments to many HMOs ``will
impede their ability to offer the additional benefits, such as
prescription drugs, that were expected to encourage more people to
enroll.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American Association of Health Plans hired the firm of Peter
D. Hart Research to conduct the survey. It received responses from
23 HMOs serving 4 million beneficiaries, or two-thirds of those in
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare HMOs must cover at least the services offered in the
fee-for-service program and usually offer additional benefits. The
secretary of health and human services can approve or reject the
mix of premiums and benefits devised by a private health plan. But
if she disapproves, the HMO does not have to participate in
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries in health plans and in the traditional Medicare
program normally pay a monthly premium of $45.50, which is deducted
from their Social Security checks. HMOs may charge additional
premiums for items not covered by the standard Medicare program,
like prescription drugs, eyeglasses, hearing aids and preventive
care.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs are not
paying any extra premiums this year. For more than half of the
people who do pay extra premiums, the amount is less than $40 a

   Smith said the survey indicated that most Medicare HMOs were
increasing co-payments for prescription drugs or reducing the
amount of drugs for which they would pay.

`HOOP LIFE' NEEDS TIME IN TRAINING CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So I'm sitting in the newsroom with a friend, trying to come up
with ideas for a TV series that would make it easy for the
producers to feature a multiracial cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about something about a pro basketball team?'' my friend
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. You can't possibly do an accurate portrayal of pro hoops
with only high-fivin' white guys.
</P>
<P>
   But before we can sell the idea to anyone but ourselves, Tom
Fontana and Barry Levinson, two of TV's hottest auteurs-du-jour,
put their imprimatur on ``The Hoop Life,'' a new series beginning
Sunday on Showtime pay cable.
</P>
<P>
   Like a team starting slowly so it can peak for the playoffs,
``The Hoop Life'' looks like a train wreck at the start of its
95-minute premiere. Some of the acting by supporting cast members
is downright obvious, the way it would look if I were part of the
cast. And no matter how good the basketball action is, it's still a
simulation that looks like a simulation. Director Kevin Hooks could
have cut the hoop scenes by half without losing anything but a lot
of film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hoop Life'' centers on three players _ an aging veteran
portrayed by Mykelti Williamson, a philandering big man played by
Rick Peters, and a wide-eyed teenage phenom played by Cirroc
Lofton. They play for the New England Knights of the United
Basketball Association, and their coach is a grumpy, lumpy sort
played by Dan Lauria.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Lauria seems more suited to the National Football
League than to the Armani-suited corps de coaching common in the
National Basketball Association. Ah, but this is the United
Basketball Association. Maybe they don't have a dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, everything else about ``The Hoop Life'' is faithful
to the NBA ethic, if that's the right word. There are agents and
managers, sex-happy groupies and strip clubs, fancy cars and
fancier homes, all powered by the enormous sums paid to young men
whose maturity levels are stuck somewhere between the fourth grade
and the fourth dimension. And because this is pay cable, the
language is quite accurate and the groupies are quite naked.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first episode, I was mildly interested in what
happens down the road, particularly to Lofton's character, Curtis
Thorpe. But I'll lose no sleep if I miss the next 20 episodes,
either. ``The Hoop Life'' is likely to appeal to hormone-charged
males who'd love to identify with this line, spoken by the cousin
of Peters' high-scoring character, if you get my drift: ``Greg,''
he says, ``you're 25 years old, you're a millionaire, women who
only want sex are throwing themselves at you constantly. You're
doing what any man in your situation would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out basketball is a contact sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoop Life. New drama series about professional basketball
players. Starring Mykelti Williamson, Cirroc Lofton, Rick Peters
and Dan Lauria. Premieres Sunday on Showtime. Parental guideline
rating: TV-MA.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

COMMENTARY: SAVING PUBLIC COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For weeks, I have had the most important report on
the most important university in the life and future of New York
City. But I did not read it. I just glared at it.
</P>
<P>
   The cover put me off, hard _ ``The City University of New York:
An Institution Adrift.'' Another attack on the publicly financed
college that led me to work I have loved ever since? Who needs it?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My City College was an intellectually and academically elite
school attended by students with family income ranging from not
much to very not much. Eventually it was grouped legislatively with
16 other senior and community colleges into the City University of
New York _ which now carries the hopes of the 200,000 students who
attend it.
</P>
<P>
   I knew CUNY has had deep faults and problems since it opened the
doors to all high school graduates in 1969. Academically it has all
the cachet of a herring.
</P>
<P>
   I also knew that the color palette of the student body has
changed from almost entirely white to 72 percent other shades. For
most of their families, CUNY was the first college, and blessed.
</P>
<P>
   I resented the nastiness of the criticism of CUNY, like Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's advice to the students to learn how to work. Try
working for food, clothes, carfare at night while working for
graduation credits by day. You just won't have the energy left for
polo.
</P>
<P>
   When I did read the report after a few weeks, the glare
disappeared. This is a report written under the leadership of
Herman Badillo, recently appointed chairman of CUNY by the mayor,
and Benno Schmidt Jr., former president of Yale.
</P>
<P>
   My eyes softened when I realized the goal was not to eliminate
CUNY or shrink it _ as some students and teachers fear _ but to
restore some of its academic glisten, so graduates would again help
lead the city and profit from its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the most valuable qualities of the report were three
varieties of respect. Perhaps the most important: the tone of
belief in what students could do for themselves and the city if
CUNY gave them the dignity of higher goals of achievements, not the
sub-college standards that are good enough now.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the respect of pledging ``absolute commitment'' to
CUNY's ``historic organizational mission'' to provide first-rate
college opportunities for all New Yorkers academically able to take
advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   Third: proposals to help those not ready because of the failure
of New York's elementary and high school system to teach so many
students more than a humiliatingly low level of writing, reading
and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   The most important step is the first step: to establish and help
students reach acceptable goals not only in college but before they
enter it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all American colleges provide remedial courses. But
CUNY's load and the lack of standards of remedial achievement for
the college bound drag down CUNY with too many students unqualified
for higher education. The report proposes that remedial classes be
held not in the four-year senior colleges but in the community
colleges, and that passing them must be the requirement for senior
colleges _ with national standard entry tests to come.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are in New York, the elementary and high school
system often prepares students for failure in college. The report
proposes widening the emergency remedy now in some schools: CUNY
teachers using summers and other free time for tutorials in
reading, writing and mathematics in high schools and the late
grades of elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   That will cost money _ about $10 million _ and so will other
proposals. The end of ``social promotion'' in elementary schools, a
cockamamie, basically political idea, that shoves all students on
to the next grade, ready or not. Technological unification for
planning throughout CUNY, a kind of remediation for management.
</P>
<P>
   Writing an important report is difficult; getting the money out
of politicians for achievement, not stagnation, that's really hard.
</P>
<P>
   They must remember that when CUNY opened its doors wide in 1969,
it did not switch its goals from achievement to mediocrity and
failure. Open enrollment has worked out for those who had
qualifications, not for those who did not. This report is not an
attack on public higher education, but the opposite _ an effort to
improve and protect it.

 &HT;    Glavine lifts Braves' spirits with complete-game win
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Braves came back to America through the front
door Thursday night. And Tom Glavine held it open for them.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta opens what should be a fun-packed weekend at Shea
Stadium tonight, when the occasion might well have been a dirge.
Glavine threw a complete-game 4-1 victory at Montreal Thursday,
managing a split in the kind of series that can alter a season.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no altering this fact: Glavine now has beaten the
Expos 13 times in a row. And with the club's bullpen given a day's
liberty, the two excruciating late-inning losses earlier in the
week gained some distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there today more so trying to pitch some innings to
give those guys a break,'' said Glavine, who won his fourth in a
row to reach 7-7. ``It wasn't because I was afraid to get 'em in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine worked the last seven innings with a swelling left hand,
after Manny Martinez smashed a one hopper off his palm in the
third. Although the swelling eventually hindered the grip on his
fastball, Glavine remained effective, aided by two double plays. He
retired the last eight men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our young players were like meat for him,'' Montreal manager
Felipe Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough, man,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``I've seen
him pitch when he's had a lot of problems in the last 10 years.
Today was pretty tough, too. ... And I didn't use the bullpen ...
Two days rest with (John) Rocker is great for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves stranded 13 runners, but they scored immediately on
Ryan Klesko's two-out, two-run double in the first. The RBIs gave
Klesko nine in six games and switched the topic from the last two
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really upset, because you got the feeling you're going
to win and they beat you,'' Klesko said. ``You just got to let it
go. Obviously, you're mad that night, but when this team comes to
the park the next day, with the pitching staff we got, if we score
some runs, we got a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss also returned from the disabled list to
drive in a run in the fourth and test his injured quadriceps muscle
on several fielding plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a new defensive back in the game,'' Weiss said.
``They went deep on me right away.

 &HT;    Keeping Weiss off DL may be difficult task
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Walt Weiss came off the disabled list Thursday. The
bigger trick is keeping him off.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves shortstop was 1-for-4 with an RBI in the Expos finale
and said he felt no ill effects after spending nine innings on the
National League's most brutal playing surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably be a little while before I'm confident about
exploding down the line or really taking off,'' Weiss said. ``I
figure it'll take a few days of cautious running until you get to
that point where you don't have a problem. Then you just forget
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not hesitate in racing behind second to make a
tough play on a Orlando Cabrera grounder in the fifth, Weiss hasn't
been able to forget about the sore quadriceps muscle since joining
the Braves last year. He never was disabled in 1998, but he
appeared in just 96 games, primarily because of the quadriceps
strain in his right leg. He strained the same muscle running out a
single in Milwaukee on May 26 and has spent the subsequent 23 days
on the DL. Already this year, he has missed 33 games.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox said he has no plan to increase reserve Ozzie
Guillen's playing time in order to give Weiss more downtime. While
Weiss was on the DL, Guillen hit .333 with eight doubles and three
stolen bases. But Cox did not sound as if he envisions the two
shortstops sharing the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play it by ear,'' Cox said. ``Use common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Training and conditioning personnel have just about run out of
help for Weiss. Strength and conditioning coach Frank Fultz might
try a slide board next, to stretch the muscles in his leg. But
Weiss not only grades out, pound for pound, as one of the strongest
players on the team, he also is one of the most flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to me, because we've tried too many different
avenues of strategy already,'' Fultz said.
</P>
<P>
   To open a spot, Mark DeRosa was optioned to Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Risin' Simon
</P>
<P>
   Rookie first baseman Randall Simon recorded his first four-hit
game, a double and three singles, off three Expos pitchers. A
disappointing .256 season in Richmond last season _ his sixth year
in the organization _ put his future with the franchise in
question, but his response this summer has been impressive. He
enters the New York series hitting .330.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to be here and show I can play at this level,'' Simon
said. ``I know that Big Cat (Andres Galarraga) is not here, but I
know he's looking, and I got to make him proud of me for what I'm
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Braves have worked with Simon to make him more
selective at the plate, they appreciate his aggressiveness, which
he never lost even when his average dipped to .232 in mid-June. In
the 14 games since, he is 21 for 44 (.477), and he closed out the
Montreal series 8-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   Pelican brief
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have extended their player development contract with
the Class A Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League through
2002.

 &HT;    Hawks suddenly get younger
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Very eager and appearing terribly young, the three
draft picks sat at a table Thursday in a meeting room of the Omni
Hotel. They wore Hawks caps and grins, eyes sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   You can say this much for the new Atlanta players. They are
bright and feisty, a little cocky, but so fresh from the classroom
each wanted to thank the ``administration'' for drafting him. If
anyone questions their ability to play the game, they are ready to
take issue.
</P>
<P>
   Take center-forward Cal Bowdler, who played at Old Dominion in
the mid-level Colonial Conference. ``I came from a small Class A
high school to play Division I,'' the No. 17 pick said. ``I'll work
hard and keep getting better now that I'm in the NBA. I can't wait
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock says he has no question about
the talent level of any of the three:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 10 pick Jason Terry, who led the Pac-10 in scoring, steals
and assists at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bowdler, a 6-10, 255-pounder who scored 23 points against
North Carolina last season.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 20 pick Dion Glover of Georgia Tech, who suffered a
serious knee injury last fall.
</P>
<P>
   And while Terry is well-known and figures to have a bright
future in the NBA, Babcock needed to explain his decision to take
Glover, who played only as a freshman at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had stayed in school another year as I urged him to do,
he would have been a top 10 pick next season,'' Babcock said.
``When we got to the 20th pick, there was simply no way I was going
to pass on a top 10 player.'' The Hawks' roster appears far from
ready. The club's 15-man roll includes seven players between 20 and
24 years old.
</P>
<P>
   It is increasingly apparent that some of the veteran names are
going to change. Forwards Duane Ferrell, newly reacquired from
Golden State, and Ty Corbin have only an outside chance of making
this team. Corbin, who will be 37, has a ``make good'' deal for
next season with a buyout, the only way the Hawks could pay him for
services rendered after two years on a minimum contract.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock acknowledges serious trade conversations with three
teams. He said talks were of such a sensitive nature he would
neither confirm nor deny any name.
</P>
<P>
   Portland is believed to be one of those teams, and Steve Smith
is reportedly involved.The chief player Portland wants to move is
shooting guard Isaiah Rider, who has one year remaining on his
contract at $5.4 million. Since Smith goes to $7.3 million next
season with the Hawks, it would take more than one player to
balance the trade.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith is the epitome of professionalism and a dynamic
scorer, Rider is flamboyant and a chronic problem with an arrest
record and a history of walking out during games and arriving late
to practice. For an organization that preaches good citizenship, he
would appear to be the anti-Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rider is not the only Blazers guard who could be up for
trade. Jim Jackson had a loud argument with coach Mike Dunleavy in
the locker room during the Western finals and is unhappy. Too, the
club has a deep stable of young big men, including Brian Grant and
Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   No deal can be completed until Aug. 1, by league rule.

   DAM-REMOVAL (Augusta, Maine) _ On an overcast summer morning in
the lush green Kennebec Valley, a lone backhoe scooped about 30
buckets of earth from a temporary gravel wall that had been built
to patch the 60-foot gap engineers cut in the 917-foot-wide Edwards
Dam. Suddenly, accompanied by the pealing of church bells and
cheers of hundreds of spectators, the caged Kennebec River turned
wild. Environmentalists and anglers plan to use their success in
breaching the Edwards to renew their push to remove more of the
nation's estimated 75,000 dams. At the top of their wish list are

STOCKS CLIMB DESPITE RISE IN INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Overcoming an early stumble, stock prices climbed
steadily Thursday to finish with sizable gains despite a rise in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock
index explored record territory for the second straight day, while
the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 95.62 points to jump back
over the 11,000 mark. It closed at 11,066.42, within 41 points of
its May 13 peak.
</P>
<P>
   A report of strong activity at the nation's factories last month
combined with some second thoughts about Federal Reserve policy to
drive interest rates higher as investors awaited the government's
release Friday on June employment.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate increase subsided as the day wore on, and Treasury
yields finished just slightly higher, with the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond at 6 percent, up from 5.96 percent on Wednesday. The
price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell
18/32 to 89 20/32. Stock traders took the rate rise in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock and bond markets seem to be taking different
views,'' said Timothy Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus
Corp. Bond people, he said, are impressed by the fact that Federal
Reserve rate increases are rarely one-shot exercises and that it
was not all that encouraging that the Fed dropped its bias to
tighten while raising rates Wednesday. The Fed has traditionally
done this, he added, albeit without an immediate announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market participants, on the other hand, were largely
persuaded, Ghriskey said, that the Fed was merely taking back an
extra rate cut tied to global turmoil and that the economy would
keep bounding ahead, as implied by the manufacturing figures
released by the National Association of Purchasing Management.

   There was no clear pattern in the day's brisk stock trading,
however, with the technology-heavy NASDAQ composite rising 20.06
points, to close at 2,706.18, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock

   Semiconductor, drug and oil stocks were among Thursday's biggest
winners. Intel, the biggest chipmaker, gained 3 3/8 to 62 7/8,
aided by inclusion in Lehman Brothers' annual list, published
Thursday, of its 10 favorite stocks for the next 12 months. The
investment house also chose KLA-Tencor, whose products are used in
chip manufacturing; it spurted 4 1/16 to 68 15/16. Motorola gained
3 9/16 to 98 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly, another Lehman stock, rose 3 1/4 to 74 7/8, Pfizer 1
1/16 to 37 3/8 following a three-for-one-split, and Merck 1 5/8 to
75 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic-Richfield paced the oils, rising 3 3/8 to 86 15/16
while Texaco, Chevron and merger-partners Exxon and Mobil all
gained between 1 and 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks, which after the close on Wednesday said expansion
costs would shrink earnings for rest of the year, was a prominent
casualty, skidding 10 5/8 to 26 15/16. Nike was also punished after
warning of lower domestic orders while reporting an eight-fold
quarterly profit increase.
</P>
<P>
   In its first day of trading, Yankee Candle Co., a maker of
scented candles, jumped 6 1/8 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume retreated to 828.6
million shares from Wednesday's 1.1 billion, the fourth-heaviest
ever, as advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,694 to
1,383. New 52-week highs were made by 108 stocks, new lows by 40.
</P>
<P>
   The other seven Lehman picks for the year ahead were America
Online, AT&AMP;T, Firstar Corp., Ford, General Instrument, Microsoft
and Tyco International. The ``uncommon values'' list soared 51.2
percent in the year that ended June 30, more than double the 21.1
percent returned by the S&AMP;P 500.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that Palestinian
refugees should be able to settle ``wherever they want to live,''
startling Israeli officials with what appeared to be a significant
shift in U.S. policy on one of the Middle East's most contentious
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking at a news conference with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, said he would like it if the hundreds of thousands
of Palestinian refugees scattered around the Middle East ``felt
free and were free'' to live wherever they chose.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate disposition of the refugees is one of the thorniest
issues in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and is expected to be
one of the final matters settled when talks resume later this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Clinton was asked to compare his views
on resettling Kosovo refugees with Palestinian settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just look at it as a practical matter,'' the president
said, ``the agreement that is made in the end, whether refugees go
home depends in part on how long they've been away and whether they
wish to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will also depend on what the nature of the settlement is:
How much land will the Palestinians have? Where will it be? How
does it correspond to where people lived before?'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded his answer with a statement that alarmed supporters
of Israel: ``And I would like it if the Palestinian people felt
free and were free to live wherever they liked, wherever they want
to live.''
</P>
<P>
   White House and State Department aides immediately denied that
Clinton meant to alter existing U.S. policy on refugee
resettlement, which has deemed the matter one that should be
resolved solely by the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   One State Department official told officials with the Israeli
embassy immediately after the news conference that Clinton had
spoken imprecisely, according to an Israeli official, and had not
intended to signal a new direction for Mideast policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taken at face value, the president's words indicate that the all
Palestinians should be able to return ``home'' _ even if that is
core Israeli territory, said Robert Satloff, director of the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a group sympathetic to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant statement,'' Satloff said. ``Even if you
were to look at it in its most benign context, it still is an
articulation of American policy on an issue that heretofore we
haven't spoken on. Substantively, it takes U.S. policy into a new
territory much closer to the traditional Palestinian approach to
resolving the refugee issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration policy aides insisted that the president
intended no change in policy or emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Jewish-American groups will say this represents a
departure, but it doesn't,'' said a senior foreign policy aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He specifically said the
resolution would depend on refugees themselves and the shape of the
agreement they reached.''
</P>
<P>
   In other remarks, Clinton and Mubarak expressed pleasure and
relief at the election of Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister
after three and a half years of grudging progress on Palestinian
issues and domestic political paralysis under the defeated Israeli
prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again,'' Clinton said in his opening remarks, ``we now
have a real chance to move the peace process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak echoed him. ``In the months ahead, we'll be looking
forward to reviving the peace process which has been stalled for
some time,'' the Egyptian leader said. ``Unfortunately, valuable
time has been wasted. Today there is an opportunity which should
not be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli embassy official said that Barak did not need to be
reminded of the lack of progress between Israel, the Palestinians
and neighboring states over the past several years. Barak intends
to act quickly after he and his new government are sworn in,
probably next week, the official said, speaking on condition he not
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Barak needs to hear that,'' the official said,
referring to the importunings of Mubarak and Clinton to act quickly
to restart talks with the Palestinians. ``I think Barak wants to
move, on both the Syria-Lebanon track and on the Palestinian track.
He wants to do it, it's part of his program, that's what he was
elected to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he would meet with Barak ``within days'' to
begin to thaw relations between the United States and Israel and to
discuss ways to restart peace negotiations. Aides later said
Clinton meant that he would meet the Israeli prime minister within
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said that he intended to visit Washington shortly
after he talks office for a one-on-one conversation with the
president. White House aides and Israeli officials said that the
meeting would probably take place sometime after July 19.

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS THWART CLINTON ON NEW TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind., Md., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in three months, congressional
Republicans have voted to block the Clinton administration's plan
to hire 100,000 new teachers and reduce class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   In a straight party-line vote, Republicans on the House
Committee on Education and the Work Force Wednesday defeated a
Democratic amendment to an education bill that, among other things,
would have authorized $1.2 billion in the next fiscal year to
finance the initiative. The amendment offered by Rep. Matthew G.
Martinez, D-Calif., was defeated 23-21.
</P>
<P>
   The committee then passed a bill sponsored by Rep. Howard P.
McKeon, R-Calif., that left it up to local districts whether to
spend a total of $2 billion a year either on hiring more teachers
or providing additional training to current teachers. The bill
passed by a vote of 27-19, with two Democrats, Reps. Tim Roemer of
Indiana and Rush Holt of New Jersey, voting with the Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration wants to put 100,000 new teachers into
classrooms, but requiring this would force states and local school
districts to put many unqualified teachers in the classroom,'' said
Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who is the committee's chairman. ``We allow
schools to decide whether they should use the funds to reduce class
size or improve the quality of their existing teachers, or hire
additional special education teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative aimed at bringing classes down to 18 students in
the first three grades has been a major point of contention between
the White House and congressional leaders for both policy and
political reasons. The issue emerged as a major sticking point as
Clinton and congressional Republicans tried to hammer out an
omnibus spending bill just before last fall's election.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a politically unpopular government shutdown,
congressional Republicans agreed to the 100,000 teacher initiative
and provided money for one fiscal year to hire the first 30,000
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But in March, Republicans considering an education bill in the
Senate and the House voted to transfer money for hiring teachers
over the next five years into other programs. After the White House
threatened to veto the education bill, the Republicans dropped
their efforts to shift money away from the class-size initiative,
though the education measure was enacted without the money for
hiring more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   This weeks' action indicates the Republicans remain firm in
their opposition to allowing Clinton's class-size initiative to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   That opposition stems in part from policy differences. Clinton's
plan focuses on low-income rural and inner-city school districts.
The Republican proposal would spread federal dollars around to more
well-to-do suburban school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is a direct attack on those schoolchildren who most
need federal help,'' said Rep. William Clay, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure is caught up in presidential politics,
people from both sides acknowledge privately. The White House is
hoping to make the teacher initiative a major theme in the coming
campaign. The Republicans would like to deprive it of that theme in
a way that shows they care just as much about education.

WOMEN'S GROUPS ATTACK VATICAN'S STANCE ON POPULATION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)  (mk) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Frustrated by the Vatican's efforts to thwart a
plan to limit world population growth, 126 women's organizations
from around the world presented an open letter to the Roman
Catholic Church on Thursday at a conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing their disagreements in a series of questions, the
women's groups, led by 57 Latin American organizations, asked how a
church that holds life as ``a fundamental value'' could watch
thousands of women die because they lack access to family planning
and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The letter asked why the Vatican wanted parents to supervise
young people's sex education when many cases of abuse occur in the
home, and why a church committed to social justice opposed women's
achieving aspirations fundamental to their ``just and humane
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also asked why an institution, which ``by its nature
does not have women or children or sexual and reproductive
problems'' is ``blocking advances in contraception, sexual
education and HIV prevention'' beneficial to millions of women.
</P>
<P>
   The plan being discussed at the conference, first agreed on five
years ago in Cairo, Egypt, deals with sex education, contraceptive
advice for adolescents and safe abortions.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of conservative Muslim and Roman Catholic
countries with Vatican support continued to oppose aspects of the
plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many private organizations interested in population policy are
also frustrated, saying that the Vatican and its allies have
deflected the conference from its fundamental purpose of reviewing
how the Cairo plan is working. ``What is objectionable is the
Vatican's refusal to accept that the conference's purpose is to
review implementation of the Cairo plan and suggest ways of
improving it, not reopening the agreement,'' said Ingar Bruegemann,
director general of the International Planned Parenthood
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a Catholic theologian, Daniel Maguire, professor of
moral theology at Marquette University in Milwaukee, also attacked
the Vatican's teachings on birth control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as head of an organization called Religious
Consultation on Population, Reproductive Health and Ethics, he
cited St. Antonius, a 15th- century archbishop of Florence, Italy,
as a church father who defended abortion. Maguire told the
conference that the Vatican should drop its ``dogmatism'' on the
subject because it ``offends many Catholics and most of the world's
religions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a different kind of attack on the Vatican is coming
from Catholics for a Free Choice, an organization opposed to the
Vatican's teachings on sexual matters, and 70 other voluntary
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   They are seeking to downgrade the Vatican at the United Nations
from being one of only two nonmember observer states, along with
Switzerland, to the more modest status of nongovernmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
   As an observer state the Vatican can take a full part in all
U.N. conferences, addressing them at will although it has no vote.
As a nongovernmental organization it would loose those privileges.
``The best thing that ever happened to us was when the Vatican
opposed abortion for Kosovo rape victims,'' said the group's
president, Frances Kissling. ``Support came rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo plan, at the center of this week's conference, seeks
to ease population growth, allowing the world population to rise
from the present 6 billion to 9.8 billion by 2050, then freeze it
there. The means for accomplishing that is to improve the lot of
women, in the belief they will then have smaller families.

MAINE DAM REMOVAL COULD MARK TURNING POINT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Maine _ This is how the end might come for a dam in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, on an overcast summer morning in the lush green
Kennebec Valley, a lone backhoe scooped about 30 buckets of earth
from a temporary gravel wall that had been built to patch the
60-foot gap engineers cut in the 917-foot-wide Edwards Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, accompanied by the pealing of church bells and cheers
of hundreds of spectators, the caged Kennebec River turned wild.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying more than a century of sediment and seven generations
of memories, an estimated 18,000 cubic feet of water per second
roared through the breach and, for the first time since 1837,
flowed freely toward Merrymeeting Bay and the ocean 43 miles away.
Soon, nine species of fish, including the endangered shortnose
sturgeon, will once again be free to populate the river.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and anglers plan to use their success here to
renew their push to remove more of the nation's estimated 75,000
dams. And at the top of their wish list are eight in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of something that is going to affect
this entire nation,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who is
pictured on his official biography holding a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the removal of Edwards Dam as ``a statement about
our capacity to honor and respect God's creation, the sacramental
commons, and to live not just in the past, but in a visionary and a
different future in a way of balance and harmony with creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's enthusiasm for dam removal horrifies defenders of some
of the Northwest dams, which not only kill salmon but generate
hydropower and support irrigation, navigation and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (dam removal) is a further indication that Secretary
Babbitt has this in mind and takes pleasure out of doing these
things,'' said Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., a fervent opponent
of removing any dams from the Snake River in Washington state.
``It's a perverse sort of pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   The breaching of Edwards Dam marks the first time a federal
agency has ordered a dam removed after deciding that the cost to
migrating fish denied access to their historic upstream spawning
grounds was greater than the benefit from the hydropower.
</P>
<P>
   Similar decisions could be reached in Washington state, whose
growth is partly attributable to the economic benefits of
hydropower. At the same time, salmon, the very symbol of the
region, are struggling to survive because dams block their
migratory routes.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial proposal in the state is a push by
environmentalists, driven by a desire to restore endangered salmon
stocks, to remove four large federal dams on the lower Snake River.
The Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite
dams are valuable for irrigation and hydropower but harmful to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late this year or early next year, we will come out with a
recommendation either to breach or not to breach, or some third
way,'' said Terry Garcia, the assistant Commerce secretary
responsible for the National Marine Fisheries Service. ``We're
going to start engaging the region in a wide-ranging debate, not
just on the science, but on all of the components to a decision
that would affect those dams and that river ... and hopefully reach
a consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   But consensus is not in sight. Pitted against the
environmentalists are powerful economic interests opposed to dam
removal, and elected officials from the state have lined up to
decry the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate is irrelevant, when we ought to be saying many
species have been listed as endangered, and what do we need to do
to get them unlisted,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. ``We're
spending a lot of time debating whether the Snake dams should come
down, and not enough time putting our energy into other ways to
save salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   A more likely candidate for removal in the short term is the
Elwha Dam on the Olympic Peninsula. Congress has voted to remove
the dam, and is now considering how to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also several other, lesser known instances in
which a dam could be removed much sooner. The Simpson Timber Co. in
Shelton hopes next summer to remove an unused 14-foot dam from
Goldsborough Creek, a major south Puget Sound tributary, while
PacifiCorps, a Portland-based utility, is negotiating with
environmentalists over how to pay for the likely removal of Condit
Dam on the White Salmon River in southwest Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists are pushing for the removal of the Enloe
Dam on the Similkameen River in Okanogan County, while others think
the Cushman Dam, owned by Tacoma Public Utilities, should go.
</P>
<P>
   People have been building dams for thousands of years _ the
first known dam was built on the Nile by the Egyptians in 2800 BC.
Early American colonists used dams to power grist mills and saw
mills, building their first dam in South Berwick, Maine, in 1634.
</P>
<P>
   But removing them has become a trend. An estimated 121 dams have
been removed in the United States in the past 40 years, but the
breaching of the Edwards Dam ``really marks a turning point in how
we view rivers across the country,'' said Margaret Bowman, senior
director of dam programs at the environmental group American
Rivers. ``In the past, dam removal was considered a very radical
and not very feasible way of restoring a river, but the Edwards
demonstrates that this can be a practical and cost-effective way of
repairing damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of dams has become an international issue. A World
Commission on Dams is studying a variety of projects, including
Washington state's Grand Coulee dam, in an effort to assess the
impacts of dams.
</P>
<P>
   The hydropower industry is bracing for the debate. Industry
officials are urging policymakers and consumers to consider the
benefits of hydropower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 10 or so years, the lion's share of hydro dams
are coming up for relicensing, so this is really a pivotal time for
hydropower,'' said Richard McMahon, an official of Edison Electric
Institute, an industry trade association. ``A lot of these dams are
extremely productive resources _ emissions free, renewable _ and
we'd like people to see the bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, the picture was considerably less cloudy than in the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the dam removal movement was in full swing, the
Edwards was generating just .1 percent of Maine's electrical power,
and the mills for which the dam was built had long since closed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied a new
license to Edwards, citing environmental costs. Fish once so
plentiful that a laborer's contract stipulated he would not be
served salmon more than once daily were now never seen above the
dam and struggling to reproduce below it.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Edwards Dam, facing a $9 million pricetag to build
a fish ladder, agreed to allow the dam to be removed. And the
owners of other upstream dams, as well as Bath Iron Works, agreed
to pay the $7 million cost of removal as mitigation for the harm
their own projects do to fish.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the transformation of the river was dramatic. Above
the dam, what had been a giant muddy reservoir populated by worms
and flatwater fish became a rushing river that dropped 10 feet and
soon is expected to attract the salmon and sturgeon that populate
the lower river, as well as predatory birds such as osprey and
eagles. Below the dam, the blue-gray water turned brown as the
sediment and debris began to flow _ a temporary disturbance from
which the river is expected to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials predict that removing the dam will add 1,100
shortnosed sturgeon to the river and double the number of Atlantic
sturgeon to 10,000 over the next three to five years, as well as
benefiting other migratory fish, including the American shad,
Atlantic salmon, striped bass, blueback herring and alewives.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the dam to fish has been seen around Memorial Day
each year, when hundreds of thousands of fish gather below the dam,
flopping around after failing to traverse the dam to reach their
upstream spawning habitat. Next year, they are expected to swim as
far in as Waterville, 17 miles north, until they hit the next dam.

BUSH SEEKS TO CURRY FAVOR IN SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Encroaching on political turf that Vice
President Al Gore has cultivated for years, Gov. George W. Bush
ventured into Silicon Valley on Thursday to fatten his already
flush campaign treasury and to unveil proposals favored by the
technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor departed from his standard text to make an
aggressive pitch to the computer titans in the room, a group with
growing political influence that both political camps are wooing.
He chided President Clinton and Gore, among other things, for not
allowing American companies to sell sensitive high-technology
products overseas when those products are available from
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our best companies feel frustrated that they cannot sell some
of their products abroad even when equipment technology is sold by
foreign competitors,'' he said at a breakfast attended by about 500
people.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, in a step the administration has been headed
toward for some time, the White House announced an easing of export
restrictions on high-powered computers, which computer makers had
lobbied for aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also criticized the administration for not loosening
immigration restrictions that would allow technology companies to
recruit more workers. He suggested that the administration had
moved too slowly to embrace a bill in Congress that would limit
lawsuits arising from Year 2000 computer breakdowns. And he
advocated lower taxes for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters paid $1,000 apiece to hear Bush's pitch for the
Republican presidential nomination at the breakfast meeting here or
at a dinner on Thursday night in San Francisco. In all, he took in
$1.7 million from the two events, contributing to a total of $5
million from California this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, we were one of the first states to protect the
technology industry from Y2K legislation _ the biggest potential
ambulance chase in the millenium,'' Bush said. ``I'm pleased to see
that our current president may be signing a bill of some form that
came out of Congress. In this administration, wisdom comes so
rarely that we should not complain even if it comes too late. But
I'll tell you this, from the very beginning I will take the side of
innovation over litigation every single time.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also advocated an increase in the number of highly
skilled workers allowed into the country under visas known as H1-B,
a move adamantly opposed by labor unions. He said the cap of
115,000 workers for this year has already been reached, and that
could damage companies facing a shortage of computer engineers and
software technicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limit on H1-B visas should be raised, Mr. President and
Mr. Vice President,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the closest Bush came to directly taking on Gore, the
leading candidate for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign advisers said they had considered lambasting the
vice president head on. But ultimately, they said, they decided _
and Bush concurred _ that there would be no gain in directly
attacking Gore this early and at a time when polls show he is far
less popular than Bush. They said the outpouring at the event here
on Thursday would speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be disingenuous to say there wasn't some
discussion,'' one Bush adviser, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said of the talks about whether to go after Gore. ``But
the basic feeling was that we have our own agenda to lay out.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans, Bush's national finance chairman, disputed that the
campaign had invaded Gore's territory. ``That's a myth,'' he said
as donors dined on quiche and sausages. ``It was never his turf.
It's one of the great myths of America _ and we're demonstrating
that this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he stuck to his own agenda for the most part, Bush could
not resist referring to Gore's famous gaffe that he had invented
the Internet. He incorporates a line about that in virtually every
speech _ and it was particularly well received on Thursday.
Democrats, he said, ``no more invented prosperity than they
invented the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Romash, the deputy chairwoman of the Gore campaign, said
the vice president was not threatened by the outpouring here for
Bush. ``This is one of those places where he has support and we
have a lot of support,'' Ms. Romash said. ``We're pleased with the
level of support we're receiving.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Gore has long held a deep interest in computers, many
software financiers are Republicans. And Bush has some ties of his
own to the industry. In Texas, he has assiduously tapped executives
in the ``Silicon Hills'' of Austin, where many software and
semiconductor companies are based.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks on Thursday morning, Bush went out of his way to
cite Silicon Valley again and again _ far more than he has other
regions on this last day of his three-day swing up and down
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredibly fascinating place,'' he said. ``To me, it
means more than a V-chip or an area or a spot on the map,'' It's a
piece of the spirit of America. It not only talks about new
technologies that shape our lives, but it speaks about daring, and
enterprise _ and the ultimate American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other proposals, Bush called for freeing the Internet from
duties and tariffs; proposed a permanent federal tax credit for
research and development and reduction in marginal tax rates.

GORE HIRES MORE ADVISERS AFTER RIVALS GAIN IN FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore hired several new advisers
Thursday, a day after learning that both his Republican and
Democratic competitors for the presidency had raised surprising
amounts of cash in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   While a Gore spokesman said that the hirings had nothing to do
with the fund-raising figures, one source close to the campaign
described Gore aides as ``catatonic'' over the news that Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, had taken in $36
million so far and Gore's Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, had raised $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's cache was well shy of the the Gore campaign's $18.5
million but considerably better than expected in a race against a
sitting vice president. A second source said the Gore campaign was
particularly concerned by the Bradley numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore spokesman, Chris Lehane, said the hirings had been in
the works well before the campaign numbers were released.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane insisted that no one at the Gore campaign was
``catatonic.'' ``I would say, `nonchalant,''' he said. ``The Gore
campaign is exactly where it hoped to be, and Republicans almost
always outraise Democrats.'' Asked about Bradley's numbers, he
said, ``I'll let other people evaluate other campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a statement, Lehane also said that ``Gore campaign
chairman Tony Coelho was brought in to build a team, and he is
doing just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho is bringing in Celinda Lake, a pollster, and has hired
Gore's old friend Carter Eskew as senior media adviser _ a
surprising addition because Gore's longtime media adviser, Bob
Squier, and Eskew are former business partners who had a famous
falling out several years ago. Eskew, a consultant for tobacco and
pharmaceutical companies, will not be replacing Squier, Lehane
said, adding that their specific roles are not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is leaving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore adviser who has worked with both Squier and Eskew in the
past said, ``Despite their other differences, the reality is they
share a longstanding personal interest in Al Gore's career. I'm
sure there's some discomfort,'' for the two to find themselves
working together again, he said, ``but it always felt funny for one
of them to be involved and not the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Also hired Thursday was Lauren Choi, a policy adviser formerly
with the Treasury Department. Lehane said other additions to the
campaign staff would be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Squier nor Eskew returned calls.

TEXAS COURT DECISION COULD HIT ATHLETIC SPORTS SPONSORS HARD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a ruling that could make hundreds of amateur
sports sponsors recheck their safety lists, the Texas Supreme Court
held Thursday that a former college student could sue a fraternity
for injuries he suffered in a fraternity-sponsored game.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Texas, the high court held that athletic
sponsors are not entitled to the same protections against lawsuits
as the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The court decided that Edward Lockwood Moore III, who was
blinded in one eye during a 1992 paint-ball ``war game'' while he
was a student at Stephen F. Austin University in Nacogdoches, could
sue the event sponsor, Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which Moore had
accused of providing inadequate safety gear or instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine a sport or recreational activity whose
participants, sponsors, coaches and venue providers will not be
affected,'' said Justice Craig Enoch, one of three justices who
unsuccessfully argued for a hearing on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the court majority, without comment, upheld a 1997
decision by the lst Court of Appeals in Houston, which ruled that
Moore was entitled to a trial of his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Supreme Court had agreed to hear the
fraternity's appeal of the Houston appeals court decision. But, in
an unusual move and without explanation, the court changed its mind
Thursday and upheld the lower court.
</P>
<P>
   There was no majority opinion, but three justices _ Enoch,
Nathan Hecht and Priscilla Owen dissented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fears of critics of the Texas Supreme Court, this
ruling demonstrates that the court continues to be interested in
protecting consumers' rights,'' said Ken Hoagland, a spokesman for
Texans for Lawsuit Reform. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``One can hope, however, that the Supreme Court believes that
gloves, catcher's masks and knee pads are sufficient safety gear
for softball and baseball games commonly sponsored by charitable
organizations.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Moore's attorney, R.L. ``Pete'' McKinney of Houston, said he
will now go back to the district court, which initially dismissed
his client's lawsuit. The fraternity had argued that it was not
liable for Moore's injury under the state's ``competitive contact
sports doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   That defense recognizes the inherent risk accepted by
participants in a sport. A player is liable only if he hurts an
opponent through reckless or intentional conduct not connected to
actual play.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1st Court held that sponsors of amateur athletic events
should be held to a higher standard, and now the Texas Supreme
Court has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   While players may get caught up in the ``spirit of the
contest,'' sponsors and other non-participants ``have the benefit
of reflection before they act,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said the decision means that sponsors must provide
proper equipment and take ``ordinary care'' in how events are
conducted. ``All it does is put a burden of ordinary care on the
sponsor of an event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ruling shouldn't change how most little leagues and
other amateur sports organizations operate.
</P>
<P>
   South Texas College of Law professor Paul McGreal agreed that
``it doesn't look like that big of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   By not rendering a full decision that might have given guidance
to lower courts across the state on the subject, McGreal said, the
Texas Supreme Court opted without explanation not to hear the case
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Others were not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys who had read the appellate court's ruling said that
Thursday's Supreme Court decision not to hear the case will need to
be taken seriously by youth associations that sponsor sporting
events such as baseball little leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Those groups now have the potential to be sued if participants
are injured during events, the attorneys said. Not all sponsors
will be affected, however. For example, a company that provides a
youth sports association with the money to sponsor a team would
have little exposure to liability, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will this have a chilling effect on sponsor of youth sports?
It could,'' said one Austin trial attorney who had read the opinion
but did not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In the paint-ball game in which Moore was injured, his lawyer
said, players were provided with only thin plastic ``laboratory
goggles'' loosely fastened with a rubber band, rather than heavier,
more protective gear.
</P>
<P>
   The game was part of a fraternity ``rush'' activity to recruit
new members. Moore's goggles snagged on a tree limb, and he was hit
in the eye by a paint-ball fired by an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said Moore now lives in Houston and works as an
emergency medical technician in the Nacogdoches area.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, still
firmly in control of his army, is sending reinforcements into the
pro-Western Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, NATO's military
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In his first appearance before Congress since the Kosovo air war
began on March 24, Clark said the Yugoslav leader was
``simultaneously preparing forces, gathering intelligence and is
capable of moving against'' President Milo Djukanovic of
Montenegro, whose government is considered more democratic than
that of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference later at the Pentagon, Clark said NATO
intelligence had detected recent reinforcements into Montenegro, as
well as efforts by Milosevic to put ethnic Serbs and political
allies of Djukanovic's opponent into positions of authority there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montenegro remains a very sensitive area,'' the general told
reporters. ``President Milosevic is calculating what is to his best
advantage in terms of making moves in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Defense Secretary William Cohen declined to say what
NATO would do if Milosevic tried to oust Djukanovic. But during the
air war the alliance threatened to intervene if there was an
outright coup in Montenegro by forces loyal to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic has been very wary of Serbian encroachment, walking a
difficult political line as he tried to distance the republic from
Milosevic yet avoid provoking him while continuing to court the
West for aid and support.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing outrage among ordinary Serbs after the 78-day
air war and a CIA operation aimed at destabilizing the Belgrade
government, Clark said Milosevic was trying to rebuild his
political power base while keeping his political foes off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic retains a formidable power in Yugoslavia and he's an
expert at dividing the opposition,'' the general told the Senate
Armed Services Committee. ``The opposition is fragmented and
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Milosevic was now trying to ``relegitimate himself''
with a Yugoslav public angry over widespread destruction throughout
the country that many residents say they are realizing is the fault
of their president. He is ``portraying himself as the victor in the
conflict by promoting reconstruction,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   With Yugoslav troops now out of Kosovo, the general said
Milosevic's military was conducting a low-level campaign of
expelling ethnic Albanians from the Sanjak region between Serbia
and Montenegro.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly three weeks after the first NATO troops entered Kosovo,
Clark said, there were now 23,000 allied troops in Kosovo, 4,500 of
them Americans. Eventually, there will be 7,000 American troops in
Kosovo, the last arriving by Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The general was less precise when it came to saying when
American forces could leave. ``The future is very unpredictable in
the Balkans at this point because it very much depends on the
continuity in power of one individual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``I don't see a decadelong commitment in
Kosovo, although the U.N. may be there for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour hearing, senators generally heaped praise
and gentle questions on the four-star general.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by several lawmakers to assess the cooperation by Kosovo
Albanian rebels, Clark said he had a ``80 to 90 percent level of
confidence'' that most of the rebel fighters would comply with
their agreement to disband in the next 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the ultimate degree of compliance will be,
but this is the Balkans, and we know that people on both sides will
be hedging their bets because people in this region have seen all
of these international promises before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO peacekeepers move into Kosovo, the military is beginning
to examine the strengths and weaknesses of an air war that Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee, said
Thursday cost about $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clark praised the Navy's and Air Force's precision-guided bombs
and missiles, as well as long-range bombers including the B-2 and
B-1. He also cited the Apache helicopters in Albania, maligned for
taking so long to deploy and then never flying in combat, noting
that they had intimidated Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   But across Capitol Hill, the Army commander of the Apache
gunships, Brig. Gen. Richard Cody, told a House hearing that many
pilots sent to fly the tank-killing helicopters were undertrained
and underequipped to fight in conditions that he said were the
toughest he had seen in his 27-year military career.
</P>
<P>
   Cody, one of the Army's most respected helicopter officers,
outlined his criticisms in an internal memo sent last month to the
incoming Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, and explained
them Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to a House Armed Services subcommittee, Cody
defended his memo, which also criticized a shortage of night-vision
goggles for pilots and poor radios, and urged lawmakers to finance
updated equipment and more pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 Apaches sent to Albania from bases in Germany were so
short of qualified air crews that 22 experienced crew members from
Fort Bragg, N.C., were sent to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Cody, in an interview during a break, said one reason the
Apaches were delayed was that NATO initially planned to send them
to Skopje, Macedonia, in early April. When the Macedonian
government balked, the helicopters were sent instead to Tirana,
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   But the Albanian air base required extensive improvements before
the Apaches could land, and the mountainous terrain into Kosovo
posed much more difficult missions and required more training,
especially at night, than would have been the case in Macedonia,
Cody said.

CALIFORNIA PASSES LAW LIMITING HANDGUN PURCHASES TO ONE PER MONTH

 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California Legislature Thursday approved a measure to limit
handgun purchases to one a month, making it the largest state to
pass a measure that gun-control advocates say would reduce the flow
of guns to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control proponents and some law-enforcement officials have
long argued that sharply limiting the number of revolvers and
pistols that can be bought at one time is a major step in helping
close off the illegal gun market. The authorities say that
intermediaries for gun traffickers often buy several firearms at
once from federally licensed dealers, and the guns are then resold
to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, a person who passes a background check can
buy an unlimited number of guns at one time and as often as they
wish. Three states _ Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina _ have
passed laws limiting handgun purchases to one every 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In California, about 41,000 of the approximately 183,000
handguns sold in 1998 went to people who bought more than one
handgun at a time, according to data compiled by state regulators.
In some instances, the purchases involved eight guns or more.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has not said whether he will sign
the bill, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the strongest measures in the country to shut
down the flow of handguns to the black market,'' said Luis Tolley,
a lobbyist for Handgun Control, an advocacy group. ``We hope
California's action will encourage other states and Congress to
adopt similar measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the legislation was the first setback for the
National Rifle Association after its recent success in defeating a
congressional proposal that would have strengthened federal laws on
firearm sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But while advocates like Tolley applauded the passage of the
California bill, the impact of similar measures elsewhere has been
mixed. The new bill, like others that exist, applies only to
handguns, not to rifles.

   Law-enforcement authorities in Virginia, which enacted a
one-handgun-a month measure in 1993, said that the law had reduced
the illegal trafficking of guns bought from dealers in the state.
But traffickers have simply turned elsewhere for weapons or
criminals have found other strategies to buy guns in Virginia,
federal and state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a notorious case in 1995, for instance, 15 members of the
Norfolk State University band fraternity, Kappa Kappa Psi, were
recruited by gun-runners to buy handguns one at a time from area
gun stores. The traffickers eventually shipped 100 handguns to
Washington, where many were used in crimes, according to newspaper
accounts published at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the impact of laws restricting handgun purchases to
one every 30 days has been far less harsh than predicted by dealers
and pro-gun groups like the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Marcus, the owner of Bob's Gun and Tackle Shop in
Norfolk, Va., and the president of the Virginia Firearms Dealers
Association, which opposed the Virginia law when it was proposed,
said that the law had not reduced sales. In addition, he said, the
number of customers who have complained about having to wait 30
days to buy more than one handgun has also been small.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that if the numbers bear out that there has been a
reduction in illicit trafficking, then I would have to say that
this is a positive,'' Marcus said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, licensed gun dealers must file a report with
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the federal agency
that regulates the manufacture and sale of guns, when an individual
buys two or more firearms from that dealer during any five-day
period. An ATF spokesman said that the agency receives some 1,500
to 1,800 reports each week, or up to 100,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   But connecting those multiple sales to handguns seized by the
police or recovered in connection with crimes is complicated. While
ATF data suggest that only about 1.3 percent of the crimes traced
by the agency since 1994 were determined to be part of a multiple
sale, that figure may be understated because the agency only began
to centralize multiple sales records in 1995, said Joseph J. Vince,
a former top ATF official.
</P>
<P>
   Vince said that the impact of a few states adopting such laws
would likely be small because illegal gun traffickers would either
go elsewhere or buy weapons from unregulated places like gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Helsley, the California representative for the NRA, said
that the group opposed the measure because it believed the bill did
not provide law-enforcement officials with any additional
crime-fighting tools.
</P>
<P>
   Helsley said that California already had a 10-day waiting period
before a handgun buyer can pick up a firearm, giving officials
ample opportunity to check on the buyer's background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what is arguably the most sophisticated system in the
United States, and the reason we are supposed to have this new law
is because it doesn't work,'' Helsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, California lawmakers twice defeated bills similar to
the one passed Thursday. But Tolley, the lobbyist for Handgun
Control, said that the tide turned in the bill's favor when it was
passed by the California state Assembly just days after the
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in April.
On Thursday, the bill passed by a wide margin in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before Littleton, I was saying we were three or four
votes short,'' Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Littleton shootings, President Clinton announced that
he backed the concept of restricting handgun sales to
one-per-month. But such a proposal never received serious
consideration in the recent congressional debate over firearms.

HOUSE TAKES UP FINANCIAL OVERHAUL MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Calif., N.Y. Ga., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers who want to deregulate the nation's
financial system won an important test vote Thursday as the House
of Representatives debated a measure that would remove the last
remnants of Depression-era laws that have largely kept banks,
securities firms and insurance companies from entering one
another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 227-203 vote, which enabled the sponsors to bring the
measure to the floor, broke largely along party lines as the House
prepared for a final vote later Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is endorsed by the White House, although administration
officials and many Democratic lawmakers criticized some new
provisions Thursday that they said would make it easier for
insurance companies to disclose confidential health information
about patients, weaken laws against money laundering and not do
enough to prevent discrimination by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the House, the bill will be forwarded to a
congressional conference committee, where the lawmakers will
attempt to reconcile it with a different version that the Senate
adopted two months ago over the objections of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers have moved the bill swiftly through the House by
pushing aside several contentious issues that could still doom the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's debate held the promise of producing a historic
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental precept of this bill is that it will end the
artificial restraints on commerce embodied in 65 years of law,''
said Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, who is chairman of the House Banking
Committee and was one of the main authors of the legislation. He
said it would ultimately save consumers at least $15 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   House approval would mark the first time that both chambers of
Congress in the same legislative session have approved measures
repealing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. That landmark law
reflected the view that the close affiliations between banks and
securities firms had been a primary cause of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The Glass-Steagall Act restricted the securities activities of
national banks and prohibited investment banks from engaging in
commercial banking activities. Over the last 12 years, those
restrictions have eased considerably as judges and regulators have
interpreted the act more loosely.
</P>
<P>
   Their rulings have enabled the rise of some enormous financial
conglomerates. But many federal and state restrictions remain, and
they either limit the expansion of such conglomerates or make it
prohibitively expensive for affiliations between investment banks,
commercial banks and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate bills eliminate most of those
remaining restrictions. Among the provisions of the legislation
considered Thursday night by the House:
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies that engage in any activities that are ``financial
in nature'' would be able to affiliate under a holding company.
Insurance underwriters and real estate developers would not be
permitted to be in subsidiaries of the conglomerates but would have
to operate as affiliates. By structuring such companies in this
way, both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department would
have important roles in regulating conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restrictions would continue to limit industrial companies from
owning banks.
</P>
<P>
   _ The legislation authorizes the establishment of a new banking
institution, the wholesale financial institution, that has the
powers of a national bank but could only accept deposits of more
than $100,000 and would not be federally insured.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new federal crime would be created that outlaws the practice
of using trickery and pretending to be a customer to obtain
confidential bank information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banks would be required to post surcharges on their automated
teller machines.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill has been criticized by the administration and
many Democrats because it takes away the Treasury Department's
regulatory authority over nationally chartered banks and heavily
dilutes the requirements that all banks make loans to minorities,
inner-city neighborhoods, rural areas and others traditionally
denied access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic supporters of the House legislation either withdrew
their support Thursday or raised criticisms of the measure after
many of the items they had thought were in the legislation aimed at
protecting minority borrowers and the privacy rights of all
consumers were removed by the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all voted for this legislation in committee because we were
able to have strong community reinvestment provisions because of
consumer protections and because of strong antiredlining
provisions,'' said Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., the ranking member of
his party on the banking committee. ``Once those items eroded, so
did our support.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, the House measure had not faced any of the
partisan bickering that pervaded the Senate legislation. The House
bill was co-sponsored by leading Republicans and Democrats and it
was largely embraced by the Treasury Department after it rejected a
proposal by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,
that would have the effect of taking regulatory authority away from
the Treasury and giving it to the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's debate was steeped in partisan wrangling after
House Republicans stripped the measure of a provision that would
have prohibited insurance companies affiliated with banks from
discriminating against poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, known as redlining, is already against the law for
banks. A provision pre-empting state insurance laws and extending
the prohibition to the insurance industry passed earlier this year
in the House Banking Committee by a single vote. It was sponsored
by Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican leadership decided late Wednesday to strip
the Lee Amendment and not allow further consideration of it by the
full House, Democrats who had supported the legislation defected in
mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a good job in fostering conditions in which our
capitalist system can flourish and it's in our interest that our
capitalist system flourish,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``But
can we try to do a little bit for those who are being left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats also complained that the legislation did not go
far enough in protecting the privacy interests of bank customers
and patients. And in one of his final acts in office, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin criticized an amendment to the Bank Secrecy
Act proposed by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., that would eliminate the
requirements that banks report suspicious money transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are now required to report all transactions of more than
$10,000 to the federal government as part of the secrecy act, which
is intended to discourage tax evasion and money laundering. The
amendment criticized by Rubin would raise that amount to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The House ultimately defeated the Barr amendment.

MRS. CLINTON GIVES FIRST SIGN OF POLICY DIFFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1 of the New York Times.)  
(mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first public indication of a policy difference between
Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband, the first lady Thursday
joined New York labor and political leaders in pressing White House
officials to scale back proposed Medicare cuts that could hurt New
York hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, taking a break from preparations for her possible
campaign for the Senate from New York, met in the White House with
the New Yorkers, President Clinton's chief of staff and a senior
health care adviser. Mrs. Clinton was responding to the invitation
of Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has asserted that the
president's proposed cuts could cost teaching hospitals in New York
billions of dollars a year and ``risk the very fabric of our health
care system.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said the first lady
had ``expressed her interest in trying to alleviate the
difficulties'' facing teaching hospitals. Ms. Berry said the first
lady spent most of her 20 minutes at the meeting listening, and she
and other White House officials played down the notion that the
Clintons were in conflict over a major aspect of one of Clinton's
biggest policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton's decision to accept Schumer's
invitation and join the meeting, which was held across the hall
from the Oval Office and at the center of the West Wing of the
White House, clearly put her in the public position of appearing to
join some of the most powerful forces in New York politics in
fighting budget cuts that Clinton has advocated, first to balance
the budget and than to help finance changes in the Medicare
program. Mrs. Clinton's associates have long suggested that the
first lady would seek opportunities to draw differences between
herself and her husband, and suggested that this issue was the
ideal one to do it with.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's stroll to the Roosevelt Room came at a time when
she has embarked on an effort to construct her own political
identity as she prepares for a possible race to succeed Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who is retiring at the end of 2000. She
rented a campaign headquarters near Madison Square Garden on
Thursday, and plans to formally create an exploratory committee
next Tuesday, before beginning a four-day trip across central New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a press conference Thursday at the White House,
suggested that he was sympathetic to concerns by teaching
hospitals, in New York and elsewhere, that some of his
budget-reduction initiatives had been too severe on them. He said
he was looking for ways to rectify that, and noted that his
Medicare plan proposed earlier this week included a $7.5 billion
fund directed particularly at teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would encourage the senators from New York, or anyone else
who's concerned about this, to bring those concerns, bring the
facts to the table, get it out in the open _ then embrace the idea
of Medicare reform, pass that fund, and then allocate it as it
should be allocated,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the merits of the complex issue notwithstanding,
Clinton seemed at once resigned and appreciative of what both his
wife and Vice President Al Gore, who is running for president, have
been doing in recent days as they draw away from the man who has
for seven years been the dominant figure in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore disagrees with his actions over the next year and a
half, Clinton said wistfully, ``then of course he will have to say
so. And I will take no offense at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if my wife decides to run for senator from New York, then
some of the disagreements that we've had in the past over decisions
I've made as president she may be constrained to state publicly
because they will be relevant to the future,'' the president
continued. ``And that's the way a democracy works.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this issue was ideally suited for Mrs. Clinton to
draw some distance. For one thing, it gives her a chance to appear
to be in a position of helping one of the central aspects of New
York's health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   It also allowed her to strike a public allegiance with Dennis
Rivera, president of the union representing 150,00 health workers
and one of the most influential forces in Democratic politics in
New York state. Rivera has already been working behind-the-scenes
to help Mrs. Clinton prepare for the campaign, and he was delighted
Thursday at her presence at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are elated with the meeting,'' Rivera reported afterwards.
``We had the enthusiastic support of the first lady. She clearly
understands the problems that the teaching hospitals in New York
state are facing. She's committed to help us find solutions to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that she will get the assistance of the president of
the United States in this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry, Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, declined to say whether
Mrs. Clinton would do that, and described her commitment as a
general one to the future of teaching hospitals. ``The effect of
these meetings is she wants to try to assure that they don't have
any undue burdens,'' Ms. Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer offered generally high praise of Clinton's Medicare
plan, which, most notably, would for the first time provide
reimbursements for prescription drugs. He was critical, though, of
part of the way the president would finance that, the reduced
Medicare reimbursements for teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said the president's plan would cost New York hospitals
$39 billion in the next 10 years, on top of reductions that were
brought about as part of the 1997 budget-balancing act. The meeting
Thursday, which was lead by John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff, was intended to persuade the White House to roll back that
policy, Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said that Mrs. Clinton was clearly supportive of that
effort during the meeting. ``I made the major pitch but Mrs.
Clinton chimed in,'' Schumer recounted Thursday evening.

IRA TALKS HALT, TO MUCH TEETH GNASHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Marathon talks to resolve the
disarmament impasse that threatens the province's peace settlement
broke off early on Friday. But a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony
Blair said they would resume on Friday morning and end with a
statement on the ``way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second day that the grinding negotiations had gone
into the early morning and the fifth straight day that Blair and
his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, had spent trying to find a
compromise between the Ulster Unionists, the Protestant party that
is the province's largest, and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had set midnight Wednesday as the ``absolute'' deadline
for settling the dispute but relaxed the date, his spokesman said
late Thursday, because ``we do not believe the gap is
unbridgeable.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an optimistic view shared by few people in the air of
gloom and disappointment at the Stormont Castle Buildings as the
participants drove off into a rainy night.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's spokesman said a long-awaited report on disarmament by
Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, chairman of the an international
commission on the issue, would be presented to the negotiators on
Friday morning. The two governments will receive position
statements from the parties and are to decide what promise the
combined views hold for moving on to the next steps in the process
laid out in the April 1998 peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The general expectation was that a decision would be taken to
postpone further negotiations until after the summer months of
sectarian parades that have been flash points of tension.
</P>
<P>
   The most volatile the marches is scheduled for Sunday. It is the
procession of the Protestant Orange Order from Drumcree Church.
</P>
<P>
   The government-appointed Parades Commission on Monday prohibited
the parade from passing into the Roman Catholic area, and the
police and British troops have been building trenches and
barricades in the town, in County Armagh, to enforce the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The talks on Thursday began at noon, after having adjourned at 4
a.m., and Blair warned that the public was becoming frustrated with
the bewildering deadlock and would have no sympathy for failure.
``The entire civilized world will not understand if we cannot put
this together and make it work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with a similar sense of exasperation and urgency, Ahern
told reporters that failure would be ``unforgivable and
unexplainable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an awful lot to gain and a frightening amount to
lose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-fought accord of April 1998 creates a series of
power-sharing institutions intended to end the violent conflict
between the majority Protestants and the minority Catholics of this
British province that has cost more than 3,200 lives in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists are demanding that the IRA begin to disarm
immediately, to take part in the crucial next step of the
settlement, the creation of the executive cabinet that will run the
new Northern Ireland Assembly. But Sinn Fein leaders refuse to make
that pledge, saying the accord calls for no such preconditions.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, President Clinton called Gerry Adams, president
of Sinn Fein, and David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionists, to
reinforce the need to achieve a resolution promptly. A spokesman
for Blair said Clinton had made it clear ``that the U.S. and the
wider world will not understand if we don't get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the guerrillas' disarmament has been the principal
obstacle to a settlement since paramilitary groups began declaring
cease-fires and expressing interest in a political solution five
years ago. It was sidelined in the final days before the April 1998
accord and has now come back with the power to derail the overall
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists have taken their stand on disarmament at a
critical moment, because the creation of the executive, on which
Sinn Fein has two seats, signals the moment that the new
legislature in Belfast can assume its powers from the British
government in London.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had set the first deadline in the hopes that the transfer
could occur on Thursday, when new legislatures in Scotland and
Wales took on their legislative authority. Instead, Blair had to
cancel his own appearance in Edinburgh, where the queen was leading
inaugural celebrations of the Scottish Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he was staying in Belfast because of the ``huge
progress'' already made and the ``historic, seismic shifts in the
political landscape'' already brought about by the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein has made a proposal that entails a commitment to
achieve disarmament by next May, the date set out in the original
agreement, with a first turnover of weapons by December. The
organization insists that it has to be allowed to take up
immediately the two positions its vote count in the legislative
elections entitled it to in the 10-member cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists offered counterproposals on Thursday
afternoon that insisted on actual disarmament, not just the
promise, as the condition for letting Sinn Fein into the
government. Touching on the deep distrust between the political
parties, Trimble said, ``Sinn Fein promises are not bankable.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair acknowledged the differences but said that the British and
Irish governments had offered the Unionists ``absolute fail safe
legislative guarantees'' that any party failing to live up to its
promises to disarm would be expelled from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the problem was ``was no longer a basic principle
dividing the parties, but one of sequencing and time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This is the slender thread by which the future of
Northern Ireland hangs.''

INVESTORS CREAM STARBUCKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Investors Thursday blasted Seattle coffee retailer
Starbucks for its announced plan to branch out into new retail
businesses and a new forecast of lower earnings, beating back its
share price as much as 41 percent at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock fell $10.63 to close at $26.94, rebounding
from a session low of $23.44. Starbucks Wednesday announced its
plans for more Internet businesses and said it expects to earn only
54 cents a share for the fiscal year ending in September, below the
Wall Street consensus of 60 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent investors wild. Starbucks was the most actively
traded Nasdaq stock, with 73 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz told analysts
that the company is counting on acceptance of the Starbucks brand
at its 2,300 coffee shops to carry over to new Internet ventures,
including on-line sales of gourmet foods, cooking utensils and
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the company will form a new subsidiary to
handle the new lines of business he sees as necessary for Starbucks
to grow beyond the packaging and brewing of coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck Hill of Boston-based First Call Corp., which polls
analysts, said 17 of the 20 analysts who follow Starbucks see
problems percolating next year for the coffee giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six of the 17 lowered their recommendations for the stock,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, it seems to be that the analysts see it (low
earnings) as longer lasting than the period being mentioned. The
new consensus is that there will be a 14 percent haircut on next
year's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In his conference call with analysts, Schultz said that any
shortfall experienced was ``relative only to the high expectations
we placed on ourselves'' and he advised them to ``expect
considerable improvement'' in the future. He stopped short of
forecasting fiscal 2000 performance, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of a small group of traditional bricks-and-mortar
retailers who understands the (Internet) as well as any CEO of a
bricks-and-mortar company and I am bringing all that experience,
all those skills and all those relationships to bear to make sure
we win and win big,'' Schultz told analysts.
</P>
<P>
   He said he delivered 80 consecutive months of positive financial
reports, and will lead Starbucks ``ahead of the curve'' onto the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks said sales at stores open at least a year rose 7
percent last month. Revenue rose 30 percent to $170 million from
$131 million.
</P>
<P>
   But earnings began to slip as the company was starting up the
new Internet ventures, including hiring to operate it, Schultz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks experienced substantial drops in its stock price
before. Its stock lost about half its value during a two-month
stretch last year, falling as low as 14.375 on concerns that its
earnings growth would slow as it plunged into international
expansion.

TEXAS COURT RULING COULD HAVE IMPACT ON TOBACCO CASE LAWYERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a decision that could renew debate over legal
fees in the tobacco lawsuit, the Texas Supreme Court ruled Thursday
that lawyers who commit ethical violations can be required to
forfeit all or part of their fees, even if their clients aren't
harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn, who has been investigating the
$3.3 billion awarded five private lawyers for helping Texas obtain
the $17.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry, said the
ruling was potentially relevant to the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has not decided what action, if any, he could take
against the attorneys, who were hired by his predecessor, Dan
Morales.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Silver, a University of Texas law professor who is a
consultant to the five lawyers, said he would be ``astounded'' if
the ruling ``has any implications for the tobacco case at all.'' He
said the ruling applies to cases with multiple plaintiffs, not to
suits brought by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruling, which was unanimous, stemmed from a
1989 explosion at a Phillips Petroleum plant in Pasadena, Texas,
that killed 23 workers and injured hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
   One suit resulted in a $190 million settlement for 126
plaintiffs and a contingent fee of more than $60 million for their
five attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   But 49 of those plaintiffs later sued their lawyers for alleged
professional misconduct. Among other things, the plaintiffs accused
the attorneys of failing to fully investigate individual claims and
of forcing their clients into accepting the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys _ F. Kenneth Bailey Jr., David Burrow, Wayne
Reaud, Walter Umphrey and John E. Williams Jr., who then practiced
in the same firm _ denied any misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Umphrey and Reaud of Beaumont and Williams of Houston, all of
whom later represented Texas in the landmark lawsuit against
tobacco companies, settled with the Phillips plaintiffs. But the
other two lawyers, who practice in Houston, appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court said an attorney's duty to his client is
violated by ``disloyalty, not any resulting harm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An agent's (lawyer's) compensation is not only for specific
results but also for loyalty,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court returned the dispute to a state district
court, where the Phillips plaintiffs will have an opportunity to
make their case.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who has called the legal fees in the tobacco case
``excessive,'' said the court decision means that ``lawyers can't
place their interest in receiving a fat fee above their duty to
their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was watched by lawyers on both sides of the tobacco
fee dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schenkkan, an Austin attorney, filed a brief in the case on
behalf of Texans for Reasonable Legal Fees, a coalition of civil
justice reform and other business groups formed to fight the
tobacco fees.
</P>
<P>
   Silver argued, in a separate brief that he said was unrelated to
the tobacco case, that fees forfeiture should require proof that
the clients were harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.3 billion in legal fees is to be paid by cigarette
makers, and the tobacco companies have said that a reduction in
legal fees wouldn't increase the size of the state's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the lawyers' critics have contended that the
attorneys put their own interests over those of the state by
negotiating a separate pile of money for their fees.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who succeeded Morales after the tobacco suit was
settled, hasn't ruled out the possibility of suing the lawyers for
breach of fiduciary responsibility to the state. But he insisted
Thursday that he hasn't decided his next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be one of the options, but I don't want it to
appear that I have reached a pre-ordained conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schenkkan said he was ``delighted'' with the Supreme Court
ruling. He said it ``highlights the importance of General Cornyn's
investigation into possible breaks of fiduciary duty by the
plaintiffs' lawyers hired by Dan Morales.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Cornyn accused Morales of falsifying
documents to help a sixth lawyer, Marc Murr of Houston, also obtain
hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees. Murr is a longtime
Morales friend.
</P>
<P>
   Murr withdrew his claim after Cornyn made his allegations, but
Murr's relationship to the tobacco case is being investigated by a
federal grand jury in Austin. Other lawyers say Murr did little
work on the tobacco suit.

 NEW YORK: to ABR's.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no logical reason for ABR's stock price to have traded
for more than $25.50 after June 7, yet it did, closing at $26 on
June 24, then inching steadily upward, to $29.6875 on Tuesday.
Traders speculated Thursday that those moves could have been caused
by short covering, in which investors who had sold ABR shares they
did not own, in expectation that the price would fall, were forced
to buy them back before the stock stopped trading altogether to
limit their losses.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-June, only 14,504 ABR shares had been sold short, but
that number might have grown this week as ABR's share price edged
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Wednesday, the last day of the second quarter and the
day that the Russell indexes were reconstituted, ABR shares surged.
In the first hour of trading, they moved as high as $35; they then
soared in the last half hour, briefly hitting $100 before closing
at $90.06.
</P>
<P>
   Between 3:30 and 4 p.m., only one block of 10,000 shares changed
hands on the Nasdaq market, accompanied by several blocks of 1,000
to 2,400 shares. But in late trading, at 4:24 p.m., two huge
blocks, of 52,200 and 35,000 shares each, changed hands.
Immediately after those trades, the share price dropped to $72,
from $90.06. Daily volume totaled 273,500 shares, more than half
the 488,000 shares still in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ABR was not the only stock affected by trading related to
changes in the Russell 2000 index. Shares of two other companies
that some traders thought might be included in the index _ Pitt-Des
Moines Inc. and Chaparral Resources Inc. _ also soared on
Wednesday, only to retrace their gains Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet investment bulletin boards on Yahoo, Silicon
Investor and the Motley Fool, correspondents speculated that day
traders had also climbed aboard the ABR bandwagon once they were
alerted to the sharp jump in the stock's price and volume. Some
people who portrayed themselves as day traders posted notes saying
they had bought shares in the $30s and sold them in the $80s or
$90s. Those reports could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   For each of those ABR trades, though, someone paid a hefty price
and someone else reaped the rewards. It is likely that the most
sophisticated market participants _ those who were able to discern
quickly that ABR shares would soon be worth no more than $25.50
each _ gathered some of the profits at the expense of
less-sophisticated investors.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also likely that someone who thought a buying strategy
was the height of sophistication _ enter the orders into a computer
and push a button _ was, in fact, the ultimate buffoon.

 MARKET PLACE: A FLUKE THAT MADE A STOCK MOVE LIKE BRAIN
WAVES  (jw) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somewhere a portfolio manager is cursing a blue
streak, and a few day traders are probably counting their profits.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable demonstration that financial markets can move
faster than brain waves, shares of a small company called ABR
Information Services more than tripled on Wednesday, rocketing as
high as $100 apiece on what appears to have been a colossal mistake
_ one borne out of the popularity of the investment strategy known
as indexing or simply a case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as news of the grand faux pas circulated on Wall
Street, the shares retraced their outsize gains, falling $62.06, to
$28. Yet even that price appears to be unreasonably high. In the
next three weeks, the few hundred thousand shares of ABR that are
still in circulation will be worth no more than $25.50 each in cash
because of the company's acquisition by the Ceridian Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday night, no one had come forward to acknowledge
having bought the stock by mistake, and Nasdaq market officials
were investigating the unusual trading.
</P>
<P>
   Traders, though, held forth with two theories of what happened.
The most plausible is that a fund manager near the close of trading
on Wednesday entered an order to buy all the stocks in the Russell
2000 index, including ABR, which provides payroll, benefits and
other human resource services to companies. Wednesday happened to
be the one day of the year that stocks are added to or deleted from
the index. Not realizing that ABR Information shares would soon
stop trading altogether because the company had been acquired, the
buyer started a chain reaction that forced up the price of the
relatively few shares that remained in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility also has to do with the annual changes in
the Russell 2000 index, but it suggests an even bigger blunder by
some investment manager. This theory is that a buyer entered the
wrong stock symbol on a trade ticket, substituting ABRX, the symbol
for ABR Information Systems, for ABGX, the symbol for Abgenix Inc.,
a biopharmaceutical company that is expected to be in the Russell
2000 index when the final list is issued next week. Stocks being
added to the index tend to get an initial boost as investors who
track the index buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ABR executives, who were preparing to ride off into the sunset
after selling the company for more than $730 million, are
scratching their heads over the stock's brief surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had done something to merit it, but we didn't,''
said James MacDougald, chairman of ABR. When Nasdaq market
surveillance officials called to ask what might be the cause of the
strange trading, he said he told them he ``didn't have any idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale began early last month, when Ceridian, the corporate
services company formerly known as Control Data, bought control of
ABR, based in Palm Harbor, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ceridian had offered to buy all of ABR's 28.2 million shares for
$25.50 each, and shareholders responded by offering up 98.3 percent
of the total, all but about 488,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Tender offers often do not attract all of a company's shares,
some of which languish in safe deposit boxes. Shareholders who
forget or choose not to participate in such an offer do not lose
out, however; they receive the right to the stated amount of cash
whenever their stock is turned in.
</P>
<P>
   The tender offer expired on June 7, about the time that the
Frank Russell Co., the Tacoma, Wash., financial data company, was
drawing up its preliminary list of companies to be added to and
deleted from its most popular indexes: the Russell 1000 index of
large-capitalization companies and the Russell 2000 small-cap
index. Those changes take place each year on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ABR was already part of the Russell 2000, accounting for less
than 0.1 percent of the index. Though the company had already
agreed to be acquired and most of its shares had been removed from
circulation, Russell's index experts knew that the deal would not
close until mid-July. Allowing for the slight possibility that the
acquisition would not be completed, Russell did not schedule ABR
for removal from the index on June 30. Instead, ABR is to be
removed when its shares stop trading. Ceridian, the acquiring
company, is part of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index of large
companies, as well as the Russell 1000.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three weeks of June, Russell released lists, and
several revisions, of the companies it did expect to add to its
indexes. Those included Abgenix, the stock with the ticker symbol
similar to ABR's.

2 STATES ACT TO LIMIT SPREAD OF VIDEO POKER MACHINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., S.C.)  (jw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two Southern states took steps Thursday to control the
spread of video poker machines, which have brought impulsive
gambling to the dark corners of thousands of gas stations,
convenience stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight Wednesday, Louisiana shut down 4,874 of its
15,000 poker machines, the result of a 1996 referendum allowing the
state's parishes to choose whether to keep them. It was believed to
be the nation's largest single shutdown of a form of legalized
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   And in South Carolina, which has 34,000 machines, more than any
other state, the state Legislature approved a plan Thursday that
would give voters a chance to prohibit the machines statewide in a
November referendum. If the voters allow it to continue, video
gambling would be more closely regulated than before, and the state
would collect a hefty tax on its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling opponents, who have long called the machines the
``crack cocaine'' of gambling because of their convenient,
addictive nature, celebrated the day as a rare retrenchment in the
industry's rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we knocked out more than 4,000 machines, and got the
opportunity to knock out 34,000 more,'' Tom Grey, director of the
National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, said Thursday. ``It
doesn't get much better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear just how much of a retreat had really taken
place. Many South Carolina officials expect the video gambling
industry _ which has become the state's most potent political force
_ to mount a multimillion-dollar political campaign to convince
voters it should stay in business. If gambling survives the Nov. 2
vote, it will be limited by the new regulations, but will begin
contributing an estimated $180 million a year in taxes to the state
budget, which will quickly make the state dependent on gambling's
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of organized gambling completed their purchase of
South Carolina,'' said state Rep. John Graham Altman, R-Charleston,
and an ardent opponent of gambling. ``We're no longer a sovereign
state; we're an occupied territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were particularly upset that the industry won its most
coveted prize: an increase in the maximum jackpot payable by the
machines to $500 per sitting from the current $120 a day. That
could attract large numbers of new gamblers to the machines, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry did have to make a few concessions. Minors will
no longer be able to play the machines, which will also be closed
on Sundays. A statewide computer system will monitor the integrity
of the machines, making certain that a 25 percent tax is collected,
and owners will be subject to new background checks. And no site
can have more than five machines, which will restrict the spread of
the casino-style parlors, often at the state's borders, that now
have scores of machines under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a decade, video gambling has transformed South
Carolina's landscape. It is now impossible to drive through any
rural or urban area without encountering signs for the machines,
which also lure players from neighboring states. Many gamblers are
from low-income families, and there have been numerous stories of
people who have lost their paychecks while mesmerized by the
electronic games of poker, blackjack and keno.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also reshaped the state's politics, with alliances
among proponents or opponents more powerful than party
affiliations. Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, who received half his $6
million campaign treasury from poker interests, sounded relieved
that the issue, which had riven the Legislature like no other in
recent memory, had finally been sent away to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I think everyone recognized this was a fair
plan,'' Hodges said early Thursday morning when the plan finally
passed the House after being rejected six times before.
</P>
<P>
   Several leaders of the state's gambling industry, which took in
$2.5 billion last year, also said they were satisfied with the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is Louisiana was somewhat more decisive. In 1996,
33 of the state's 64 parishes, as counties are known, voted to ban
video gambling machines in a statewide referendum.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The industry quickly went to court, but was unable to stop the
shutdown. Now the state and local governments will lose an
estimated $72 million in taxes, and some restaurants that have
relied on gambling for income have threatened to close.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the parishes that banned the machines are in rural
areas, but the ban includes several cities, among them Baton Rouge
and Lafayette. The machines will still be legal on the riverboat
casinos that are moored throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   And the gambling industry has not given up. It will be back in
court on Friday to assert that it was unfairly kept from getting
its message to voters in the 1996 election.

SEC WAS ALERTED ABOUT FRAUD SUSPECT IN '91, LAWYER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio _ Seven years ago, as federal securities regulators
here were working to close a fraud case against a seemingly
insignificant money manager, they received a warning from a local
lawyer: The manager, Martin Frankel, was lying to them.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being destitute, as Frankel was maintaining in his
settlement talks with the regulators, he secretly controlled
millions of dollars, the lawyer told them. Not only that, the
lawyer said, but Frankel had moved money into a Swiss bank account
and was using a series of aliases as he made expensive purchases
through dummy companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed this information on to the SEC,'' said the lawyer,
Terry Davis, who at the time was pursuing a civil suit against
Frankel on behalf of several investors. ``They would have had to
have known about that information, because we sent them papers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it appears the SEC did little to follow through on the
leads, according to people who have reviewed the record of the
case. Within months, the SEC settled its case against Frankel,
barred him from the securities industry and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that inaction looms large. Frankel is now at the center
of one of the largest insurance fraud investigations in history _ a
suspected scheme that relied on using Swiss bank accounts, dummy
corporations and aliases.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the SEC said it would not comment on what
information was available about Frankel in the early 1990s or on
whether it received documents and reports from the Toledo lawyers.
But agency officials defended their handling of the case, calling
it a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the maximum relief available,'' said Richard Walker,
director of enforcement at the SEC. In settling the case, Frankel
agreed to pay more than $200,000 and accepted a permanent bar from
the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel has been missing since May 5, when firefighters were
called to his mansion in Greenwich, Conn., and found smoldering
documents stuffed in fireplaces. Federal prosecutors say they think
he fled because a scheme to drain cash from insurance companies he
controlled was in danger of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still struggling to understand the full
boundaries of Frankel's business dealings, which spanned several
states and at least two continents. But it seems increasingly clear
that the current case has its roots in the financier's first brush
with federal law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all a continuation of a scheme that was begun back
then,'' one person who has reviewed Frankel's business records
said. ``It was all just a scam that went on too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who was born in Toledo and worked at Dominick &AMP;
Dominick, a small brokerage firm in the city, found a new partner
in 1987 and founded the Frankel Fund.
</P>
<P>
   It attracted some investors, but by 1988 it got into trouble,
prompting close scrutiny by the SEC into whether Frankel had
misrepresented his investing record and used client cash for
expenses like rent.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Frankel appeared to be cooperative in the agency's
inquiry, turning over records and voluntarily submitting to
questions. But when the SEC demanded his bank records and other
financial data, he balked. After investigators threatened to go to
court to force him to produce the records, Frankel settled the case
on what seemed to be harsh terms.
</P>
<P>
   But now it appears that Frankel may have gotten the better of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly filed SEC documents appear to show that Federal
regulators focused their inquiry largely on the Frankel Fund, which
was only one of Frankel's investment concerns. A larger pool of
money that Frankel used to start his new career in the insurance
industry was left unexamined, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Former associates say that much of the money Frankel raised in
Toledo came from a company called Creative Partners Inc., an
investment fund he started in 1989. The company was not registered
with federal or state securities regulators, but within a year,
brochures for the fund boasted that it had already ``outperformed
every publicly traded mutual fund in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with a group of 8 to 12 part-time salesmen, Frankel
built up a multimillion-dollar investment chest in less than three
years, former staff members say. Selling limited partnerships for a
minimum of $10,000, the fund lured more than 100 investors and grew
to as much as $13 million by 1991, according to William Stevenson,
who worked as a consultant at Creative Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Several investors say there were at least four funds with 35
people in each with a minimum $10,000 investment, and Walter
Rothschild, a former employee, said one man had invested $500,000
in the fund. Indeed, Frankel once boasted in a brochure that in
1991 he was managing more than $63 million in the fund. No public
records exist about the holdings of the Creative Partners Fund.
</P>
<P>
   There was several aspects of Creative Partners' operations that
could have attracted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Its assertions on performance appear to have been
exaggerated and the firm was not registered, as Federal securities
law requires.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Toledo lawyer, said he brought the existence of
Creative Partners to the attention of federal regulators in 1991.
No enforcement action was ever taken against the fund.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1991, just as the SEC case against him was
drawing to a close, Frankel turned to the insurance industry. With
several million dollars in seed money, he established the Thunor
Trust, the investment vehicle he used to begin his acquisition of
insurance companies through the purchase of a controlling stake in
Franklin American Life Insurance Co. of Nashville in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cash taken from the insurance companies may, in turn, have
helped Frankel cover his tracks in Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he closed the Franklin deal, he repaid the investors
in Creative Partners with handsome profits and then gave them back
their original investment. The fund, he said, was to be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and another lawyer at his firm, Shumaker Loop &AMP; Kendrick,
said that SEC officials made some inquiries, even after the
agency's case was resolved with Frankel in July 1992. But he said
the agency appeared to lose interest in a man who at the time was
considered a small-time money manager who had defrauded a handful
of investors in 1987 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Had the agency begun an aggressive investigation in the early
1990s, there was much it might have discovered about Frankel's new
business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, just a few months before the case involving the
Frankel Fund was finally concluded, he apparently formed a new
company called Bloomfield Investments Limited, using an alias.
</P>
<P>
   The incorporation papers list a 25-year-old trader named Eric
Jensen as its president and David Rosse _ a name often used by
Frankel as an alias _ as a director. The company had offices in
Chicago and Geneva, and assets of more than $8 million when it was
formed in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen could not be reached for comment, but his mother, who
lives in Iowa, said that he knew Frankel but had not been in touch
with him for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield Investments, which was incorporated in the British
Virgin Islands, is important to investigators because they say that
in March and April, Frankel wired about $74 million of insurance
money to Bloomfield through the Stamford, Conn., branch of the
Union Bank of Switzerland, and the Banque SCS Alliance in
Switzerland.

   Does it Melt in Your Heart? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of intensive promotional marketing that has become
de rigeur for animated films and children's TV shows: T-shirts,
plush toys, hats, a fan club.
</P>
<P>
   But for a candy commercial?
</P>
<P>
   The people at Mars say M&AMP;M's, the colorful candy-coated
chocolate drops that ``melt in your mouth, not in your hand,'' and
the wisecracking animated versions that appear in the company's
commercials, have long had a devoted following of fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have shrines to M&AMP;M's, rooms full of M&AMP;M's
items,'' said Pat D'Amato, public relations manager for the
company's M&AMP;M/Mars division. ``We wanted to provide them with
interesting contests, offers and premiums which no one else has.''
</P>
<P>
   So late last year the company's marketers dreamed up the M&AMP;M's
Brand Inner Circle, a ``loyalty program'' now being promoted in
newspaper inserts. For $19.95, members get a ``limited edition''
candy dispenser, shaped like two M&AMP;M's characters, and a quarterly
magazine, Inside the Shell, ``written'' by the characters, with
M&AMP;M's recipes and offers for everything from jackets to golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. D'Amato wouldn't say how many people have signed up,
she said the program was achieving its marketing goal. ``We want
these loyalists to be able to continue to be brand advocates,'' she
said. And Mars is pretty sure nobody will fill their candy
dispensers with Reese's Pieces.

<P>
   Maybe Lewis Carroll's Red Queen was right: Sometimes it really
does take all the running you can do to keep in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   Maura J. Abeln, general counsel for Owens Corning _ the
front-and-center defendant in asbestos litigation _ is finding that
out the hard way. For more than a year, she has fought off every
potentially lethal attack on the settlement process she worked out
so painstakingly with some 80 plaintiff's law firms ready to
litigate more than 200,000 asbestos claims.
</P>
<P>
   She waited, breath held, until the Supreme Court overturned a
class-action suit against Owens-Corning's Fiberboard subsidiary two
weeks ago, enabling Owens Corning to add Fiberboard's cases to its
settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's back into the breach again. Ms. Abeln spent much of
Thursday testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, which is
considering legislation that could steer plaintiffs back into the
courts . She seamlessly melded compassion with practicality, in
hopes that her settlements will be grandfathered out of any law.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is to stay out of the fray and continue with our
own program,'' Ms. Abeln said. ``I've got to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   She is protecting the Owens Corning National Settlement Program,
a method for settling asbestos claims on the basis of how long
claimants were exposed to an Owens Corning product, and how severe
their disease has become. She has traveled the country, meeting
with plaintiff's lawyers and hammering away at their distrust.
</P>
<P>
   She used humor _ lawyers found stuffed pink panthers, Owens
Corning's consumer logo, in their mailboxes, and one received a
gift-wrapped peace pipe. She used facts _ she showed them Owens
Corning's books, trotted out its executives to answer questions and
laid out what the company could pay and how quickly it could pay
it.
</P>
<P>
   And, against all odds, she won the enemy over. ``I've had as
many feuds with industry lawyers as anybody, and Maura is
remarkable,'' said Fred M. Baron, of Baron &AMP; Budd in Dallas.
``She's like a rodeo cowboy, she gets on that horse and stays with
it, no matter how much it bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the cowboy is not the first metaphor brought to mind
by Ms. Abeln _who is intense rather than devil-may-care. A
43-year-old with a ready smile, she has a way of making anyone
believe she is listening, absorbing and processing their every
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Maura's, and it's hard for a plaintiff's
attorney to say that about a corporate attorney,'' said John D.
Cooney, a partner at Cooney &AMP; Conway. ``She is blunt,
straightforward and invites you to believe her.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, when Ms. Abeln claims to understand the plaintiff's
point of view, she means it. Her father, a foreman in a copper
tubing plant in Reading, Pa., died of emphysema in 1986. ``He'd
come home with copper dust on his shoes, and that might have been
the cause,'' Ms. Abeln said. ``I see things from the plaintiff's
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abeln recalls her childhood as short on cash for luxuries _
she sold shoes and doughnuts in high school to help raise money for
college expenses _ but long on the belief in self-betterment. Her
mother did not go to college until she was 47, then worked in
various social work jobs until she died at 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was quite the feminist, giving me copies of Ms. magazine
when I was just 15,'' Ms. Abeln said. She said her mother also
encouraged her to go to Vassar, ``because she wanted me in an
environment that showed what women could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abeln caught on quickly. She had honor-society grades and
was involved in the college newspaper and in sports like field
hockey and softball. She won a Rhodes scholarship in 1976, the
first year that women were accepted. She studied economics at
Oxford, married and divorced, then accepted a full scholarship to
study law at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Miami seemed a permanent home. She married one of
her law professors, had two children, and later built a thriving
banking law practice as a partner for Baker &AMP; McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, though, woes in the banking market left her practice in
turmoil _ just as her mother died of breast cancer and her marriage
disintegrated, leaving her to raise her small children alone.
</P>
<P>
   When General Electric Co.'s plastics division in Pittsfield,
Mass., invited her to be its general counsel, she jumped. ``I
needed to do something different, and Pittsfield seemed a nice town
that was closer to my brother in Allentown, Pa.,'' she recalled.
Moreover, she was getting married again, to someone willing to stay
home with her children, and she would be the youngest general
counsel of any GE division. She was sold.
</P>
<P>
   She got her first taste of personal injury claims when she
handled GE's silicon breast implant litigation. But Benjamin W.
Heineman Jr., GE's general counsel, remembers her more for her
ability to work with people. ``She built one of our finest global
legal staffs,'' he recalled. ``She knows how to inspire loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   She also knows how to impress the brass. Glen H. Hiner was
running GE Plastics when Ms. Abeln joined. He left six months later
to become Owens Corning's chief executive, but Ms. Abeln had
already made a lasting impression. When he realized that Owens
Corning's asbestos situation had gotten out of hand, he came
calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd polarized the plaintiffs bar into a solid position
against us,'' he recalled. ``I knew Maura was smart and had a good
business sense. But I also knew she could rally people to her
side.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Abeln came on board in February 1998, jury verdicts
were turning against the company, just as its insurance money for
asbestos claims was running out. ``I have the most important job in
this company after Glen's,'' she said. ``If we kept trying to delay
cases and deferring payments, we could not survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Her future? Divorced again, she is getting married next June, to
Steven Smith, a software consultant. And, ``I most certainly want
to be a CEO some day,'' she said. Hiner's take on that? ``I
wouldn't discount the possibility.''

HMO'S PLAN TO RAISE PREMIUMS OR DROP BENEFITS FOR MEDICARE
SUBSCRIBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs lede to clarify ambiguity; grafs 3-5 to add details of
Clinton's plan and add name of trade association; 9th graf to
delete redundancy)  (rm) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health maintenance organizations will increase
Medicare premiums or cut benefits for most of their 6 million
elderly subscribers next year because they consider federal
payments to HMOs inadequate, a trade association for the managed
care industry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the association said, at least 250,000 Medicare
beneficiaries will be forced out of HMOs because their plans are
curtailing service areas or dropping out of Medicare. Some of these
beneficiaries may find other HMOs, as the health plans continue to
enroll new members, but many people will find their old doctors are
not members of their new health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions seem to undercut a key part of President Clinton's
latest Medicare proposal, which depends on competition among HMOs
to make the program more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Further, while Clinton's plan calls for Medicare to cover
prescription drugs starting in 2002, many health maintenance
organizations that already provide such coverage said they intended
to cut back drug benefits for Medicare patients next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the deadline for HMOs to tell the federal
government if they plan to participate in Medicare next year and,
if so, what their premium and benefit packages would be.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs surveyed by the trade group, the American Association of
Health Plans, reported that they were increasing premiums for 1.5
million Medicare beneficiaries next year. Richard I. Smith, vice
president of the association, said that premiums would increase by
more than $20 a month for 930,000 beneficiaries, including 400,000
people who will see increases of $40 or more.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, federal auditors have repeatedly
asserted that Medicare was overpaying HMOs, which now care for
about 16 percent of the program's 39 million beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   However, Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association
of Health Plans, said: ``Overpaid plans don't leave the program.
Overpaid plans don't cut benefits to beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Federal
Health Care Financing Administration, said, ``We're disappointed
that HMOs are making decisions that will force some Medicare
beneficiaries to change their health coverage and at the same time
scaring them about their Medicare benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs pulled out of more than 300 counties in 22 states early
this year. The changes directly affected more than 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   With next year's withdrawals, Ms. Ignagni said, HMOs will have
dropped more than 650,000 people _ about one of every 10 Medicare
beneficiaries in such plans.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials insist that health plans are simply making
business decisions. Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the
Medicare agency, told Congress last month that ``a certain amount
of market volatility must be expected when relying on the private
sector to serve beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeParle said HMOs that remain in Medicare ``will be paid
more in 2000 than in 1999 _ about 5 percent, on average,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have found that Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs are,
on the average, healthier than those in the original
fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs receive a fixed amount of federal money for each Medicare
beneficiary, regardless of what the person's care costs. Consumer
advocates say some HMOs try to fatten their profits by selectively
recruiting healthy beneficiaries and shunning sicker patients.
Health plans deny that they engage in this practice.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries dropped from an HMO can return to the
original fee-for-service Medicare program or enroll in another
managed care plan if one is available where they live. But Medicare
beneficiaries say the experience of being dumped by an HMO is
traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., who is chairman of the Health
Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, said the Medicare HMO
program was facing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Congress takes action to correct this problem, the
consequences will be devastating for Medicare beneficiaries,
especially low-income seniors,'' Bilirakis said. ``Many will lose
the option of participating in a Medicare managed care plan
altogether. Others will face increased out-of-pocket costs or a
reduction in benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   About 55 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs have incomes
less than $25,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   HIP Health Plans is pulling out of the Medicare program in the
Tampa, Fla., area represented by Bilirakis.
</P>
<P>
   Some Medicare beneficiaries join HMOs even as others leave.
Government data show a small net increase in the number of people
in Medicare HMOs this year, but the industry says enrollment is
growing much more slowly than in the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has sharply reduced its
projections of Medicare HMO enrollment. Elderly people have become
acutely aware that HMOs can drop out of the Medicare market, and
that is ``likely to reduce the willingness of some Medicare
beneficiaries to enroll in plans in the next few years,'' the
budget office said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Congressional Budget Office said that
unanticipated cutbacks in Medicare payments to many HMOs ``will
impede their ability to offer the additional benefits, such as
prescription drugs, that were expected to encourage more people to
enroll.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American Association of Health Plans hired the firm of Peter
D. Hart Research to conduct the survey. It received responses from
23 HMOs serving 4 million beneficiaries, or two-thirds of those in
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare HMOs must cover at least the services offered in the
fee-for-service program and usually offer additional benefits. The
secretary of health and human services can approve or reject the
mix of premiums and benefits devised by a private health plan. But
if she disapproves, the HMO does not have to participate in
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries in health plans and in the traditional Medicare
program normally pay a monthly premium of $45.50, which is deducted
from their Social Security checks. HMOs may charge additional
premiums for items not covered by the standard Medicare program,
like prescription drugs, eyeglasses, hearing aids and preventive
care.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs are not
paying any extra premiums this year. For more than half of the
people who do pay extra premiums, the amount is less than $40 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the survey indicated that most Medicare HMOs were
increasing co-payments for prescription drugs or reducing the
amount of drugs for which they would pay.

<P>
   Air travel from Britain to many parts of the world will be
virtually impossible over the new year because of fears about the
millennium bug, it was claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   British airline pilots are threatening to refuse to fly to most
of eastern Europe and Asia, including the Indian subcontinent and
China. Insiders describe Africa as a ``no-go'' area, and Central
and South America are causing anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by the British Airline Pilots' Association
(BALPA) has found serious shortcomings in most countries'
preparations, especially those in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a rapid acceleration in the drive to make air
traffic control systems ``millennium compliant,'' flights from
British airports will be severely restricted from Dec. 31 to Jan.
3, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   BALPA said it would be safe to go to northern and western
Europe, and the United States. However, some U.S. authorities have
questioned the readiness of airports dealing with internal flights.
</P>
<P>
   It is understood that pilots will refuse to fly over countries
where they believe little or no attempt has been made to cope with
the potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   A list of airports and regions thought to be unsafe will be
published in the next few weeks by the pilots' union with the help
of the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Associations.
</P>
<P>
   A BALPA source said: ``People will not have to worry about
travelling from Britain to a country over the millennium...we will
not fly to areas we regard as unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Darke, general secretary of BALPA, and the Transport
and General Workers' Union will fully back those refusing to fly on
safety grounds over the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for intercontinental flights from Britain could be low
over the four-day period as many holidaymakers will leave earlier
in the week and stay away until after the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The International Air Transport Association is also running an
inquiry, to be published in the summer. A spokesman at British
Airways, which supplied the chairman for the inquiry, said it would
not know which were safe routes until the report was finished. &QL;

   All at once it got very serious. Ken Newport looked up from the
600-page document he had printed from the Internet. He had been
ploughing through its interminable ramblings about horsemen and
brides, scrolls and seals, beasts and Babylon, demon armies and
divine punishments. But then something clicked.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant, he realized with a sudden chill, was blazing gun
battles, burning buildings and more dead children.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of Waco were looking for a repeat of the awful
inferno in which some 80 people died in the siege of their
headquarters in Texas six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, did an unknown academic from Liverpool like
him go about contacting the FBI? It had all begun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newport is a theologian who, for the past two years, has
been gathering material for an academic volume on how groups
throughout history have interpreted Revelation, the final book of
the Bible which is consumed with surreal visions about the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, he discovered, those who became
obsessed with the Apocalypse became filled with the conviction that
it was a timetable of real events and that the end was about to
come in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baptist, Benjamin Keach, thought it would
happen in 1689. One of the founders of Methodism, Charles Wesley,
thought Doomsday would be 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most famously, the American preacher William Miller
gathered his followers around him on Oct. 22, 1844, all having sold
their worldly possessions, quit jobs and moved to upstate New York,
which was where Christ was due to return.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Branch Davidian cult at Waco, under their
wild and charismatic leader David Koresh, were seized with the same
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more. From time to time there appeared a
group that was not simply content to wait for Armageddon. They saw
it as their duty to provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in gathering material on the history of the Branch
Davidian cult that he came across evidence that Koresh's
successors, who style themselves the Students of the Seven Seals,
are engaged upon a process whose logic seems to be taking them
remorselessly to the creation of another Waco _ sometime between
now and Friday Aug. 6, when they are convinced that the world will
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his neat modern study at Liverpool Hope University
College, amid racks of box files and a world away from the madness
of Waco, Dr. Newport began to correspond _ by letter and e-mail _
with the new generation of Branch Davidians, who have fled Texas
and are now dispersed throughout the U.S. and UK.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted them through their websites and by writing to the
seven members who are in American jails, serving a total of 238
years between them. Slowly he began to piece together the story
which has so unnerved him. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   The first piece in the jigsaw went back to Oct. 23, 1844 _ the
day after the world didn't end as William Miller had predicted. It
was then that his followers began the long process of coming to
terms with what they dubbed The Great Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several new groups which sprang from the disillusioned
Millerites was the Seventh Day Adventists, whose recruits included
one John Kellogg, who developed for his brethren a special
vegetarian breakfast food called corn flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a movement doomed to schism. A washing machine
salesman called Victor Houteff led a breakaway called the Davidian
Seventh Day Adventists. And after Victor's wife and successor
Florence gathered the movement's 940 members together for another
unsuccessful Doomsday on April 22, 1959, it split again, with Ben
Roden and his wife Lois forming the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the succession should have passed to their son
George. But by then David Koresh was on the scene and things began
to turn from the merely eccentric to the downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the leadership issue, Ken Newport discovered, George
Roden dug up the remains of an 85-year-old Davidian who had died
some 20 years earlier, and challenged Koresh to a Resurrection
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   A gun battle ensued and, though the police arrested everyone, no
one was convicted _ though George was given six months for contempt
of court for threatening the judge with plagues and herpes.
</P>
<P>
   George was later sent to an asylum after drawing a third
Davidian into a row over whether George or Koresh had been chosen
by God to be the seventh and final angel named in the Bible; when
the third man insisted it was neither of them but him, George
chopped him up with an axe.
</P>
<P>
   But it was none of this which prompted the Davidians' letters
and e-mails to Ken Newport suddenly to halt. Nor was it his
questions about the awful events at Waco, at which the FBI
acquitted themselves so poorly. &QL;

<P>
   The cult members began to get wary when Dr. Newport started to
ask about their belief that Koresh is due to return from the dead
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Their massive documents on the Web revealed that a code-breaking
of a combination of dates in Revelation and the prophetic book of
Daniel suggested that Koresh would return on Aug. 6, at the head of
200 million horsemen (see Rev. 9:16) to cleanse the earth and
slaughter the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Those of Koresh's followers who were not consumed in the flames
of Waco were to prepare for the event under the guidance of a
Davidian by the code name of The Chosen Vessel.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Ken Newport began to find out who this might be that
all communication was ended with a final e-mail: ``We perceive now
that you are not a seeker after the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Newport continued to comb through what had already been
made available to him. The conclusions he was forced to make
disturbed him.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors to join Koresh's divine army they, too, would
have to be dead before Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no reference to self-sacrifice in any of the
documentation. Rather there was the suggestion that the remnant,
under the direction of The Chosen Vessel, would have to be killed
by the same forces who killed Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic is clear,'' says Dr. Newport. ``It all makes perfect
sense if you take on board the hypotheses they start with. It is
entirely possible that they are provoking some horrendous
confrontation with the U.S. authorities.'' His estimate is that
around 40 to 50 individuals might be involved in such an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the world, security services have decided they have to
take this kind of thing seriously. The propensity of cults to turn
fantasy into grim reality is evident from a mere recital of names
like Jonestown, the Solar Temple, Heaven's Gate, Aum Shinri Kyo.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Israel recently expelled 14 members of a
Denver-based Doomsday sect called Concerned Christians, accusing
them of plans to attack the al-Aqsa mosque in an attempt to spark
off the apocalyptic war of Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   In the UK, the anti-terrorism squad is alive to fears that a
fanatical U.S. group has targeted the Millennium Dome for attack.

   ``Had they taken the trouble to find out anything about what was
going on in the heads of those in the Waco compound, they might

Instead, their actions seemed calculated to produce the worst
possible outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonization of the U.S. government which is found
ubiquitously in Seventh Day Adventist sources predisposed members
of the Branch-Davidian movement (nearly all of whom, including
Koresh himself, were drawn from the Adventist church) to view the
siege of their headquarters by the FBI as of apocalyptic
significance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorities added to such a perception by shining
unceasing lights into the compound, playing demonically loud music
alternately punctuated, one Waco survivor claimed, with the sound
of rabbits being slaughtered and of Tibetan monks chanting.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into the weird end-of-the-world scenario of those
final chapters of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dealing with a group which believed that, just
before the end of the world, the great Satanic power would seek to
destroy the last faithful remnant of God's people,'' says Dr.
Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder that, with all that going on outside their Mount

dawn had broken,'' he says. &QL;

LITTLE-KNOWN PANEL SPELLS HEADACHES FOR A SAN DIEGO MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It is made up of 19 ordinary citizens, most of them
retirees, and has a paid staff of one. It operates in solemn
secrecy and has sweeping authority to investigate public agencies
and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Its roots reach back to the Norman Conquest. And even if most
Californians have no idea what it does, it set the political
establishment of the nation's sixth-largest city squarely on its
ear last week.
</P>
<P>
   The headline here was bold and grim _ ``Jury Charges Golding
With Misconduct'' _ and on the surface the news for Mayor Susan
Golding could hardly have been worse. The San Diego County grand
jury had charged her with ``willful misconduct'' in her campaign to
build a new baseball stadium downtown, touching off a
quasi-criminal process that could lead to a trial and, in the worst
case, her removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The reality was considerably more complex. The grand jury that
leveled the accusation against Golding was not a prosecutorial
panel of the sort that routinely hands up criminal indictments but
instead a civil grand jury, a little-understood California
institution that functions more like a citizens' watchdog group,
albeit one with subpoena power. And this grand jury's accusation
against the mayor, the first such charge against a San Diego
official in this century, has brought harsh new scrutiny to a
127-year-old system whose critics say is past its time.
</P>
<P>
   Every county in California has such a grand jury, a panel of 19
volunteers who apply for the job, sit for a year and are selected,
in part at random, by judges. These juries are charged, among other
things, with issuing reports on fraud, waste or mismanagement by
public officials or institutions like hospitals and jails, while in
most cases separate grand juries are impaneled as needed to hear
criminal cases. The civil grand jurors have virtually no permanent
staff and are paid nothing but minimal expenses, and their work is
typically noted and then filed away with little fuss or fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they get a day's worth of press and then they sit
there,'' said John K. Van de Kamp, former Los Angeles County
district attorney and state Attorney General. ``But once in a
while, you'll hear of a grand jury that's really at odds with
county administrators and gets into conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a thousand years, grand juries and their predecessors
have served an important role as community watchdogs. But grand
juries in fewer than half the states retain any formal vestige of
that role, and ``no other state has the same emphasis'' as
California, said Sara Sun Beale, a professor at Duke University Law
School who is a national authority on grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   This San Diego County grand jury, whose yearlong term expires
this week, has ruffled feathers and rankled a wide range of local
officialdom, faulting everything from the county jail's medical
treatment of inmates to the manners of the district attorney's
office and issuing four reports alone harshly critical of the
city's plan to build a new ballpark for the Padres, which was
approved by nearly 60 percent of voters in a referendum last fall.
The jury's work reflects the skepticism of its foreman, a
71-year-old retired Army intelligence officer named Peter DiRenza.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can tell you is that we were impaneled into
this grand jury to do a job, and that is oversee the county of San
Diego,'' DiRenza said. ``And that's what we've tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To many public officials here, DiRenza and his colleagues amount
to a runaway train, armed with a mantle of judicial solemnity they
do not deserve. The grand jury issued its charge, known formally as
an ``accusation,'' against the mayor without even consulting the
district attorney, Paul Pfingst, who is required by law to review
it to determine whether it merits the equivalent of a trial that
could bring her removal. Alternatively, Pfingst may ask a judge to
dismiss the case if the evidence _ so far still secret _ does not
support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that what this grand jury has accused the
mayor of are illegal acts,'' said the independently elected city
attorney, Casey Gwinn. ``They're not even improper. If a grand jury
could get an elected official removed for this, it would be
unbelievable. They're accusing her of acting like a mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the jury's accusations against the Republican mayor do
seem tenuous. In one count, it faults her for failing to fill
vacancies on a citizens' watchdog commission that oversaw public
utilities, arguing that by doing so she effectively killed the
panel and let money earmarked for burying overhead power lines be
diverted to other purposes. The city attorney counters by saying
the commission was essentially defunct in any case, its role
overtaken by the statewide deregulation of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury's other charge is that Ms. Golding agreed to
support a $4 million appropriation for the San Diego County
Hotel-Motel Association's visitor marketing program in exchange for
its backing of her proposal to build the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   But the city gives no money directly to the association, only to
the Convention and Visitors Bureau, which handles the marketing
efforts, and the mayor can make such decisions only with the
support of the City Council. As it happens, officials say, Ms.
Golding was absent on the day the Council approved the
appropriation and did not even cast a vote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the jury has not yet publicly spelled out precisely what
it found so objectionable about the mayor's actions, the
implication is that it was offended by what it considered unseemly
political horse trading.
</P>
<P>
   Details in support of its charges are not to be made public
until next week, about the time Ms. Golding faces the equivalent of
an arraignment. But the foreman, DiRenza, does say that the inquiry
began with a tip last fall, and rejects any suggestion that he or
his colleagues are engaging in some sort of vendetta against the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   DiRenza also says the grand jury acted without consulting the
district attorney because it had taken the matter to the district
attorney's office for an initial review and investigators there had
said there was nothing they could do. ``Being an investigator for
30 years,'' he said of his Army intelligence career, ``I just knew
there was something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, Pfingst, declined to detail any such
initial consultations, saying they would be a subject of his
official review. But he said he was disappointed that the grand
jury ``clearly did make a deliberate decision not to consult with
our office'' about the formal accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said a state appeals court decision in a similar
case strongly suggested that Ms. Golding might be immune from any
such grand jury action resulting from the performance of her
official duties.
</P>
<P>
   In that 1996 decision, the appeals court threw out a grand jury
accusation against two members of the Orange County Board of
Supervisors stemming from that county's municipal bankruptcy. The
court ruled that just as public officials were immune from lawsuits
over their official actions, so they could not face a grand jury
accusation for official acts or omissions that were not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real issue here as to whether the mayor is simply
immune,'' Pfingst said.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinn, the city attorney, also questions whether the grand jury
even has jurisdiction in such matters in a city like San Diego,
whose charter lays out its own system of removing the mayor for
official misconduct, through a recall election. He says the civil
grand jury, a Gilded Age reform institution intended to check
special interests' power over local government, may well have
outlived its function in an era of open-meeting laws, public
disclosure and media scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Van Nuis, a paralegal who served on last year's civil
grand jury in San Diego, has since decided that the institution
should probably be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``About halfway through the term, it started to occur to me that
you pick your own research topics, so they tend to be issues that
are of concern to you personally and not necessarily the
community,'' she said. ``Most of the grand jurors already had ideas
of what they wanted to write, which is sort of the problem. It
takes on a patina of respectability that I don't think is
warranted. I wrote three reports, and if they'd never been written
the republic would still be standing. These are basically opinion
pieces from people who think their opinion really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But that, Gwinn said, is not how the public reads the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my dealings with people since this broke,'' he said, ``the
basic reaction is, `This is the grand jury, she must be guilty, she
must have done something wrong.' And every person I've talked to
among the general public does not focus on the specifics.''

   All at once it got very serious. Ken Newport looked up from the
600-page document he had printed from the Internet. He had been
ploughing through its interminable ramblings about horsemen and
brides, scrolls and seals, beasts and Babylon, demon armies and
divine punishments. But then something clicked.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant, he realized with a sudden chill, was blazing gun
battles, burning buildings and more dead children.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of Waco were looking for a repeat of the awful
inferno in which some 80 people died in the siege of their
headquarters in Texas six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, did an unknown academic from Liverpool like
him go about contacting the FBI? It had all begun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newport is a theologian who, for the past two years, has
been gathering material for an academic volume on how groups
throughout history have interpreted Revelation, the final book of
the Bible which is consumed with surreal visions about the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, he discovered, those who became
obsessed with the Apocalypse became filled with the conviction that
it was a timetable of real events and that the end was about to
come in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baptist, Benjamin Keach, thought it would
happen in 1689. One of the founders of Methodism, Charles Wesley,
thought Doomsday would be 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most famously, the American preacher William Miller
gathered his followers around him on Oct. 22, 1844, all having sold
their worldly possessions, quit jobs and moved to upstate New York,
which was where Christ was due to return.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Branch Davidian cult at Waco, under their
wild and charismatic leader David Koresh, were seized with the same
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more. From time to time there appeared a
group that was not simply content to wait for Armageddon. They saw
it as their duty to provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in gathering material on the history of the Branch
Davidian cult that he came across evidence that Koresh's
successors, who style themselves the Students of the Seven Seals,
are engaged upon a process whose logic seems to be taking them
remorselessly to the creation of another Waco _ sometime between
now and Friday Aug. 6, when they are convinced that the world will
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his neat modern study at Liverpool Hope University
College, amid racks of box files and a world away from the madness
of Waco, Dr. Newport began to correspond _ by letter and e-mail _
with the new generation of Branch Davidians, who have fled Texas
and are now dispersed throughout the U.S. and UK.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted them through their websites and by writing to the
seven members who are in American jails, serving a total of 238
years between them. Slowly he began to piece together the story
which has so unnerved him. &QL;

alternately punctuated, one Waco survivor claimed, with the sound
of rabbits being slaughtered and of Tibetan monks chanting.

   ``No wonder that, with all that going on outside their Mount
Carmel compound, Koresh's people thought that the eschatological
dawn had broken,'' he says. &QL;

   NEVE DEKALIM, Gaza Strip _ Slapping mortar onto the wall of a
new house in this Jewish settlement studded with stucco homes and
palm trees, Rifat Jarjua, a Palestinian construction worker,
acknowledged the other day that he was in a hopeless bind.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, a Palestinian, building houses for Israelis on
land he considers to have been taken from his people. On the other
hand, he said, he had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person has to earn his daily bread,'' said Jarjua, 28, who
lives in neighboring Khan Yunis and has two children. ``We have no
other job opportunities, so we're forced to work here. If the
Palestinian Authority wants us to stop working in settlements, it
should give us other jobs. We're trapped between the fire and
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarjua is one of an estimated 11,000 Palestinians who work in
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, building the
very communities that Palestinian leaders have called a cancer
strangling prospects for an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Palestinian Authority has mounted a
campaign to stop the laborers from working at the settlements,
trying to root out a phenomenon that has become entrenched over
more than 30 years, strengthened by Israeli border restrictions
that prevent many workers from reaching jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott campaign was prompted, Palestinian officials say, by
a sharp increase in Israeli settlement activity in recent months
that has included expansion of existing settlements and erection of
more than a dozen new outposts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unprecedented ferocity of the settlement onslaught obliges
all of us to stop all forms of work in the settlements,'' the
Palestinian cabinet said in a statement. ``The leadership appeals
to everyone to halt work at the settlements, because settlement is
a danger that threatens Palestinian national existence.''
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper announcements, readers have been urged to submit
names of Palestinian building contractors carrying out work in
settlements, and the Palestinian Contractors Union urged its
members to stop working ``on these projects that steal land and
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In the largely Palestinian-governed Gaza Strip, where access to
Jewish settlement enclaves can be more easily controlled,
Palestinian police officers have seized identity cards from
laborers heading for settlements and warned them to stop working
there. Laborers have also been visited in their communities and
cautioned not to show up for work.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip say that in telephone
conversations with workers who are now staying away, they have been
told about stronger pressure: tire slashings, beatings, detentions
and violent questioning by the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has succeeded in deterring workers from reaching
three small Gaza Strip settlements surrounded by Palestinian-ruled
territory: Netzarim, Morag and Kfar Darom. The absent Palestinians
have been replaced by workers from Romania and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned the page and moved on,'' said Shlomo Kostiner, a
settler from Netzarim and a spokesman for the local settlement
council. ``This is only going to hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   But enforcement of the boycott has been less effective at Neve
Dekalim and the rest of the Katif bloc of settlements, the largest
Israeli enclave in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the boycott has been virtually unenforceable in
the West Bank, where there are only limited areas of Palestinian
control and access to the settlements cannot be blocked by the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the boycott campaign is moral persuasion, asserted
Khalid El-Khatib, secretary of the National Committee to Defend the
Land and Confront Settlement, an umbrella organization of several
political groups.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Gaza, Khatib said that the argument made to
the laborers is that Palestinian work in settlements is a
self-defeating absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand a halt to settlements,'' he said. ``The European
Union and Israeli peace groups say they will boycott goods
manufactured in settlements. The U.S. government calls them
obstacles to peace, and yet our workers and contractors are working
there, cooperating with the expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not putting food on the table, because in our
society relatives help each other in hard times, preventing
hunger,'' Khatib continued. ``The problem is that land is being
stolen daily. Do you want your land or a piece of blood-soaked
daily bread? You can't make peace without land.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatib said efforts are under way to create other jobs in
Palestinian-governed areas, particularly in the private sector,
where priority would be given to workers who have quit their jobs
at settlements. A boycott of work at the settlements would create
an urgent unemployment problem that would compel the Palestinian
Authority to find immediate solutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatib's vision remains a distant prospect. The struggling
Palestinian economy cannot provide enough jobs, and thousands of
laborers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip continue to stream daily
to work in settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Muhammad, 42, a father of 12 who works in Neve Dekalim,
scoffed at the Palestinian Authority's boycott appeal. There are
not enough construction jobs in his town, Khan Yunis, he said, and
the pay for such work is significantly lower than the $25 a day
that workers can earn at the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't tell us not to work here without giving us other
jobs first,'' he said. ``If people are forced to sit at home, there
will be trouble in Khan Yunis _ they'll go out and throw stones.
Forget politics. People want to work.''

ALBOM A PLUM OF A DIVERSE WRITER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mitch Albom, Detroit Free Press columnist
extraordinaire for the past 14 years and reigning media megastar,
has a DiMaggio-esque streak going that may never be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, it has nothing to do with National Sportswriter of
the Year Awards (which is up to a dozen), the constant fear of
being squished by Bill Conlon on ESPN's ``Sports Reporters,''
showing up to his weekly radio show on WJR-AM in Detroit (or his
weekend show for ESPN Radio that can be heard on KVEN-AM 1450 in
Ventura County) or traffic at his Web site (www.albom.com).
</P>
<P>
   More than a year and a half since its release _ for the past 88
weeks _ Albom's book called ``Tuesday's With Morrie'' (Doubleday;
$19.95) has not only stayed on the New York Times Bestseller List
for nonfiction, but consistently remains in the top five, hitting
No. 1 in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it was the top-selling nonfiction book in America.
It's been printed in 22 languages and also is a bestseller in
Japan, Australia, Brazil and England, where Albom has been
predisposed the past two weeks covering Wimbledon. Oprah Winfrey,
who bought the movie rights and produced the flick, has a release
date set for four months from now.
</P>
<P>
   A sports book? Something about Maury Wills? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The subtitle _ ``An old man, a young man, and life's greatest
lesson'' _ is much too simple an explanation about what's really
packed into the 192 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson? Hey, we can't give away the ending. If you haven't
picked it up by now and spent the couple hours or so it takes to
read it, do yourself a favor and flip the pages this summer.
</P>
<P>
   As for other hard- and soft-back summer reading _ more
specifically with sports as the focal point _ also consider these
while the sun is a-blazin':
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf,'' by Bill Murray with
George Peper (Doubleday; $19.95, 211 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Why it smokes: We finally get a look into Murray's life in golf
and how much his legendary role of Carl Spackler in the movie
``Caddyshack'' is autobiographical. Hearing Murray's voice as you
read the words makes it work. Plus the photos of him and anecdotes
about him others offer that are inserted through the title are
heartwarming.
</P>
<P>
   Why it chokes: Consult a physician before reading. It's
``Chicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul'' meets Hunter S. Thompson, a
movie role Murray actually played from a script he actually wrote
that didn't actually go anywhere. Kind of like the book. Great
idea, but when someone this schizophrenic is asked to put his
thoughts together.... At least he's got the acting career going for
him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``Women's Soccer: The Game and the World Cup,'' edited by
Jim Trecker and Charles Miers (Universe Publishing; $20, 96 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Why it smokes: Murray's book title might seem better suited for
this one, but it's far from a rah-rah book about the U.S. National
Team. This officially licensed product of the FIFA Women's World
Cup (it even has the hologram sticker) is a collection of features
by those who cover the sport closest and gives extensive background
to the current tournament while putting into context how it will
shape the sport and the future of women's team athletics. Got to
read it before next week's final at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Why it chokes: Looks like a book aimed at kids, but the younger
ones might not pick up the rich text. Although the photos are
impressive in themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``People Who Sweat,'' by Robin Chotzinoff (Harcourt Brace
&AMP; Company; $22, 203 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Why it smokes: Chotzinoff finds people who, like herself, have
suffered through years of ``terminal athletic mediocrity'' but find
meaning in participation sports, such as the guy known as ``Little
Fat Boy'' who constantly finishes last in triathlons. The best
story, though, may be of a 52-year-old socialite from La Jolla who
took up surfing a couple of years ago and finds herself catching
waves with her son's friends, who can't help but address her in the
ocean as ``Mrs. (last name withheld because she feels surfing is
far too personal to reveal her identity).''
</P>
<P>
   Why it chokes: Could make you feel guilty about watching TV
after reading such nonsense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Betting on Horses,'' by
Sharon B. Smith (Alpha Books; $16.95, 268 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Why it smokes: Isn't everyone an idiot when it comes to betting?
Smith, the former ESPN and NBC horse racing commentator, explains
it to those who've only casually placed bets at the track but
really want to go beyond silly hunches and an ignorance of terms
and charts. Everything about the sport is covered in easy-to-digest
terms, including a simple system for picking a horse that doesn't
come with a guarantee, but could.
</P>
<P>
   Why it chokes: It's usually shelved in book stores in the games
and humor section. And while it has a companion pocket-size edition
($7.95), are you really going to whip that out at Hollywood Park
with all the other idiots looking at you? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Book: ``The Best American Sportswriting of the Century,'' edited
by David Halberstam (Houghton Mifflin; $30 hardcover, $18
softcover, 776 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Why it smokes: The annual series edited by Glenn Stout goes
millennium-mania with this monster project that gives the esteemed
Halberstam the final word on the best and the brightest
sportswriting from the past 100 years. It's no small project.
</P>
<P>
   Why it chokes: First of all, it's 776 pages, not exactly
beach-friendly. Halberstam's choice of 59 stories from 51 writers
(many of whom are non-traditional sports pontificators, like
himself) is topped by four scribes superior enough to be called the
``best of the best.'' A piece by Gay Talese on Joe DiMaggio
published in Esquire in 1966 seems to be the ``Citizen Kane'' of
this list. The implication that the best sportswriting doesn't come
from those who do it for a living doesn't sit well here. Oh, and by
the way, there are no columns included in the book from Mitch
Albom, who is only mentioned in the back under, ``Notable sports
writing and sports writers of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``best-of'' sportswriters book without Albom? Best to check
the New York Times Bestseller List. That's where you'll find him
instead.

 Net Chip Firms Strike Stock Gold  &HT;     By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Investors channeled their Internet passion away from content
providers and into Internet backbone companies during the second
quarter of 1999.
<P>
   The 10 Bay Area firms with the highest stock price gains during
the quarter almost all provide chips and equipment for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common theme (behind these gains) is corporate spending on
communications equipment and on people who supply chips to
communications companies,'' said Michael Murphy, editor of the
California Technology Stock Letter in Half Moon Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Bay Area companies saw their stock prices rise by an
average of 23 percent during the three months that ended on June
30, according to a survey of 393 local public firms by Davis Skaggs
Investment Management.
</P>
<P>
   That was significantly better than the 6.7 percent rise in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and the 9.1 percent rise in the Nasdaq
composite during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 highest-rising local stocks included four semiconductor
firms that sell chips for communications or networking equipment _
MMC Networks Inc., National Semiconductor Corp., ESS Technology
Inc. and Telcom Semiconductor Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That was a marked contrast to 1998 and the first quarter of
1999, when the fastest-rising stocks included Internet content
firms like Excite, Yahoo and Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are looking at chip stocks as a safer and surer way
to get on the Internet bandwagon,'' said Arun Veerappan, a senior
technology analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``The
Internet is powered by the chips that these kinds of companies
produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area's Top 10 also included four other firms involved in
communications equipment _ Network Peripherals Inc., Metricom Inc.,
Netopia Inc. and DSP Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Network Peripherals, a Milpitas firm with 150 employees, had the
biggest stock gain of any local firm during the quarter _ rising
from $5.31 to $19.38, an increase of 265 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Network Peripherals' gains were triggered in part by its
announcement of several products targeted at the ``gigabit
Ethernet'' market _ switches that will let companies link their
in-house computer networks at speeds up to 1 billion bits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year, we refocused away from legacy businesses
of 100 megabits into the gigabit arena,'' said company president
William Rosenberger. ``This is a very, very hot market.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, the two worst-performing local
stocks tracked by Davis Skaggs were both biotech firms that
suffered unexpected business setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Depomed Inc. of Foster City saw its stock drop from $10.06 to
$3.13 during the quarter _ mostly because its major partner,
Bristol-Meyers Squibb, decided not to use the drug-delivery
technology Depomed had been developing.
</P>
<P>
   And Scios Inc. of Mountain View saw its stock fall from $9.06 to
$3.25 during the quarter, after the Food and Drug Administration
declined to approve one of its drugs and ordered the firm to do an
additional yearlong clinical trial.

BUSH'S BIG BANKROLL AND WHAT IT MEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ariz., N.J., Iowa, N.H., Calif., N.Y., Ohio)  (jw) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush's outsized, $36.3 million campaign
war chest, more money than any candidate has raised so early in any
presidential election season, was the driving subject of
conversation Thursday among candidates and political experts who
said it would have an inevitable impact on his competitors and
reshape the landscape of campaign finance for the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, joining several Republicans, sought to
portray the Texas governor as the candidate of big money, showing
that overflowing coffers can bring related political baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's huge bankroll almost certainly means that he will forgo
federal matching funds in the presidential primaries and the
spending limits that come with them, several Bush advisers say.
Thursday, a top campaign adviser to Vice President Al Gore, who has
raised $18.5 million, said his campaign would abide by the spending
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the multimillionaire Republican candidate Steve
Forbes, who eschewed matching funds in 1996 and was again expected
to spend millions of his personal fortune to finance his candidacy,
Bush will probably be the only other candidate to refuse federal
matching funds. He was expected to make an official decision about
how he would finance his campaign later this month.
</P>
<P>
   If the governor refuses matching funds, he can spend whatever he
likes in the early primary and caucus states, while all the other
Republican and Democratic candidates will have to abide by the
strict state-by-state spending limits that apply to candidates who
accept federal matching funds. In Iowa, where the first caucuses
will be held early next year, the spending limit will be about $1.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where the first presidential primary of the
2000 campaign will be held, the spending ceiling will be about $6.6
million, according to Sharon Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates who accept matching funds will have to cap their
overall spending in the primaries at a figure somewhere near $33.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants, campaign workers and campaign finance
experts were all reaching Thursday for just the right lopsided term
to describe the Bush campaign's unprecedented fund-raising coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievably big number,'' said Kenneth Gross, a
former FEC official. ``Distressing'' was the adjective chosen by
Roger Witten, a lawyer who stood before the Supreme Court to help
defend the post-Watergate election laws, including the use of
public money and spending limits in presidential elections that
were meant to curb the political money chase.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Clinton said that if Bush
rejected federal spending limits he would be lined up with
Republicans who were ``unanimously hostile'' to changing campaign
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican consultants said the image of being the
big-money candidate could also hurt Bush and perhaps help Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who has made the campaign finance issue a rallying
cry for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Berman, a Republican fund-raiser who supports Bush, said
McCain might benefit in the short term. But the biggest effect of
Bush's money, Berman said, is to further dampen the fund-raising
prospects of his rivals. ``It basically means that the air supply
has been shut off to all the second-tier candidates,'' Berman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the pace of Bush's fund-raising holds up, the $16.7 million
or so that the governor would not receive in federal matching funds
would amount to a small part of his campaign budget. Furthermore,
not being bound by spending limits means that Bush probably will
still be flush long after other candidates have hit the primary
spending ceiling or run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   With primaries scheduled in early March in a number of expensive
states, including California, New York and Ohio, it is quite
possible that other candidates will have gone broke or hit the
ceiling by then. That could leave almost five months in which Bush,
and possibly Forbes, would be the only candidates with campaign
money to burn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican nominee, hit the
spending ceiling in April. In the months left before the general
election, the party tried to prop up his candidacy by spending
millions of dollars on issue advertising that prominently featured
Dole. The Democratic Party also spent millions on such
advertisements, although the Clinton-Gore ticket did not have a
primary challenge and opened an insurmountable lead over Dole in
those spring and early summer months.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of either Gore or former Sen. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., facing a similar plight next year, several Democratic
fund-raisers said the Democratic National Committee was increasing
its fund-raising. But Marla Romash, deputy chairwoman of the Gore
campaign, insisted that it would have the resources necessary to
``win the primaries and win the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   A party's ``soft money,'' the large contributions that fall
outside federal election law limits, can be used to finance issue
advertising. Soft money is expected to play a bigger role than ever
in the 2000 general election. The Republican and Democratic
nominees will each receive $67.3 million in public money after the
nominating conventions. (If Bush is the Republican nominee, he is
expected to accept federal financing for the general election.)
Then the candidates do not raise any more private donations. But
the parties continue to raise money from private donors. In 1996,
soft-money fund raising by the Democratic and Republican parties
exceeded $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview on Wednesday, McCain predicted that a
billion dollars in soft money would be spent in the 2000 elections,
and called for passage of campaign finance legislation that he has
introduced to ban soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's network of Pioneers, a group of wealthy Republicans who
have been collecting $1,000 checks for him in the last several
months, could quickly be converted to a soft-money team of
fund-raisers for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, has established himself as the most
successful party fund-raiser in history, and he is busily raising
soft money for the Democratic Party.

 _ SF CHRON  
 3 Firms Skyrocket With IPOs  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Three more Bay Area companies launched their stocks into the
financial stratosphere yesterday.
<P>
   Ask Jeeves Inc., a Berkeley search engine service than lets
users pose their questions in plain English, more than quadrupled,
shooting from an offering price of $14 to close at $64.94. The
company, which raised $42 million by selling 12 percent of its
stock to the public, suddenly has a market value of $1.58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One Inc., a Walnut Creek company that allows firms to
buy products and services over the Internet, nearly tripled in
price, jumping from $21 to $61. The company sold 15 percent of its
shares for $63 million and ended the day with a market value of
$1.39 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clarent Corp., a Redwood City seller of Internet phone systems,
rose 70 percent to $25.50 from $15 and is worth $670.7 million
after selling 15 percent of the company to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Internet companies are starting off July at the same
sizzling pace they ended the first half of the year. Through the
end of June, 42 Bay Area firms, most of which are Internet related,
went public with an average gain of 138 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Like those IPOs, the three companies that went public yesterday
are not yet profitable. Ask Jeeves lost $4.9 million on $1.1
million in revenues in the first quarter. Commerce One lost $12.3
million on $2.1 million in sales and Clarent lost $5.5 million on
$6.7 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   But their growth prospects are tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves answered nearly 1 million questions per day in April,
and the number of users has more than quadrupled from 425,000 last
September to about 2 million. The company connects users to its
public Web site www.ask.com and tries to direct them to the exact
page that answers their questions. If that fails, it provides
matching Web pages from other search engines such as Yahoo,
WebCrawler and AltaVista.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Jeeves works very well answering the most popular
questions,'' said Danny Sullivan, editor of
www.searchenginewatch.com, which tracks online search services.
``It's not artificial intelligence or software that makes it work
so much as humans (at Ask Jeeves) who find the right links and the
right relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you ask a question about President Clinton, Ask
Jeeves might ask if you want to find out where you can listen to
the Linda Tripp tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves CEO Robert Wrubel said about half the company's 200
employees are editors and researchers who have put about 7 million
questions in the company's ``knowledge base.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Ask ``Why is the sky blue?'' or ``What's an IPO?'' or ``What's
the going rate for a Honda?'' and you get specific, detailed
answers.
</P>
<P>
   But if you ask ``Who said `May you live in interesting times?'''
you will get gibberish. Instead of an answer, Ask Jeeves queries if
you want to know what time it is in Africa or where can to find a
planting map for early May. By contrast, AltaVista quickly links
one to more-appropriate sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Jeeves isn't perfect,'' said analyst Sullivan. ``But none
of the search engines are.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrubel said that Ask Jeeves keeps adding to its universe of
questions and links to online answers and aims to be ``the first
Internet butler'' that serves up appropriate answers quickly and
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it started a national advertising campaign. In
addition to revenues from banner ads on its public web site, Ask
Jeeves sells its easy-to-use question answering services to
companies such as Bell South, Compaq and Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves is not the only search engine company to go public
recently. GoTo.com, a Pasadena Internet search service that
operates a bit like an online Yellow Pages that lets lets companies
pay for the right to be listed first in search results, has jumped
from $15 to $36.50 since its IPO June 18.
</P>
<P>
   While Ask Jeeves lets people search the Internet, Commerce One
lets companies buys telecommunications gear office supplies and
other products. The company estimates that the business-to-business
e-commerce market will expand from $109 billion this year to $1.3
trillion in 2003. Competitor Ariba Inc. of Sunnyvale has more than
quadrupled from $23 to $105 since its IPO June 23.

 _ SF CHRON   Wells Distances Itself From Steel Company 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Wells Fargo has lowered its profile as lender to a steel company
accused of unfair labor practices, in what could lead to an end of
a costly and embarrassing union boycott of the San Francisco bank.
<P>
   The bank said yesterday that it has stopped acting as the leader
of a group of lenders that extended $125 million to Oregon Steel
Mills, which refused to take back hundreds of Pueblo, Colo.,
steelworkers after a 1997 strike. Wells Fargo remains a lender to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The United Steelworkers of America, which has led a 19-month
boycott against Wells Fargo, said the move could prompt it to call
off its campaign but only if the bank takes more action to pressure
Oregon Steel. ``We're hopeful this is a first step,'' said boycott
coordinator Eric Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   The union claims that the boycott has triggered withdrawals of
some $1.2 billion in deposits from the bank; however, Wells Fargo
says it has lost much less.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Wells Fargo insisted that it isn't reducing its
relationship with Oregon Steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``For business reasons, the company restructured the loan,''
said spokeswoman Kathleen Shilkret. ``We are still extending
credit. Bowing to pressure would cause a dangerous precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Once loan terms are set, the leader of a loan syndicate
essentially is an administrator. In an extraordinary move, Oregon
Steel now is carrying out that function itself instead of having a
bank do it, Shilkret said.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives said it's possible the arrangement is
cosmetic, letting Oregon Steel continue to get credit without
having any lender designated as leader. ``If it's a smoke screen,
we will escalate,'' Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   First Interstate originally led the group of banks that made the
Oregon Steel loan. Wells Fargo inherited the leader position in
1996, when it bought the Los Angeles bank.
</P>
<P>
   After Oregon Steel replaced its unionized workforce, the
Steelworkers tried to hit back by targeting Wells Fargo,
threatening Oregon's source of financing.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott became one of the most visible ``corporate
campaigns'' of recent years. That's an increasingly common union
tactic of pressuring companies to settle labor disputes by
appealing to customers, shareholders, lenders and the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   As the boycott gathered steam, Wells Fargo protested that it
shouldn't be dragged into a labor dispute involving one of its
customers. Boycott supporters maintained that the bank was taking
the company's side by lending it money.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Union Bank of California and its corporate
parent, Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, withdrew from the Oregon
Steel syndicate though the two banks said their move wasn't a
response to the boycott. Canada's Scotiabank also stopped lending
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, as Oregon Steel's loan was scheduled for
renewal, a union member and two supporters, California Assemblyman
Scott Wildman, D-Los Feliz, and Rick Tuttle, City of Los Angeles
Controller, met with Paul Watson, the bank's corporate banking
chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him it wasn't a good business practice'' to lend to a
company that was using replacement workers, Wildman said.
</P>
<P>
   Wildman, who is chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit
Committee, said he didn't threaten state sanctions against the
bank, such as the withdrawal of pension fund investments.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to Wells Fargo said the intervention of the
lawmaker was a pointed reminder of pro-union sentiments in
Sacramento, where the Legislature and governor's office are both
controlled by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The union said it now will try to find out whether Wells Fargo
is willing to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will ask political and community leaders who have been
go-betweens between the union and Wells Fargo to see if the bank is
willing make any more moves,'' Lerner said.

TWO GIRLS HELD AFTER WOMEN IS BADLY BEATEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A 25-year-old woman was severely beaten in the head
by two teen-age girls on Tuesday after complaining that their car
was blocking the street. She remained in a coma Thursday in a
Northern Virginia hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Prince William County, where the incident
occurred in a generally quiet, middle-class neighborhood of
Woodbridge, said it was unusual for girls to commit so brutal a
crime, although the county police said violence by teen-age girls
and young women was on the rise throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever had anything like this with girls
involved,'' said Sgt. Kim Chinn, a spokeswoman for the Prince
William County Police Department. ``But we have noticed in the last
several years that more young girls are becoming involved in crime,
and more in violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ebert, the commonwealth attorney for Prince William County,
said in an interview Thursday that the two girls had administered
``an unusually brutal beating with little justification.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls, Teresa Hattie Dixon, 18, and a 16-year-old girl whose
name was not released because of her age, were arrested shortly
after the beating and are being held without bond. Charged with
aggravated malicious wounding, they could be sentenced to life in
prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the incident began shortly after a car in which
the victim, Natalie Giles Davis, was riding with her two young
children and two other young cousins were passengers left the Davis
house to attend a church service.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Davis drove her car around a stopped vehicle, heated
words were exchanged between her and the two suspects, who were on
the sidewalk with three friends, Chinn said. Mrs. Davis drove on,
and the five girls followed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davis and the 16-year-old girl left their cars and got into
a fight, which Ms. Dixon joined, the police said. Mrs. Davis' head
was pounded against the sidewalk, the police said, and was also
kicked.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert said he intended to ask the court to try the younger girl
as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman, Janice Moore, described Mrs. Davis'
condition as critical. Charles Davis, 27, the injured woman's
husband, said doctors had told him her life was in danger.

 _ SF CHRON   Apple Sues Maker of Candy-Colored iMac Look-Alike Computer 
 &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Apple Computer sued the maker of an iMac look-alike yesterday,
charging that Future Power and Korean conglomerate Daewoo filched
the candy-colored iMac's industrial design.
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, attempts
to block sales of the $799 Windows-based knockoff and seeks
unspecified actual and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   It contends that E-Power _ a translucent, curvy PC with built-in
monitor and Internet connections _ bears more than a striking
resemblance to the iMac's space-age look. Future Power just debuted
the machine last month at PC Expo in New York; it was slated to
ship in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a universe of original designs that Future Power and
Daewoo could have created for their computers, but instead they
chose to copy Apple's designs,'' Steve Jobs, Apple's interim chief
executive, said in a statement. ``We've invested a lot of money and
effort to create and market our award-winning designs, and we
intend to vigorously protect them under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Santa Clara's Future Power, an 8-month-old startup,
said they have ``not seen a copy of any legal filing and will not
have any comment until that time.''
</P>
<P>
   At PC Expo, Future Power executives had said they discussed the
teardrop-shaped computer's design with lawyers, and were confident
it did not violate Apple's intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is unusual in the PC industry because it centers on
the industrial design of a PC. In the past, Apple has sued over
intellectual property, such as its famous lawsuit against Microsoft
for copying the ``look and feel'' of the graphical user interface
of the Macintosh operating system in Windows. It eventually lost
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, high-tech lawyers said Apple could pursue a tactic
called a ``trade dress'' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple is likely to argue that its distinct packaging was
ripped off, and that confuses the market,'' said Rich Gray, an
intellectual-property attorney in San Jose. ``They've spent a lot
of time and money establishing the distinctive look of the iMac.''
</P>
<P>
   A trade dress claim, based on a product design's particular
``look and concept,'' was established by the Lanham Act of 1946,
also known as the Trademark Act. In 1992, Taco Cabana, for example,
successfully protected the appearance and decor of its restaurant
chain, much as it would a trademarked word or logo, when it
successfully sued Two Pesos for stealing its motif.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Apple had employed the trade dress strategy in its
graphical-user interface case against Microsoft, it would have
won,'' said Jack Russo, a Palo Alto attorney specializing in
computer litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-maker is especially protective about the iMac, a
hip-looking, heavily promoted consumer machine that helped fuel a
dramatic financial turnaround at Apple. More than 1 million units
have been sold since it began shipping last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Like its more recognizable Mac counterpart, E-Power comes in
five colors (emerald, ruby, topaz, sapphire and amethyst) and an
all-in-one packaging. The iMac is available in a similar palette
but with fruit names: blueberry, grape, strawberry, tangerine and
lime.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only external features distinguishing the two
machines is that E-Power comes with a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   Future Power is a joint venture backed by Daewoo Telecom, a
subsidiary of the Daewoo Group.

 &HT;    Atlanta Olympics official agrees to open all but 8 boxes of
records
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just as Billy Payne officially closed the door
Thursday on the Atlanta Olympics, he pledged to open to the public
all but eight boxes of records from the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he still wants to keep the disputed documents under
wraps, but he did agree to give a congressional committee
``unfettered access'' to those boxes, which he says contain
personal memorandums and correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tom Bliley (R-Va.), chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, which is investigating possible corruption in the
Atlanta Olympic bid, would not agree to keep the sensitive records
from the public. In a statement, Bliley said he had ``gone as far
as we can to address their concerns without adversely affecting our
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee says Payne's claim that the papers are personal is
unfounded, and it has demanded in a strongly worded letter that it
be allowed unrestricted access.
</P>
<P>
   The documents in the eight boxes are the subject of the Georgia
Amateur Athletic Foundation lawsuit against state Attorney General
Thurbert Baker and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which argue
that the Olympic records are subject to the Georgia Open Records
Act. GAAF owns the records.
</P>
<P>
   Payne had allowed federal investigators to examine the
controversial papers, but he had forbidden them from making copies,
because he feared lawmakers would release them to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have reviewed those documents extensively, and we have
asked them not to copy them until the litigation is completed,''
Payne said during a news conference in the rotunda of the Metro
Chamber of Commerce, overlooking Centennial Olympic Park. ``They
refused that request, so we have complied totally and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne sent a letter to the House Commerce Committee on Wednesday
saying the foundation would ``cooperate fully.'' But he requested
that the documents in the boxes ``not be disclosed to third
parties'' unless the committee determines them relevant in a
hearing or report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our day in court to prove our case,'' he said. A court
hearing is scheduled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who chairs the subcommittee leading
the investigation, welcomed the announcement of cooperation, even
if it came only after the threat of a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know all too well the path Salt Lake City organizers
chose,'' Upton said in a statement. ``Taxpayers deserve to know if
the same thing happened in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic officials said that the 5,700 boxes of documents
to be released will prove that no wrongdoing was associated with
the bid for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this thing broke in Salt Lake City, people started to
wonder about Atlanta and saying, 'Billy, say it ain't so,''' said
A.D. Frazier Jr., former chief operating officer with the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games. ``Well, I'm here to say that it
ain't so.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the eight boxes, all records will be open for
inspection beginning July 19, the third anniversary of the '96
Opening Ceremony, Payne said. The boxes are stored at ACOG
headquarters, the Atlanta History Center and several private
storage facilities. The committee still has to work out a procedure
for viewing the records, which will include retrieval, access and
copying fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every record of the Olympic Games is available for your
inspection,'' Frazier said. ``I beg you to spend the rest of your
life going through those boxes. Have fun. The donor information and
private foundation information is all that is left out, and
Congress has access to that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, which was called to announce the formal
dissolution of ACOG, Frazier reported that its books are balanced
and that any money left in a $12 million contingency fund would be
turned over to the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While touting the successful conclusion of a 12-year odyssey
that began with Payne's dream of bringing the world's biggest
sports event to Atlanta, the Olympic officials acknowledged
disappointment that the Salt Lake bribery scandal has tarnished
their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so proud of everything that happened here, and we
wonder why somebody wants to make us ashamed of it, or that there
is something we ought to apologize for,'' said Andrew Young, ACOG
co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The former mayor defended the group's actions and expenses
during the bid process and noted that the money spent on lobbying
fell far short of their competitors' tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to think with $6 million we could out-bribe people
who admittedly spent $15 million in Toronto, $25 million in
Melbourne and $35 million in Athens _ you know better than that,''
said Young, who also is GAAF chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a former U.S. House member and U.N. ambassador, also has
some harsh words for the committee investigating Atlanta's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the Congress . . . could do business with
one-hundredth of the competence that we demonstrated here, they'd
learn a lot,'' he said.

asked them not to copy them until the litigation is completed,''
Payne said during a news conference in the rotunda of the Metro
Chamber of Commerce, overlooking Centennial Olympic Park. ``They
refused that request, so we have complied totally and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne sent a letter to the House Commerce Committee on Wednesday
saying the foundation would ``cooperate fully.'' But he requested
that the documents in the boxes ``not be disclosed to third
parties'' unless the committee determines them relevant in a
hearing or report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our day in court to prove our case,'' he said. A court
hearing is scheduled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who chairs the subcommittee leading
the investigation, welcomed the announcement of cooperation, even
if it came only after the threat of a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know all too well the path Salt Lake City organizers
chose,'' Upton said in a statement. ``Taxpayers deserve to know if
the same thing happened in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic officials said that the 5,700 boxes of documents
to be released will prove that no wrongdoing was associated with
the bid for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this thing broke in Salt Lake City, people started to
wonder about Atlanta and saying, 'Billy, say it ain't so,''' said
A.D. Frazier Jr., former chief operating officer with the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games. ``Well, I'm here to say that it
ain't so.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the eight boxes, all records will be open for
inspection beginning July 19, the third anniversary of the '96
Opening Ceremony, Payne said. The boxes are stored at ACOG
headquarters, the Atlanta History Center and several private
storage facilities. The committee still has to work out a procedure
for viewing the records, which will include retrieval, access and
copying fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every record of the Olympic Games is available for your
inspection,'' Frazier said. ``I beg you to spend the rest of your
life going through those boxes. Have fun. The donor information and
private foundation information is all that is left out, and
Congress has access to that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, which was called to announce the formal
dissolution of ACOG, Frazier reported that its books are balanced
and that any money left in a $12 million contingency fund would be
turned over to the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While touting the successful conclusion of a 12-year odyssey
that began with Payne's dream of bringing the world's biggest
sports event to Atlanta, the Olympic officials acknowledged
disappointment that the Salt Lake bribery scandal has tarnished
their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so proud of everything that happened here, and we
wonder why somebody wants to make us ashamed of it, or that there
is something we ought to apologize for,'' said Andrew Young, ACOG
co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The former mayor defended the group's actions and expenses
during the bid process and noted that the money spent on lobbying
fell far short of their competitors' tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to think with $6 million we could out-bribe people
who admittedly spent $15 million in Toronto, $25 million in
Melbourne and $35 million in Athens _ you know better than that,''
said Young, who also is GAAF chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a former U.S. House member and U.N. ambassador, also has
some harsh words for the committee investigating Atlanta's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the Congress . . . could do business with
one-hundredth of the competence that we demonstrated here, they'd
learn a lot,'' he said.

A CROWDED STRETCH RUN IN HORSE OF YEAR RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Winning the Hollywood Gold Cup on Sunday
thrust Real Quiet into Horse of the Year contention _ which says a
lot about the state of the campaign for racing's top honor.
</P>
<P>
   At the season's midpoint, there are a lot of candidates but no
George W. Bush or Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wide open,'' said trainer D. Wayne Lukas, whose
near-Triple Crown winner Charismatic is the choice here for Horse
of the Half-Year but is injured and retired and thus a long shot
for next January's vote. ``You're going to need the next six months
(to narrow down the contenders).''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, eventual Horse of the Year Skip Away had won four major
races from Florida to Maryland to California by now.
</P>
<P>
   In '99, only the dominant 3-year-old filly Silverbulletday has
won as many as three Grade I's, and her thumping by colts in the
Belmont Stakes set back her Horse of the Year chances.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, who won the Pimlico Special in May, is one of two
males in the 3-year-olds-and-up division with two Grade I's to
their credit, although his overall record this year is only 2 for
5. The other multiple-Grade I winner is Gulfstream Park and Oaklawn
handicap winner Behrens, who beat Real Quiet in the Massachusetts
Handicap, their only meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens races in Monday's Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park.
Real Quiet is expected to stay sharp by running in the Aug. 7 San
Diego Handicap at Del Mar. Then the two leaders in the ``NTRA
Champions on Fox'' series would square off in the Aug. 29 Pacific
Classic at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, '98 Belmont winner Victory Gallop, second to Behrens
in this week's NTRA poll, is aiming for the Aug. 1 Whitney at
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream looms as the
championship-decider. Six of its past 12 winners were Horses of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   If none of the older horses takes command, it could be a year
for a dominant figure from a minor division, like '97, when a
splintered vote went to undefeated 2-year-old Favorite Trick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possibilities: 3-year-old General Challenge, planning
to use the July 18 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park as a springboard
to the Pacific Classic; 2-year-old filly Chilukki, a brilliant 3
for 3 for Bob Baffert; 6-year-old Yagli, 2 for 2 in Grade I turf
races; 4-year-old filly Banshee Breeze, unbeaten in three starts;
and 4-year-old filly Manistique, 4 for 5 but winless outside
California in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Six more months, it'll all be settled.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: The five Hollywood Park stakes Saturday, Sunday and
Monday include the Beverly Hills Handicap, in which Julio
Canani-trained Tranquility Lake will be odds-on for her fourth
straight front-running victory on turf after beginning her career 2
for 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julio's improved this horse 10 to 15 lengths,'' said owner
Martin Wygod, who moved the 4-year-old to Canani last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-standard: Puerto Madero, fourth and last in the Hollywood
Gold Cup, favored his left front ankle the next day. Richard
Mandella said X-rays were negative and the Chilean-bred was
scheduled for further examination.
</P>
<P>
   But a new physical problem probably wouldn't explain three
straight indifferent performances since his Donn Handicap win.
Puerto Madero trained sharply and looked great in the paddock.
Maybe the 5-year-old simply has lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up: Budroyale, the 6-year-old ex-claimer whose
earnings went over $1 million with the Gold Cup's second-place
purse of $200,000, will try softer competition next time in the
Aug. 22 Longacres Mile at Emerald Downs near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've followed our hearts with this horse, (and) that's a race
I've always wanted to win,'' said owner Jeffrey Sengara, who is
from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsammy out: Emile Ramsammy, having his best meet since joining
the Southern California circuit in 1998, expects to miss the rest
of the Hollywood Park season after fracturing his right collarbone
Sunday at Woodbine Race Course near Toronto. He was fourth in the
standings here with 30 winners in 143 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just bad luck,'' said Ramsammy, hurt when his mount broke
down and fell in the race following his third-place finish aboard
Bobby Frankel-trained Euchre in the Queen's Plate.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsammy took over the assignment because Mickey Walls, who won
Canada's premier race aboard Woodcarver, was tied up with
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Sad ending: The death of Three Ring, who flipped and fractured
her skull in the Belmont Park paddock before Sunday's Mother Goose
Stakes, has to rank high on the long list of racetrack tragedies.
Trainer Eddie Plesa said the Grade I-winning 3-year-old filly
seemed to panic when she stepped on a downward slope in her
saddling stall.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are emotionally prepared for the worst to happen while
their horses are racing. But while they're being saddled?
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring has been buried at owner Barry Schwartz's Stonewall
Farm in Granite Springs, N.Y. A $770,000 earner since being
purchased privately for $250,000 as a 2-year-old, she was not
insured, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Can he say that? Michael Wrona might have achieved a
race-calling first when he said the favorite in Sunday's Hollywood
Park nightcap, running at the back of the pack at the time, faced
``a hell of a task.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as it came out of my mouth, I thought, `What did you
just say?''' Wrona said of the profanity. ``That's one I'll try not
to repeat. I hope nobody was offended.''

 &HT;    EDs: 1ST UPDATE: Corrects number of hydraulic jacks in 7th graf.
 &HT;    Old trick speeds lighthouse relocation
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is moving at the speed of
slippery soap.
</P>
<P>
   On the black and white-striped beacon's unexpectedly rapid
journey inland to safety, workers are using bars of Ivory soap to
grease the steel tracks along which the lighthouse is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Bar soap is handy, of course, on stubborn zippers and squeaky
kitchen drawers. House movers have used it for years to slide
buildings onto truck trailers.
</P>
<P>
   On North Carolina's Outer Banks, moving officials credit the old
trick with helping speed the lighthouse past the halfway point in
its 2,900-foot trip away from crashing Atlantic waves.
</P>
<P>
   The 128-year-old lighthouse is now beyond the oceanfront dunes
that would be vulnerable to overwashing by waves during a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is moving so well with the Ivory soap as a lubricant
that it almost rolls itself,'' said Randy Knott, chief engineer
with Atlanta-based Law Engineering and Environmental Services Inc.,
the lead engineering consultant on the lighthouse project.
</P>
<P>
   The steel track's beams are so slippery, Knott said, that the
4,800-ton lighthouse has had a tendency to roll backward in its
slightly uphill trip, until it is braced by a hydraulic jack.
</P>
<P>
   Initially crews planned to use a graphite-based dry lubricant.
Officials feared that sand would blow onto the sun-softened soap,
creating friction between the steel beams and the steel rollers on
top of which the lighthouse is riding.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't been a problem, and officials aren't sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know whether it is the heat or humidity or what, but
we are not getting sand on the rollers,'' said Joe Jakubik, project
manager for International Chimney Corp., the project's contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The 108-foot-tall landmark's $11.8 million rescue has gone so
smoothly that officials are predicting it will arrive at its new
foundation about July 10.
</P>
<P>
   When the move started June 17, officials said the trip would
take four to six weeks, with hydraulic jacks pushing the tower 70
to 100 feet a day. But some days the lighthouse has traveled more
than 200 feet, cutting its travel time by a week or more. It is
scheduled to reopen to the public Memorial Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Expert House Movers, a subcontractor, has saved time in the way
it resets the hydraulic jacks, Knott said. The jacks push the
lighthouse along the steel tracks for a distance of 5 feet, at a
virtually imperceptible speed of 1 to 2 inches a minute. At that
point, the jacks move forward for the next 5-foot move, and
hydraulic plates hold them in place.
</P>
<P>
   Expert House Movers had planned to carry out that process
manually, a time-consuming effort requiring workers to unbolt and
rebolt the jacks to the steel tracks. ``It is now a tremendously
efficient process,'' Knott said.

EARNINGS WARNING DRAINS STARBUCKS STOCK

 (ATTN: Wash.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sipping his coffee at the Starbucks restaurant on
Melrose Avenue here, Matt Siess said he loved the brew and the
atmosphere. But he is skeptical about the coffee chain's new
ambition to sell things beyond drinks and light food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what selling coffee has to do with selling
Calphalon,'' he said referring to the cookware products.
``Ultimately, I guess, I think that most people that come here,
come here to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some of its customers, Starbucks investors are skeptical as
well about the company's plans, announced late Wednesday, to become
an Internet retailer, not just of roasted beans and coffee mugs,
but of everything from frying pans to towels, picture frames and
even sofas and credenzas.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. lost 28 percent of
their value Thursday, falling $10.625 to close at $26.9375, after
the company announced its Internet strategy and said that its
earnings for the fiscal year would be 10 percent below Wall
Street's expectation. More than 73 million shares changed hands,
making Starbucks the most actively traded issue.
</P>
<P>
   To many investors, the earnings disappointment and the Internet
announcement both suggested that a phenomenally successful company
was losing its focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to stretch who they are as a company into an
area where they really don't have any expertise,'' said John
Ivankoe, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, Howard Schultz,
who once defied skeptics who said that the country did not need
more fancy coffee shops, promised to do the same with Internet
strategy, with legions of customers like Siess following Starbucks
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz told analysts and investors in a conference call late
Wednesday that the company would create the ``premier lifestyle
portal on the Internet,'' saying that the Starbucks Web site would
offer ``a feeling of romance, of relaxation'' similar to what he
said a customer might experience in a coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that Starbucks was losing its focus, telling the
analysts that the coffee-shop business ``is and always will be the
driver of what we do.'' Starbucks said it expected to earn 54 cents
a share in the year that ends on Oct. 3, rather than the 60 cents
analysts had been expecting. Last year, the company earned 44 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Starbucks said, is not that profit from coffee
shops is falling. Rather, they just did not grow enough to make up
for other setbacks, like flat sales of the company's Frappuccino
bottled coffee drink, which is sold in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials insist that the core business of North
American coffee shops is not overdeveloped. Sales at stores open at
least a year are up 5 percent so far this fiscal year. Starbucks,
which has about 2,000 North American shops, is opening 400 new
shops this year. It also wants to expand overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company has been diversifying to prepare for the day
when growth of that core business will slow.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the Internet comes in. Schultz said that Starbucks
would set up a portal site by the end of this year. Once viewers
come to the home page of the site, they will be led to other pages
selling not only Starbucks coffee but gourmet food, kitchenware,
home furnishings and furniture. Many of these sites would be
managed by retailers that already sell such goods and would retain
their brand names.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company would announce a major strategic
partnership this summer to pursue the Web business. Starbucks will
also consider acquisitions and investments in other companies that
provide some of the products to be sold on the Web site. He said he
could not confirm or deny rumors that Starbucks was trying to buy
Williams-Sonoma, the retailer of fancy cookware.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said the key to Starbucks' success would be its ability
to attract Web customers through its shops by such measures as
advertising the Web site on the 14 million paper cups it uses each
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have a relationship with Starbucks that is
different from a traditional bricks-and-mortar store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the customers at the Melrose Avenue shop were not
that sure. Rosie Taravella, a 37-year-old actress and screenwriter
sipping a Grande Guatamalan, remarked, ``What I'd like to see
Starbucks invest in is drive-throughs _ making the obtaining of
coffee easier.''

 SYLVIA SIDNEY, 88, FILM HEROINE IN 1930s  
 (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sylvia Sidney, whose vulnerable but spunky persona
helped make her the ultimate heroine of realistic movies of the
1930s, died Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was
88 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sidney determined to be an actress at the age of 15 and
perfected her artistry over six decades in a versatile mix of 40
films and 100 classical and modern plays.
</P>
<P>
   In her 20s, the petite actress with a heart-shaped face, large,
moist eyes and a tremulous voice played anguished film heroines in
Rouben Mamoulian's ``City Streets,'' Theodore Dreiser and Josef von
Sternberg's ``American Tragedy,'' Elmer Rice and King Vidor's
``Street Scene,'' Sidney Kingsley's ``Dead End'' and Alfred
Hitchcock's ``Sabotage.'' She also starred in the first three
American films directed by Fritz Lang: ``Fury,'' ``You Only Live
Once'' and ``You and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lang's stark cinema of social injustice, the film historian
David Thomson wrote, the actress ``caught exactly the fragile
happiness allowed in Lang's world and played with a restraint that
perfectly matched the fatal simplicity of the plots. There are
close-ups in `Fury' of Sidney watching Spencer Tracy in a burning
jail, as harrowed as any Lillian Gish close-ups'' in D.W.
Griffith's silent film masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sidney was grateful for tutelage from her first film
directors. In 1977 she remarked: ``King Vidor and Mamoulian, of
course, I adored. Fritz Lang and I became dear friends, though we
had awful fights.'' But producers were reluctant to free her from
type-casting, prompting her to deplore her repetitious roles as
``the girl of the gangster, then the sister who was bringing up the
gangster, then later the mother of the gangster, and they always
had me ironing somebody's shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sidney also resented being treated as studio property. She
considered herself not a star, but an actress. Eventually she
expanded her gallery of screen characters to include a chic
Eurasian double-agent in ``Blood on the Sun'' (1945), an idealistic
journalist in ``The Searching Wind'' (1946), a drudge in ``Les
Miserables'' (1952) and a hard-bitten matriarch in ``Summer Wishes,
Winter Dreams'' (1973), for which she was nominated for an Oscar as
best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s her films included ``Hammett,'' ``Corrupt'' and
``Beetlejuice,'' directed by Tim Burton. In 1996 she appeared in a
cameo as a prairie woman in Burton's ``Mars Attacks!'' as a favor
to the director for casting her in ``Beetlejuice'' as a
chain-smoking ghoul, a role she thought was ``great,'' said John
Springer, her friend and publicist.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, Miss Sidney appeared in Ben Hecht's ``To Quito and
Back'' (1937), Irwin Shaw's ``Gentle People'' (with the Group
Theater, 1939), Carl Reiner and Joseph Stein's ``Enter Laughing''
(1963) and Tennessee Williams' ``Vieux Carre'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Her richly varied tour and stock performances included
``Pygmalion,'' ``Angel Street,'' ``Jane Eyre,'' ``Joan of
Lorraine,'' ``Kind Lady,'' ``O Mistress Mine,'' ``Anne of the
Thousand Days,'' ``The Rivals,'' ``The Madwoman of Chaillot,''
``The Little Foxes,'' ``The Importance of Being Earnest,'' ``She
Stoops to Conquer,'' ``The Glass Menagerie,'' ``Cabaret,'' ``Sweet
Bird of Youth,'' ``Butterflies Are Free'' and `` 'Night, Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Miss Sidney's dozens of starring television roles were
acclaimed performances as a cancer-ridden patient in a hospice in
the 1980 play ``The Shadow Box'' and as plain-spoken but
compassionate grandmothers of homosexual AIDS patients in ``An
Early Frost'' in 1985 and in ``Andre's Mother'' in 1990. Miss
Sidney last appeared on screen in 1998 in several episodes of ABC's
new version of ``Fantasy Island,'' for which she had a seven-year
contract for a recurring role, Springer said. The show was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Sidney, originally named Sophia Kossow, was born in the
Bronx on Aug. 8, 1910, to Victor Kossow, a clothing salesman, and
the former Rebecca Saperstein. Her parents were divorced when she
was 9, and soon after she was adopted by her mother's second
husband, Dr. Sigmund Sidney, a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Shy and a stutterer, she was given elocution and dancing lessons
starting at the age of 10. As a teen-ager, she left Washington
Irving High School to study acting at the Theater Guild school in
Manhattan and was soon expelled for staying out late. Nonetheless,
she obtained a dozen roles and favorable notices in Broadway plays,
including a 1928 drama, ``Gods of the Lightning,'' and a 1930
comedy, ``Bad Girl.'' They won her a contract with Paramount
Pictures and opened her path to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Her main recreation at her homes in Roxbury and later Danbury,
Conn., was needlework. Her designs are sold as kits, and she wrote
two popular instruction books on the art: ``Sylvia Sidney's
Needlepoint Book'' (1968) and ``The Sylvia Sidney Question and
Answer Book on Needlepoint'' (1975).
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sidney's three marriages all ended in divorce. Her husbands
were Bennett Cerf, the publisher; Luther Adler, the actor, and
Carlton Alsop, a publicity agent. With Adler, she had a son, Jacob
(Jody) Adler, who died in 1987 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
also called Lou Gehrig's disease. His illness prompted her to
become a dedicated volunteer for the National ALS Foundation. No
immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sidney regarded her life and her career as inseparable.
``There isn't a role that I wouldn't accept, provided it's good and
has something to say,'' she told an interviewer in 1975. ``I
wouldn't know what to do with myself if I retired. I'm an actress,
and I have to work.''

MAINTENANCE FIRM'S LAWYER EXPECTS INDICTMENTS IN VALUJET CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Mo., Texas, Ga.)  (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyer for an aircraft maintenance company
involved in the crash of Valujet Airlines Flight 592 in the
Everglades three years ago said Thursday that he believed it was
likely that the company and some of its employees would soon be
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal indictments after plane crashes are extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a DC-9, crashed on May 11, 1996, shortly after
takeoff from Miami, killing all 110 people on board. The National
Transportation Safety Board traced the cause of the crash to a fire
in the forward cargo hold started by reactive chemicals in old
airplane parts, oxygen generators, which had been removed from
another Valujet plane by the maintenance company, Sabretech.
</P>
<P>
   Sabretech delivered the parts to the ramp where Flight 592 was
being loaded for its trip to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the airline have been under investigation by
federal and Florida authorities for possible violation of laws
governing labeling and shipment of hazardous materials, and of
environmental laws. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Miami, Alicia Valle, said she could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami-Dade state attorney's office, Donald Ungurait, a
spokesman, said, ``We do have an ongoing investigation that
accompanies the federal investigation and in other ways is purely
independent, under state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involves all of the potential parties who were involved in
the activity surrounding the Valujet tragedy,'' Ungurait said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say if indictments were expected.
</P>
<P>
   But the maintenance company's lawyer, Kenneth Quinn of
Washington, said, ``I have no reason to believe that the
government, after an exhaustive three-year investigation, is going
to do anything other than indict, unless we can reach some kind of
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's any evidence of any willful or criminal
behavior connected to this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, a former general counsel of the Federal Aviation
Administration, said he believed that an indictment would hurt
future air safety investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the FBI and homicide detectives are going to show up on
site as they have in the TWA and Valujet cases,'' he said, ``I'm
sure any lawyer in their right mind would tell companies and
employees not to cooperate, without a guarantee of immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the safety board had also found fault with Valujet
and FAA inspectors and that if his clients were indicted, those
parties should be, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Steven Marks has represented the families of 28
passengers on the plane. ``We believe, based on the discovery we've
taken on the civil side,'' he said, ``that the conduct was of such
an egregious nature that it would justify a punitive damage
finding, which in Florida is essentially the equivalent to
manslaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five of the cases have been settled, Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the crash, Sabretech was a subsidiary of a
privately held St. Louis company, Sabreliner. The company closed
the Miami shop and re-opened in Orlando, Fla., but eventually
closed that, too, and a shop in Amarillo, Texas. Sabretech's assets
were sold to Aviation Management Systems Inc. of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Valujet renamed itself Airtran Airways. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: AFTER 4 YEARS, U.S. WOMEN SURVIVE ANOTHER DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ There was no room for error, not after nearly
four years of smarting. To earn their way back to the semifinals of
the Women's World Cup, the Americans had to survive dangerous
Germany, 3-2, Thursday night in the steamy casserole dish of Jack
Kent Cooke Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the part we love _ win or lose,'' Julie Foudy, the
loquacious midfielder, had said.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everything had been engineered for the Americans in
their home country. They had the easiest travel schedule, a fairly
logical meander toward the West Coast if they could win Thursday
night, while the Chinese had to put their twanging hamstrings in
airplanes for coast-to-coast treks.
</P>
<P>
   Even the official 1999 Women's World Cup video was a veritable
celebration of Yankeedom _ barely a reference to the perhaps
inconvenient, but certainly indisputable, fact that the Norwegians
are defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   Since they lost to Norway, 1-0, on an early and devastating goal
in the semifinals in Sweden in 1995, the American women had been
waiting to get back to the semifinals. They would have to win
Thursday night. There was no option of a tie, as there had been in
the three games of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendlies are nice,'' Foudy said about the long list of
international matches, ``but this is what the World Cup is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans made a stunning mistake in the fifth minute
Thursday night when Brandi Chastain made a bad pass past goalkeeper
Briana Scurry for an own goal and a 1-0 Germany lead.
</P>
<P>
   The wise old Michelle Akers moved forward as the American
offense launched into gear, and a hard shot was deflected to
Tiffeny Milbrett, who tied the score in the 16th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The home team was shocked again in the first minute of extra
time and a German oompah band played a rendition of ``Roll Out the
Barrel,'' its gusto fueled by 2-1 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain tied the score in the 49th minute, bellowing with what
looked like relief. Then Joy Fawcett, the most underrated of the
longtime regulars, nicked in an exquisite header in the 66th minute
to give the United States the lead and a berth in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of the game (followed by Brazil-Nigeria) was based
on four years of waiting _ maturation by the Chinese, retooling by
the Norwegians, tapping the national genius by the Brazilians. The
key phrase is ``four years.'' That is a long time to smart.
</P>
<P>
   Four years make the World Cup. Four years give it the bite, the
tension, the anticipation. In the eccentric little sport of
American football, a Super Bowl is played once every year, but it
somehow seems more frequent than that. In real football _ soccer _
four years go by for the big one. The rest of the world knows how
to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is, why would anybody want to tinker with this
system? Oddly enough, Joseph ``Sepp'' Blatter, the president of the
world soccer body, known as FIFA, has been making some rather
radical pronouncements about holding the men's (and by projection,
the women's) cups every two years, on the rather dubious assumption
that more is better.
</P>
<P>
   Revision cannot happen any too soon, so the men will hold their
next one in 2002 in Japan and South Korea, while the women will
have to wait until 2003, perhaps in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's game was held out in the suburbs rather than at
RFK Stadium in Washington, after RFK officials demanded the final
game or they would not participate. They should have understood
that FIFA has been fixated on the Rose Bowl since the huge crowds
at the 1984 Olympic tournament and the 1994 men's World Cup. When
the RFK people declined, the Cooke officials jumped right in _ and
Thursday night reaped the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was to operate with a downsized capacity of
41,110 Thursday night, but as the American women captivated
America, the demand for tickets grew, and officials opened the
upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was huge, and supportive, but the American players had
a tough assignment against the second-place finisher from the
strongest group in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, finalists in 1995, wear the same white and black,
or all green, uniforms as the German men's national team _ and are
also disciplined athletes who are never to be counted out of a
game. Like the Americans, they had been waiting four years to get
back. Four years is what makes this event so special. Why do we
have to keep reminding the soccer officials about this?

THROUGH RAIN AND GLOOM, GRAF DELIVERS VICTORY OVER WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The darker it got, and the longer it
dragged on, the more impassioned the Wimbledon quarterfinal between
Steffi Graf and Venus Williams became. Graf, the seven-time
champion, had a statement to make in her rain-infested contest with
Williams, the 19-year-old American whom Graf has deemed worthy to
inherit her mantle. But not until Graf is ready to relinquish it.
</P>
<P>
   So after seven hours and four rain delays, Graf grabbed a lethal
service break to lead 3-2 in the final set, then fended off three
break points to hold for 4-2. She wound up advancing to her 10th
career Wimbledon semifinal with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played unbelievable tennis, and that's what counts to me,''
Graf said. ``Everyone that came in the locker room _ you know,
Virginia Wade, Pam Shriver _ was saying it was an incredible match,
and that's how I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Graf used the occasion of her 22nd Grand Slam
victory last month at the French Open to announce her retirement
from that event. As for this one, her favorite, Graf hasn't yet
completed her mission and won't even if she wins here this year: an
eighth Wimbledon crown would leave her one major short of tying
Margaret Court's Grand Slam record of 24 singles titles. And while
Graf doesn't give the record books as much deference as Pete
Sampras does, she does crave another title at Wimbledon, which she
last won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Graf called this the most difficult quarterfinal she has ever
played, not only because it had to be played in fits and starts,
but also because Williams put up such a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the game,'' said Graf, whose formidable forehand and
hissing backhand slice didn't scare Williams. ``She got some balls
I thought were over.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American, third-seeded Lindsay Davenport, had a faster
outing. With a barrage of passing shots and heavy artillery from
the baseline, Davenport beat the defending champion, Jana Novotna,
in just 65 minutes, 6-3, 6-4, to achieve her first Wimbledon
semifinal. Davenport, who made her Grand Slam title breakthrough at
the 1998 U.S. Open, also put herself one victory away from
reclaiming the No. 1 ranking from Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grass-court game is getting better every year,'' said
Davenport, who is now 6-0 against Novotna, the stylish 30-year-old
Czech net-rusher. ``I think for some people today this is a huge
upset, and in some ways it is, but in other ways I knew I could do
it going out there. Did she play her best tennis? Probably not, but
maybe that was because I didn't let her.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna was realistic about the demise of her title defense:
``Every player has one player, a particular player that you don't
really like to play against, and in my case, Lindsay is that
player,'' she said, ``simply because she has a very good serve and
very powerful ground strokes, and I just get overpowered.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Williams didn't get overpowered by Graf, she was the
more uncomfortable performer when, at 7:30 p.m., the two were
summoned back onstage a final time with Graf on the verge of
holding serve to level the third set at 2-2. And then, in the fifth
game, when Williams netted a forehand that sent the game to deuce
instead of giving her a 3-2 lead, the teen-ager began to press. Her
forehand volley blooper gave Graf a break point, and the German
converted it with a vicious one-two forehand punch: the first shot
made a perfect diagonal and pulled Williams into the corner, and
though the American somehow managed to send a reply back across the
net, Graf was ready to intercept it with a pulverizing
down-the-line forehand.
</P>
<P>
   Too rattled to convert any of the three break points she held in
the next game, Williams, who watched replays of the unfinished
match during the rain delays, watched the match fade away with the
light.
</P>
<P>
   As camera flashbulbs flickered like fireflies in the Center
Court stands and the gloom was complicated by a light drizzle, Graf
served for the match. The marathon ended moments later when
Williams muscled a down-the-line forehand wide at 40-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have played better on some key points, been more
aggressive on break points, but time ran out,'' said Williams.
``I've played some pretty good matches and still lost, so this
definitely will go on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two women's quarterfinals failed to reach a resolution
by the time play was officially abandoned at 8:30 p.m. Their
contestants were doomed to spend the night in suspended animation
after spending most of the day in a vigil as they waited in vain
for the showers to pass.
</P>
<P>
   In a confrontation guaranteed to give Wimbledon's women's
semifinal round its first qualifier in tournament history,
86th-ranked Alexandra Stevenson, the San Diego teen-ager who turned
her back on a UCLA scholarship by turning professional here,
claimed the first set from 16-year-old Jelena Dokic of Australia,
6-3. But Dokic was up 5-1 and serving for the second set at 40-30
when their match was halted by darkness.
</P>
<P>
   In the other quarterfinal, last year's runner-up, Nathalie
Tauziat, led 17-year-old Mirjana Lucic, 6-4, 3-3. Three of the
eight women participating Thursday _ Lucic, Dokic and Stevenson _
were playing in their first Slam quarterfinals. Lucic upset Monica
Seles in the third round, and Dokic crafted a historic upset of
top-seeded Martina Hingis in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the men's quarterfinals got onto court, and neither
made significant progress: sixth-seeded Tim Henman led 38th-ranked
Cedric Pioline, 1-0, and second-seeded Patrick Rafter was locked up
at 3-3 against eighth-seeded Todd Martin. The 30-year-old Pioline,
a Frenchman who reached the final here in 1997, is the only
unseeded player left in men's quarters.
</P>
<P>
   With none of the men's quarterfinals decided and more stormy
weather predicted for Saturday, Wimbledon officials seemed resigned
to a women's final on Sunday: the men's and women's finals have not
shared the same day since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling committee hadn't yet contemplated the unwanted
contingency of a Monday men's final, a scenario last resorted to
when Stefan Edberg defeated Boris Becker in 1988.

TEXAS RULING MAY CLEAR WAY FOR NEW VOTE ON ANTI-AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
PROPOSITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: optional trim, optional ending included) 
 
By JULIE MASON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Texas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that
affirmative action foe Edward Blum is legally justified in
challenging the city's rewording of his November 1997 ballot
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The court also ruled that a state district court has the
authority to prevent the city from using vague and misleading
language, but cannot stop an election. The mixed decision could
clear the way for a new vote on the anti-affirmative action
proposition that voters rejected, thereby upholding Houston's
Minority and Women Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling returns the legal dispute back to state District
Judge Sharolyn Wood's court, where Wood, a Republican, threw out
the results of the Proposition A referendum in a preliminary ruling
last year that is not yet final. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In 1997, Blum collected more than 20,000 signatures on a
petition to place his measure on the ballot. The measure called for
abolishing the use of racial and gender preferences in granting
city contracts, using language almost identical to the 1964 federal
Civil Rights Act. Blum also based his language on California's
Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Bob Lanier, an affirmative action proponent, and City
Council rewrote the measure over Blum's strenuous objections so
that instead, it asked voters if Houston should end its affirmative
action program. Voters rejected the measure, 54 percent to 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this really means is the voters here in the city of
Houston are going to finally have the opportunity to vote on the
initiative that 20,000 people signed to end racial preferences and
end discrimination,'' Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Zummo, a lawyer for the city, said Blum and his
supporters are far from assured of a new election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I think the other side still has to prove the
rewording of the ballot language changed the outcome of the
election,'' Zummo said. ``They haven't done that, and until they do
that they aren't entitled to another election.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Lee Brown, whose election as the first black mayor aided
the defeat of the proposition because of record black voter
turnout, said in a statement issued late Thursday that he was
confident the contracting program would survive another election.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, our position has been that the ballot
language was clear and easily understandable, which is why the move
to eliminate affirmative action was defeated by Houston voters,''
Brown's statement said. ``With the majority of Houstonians
supporting us, I am certain that we will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the core issues at stake in the case remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled in Thursday's decision that Blum does have
legal standing to challenge the city's rewording of his ballot
proposition without ruling on the merits of his case. The court,
however, also noted the city has the authority to alter such ballot
language, but not to the extent that it misleads voters.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also ruled that a state district court has the
authority to prevent the city from using vague and misleading
ballot language, but not to stop an election.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the city's rewording is vague and misleading as Blum
contends is a matter for Wood's immediate consideration _ and the
judge has already ruled the wording on the ballot did not reflect
the intent of those who signed Blum's petition.
</P>
<P>
   If she enters a final order determining that the ballot measure
was vague and misleading, a new election on the measure could be
called.
</P>
<P>
   Two years before the election, Lanier and City Council
significantly strengthened the Minority and Women Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise program, which directs about 20 percent of the
city's $1 billion annual contracting program to qualified firms
owned by women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Blum, who is co-chairman of the Houston Civil Rights Initiative,
argued the city's program perpetuates discrimination by granting
preferential treatment for women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
The proposition originally submitted by Blum read: ``The city of
Houston shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential
treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex,
color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public
employment and public contracting.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lanier's urging and over Blum's objections, City Council
changed the wording to:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shall the charter of the city of Houston be amended to end the
use of affirmative action for women and minorities in the operation
of city of Houston employment and contracting, including ending the
current program and similar programs in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   Blum and his supporters immediately challenged the rewording in
the courts, touching off a legal odyssey on a range of issues that
include jurisdiction over election matters, proper legal standing
to pursue litigation, ballot rewording and the sanctity of election
results.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Tad Halbach in October 1997 rejected Blum's
attempt to block the referendum, siding instead with the city,
which argued that Halbach lacked jurisdiction on the matter until
after the election concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city also argued that Blum lacked legal standing
to pursue the case, an opinion that was subsequently affirmed by
the 14th Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court ruling overturned the
appellate court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Who has the final authority on the wording of a ballot
initiative remains unclear. The Texas Supreme Court opinion does
not address the merits of either Blum's or the city's version of
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In rewriting Blum's measure, Lanier contended that Blum's
original wording did not convey the true intent of the petition
drive and ballot initiative, which was to dismantle the city's
contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   Blum said he objects to inclusion of the phrase ``affirmative
action'' in the city's version of the ballot measure. Blum said
``affirmative action'' is a ``nebulous phrase'' without legal
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Wood has scheduled a hearing in the case for later this month,
and has yet to issue a final ruling in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Given the timing of the latest decision, it appears unlikely the
legal issues will be resolved in time for the matter to appear on
the upcoming Nov. 2 city elections, said Alan Magenheim, a lawyer
for Blum.
</P>
<P>
   But, Magenheim said, the justices' ruling should go far in
clarifying the rights of voters and elected officials in the arena
of initiative and referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city will now have to honor the wishes of voters and put
the language on the ballot significantly similar those offered by
the voters,'' Magenheim said. ``Although the Supreme Court's ruling
is not determinative of how a new election will turn out, it will
ensure the next election will be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a federal appeals court threw out a Houston
federal judge's order banning affirmative action contracting at the
Metropolitan Transit Authority. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled the issues surrounding the challenge to the program
by the Houston Contractors Association must be decided in a full
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's program, which is modeled on the city's, had been
halted by U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in a 1997 summary
judgment.

WILLIAM WHITELAW, 81, KEY AIDE TO THATCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Whitelaw, a key aide to his fellow Conservative Margaret
Thatcher while she was Britain's prime minister, died in his sleep
overnight, his family said Thursday. He was 81 and was long
associated with the town of Penrith in northwestern England.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Whitelaw had been ill for several months, the Press
Association, a British news agency, reported without saying where
he died and where he resided at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Known for most of his career as William Whitelaw, and often
called Willie, he was awarded a hereditary peerage in 1983 by Queen
Elizabeth II and became the first Viscount Whitelaw of Penrith in
the county of Cumbria.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, a Laborite, said Thursday: ``He was a
politician who commanded enormous respect from friend and foe
alike. He made a huge contribution to British public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitelaw was renowned as a political fixer on Mrs. Thatcher's
behalf. Also, as he put it once, ``I'm never an accelerator, but
I'm the best brake she has.'' He was a skilled political tactician
and served as deputy leader of the Conservative Party for 16 years.
He was sometimes called the last of the Conservative Party's
grandees and the person to whom Mrs. Thatcher always turned when a
crisis loomed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 and 1973 he was secretary of state for Northern Ireland
under another Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath. Whitelaw
managed to get a power-sharing pact put in place that was meant to
provide Northern Ireland's Roman Catholic minority a role in its
governance. But the project crumbled after a general strike by
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the earthy aspects of Whitelaw's work, he had elite
credentials: He was born in Edinburgh into a well-known Scottish
family and was an alumnus of the boarding school Winchester and of
Cambridge University. And he won a high decoration, the Military
Cross, for his prowess as an army major commanding tanks in World
War II. But he liked to describe himself as a farmer and a
landowner.
</P>
<P>
   Whitelaw was a Member of Parliament for a constituency including
Penrith, from 1955 to 1983 and was prominent in the House of
Parliament for a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party leader William Hague expressed a widely held
view Thursday when he said that Lord Whitelaw was ``one of the
towering figures of British politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Heath, he was also leader of the House of Commons. Under
Mrs. Thatcher he was home secretary, deputy prime minister and,
from 1983 to 1988, leader of the governing Conservative Party in
the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, after a slight stroke, he resigned as deputy prime
minister and from his leadership post in the House of Lords. Mrs.
Thatcher said at the time that she had a ``great sense of loss''
and ``because your well-being comes first, sadly I have no choice
but to accept your resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said then that the lack of Whitelaw's skill
at conciliating and compromising would be a grave loss for the
Thatcher government. And indeed, Mrs. Thatcher was ousted from the
prime ministership two years later by an uprising among
Conservative members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Whitelaw's survivors include his wife, the former Cecelia
Doriel, whom he married in 1943; and four daughters. There is no
heir to the viscountcy.

PENNSYLVANIA: GORE IS FOLLOWED BY AIDS PROTESTERS 
NEW YORK: FORBES PASSES THE HAT AMONG COMMON FOLK 
NEW HAMPSHIRE: CANDIDATES DELIVER LAUGH LINES AT GALA
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa., N.Y., N.H., N.J., Texas, Utah, Tenn.)  (jw) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has more than enough problems on the
campaign trail these days, what with the Republican front-runner,
George W. Bush, in front of him in the polls and fund-raising and
his only Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey,
beginning to pick up traction in the rear. Now add to that the
noisy AIDS protesters who have begun showing up at just about every
major campaign stop, more than 3,000 of them when Gore passed
through Philadelphia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Their complaint is that Gore, who frequently speaks out on
health issues, is the Clinton administration's point man when it
comes to helping the pharmaceutical industry make big money off of
AIDS drugs. ``Gore's greed kills!'' they chant when he begins to
speak or starts to work a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the protesters assert that Gore has done nothing
to make it easier for people with AIDS in Africa, most notably
those in hard-hit South Africa, to obtain AIDS drugs developed in
the United States. The protesters say the drugs are so expensive
that most African patients cannot afford them.
</P>
<P>
   They want Gore to take the lead in lowering the cost by
persuading U.S. drug companies to allow African companies with low
manufacturing overhead to make and sell AIDS drugs. They also want
him to persuade U.S. trade officials to drop opposition to South
African trade laws that pressure multinational American drug
manufacturers into making the drugs more available.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, aware that the issue could affect two important Democratic
constituencies, gay and black voters, insists that he is working
hard to find a solution to the problem. Shortly after the protests
began, he arranged for protest leaders to meet with White House
officials who work on AIDS issues.
</P>
<P>
   But he notes that the problem of drug costs is especially
complicated because patent and trade laws protect U.S. drug
companies, and he points out that the cost of developing new drugs
often accounts for a good part of their high price.
</P>
<P>
   After the Philadelphia demonstration, Gore issued a statement in
which he said he fully supported efforts to make new and cheaper
AIDS drugs available in Africa, so long as the efforts ``are done
in a way consistent with international agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders welcomed that statement but said the
demonstrations would continue until U.S. policy actually changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We await further movement,'' said one of the movement's
organizers, Eric Sawyer of New York.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES PASSES THE HAT AMONG COMMON FOLK
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1996, Steve Forbes spent $37.5 million of his personal
publishing fortune on his first run for the presidency. And he says
he is ready to do it again the second time around, if necessary,
which well may be the case given that he is still down in the
single digits in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Forbes is trying to raise some money the old-fashioned
way, too. Rather than write another personal check, he recently
held a $1,000-a-plate dinner in New York that pulled in more than
$1 million, and he has begun mass mailings that appeal for cash,
even if it is as little as $25.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble down at the bank?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, Forbes says.
</P>
<P>
   What he is trying to do, he explains, is build up grass-roots
involvement in his campaign and thereby demonstrate that
Forbes-for-President is not just a one-man movement or, to put it
more precisely, one rich man's movement. It is very important, he
says, to show that there is a solid base of people who are willing
to invest in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives credibility,'' he adds, noting that once people
contribute cash to a campaign they are likely to follow up by
voting for the recipient and, in many cases, will give a second and
third time and maybe even volunteer to do campaign work.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has a long way to go to match the $36.3 million that Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas raised over the past four months. But he is
nearing the $3 million mark, which is roughly average for most of
the Republican field.

   CANDIDATES DELIVER LAUGH LINES AT GALA
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire says it is determined to hold the first Election
2000 primary, even if it has to hold it in 1999. Maybe. Maybe not.
A lot of other states are jockeying to grab some of that
first-in-the-nation glory.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the New Hampshire primary's past, not its future,
that was the focus of a $500-a-plate gala on Wednesday night in
Washington to raise money for the Library and Archives of New
Hampshire's Political Tradition. The library, in the New Hampshire
capital, Concord, holds an extensive collection of election
campaign papers, buttons and other paraphernalia, some of it dating
back nearly 50 years to the earliest primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred political addicts showed up for the event,
including seven current White House hopefuls. Some of them,
including several never previously accused of being yuksters, got
off some lines that might not be prime archival material but
nevertheless provide some light insight into the kinds of people
who are running this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore on Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, brand new in
the race and given almost no chance of ever catching up:
</P>
<P>
   ``Orrin Hatch called to say he'd be late and we should start
without him. I think we already did.''
</P>
<P>
   More Al Gore, this time playing off an old Ronald Reagan primary
debate line and the fact that the gala was being held in a
taxpayer-financed building, and working in a play on a recent Gore
gaffe about inventing the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``So we can all say, `I paid for this microphone.' But I'm the
only one who can say I invented this microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, recalling the response
from a factory worker on a cigarette break who, upon learning that
Alexander was running for president, blew a mouthful of smoke at
him and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all we need, another president.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Smith, himself a New Hampshirite but thus far well
out of the running in money and the polls, offering a campaign
ditty:
</P>
<P>
   ``Single digits, no name ID, so say the polls. But there's many
more Smiths than Bushes and Doles.''

</P>
<P>
   GTE has sued five insurance companies seeking $400 million to
cover its spending on Year 2000 computer repairs and testing. It is
thought to be the first case to test whether insurers may be
compelled to pay for at least some of the tens of billions of
dollars that big companies are spending on Year 2000 repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits like GTE's for coverage of preventive repair work are

INS CAUGHT SERIAL-KILLING SUSPECT 12 TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Marisa Taylor and Steve Stein 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Angel Leoncio Reyes Resendiz, suspected of committing a
string of slayings, has been caught by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service at least 12 times since 1976, INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner acknowledged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Reyes, whom the FBI identifies by one of his aliases, Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez, wasn't detained for prosecution when he was last
apprehended in June because the INS computer database was not
complete and did not list all his apprehensions, she said.
Undocumented immigrants can be caught crossing the border up to
eight times in Santa Teresa, N.M., where he was apprehended, before
they are prosecuted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner, speaking at a Dallas news conference, defended her
agency's ability to apprehend undocumented immigrants suspected of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we look at a case like this, and it's horrifying
that somebody like this could exist and could be at large,''
Meissner said. ``My reaction was, `Did something fail here?' And I
want to know if it did, what it was and what can done about it so
it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Meissner requested the U.S. Justice Department's
Office of the Inspector General to investigate the Border Patrol's
last encounter with Reyes, which was June 2 in Santa Teresa, a
community near El Paso. He was released to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now can see, piecing various parts of the story together,
that he has been in our custody on numerous occasions,'' Meissner
said. ``Obviously, had we known that in Santa Teresa at the time,
we would have acted upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list in connection with
eight homicides, including five in Texas. The first slaying he is
suspected of committing was in 1997 in Kentucky, and the most
recent were two slayings June 15 in Illinois. Authorities believe
that Reyes has a history of riding rail cars across the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Teresa, Border Patrol agents do not keep undocumented
immigrants in custody for deportation until they have been caught
eight times, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crews in New
Mexico said most immigrants caught in Santa Teresa are not detained
for a deportation hearing until they have been caught 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   Crews would not explain the discrepancy other than to say the
practice is an internal policy matter.
</P>
<P>
   The policies regarding deportation vary from city to city,
federal officials said. In El Paso, immigrants are held for
deportation hearings after their fifth apprehension. In McAllen,
they are detained after their third apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Each Border Patrol sector is different, said George Garza, the
Border Patrol agent-in-charge of the McAllen station. ``In some
sectors, it might overload the court.''
</P>
<P>
   If undocumented immigrants have been formally deported in the
past, they are usually detained and prosecuted immediately, Crews
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reyes was formally deported three times between 1985 and
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The INS database, known as IDENT, has been criticized as flawed
because it is not directly linked to other federal, state and local
criminal databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS has spent more than $65 million on a system that does
not protect the public,'' U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio,
chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee, said during a news
conference Wednesday in Washington. ``The Border Patrol knows, too
late, about Resendez-Ramirez.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents say it takes time to research each case if they want more
details.
</P>
<P>
   The INS database is designed to enter each apprehended
immigrants' name, photograph and fingerprints. But in July 1997,
about 47 percent of the undocumented immigrants apprehended by
agents along the Southwest border were not entered in the database,
according to a report from the Justice Department's Office of the
Inspector General. The report also states that the INS did not
enter into the database that names of 59 percent of undocumented
immigrants deported in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The IDENT system has more than 400,000 criminal names of
undocumented immigrants and 85,000 of those have been apprehended
based on background checks, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IDENT system is a system that has worked very, very
effectively at the border,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration authorities have also been perplexed by the shifting
identities of Reyes, who has used several names. But INS officials
aren't sure why the system, including fingerprinting, didn't catch
his identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person has used a large number of aliases. There have
been very significant changes in his appearance,'' Meissner said.
``And so the systems that we have for checking this information
have contained information in various pieces, but it did not come
together as fully as it might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner was in Dallas to launch a Border Patrol recruiting
initiative. Because of difficulties in hiring enough Border Patrol
agents, INS has trained the best agents to recruit potential
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the news conference was focused almost entirely on Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Steps have been taken to catch the slaying suspect if he is ever
in the Border Patrol's grasp again, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI most-wanted list is now part of the INS' computer
database.
</P>
<P>
   A $125,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to
Reyes' arrest and conviction. Residents in Lexington, Ky., and in
the Texas towns of Weimer and West University Place have put up
$75,000 of the reward. The FBI is offering the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was born Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis in Izucar de
Matamoros, in the state of Puebla, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Don K. Clark, agent in charge of the Houston division of the
FBI, is heading the search for Reyes, code-named Operation Train
Stop. Several agencies are part of Operation Train Stop, including
Lexington, Ky., police and the Jackson County, Ill., Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The command center, which is staffed around the clock, has
received 4,000 calls since June 8. Calls to the command center have
resulted in what the FBI is describing as 1,500 ``good leads.''

ADVERTISING: COCKTAIL TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was quite a party for a regular Friday afternoon:
limbo dancers on Second Avenue, a steel-drum band and nonalcoholic
samples of Malibu Rum drinks like Malibu Conga Punch. Then, a lucky
few took specially equipped free ``fantasy buses'' to the Hamptons,
the trendy vacation area on eastern Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The event last week was one of several big promotions that
United Distillers &AMP; Vintners, the nation's largest liquor company,
and a unit of Diageo PLC, are creating this summer to tap into what
the company believes is a new willingness by consumers to try mixed
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it a return of the classic cocktail. Others link the
phenomenon to the new ``lounge culture,'' where swing music, 1960s
mod clothes and Rat Pack style are all the rage. Still others
credit weightier factors like a strong economy and a growing
population of people turning 21, the legal drinking age.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the liquor industry is celebrating the
trend with a wide range of promotions for special cocktails,
ranging from classics like the Canadian Mist Fizz to the more
unusual Baileys Mudslide or the Chocolate Martini. And to get
consumers' attention without the benefit of television advertising
_ which most liquor marketers for various reasons still do not use
_companies use everything from zany ideas like Malibu's ``Limbo for
Your Lunch'' to Internet advertising and promotional partnerships
with radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to be able to get directly to consumers to
try our brands,'' said Derek Blackburn, United Distillers' vice
president for customer marketing in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   For many brands, summer is a key time to create promotional buzz
about a drink because people are out more at bars and restaurants,
especially the young and image-conscious whose word-of-mouth can
make a new cocktail a hit.
</P>
<P>
   For Jose Cuervo Tequila, United Distillers is introducing a
Cuervo Nation Bus tour. A bus covered in Jose Cuervo graphics and
carrying a Cuervo Crew that will distribute free Cuervo merchandise
to consumers, will visit key markets in the Northeast. All stops
will be announced on radio and in Internet advertising. United
Distillers is also giving away free trips to its Cuervo Nation, a
small Caribbean island that it owns for promotional reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Baileys Original Irish Cream _ best known as a winter drink _ is
pushing frozen and iced drinks like the Baileys Mudslide and
Baileys Iced Capuccino, using a sweepstakes and bar events that
include taking digital photos of customers and then sending them
via e-mail. To get attention, Baileys also plans to place carved
ice furniture one hot day in a strategic location in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   While each actual promotion reaches just a few hundred people
personally, the idea is to get the word out with image makers and
bartenders about a ``hot'' drink. Literally dozens of drinks have
become popular via word-of-mouth over the years, whether it was
Corona Extra Beer, the Fuzzy Navel of the 1980s or today's
Cosmopolitan, a new twist on the martini.
</P>
<P>
   ``For drinks marketers it's important to get the trade behind a
new recipe or product,'' said David Ross, managing editor of Market
Watch, an industry magazine. ``And you have to get out there using
the old-fashioned shoe leather. Building a brand takes a lot of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hoopla is hype. Still, statistics do show evidence
that cocktails are making something of a comeback. After years of
declining volume, liquor consumption is up _ albeit slightly _ to a
total of 335.8 million gallons in 1998, a rise of just under 2
percent, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, a
Washington-based trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The industry had been in decline since 1981, because of growing
anti-alcohol sentiment, the fitness craze and a decline in the
number of young people. It bottomed out in 1995 at 326.7 million
gallons from a high of 449.5 million gallons in 1981, the spirits
council said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, prognosticators say volume will continue to grow for at
least several more years largely because of the ``echo boom,'' the
children of baby boomers who are now turning legal drinking age.
Frank Walters, Market Watch director of research, said his research
showed a direct correlation between a sharp rise in the number of
people turning legal drinking age and growth in the industry. In
fact, the last time he saw such growth was in the 1970s when the
largest number of baby boomers reached the legal drinking age.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Forman Corp., based in Louisville, Ky., said it was trying
to reach the young adult market through capitalizing on the retro
``lounge culture'' by distributing three swing music CDs with
750-milliliter bottles of Canadian Mist Whisky, the nation's
top-selling whisky import. Included with the CD is a packet of
drink recipes that include classics like the Manhattan and the
Whisky Sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical to refresh the consumer category again and again
because 25-year-olds have a way of turning 35,'' said Dan Kelley,
Canadian Mist's vice president-brand general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Forman may have a tough sell. While so-called white goods
like vodka and rum are enjoying growth and lifting the overall
market, brown goods like bourbon and whisky are generally still
experiencing sluggish sales volume. One reason: Some say brown
goods are tougher to drink because they are an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   Still, younger people do seem to like the accouterments
surrounding cocktails _ the stirrer, the shaker, the special
glassware.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has played a part in the return of the classic cocktail
which has been ongoing for some years,'' said Jim Schleifer,
Absolut's marketing director at Seagram Americas in New York.
``It's the whole ambience of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mott's Inc., the juice company that also makes cocktail mixers
like Roses Lime Juice, said its research found a whole `cocktail
culture' of mostly 20- and 30-something people who enjoy the ritual
of mixing drinks, but prefer a lighter taste than some of the
classics. That insight led the company, a unit of Cadbury Schweppes
PLC, to develop Austin Powers' Shagadelic Shakers, premixed
nonalcoholic drinks in individual plastic shakers that re-create
the sound and feeling of a bar shaker once ice is added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big insight was that cocktails have made a big comeback,
but that cocktails have changed,'' said Mike Judlowe, Mott's vice
president for marketing. ``The economy is good, people are older,
and people are drinking _ like anything else it's cyclical.''

   A court convicted Gen. Manuel Noriega and his wife in absentia
of laundering $2.7 million in drug profits through French banks for
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel in 1988 and 1989, before a U.S.
invasion ended his dictatorial rule in Panama. Noriega, who was
decorated as a commander of the Legion of Honor in France in 1987,
is now serving a prison sentence in Florida on a money-laundering
conviction. His wife's whereabouts are unknown. The French court
gave them both 10-year jail sentences and ordered them to pay $33
million in fines.

   Absentee parents who fail to pay child support have been told
they face tough new punishments. Alistair Darling, the Social

AW-SHUCKS: NOLAN RYAN SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ As his date with baseball immortality neared,
Nolan Ryan was at his down-home, everyman best yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of shuck-and-jive athletes, the humble Ryan is still
100 percent aw-shucks.
</P>
<P>
   So what can you say after a career that spanned 27 seasons and
included 324 victories? What can you say about a work ledger that
listed seven no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts?
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask Nolan. He confessed yesterday that he hasn't yet
prepared his July 25 Hall of Fame acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, I'm not a speech giver,'' Ryan said with a
country blush.
</P>
<P>
   He has been informed that some previous Hall of Fame inductees
have taken as long as a full hour to render their words of
acceptance. That news seemed to pain Nolan beyond Advil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think mine, then, will be somewhere between two
minutes and an hour ... probably closer to the two minutes,'' Ryan
assessed.
</P>
<P>
   The midday news conference at The Ballpark in Arlington was
called to give the media one last chance to visit with Ryan before
he heads for Cooperstown, N.Y., for the induction. There were no
groundbreaking pronouncements _ Ruth Ryan's husband is not what
you'd call a rolling barrel of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   And it was no shock that current Rangers management plans to
honor Ryan with a weekend of festivities during the July 30-Aug. 1
Kansas City series. Nearly six years since he threw his last pitch,
in other words, Nolan is still filling seats for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes get a day named in their honor. But Arlington
Mayor Elzie Odom has proclaimed it Nolan Ryan Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, he is still citizen Ryan. Rancher, banker,
father, ex-ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that one of the nicer things about finally being
selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame is that he no longer has to
wince every time somebody introduces him as a ``future Hall of
Famer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never comfortable with that,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan recalled yesterday that he never even gave the milestone
much thought until he heard former Houston teammate Don Sutton
talking about a goal of reaching 300 wins. Sutton pointed out that
no pitcher with 300 or more career victories has ever been denied a
place in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never thought of that before,'' said Ryan, who himself
was approaching 250 wins at the time.
</P>
<P>
   No. Nolan Ryan has never had a gold necklace that read, ``Future
Hall of Famer.'' Or ``7 No-Hitters.'' Or even a bumper sticker that
rightfully proclaimed, ``I whupped Robin Ventura's butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Not his style. The beauty of Nolan Ryan is that, for the most
part, he has no style. No pretenses. No flash.
</P>
<P>
   The headlock he put on Ventura in August 1993, was an episode
that Ryan said ``embarrassed me when it happened.'' He was
surprised to learn later that ``there was a generation that sort of
felt I represented something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' Nolan said, blushing again, ``that when I was an
active player, I didn't realize that so many people looked at me as
a relic.''
</P>
<P>
   We knew better, of course. Ryan was 42 when he joined the
Rangers before the 1989 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to be here for one year,'' he repeated yesterday.
``I ended up playing for five.''
</P>
<P>
   He was destined to be a Hall of Famer even before he arrived
here. But it was in those five seasons that Ryan ascended to the
ranks of folk hero and legend. It remains a sad footnote that he
never got to pitch in The Ballpark in Arlington, retiring six
months before it opened.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in so many ways, The Ballpark is The House That Nolan Ryan
Built. His signing in 1989 filled seats and stirred long-suffering
fans' hopes. Suddenly, after Ryan was a Ranger, it was fashionable
to go watch the Rangers play again.
</P>
<P>
   Without Nolan, maybe there would have been no Ballpark in
Arlington yet. With no Nolan, the Rangers today might be a prairie
version of the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Ryan was able to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame to be
briefed on what lay ahead. Museum officials even showed him where
his own plaque would hang.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that quiet personal tour that Nolan admitted it all
began to sink in. He saw the scroll of all-time pitching leaders in
victories (324) and strikeouts (5,714) and felt humbled to see his
name listed so high.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan saw the museum's impressive display of no-hitters, and then
realized that, with seven, he merited a display case all his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a neat feeling,'' Nolan said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect much more oratory than that when the great day
arrives in Cooperstown later this month. Speeches, as he reminded
yesterday, are not his thing.
</P>
<P>
   As local relics go, he was the best there ever was.
</P>
<P>
   One last road trip, Nolan Ryan. It was five years that we won't
ever forget.

INS CAUGHT SERIAL-KILLING SUSPECT 12 TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: Adds information in second graf on apprehensions since 1998) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARISA TAYLOR and STEVE STEIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Angel Leoncio Reyes Resendiz, suspected of committing a
string of slayings, has been caught by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service at least 12 times since 1976, INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner acknowledged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Reyes, whom the FBI identifies by one of his aliases, Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez, wasn't detained for prosecution when he was last
apprehended in June because the INS computer database was not
complete and did not list all his apprehensions, she said. Reyes
has been apprehended at least eight times since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Undocumented immigrants can be caught crossing the border up to
eight times in Santa Teresa, N.M., where Reyes was apprehended,
before they are prosecuted, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner, speaking at a Dallas news conference, defended her
agency's ability to apprehend undocumented immigrants suspected of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we look at a case like this, and it's horrifying
that somebody like this could exist and could be at large,''
Meissner said. ``My reaction was, `Did something fail here?' And I
want to know if it did, what it was and what can done about it so
it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Meissner requested the U.S. Justice Department's
Office of the Inspector General to investigate the Border Patrol's
last encounter with Reyes, which was June 2 in Santa Teresa, a
community near El Paso. He was released to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now can see, piecing various parts of the story together,
that he has been in our custody on numerous occasions,'' Meissner
said. ``Obviously, had we known that in Santa Teresa at the time,
we would have acted upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list in connection with
eight homicides, including five in Texas. The first slaying he is
suspected of committing was in 1997 in Kentucky, and the most
recent were two slayings June 15 in Illinois. Authorities believe
that Reyes has a history of riding rail cars across the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Teresa, Border Patrol agents do not keep undocumented
immigrants in custody for deportation until they have been caught
eight times, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crews in New
Mexico said most immigrants caught in Santa Teresa are not detained
for a deportation hearing until they have been caught 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   Crews would not explain the discrepancy other than to say the
practice is an internal policy matter.
</P>
<P>
   The policies regarding deportation vary from city to city,
federal officials said. In El Paso, immigrants are held for
deportation hearings after their fifth apprehension. In McAllen,
they are detained after their third apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Each Border Patrol sector is different, said George Garza, the
Border Patrol agent-in-charge of the McAllen station. ``In some
sectors, it might overload the court.''
</P>
<P>
   If undocumented immigrants have been formally deported in the
past, they are usually detained and prosecuted immediately, Crews
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reyes was formally deported three times between 1985 and
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The INS database, known as IDENT, has been criticized as flawed
because it is not directly linked to other federal, state and local
criminal databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS has spent more than $65 million on a system that does
not protect the public,'' U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio,
chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee, said during a news
conference Wednesday in Washington. ``The Border Patrol knows, too
late, about Resendez-Ramirez.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents say it takes time to research each case if they want more
details.
</P>
<P>
   The INS database is designed to enter each apprehended
immigrants' name, photograph and fingerprints. But in July 1997,
about 47 percent of the undocumented immigrants apprehended by
agents along the Southwest border were not entered in the database,
according to a report from the Justice Department's Office of the
Inspector General. The report also states that the INS did not
enter into the database that names of 59 percent of undocumented
immigrants deported in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The IDENT system has more than 400,000 criminal names of
undocumented immigrants and 85,000 of those have been apprehended
based on background checks, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IDENT system is a system that has worked very, very
effectively at the border,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration authorities have also been perplexed by the shifting
identities of Reyes, who has used several names. But INS officials
aren't sure why the system, including fingerprinting, didn't catch
his identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person has used a large number of aliases. There have
been very significant changes in his appearance,'' Meissner said.
``And so the systems that we have for checking this information
have contained information in various pieces, but it did not come
together as fully as it might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner was in Dallas to launch a Border Patrol recruiting
initiative. Because of difficulties in hiring enough Border Patrol
agents, INS has trained the best agents to recruit potential
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the news conference was focused almost entirely on Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Steps have been taken to catch the slaying suspect if he is ever
in the Border Patrol's grasp again, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI most-wanted list is now part of the INS' computer
database.
</P>
<P>
   A $125,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to
Reyes' arrest and conviction. Residents in Lexington, Ky., and in
the Texas towns of Weimer and West University Place have put up
$75,000 of the reward. The FBI is offering the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was born Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis in Izucar de
Matamoros, in the state of Puebla, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Don K. Clark, agent in charge of the Houston division of the
FBI, is heading the search for Reyes, code-named Operation Train
Stop. Several agencies are part of Operation Train Stop, including
Lexington, Ky., police and the Jackson County, Ill., Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The command center, which is staffed around the clock, has
received 4,000 calls since June 8. Calls to the command center have
resulted in what the FBI is describing as 1,500 ``good leads.''
</P>
<P>
   The toll-free telephone number at the command center is (800)
889-8161.

PEDRO MARTINEZ CHASING 30 WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tommy Lasorda said it. You can look it up.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19, 1993, he lauded the acquisition of Delino DeShields
by declaring, ``As an everyday player we feel he will be more
valuable to us than the relief pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The relief pitcher Lasorda was alluding to was Pedro Martinez.
Six years later, the mere mention of the name is enough to make a
grown Los Angeles Dodgers fan cry.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers' blue chippers falter, Martinez's stock has
taken off like one of his 95 mph fastballs. Over the past few
years, Martinez's right arm has outperformed Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny kid with the wild control that Lasorda and the
Dodgers unloaded went to Montreal, became a starter and, three
years later, a Cy Young Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   He was part of another transaction, in the winter of 1997, and
wound up in Boston where he won a second Cy Young in 1998. This
year he's tracking Denny McLain the way Mark McGwire did Roger
Maris last summer.
</P>
<P>
   If a broker misgauged a commodity as badly as did Lasorda, you'd
hand over what's left of your portfolio to somebody else. The
Dodgers not only have stuck with Lasorda, they're having him scout
talent.
</P>
<P>
   And people wonder why the Dodgers are getting such horrible
returns on their payroll dollars?
</P>
<P>
   Before Kevin Brown and Mo Vaughn and Mike Piazza, Martinez was
the highest-paid player in baseball. The Red Sox shelled out $75
million over six years for his services. It's looking like a
brilliant investment, what with Martinez posting a record of 19-7
in 33 starts in 1998 and starting this season 14-2.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old will try to collect his 15th win tonight, at
Chicago. Fifteen wins would bring Martinez halfway to immortality.
Since 1930, only three major-leaguers have reached the 30-win
milestone in a season. The last to do it was Detroit's McLain in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   A victory tonight would put Martinez ahead of McLain's madcap
pace. McLain, who was 24 in 1968, notched his 15th win on July 3.
Appearing regularly on three days' rest, he made 41 starts and
finished 31-6.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, like most pitchers of this era, will be blessed to get
34 starts. So in shooting for McLain's mark he has even less room
for error than when he's aiming for today's postage stamp-sized
strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's not that wild of a pitch, casting Martinez in the
company of McLain and Dizzy Dean and Lefty Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ex-Tigers right-hander, Martinez is getting tremendous
bat support. The Tigers averaged seven runs in games McLain
pitched. The Red Sox are averaging 5.5 with Martinez on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty wins belongs on the Mount Rushmore of baseball
milestones, alongside batting .400 and hitting safely in 56
straight games and slugging 70 home runs. They're all feats that
would seem utterly impossible if not for the fact somebody had gone
and set them in stone.
</P>
<P>
   McLain seemed an unlikely character to carve out a piece of
history. ``The kid never seemed to care enough,'' Bill Rigney once
said of the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   No question, McLain was the Dennis Rodman of his day. He was as
hard to read as his slider. His hair color alternated between red
and blond. He drank Pepsis by the case. He played the organ as
sweetly as Nancy Bea Hefley.
</P>
<P>
   He jetted to Vegas whenever the West Coast schedule permitted.
He loved to gamble. (The addiction would end his career in 1970 and
send his life in a spiral that ultimately landed him in prison.)
One writer in 1968 described him as ``a cigar-chomping, oral
compulsive.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, McLain liked to talk. His mouth got him into
trouble in 1968. The two-time Cy Young winner made the mistake of
telling a visiting writer that the fans in Detroit ``are the worst
I've ever seen anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Next thing the pitcher knew, one fan had placed a smoke bomb in
his car. Luckily for McLain, it malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   You should know the fans target Martinez's car, too. They
bombard it every time he tries to drive away from Fenway, pledging
their love and pleading for more autographs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the man poised to be the next McLain couldn't be more
different than him.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is so quiet, he slipped out of the clubhouse last
weekend before reporters could ask him about his outing against the
White Sox. In his place he left a handwritten note that said, ``I
felt good, physically and mentally. The day belongs to my teammates
for their offensive production. Thank-you. Love, Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after Martinez struck out 16 batters on the way to a
6-4 win over Atlanta, he gave all the credit to his catcher for
calling the right pitches. Whatever the reason, he has done little
wrong this season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is averaging 112.9 pitches per outing and he has 165
strikeouts, both of which are league highs.
</P>
<P>
   And Lasorda thought Martinez wasn't strong enough to survive in
the big leagues?
</P>
<P>
   If you ask us, ex-Dodger Brett Butler called it right when, on
the day Martinez was jettisoned to Montreal, he said, ``I'm blown
away that they traded probably one of the best pitchers we had on
the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of a bear market for the Dodgers, though it
would be a few years before the rest of us would get wise to it.

RANDOLPH GUGGENHEIMER, 91; SAVED COMMUNITY HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Randolph Guggenheimer, a Manhattan lawyer who helped
spearhead the development of a community hospital serving the
residents of Harlem, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hospital for Joint Diseases moved from Madison Avenue
and 124th Street in 1979, Guggenheimer and Eugene L. McCabe, a
management consultant, worked together to insure that hospital
services would continue in the old building, which was renamed
North General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheimer had been a board member of the Hospital for Joint
Diseases, but he opposed the decision to move because he believed
very strongly that Harlem needed a hospital. ``I thought, `I'm a
New Yorker, I was born in New York, I love the city, and there is
nothing there but Harlem Hospital, which is insufficient,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial crises threatened North General's existence several
times, and at one early point, the National Health and Human
Services Employees Union asked its members to continue working
despite a missed pay period. McCabe and Guggenheimer recruited
public officials, philanthropists, bankers, leaders of major
medical institutions and local businessmen to take care of the
foundering hospital's unpaid bills and to raise both money and
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Both Guggenheimer _ who served as the hospital's only trustee
for a time _ and McCabe were tireless in pursuing funds, and helped
to engineer a New York state bond issue of $150 million for a new
building that would serve the impoverished and medically deprived
area. At the time, many small community hospitals, overwhelmed with
the unexpected demands of AIDS patients and crack addicts, were
being closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make financial sense,'' said Mario Cuomo, who as
governor of New York approved many of the grants and loans to build
North General. Cuomo described the hospital's creation as ``a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The state called the rebuilding of the hospital ``the largest
public-private construction project in the history of Harlem.'' In
1991, the new 200-bed North General, the only minority-operated
hospital in the state, opened its doors at Madison Avenue between
121st and 122d Streets. The nonprofit hospital specializes in
treatment for diabetes, cancer and hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, the institution added 300 units of
condominium housing for low- and middle-income residents of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Both Guggenheimer and McCabe took pride in the fact that the new
building was completed for some $15 million less than the amount of
their state bond financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we called up the state and asked what we should do with
the surplus money, they didn't know what to say,'' Guggenheimer
once recalled. ``It had never happened before. They finally told us
to keep it to avoid complications.'' The money was used to build an
annex.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe was president of the hospital and Guggenheimer was board
chairman, a position he held for some years. He maintained an
office in the hospital until his death. An annual award in his name
was established by the trustees in 1998, to be given to a member of
the hospital staff for excellence in community service.
Guggenheimer received the United Hospital Annual Distinguished
Trustee of the Year award and, in 1991, was honored by Mayor David
Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe died of cancer at the age of 61 in September 1998,
</P>
<P>
   In his dedication to Harlem, Guggenheimer followed the example
of his mother, Minna Schafer Guggenheimer, who from 1918 to 1964
produced the annual summer concerts at Lewisohn Stadium on the City
College campus. The concert series was a diamond in the New York
cultural scene for years, bringing major performers to the
neighborhood at admission fees of less than a dollar. Lewisohn
Stadium was torn down in 1966, two years after Mrs. Guggenheimer's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Guggenheimer was born in Manhattan on Nov. 14, 1907.
His father, Charles S. Guggenheimer, was a partner in Guggenheimer
&AMP; Untermyer, a law firm his own father had founded.
</P>
<P>
   Minna Guggenheimer, a philanthropist known to New Yorkers as
Minnie, raised money, engaged artists and handled negotiations for
the stadium concerts. She attended most of them, and was famous for
her informality and completely uninhibited intermission speeches.
On one occasion, a royal guest got lost and wandered into the wings
as he was about to be introduced. Mrs. Guggenheimer chased after
him, yelling, ``Here, Prince! Here, Prince!''
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheimer was educated at the Morristown Preparatory Academy
in New Jersey and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale
University in 1928. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1931,
joined the family law firm and later became a partner. In 1932 he
married the former Elinor Coleman. She has been a member of the
City Planning Commission and commissioner of consumer affairs, and
was a founder of several national and international women's
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheimer enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1942 and served
as executive officer of a fighter squadron in Europe during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, he was active in a number of organizations,
including the Jewish Child Care Association and the Mount Sinai
Hospital School of Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Charles and
Randolph Jr., and a sister, Sophie Untermeyer, all of Manhattan,
three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: MASTER PLAN FOR THE EVERGLADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Thursday delivered to Congress a detailed
blueprint for the most ambitious environmental restoration project
ever undertaken in this country. The plan's basic purpose is to
restore the historical flows of fresh water that once made the
Everglades one of the world's most wondrous and biologically
diverse ecosystems. It is the product of six years of work by the
Army Corps of Engineers, scientists and environmentalists. But its
fate, and that of the Everglades, now rests with legislators in
Washington and Tallahassee. It is they who must provide the money _
nearly $8 billion over 20 years, shared equally between the federal
government and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That seems a lot, but then again, Congress owes the Everglades a
lot. Fifty-plus years ago, following back-to-back hurricanes that
put much of South Florida under water, Congress ordered the corps
to drain a half-million acres south of Lake Okeechobee with a vast
web of levees, canals and pumping stations. This massive project
kept Florida's booming east coast free from floods and safe for
development, and provided the rich soil for the state's sugar cane
industry. But it blocked the southerly movement of clean water,
drying up the Everglades, killing off much of the area's fabled
wildlife and degrading the rich fishing grounds of Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The corps now hopes to set things right by recapturing and
rerouting most of the fresh water that is now wastefully flushed
out to sea _ 1.7 billion gallons every day. Its design includes
reservoirs to store the water, new canals to direct it southward,
artificial marshes to filter pollution from the cities and farms,
and the purchase of land to create buffer zones between people and
nature. The new system would also provide a secure supply of
drinking water for South Florida's exploding population.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is much improved over December's preliminary version,
thanks mainly to pressure from environmental groups, timely
intervention by senior officials at the Interior Department and the
White House, and the open-mindedness of Michael Davis, who oversees
the Corps of Engineers. The original plan favored the projected
needs of Florida's cities. The final plan is not perfect and will
require careful scientific monitoring to make the necessary
adjustments down the line. But it greatly increases water flows to
the Everglades, gives priority to projects that will help the
ecosystem and contains a written guarantee that nature will come
first during the life of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Financing the project will require a serious political
commitment from Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, who must master a
state legislature that often pays more attention to special
interests than to the interests of the Everglades. It will also
require help from Congress, which until last year had generously
underwritten engineering and land acquisition projects begun in
anticipation of the corps' comprehensive plan. But along with many
other federal programs, Everglades-related initiatives are now
being squeezed to meet Congression-ally mandated budget caps _ caps
that seem increasingly nonsensical in view of the projected budget
surpluses. Congress needs to think again. What is at risk here is
an extraordinary and irreplaceable national asset that happens to
be dying. Preserving and protecting it could serve as a model to
the world.  &QL;

QUOTING GOTTI'S FATHER, PROSECUTORS SEEK LONGER TERM FOR SON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (rk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors asked a judge Thursday to impose
the maximum possible prison sentence of more than seven years on
John A. Gotti, citing his refusal to admit that he was the acting
boss of the Gambino crime family and his failure to meet a deadline
for paying a $750,000 fine after his racketeering and extortion
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In April, on the eve of his trial, which could have led to a
sentence of 20 years, Gotti, 35, pleaded guilty to reduced charges
and faced a term ranging from 6 years and 10 months to 7 years and
3 months. Federal prosecutors detailed their reasons for requesting
the maximum term in a pre-sentencing memorandum laced with
sarcastic references to Gotti's reluctance to acknowledge the
existence of the Gambino organization or to concede that his
father, John J. Gotti, was the previous boss of the family.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum disclosed that John J. Gotti, 58, criticized his
son's lack of leadership. In 1991, the elder Gotti was sentenced to
life in prison without parole on federal murder and racketeering
charges, including being the boss of the Gambino family, said by
prosecutors to be the nation's second-largest Mafia group.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 29, 1998, three weeks after JohnA. Gotti, who is known
as Junior, was indicted, his father expressed disappointment with
his son's judgment and conduct. The elder Gotti made the remarks in
a conversation with his daughter, Victoria Gotti Agnello, and his
brother, Peter, at the Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Ill. All of
Gotti's prison visits are tape-recorded by prison authorities with
his knowledge, and a transcript of parts of the conversation were
made public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Gotti, the prosecutors said in the memorandum, was
dismayed that his son had delegated to subordinates ``ministerial
tasks'' that he should have undertaken as the acting boss of the
Gambino family. The prosecutors supported their assertions by
noting that in the 1998 conversation, the elder Gotti asked, ``Why
do you need all these butlers and waiters for?''
</P>
<P>
   In the same conversation, according to a transcript, John J.
Gotti said he was stunned to learn that investigators, in a raid on
one of his son's offices in Queens, had found $358,000 in cash, a
promotion list of names that prosecutors said were new Mafia
members and an unregistered handgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what he gives them to hang their hat on,'' the elder
Gotti is quoted in the transcript. ``Funny money in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same conversation, Gotti said his son should have placed
the money in a safe deposit box or in the care of a lawyer and
should not have kept the list of names.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to contentions by the younger Gotti's
lawyers that he had been indicted because of his father's
conviction as a Mafia leader, the elder Gotti is quoted as saying:
``You can't blame it on last names.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum from Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in the
Southern District, was sent to Barrington D. Parker Jr., a federal
district court judge in White Plains who will sentence Gotti on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, the prosecutors said, in pleading guilty to a charge of
being the head of a criminal enterprise, ``did not acknowledge that
the enterprise in question was the Gambino crime family.''
According to law enforcement officials, the elder Gotti has banned
Gambino family members who plead guilty from admitting they belong
to the Mafia group.

BAVASI ISN'T HITTING PANIC BUTTON _ YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Bill Bavasi can't say it because it would make him
look desperate and hurt his leverage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Anaheim Angels general manager must make a trade, and he
knows it. If he needs confirmation, he can look no further than the
past three days, when the Angels were swept by the AL West-leading
Rangers by a combined score of 32-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we feel an urgency?'' Bavasi asked. ``Yeah, we all do. Mo
(Vaughn) feels an urgency to drive in runs. Chuck (Finley) feels an
urgency to get outs. I feel an urgency to help the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to lose my mind and do something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent stretch when they won six of seven games, the
Angels are struggling. Their pitching has held up so far, but now
starter Tim Belcher (broken finger) is out and Ken Hill (sore
elbow) could join him on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   With outfielders Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds out indefinitely and
recovering from injuries, the Angels offense has been embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   They rank last in the American League in runs, doubles, triples,
RBI, walks, stolen bases, slugging percentage and on-base
percentage. Vaughn leads the team in homers (16) and RBI (49), but
he hasn't had a hit since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking for pitching _ right now our hunt is more for
offense,'' Bavasi said. ``Belcher's injury has adjusted that some,
but by and large, we still have to follow what we're doing at the
moment, which is address the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   What then? Whom can the Angels obtain? Which team is willing to
get serious with the Angels?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can find somebody else just as urgent, then ...,'' Bavasi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, how about the Dodgers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to Kevin (Malone, Dodgers GM) a lot,'' Bavasi said.
``Kevin started here (with the Angels organization). We had a great
time together. I know he's frustrated too. These are tough times
for them. He'll do the right thing. He won't panic. He'll make the
right moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels don't have much at the major-league level they'd be
willing to trade, so they would have to include prospects. But even
the minor-league system is thin, with the top prospects deemed
untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an excess to move, so we have to be creative,''
Bavasi said. ``But we're not going to alter what we've got going
(in the minors).''
</P>
<P>
   That could change if the Angels make a dramatic turnaround in
the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get to the trading deadline (July 31) with a clear
chance to win, then we'll discuss it,'' he said. ``But we're not
there now. The kids here are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to published reports, the New York Yankees and
Cleveland Indians have not asked Bavasi about Finley. But if the
Angels fall further out of the race, that will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll leave it up to him,'' Bavasi said. ``If he becomes
available, I won't get much sleep.''

EDITORIAL: ALBANY'S VACATION FROM INACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   New York's state government has taken gridlock to a new level.
Budgets in Albany used to be delayed until some other critical
deadline forced an agreement. But now even those triggers are not
enough to make things work. On Wednesday night, cuts in the state
Medicaid program lapsed, sticking the state and localities with
tens of millions of dollars in unexpected bills. Protections for
New York City loft tenants expired, terrifying many long-term
residents with limited incomes. But nothing happened. The
Legislature went away for a vacation and a ``cooling off'' period.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gov. George Pataki's staff sometimes jokes that the
state would save money running on emergency appropriations forever,
these delays are unsupportable. In New York City, the schools are
playing a dangerous but unavoidable game by presuming that money
for new prekindergarten programs and reduced-size classes in
September will eventually be approved, and risking financial
catastrophe if it is not. Other school districts are trying to
prepare their tax bills in a void.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the Legislature and Pataki seemed to have reached the
point that a more functional government would have got to in early
spring. A final budget agreement seemed near, perhaps in time to
break the logjam and pass other critical time-sensitive
legislation. But talks collapsed over the issue of Medicaid. The
Legislature had approved rather stiff cuts in the state's
reimbursement program to hospitals and nursing homes in 1995, and
Pataki had proposed new economies this year. The state's largest
hospital workers' union, led by Dennis Rivera, has been running
harsh ads against Pataki, portraying him as an enemy of the old and
the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The state should not be making a new assault on the health care
system at a time when New York's hospitals are already under siege
by the federal government and HMOs. Pataki may have already given
up on his new cost-cutting agenda. But if he has not, he should do
so quickly. The Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, is
pressing for an end to the old cuts as well. He should not try to
turn back the clock. Controlling Medicaid costs has always been
important in a state where the bill for treating the health care
needs of the poor is enormous and ever-expanding.
</P>
<P>
   But if it takes some reasonable concessions to get a budget deal
done, Pataki should compromise as a gesture of good will. Right now
the old cuts have expired anyway, pleasing the hospitals but
burdening the state with $82 million in unexpected costs over the
next three months alone. Local governments will have to pay about
$50 million extra. The meter is running.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping the pay of state legislators when they fail to pass a
budget on time does not seem to have worked. They have not got
their salaries since April, but most of them seem more cranky than
cowed. Pataki, whose bad relationship with Silver is central to the
impasse, still gets his salary. But he should perhaps be barred
from making any more out-of-state speaking trips to brag about New
York's fiscal achievements until the state has a functioning
budget.

RESILIENT AMERICANS SURVIVE SCARE, ADVANCE TO SEMIFINALS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ The confused, disorganized American defense
continued its maddening habit of early breakdowns Thursday night in
the Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Chastain did the unthinkable and put a shot into her own
goal in the fifth minute. Briana Scurry, the goalkeeper, spent the
first half glaring at her teammates with the molten stare of a
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has shown remarkable resilience as the
World Cup favorites, never displaying signs of panic or despair.
The team is strikingly fit and confident, and it overcame its early
disorder with two second-half goals to defeat Germany, 3-2, in a
quarterfinal match at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium witnessed by
President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With this nervous victory, the Americans advanced to the
semifinals on Sunday in Palo Alto, Calif., against Brazil, a 4-3
overtime winner over Nigeria. But the age and lack of speed in the
defense has left any potential title suddenly uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was scored in the 66th minute, seconds after
Shannon MacMillan had replaced Julie Foudy in midfield. With a goal
and two assists against North Korea on Sunday, MacMillan had made a
case for becoming a full-time starter. Thursday night, immediately
after she entered, she placed a line drive of a corner kick into
the penalty area, and defender Joy Fawcett headed it in for a 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the second half started, down by 2-1, the Americans
huddled near midfield to discuss the urgency of the moment. This
was the knockout phase of the tournament. One defeat and they were
gone long before anyone had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   It took only four minutes for the United States to gain its
equilibrium. Mia Hamm, who had been marked deftly by Sandra Minnert
in the first half, lofted a long corner kick that carried beyond
the far post and deflected off the German defender Steffi Jones.
The ball bounced free six yards in front of the goal and Chastain
redeemed herself by nearly going into a slide and hammering it into
the net. Chastain then fell on her back and put her arms in the
air, as much in relief as celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chastain's early error that continued what has become an
agonizing custom for the Americans. Thursday night, they suffered
two early defensive breakdowns. The first merely provided a scare;
the second resulted in the embarrassment of the United States
putting a shot into its own goal.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes into the match, Fawcett, often considered the
world's top defender, headed a pass back to Scurry. But the pass
was too soft and Germany's top scorer, Birgit Prinz ran onto the
ball. Only a desperate scramble by Scurry, who sprinted 14 yards
off her line to smother the ball, prevented a goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth minute, a lack of communication between Scurry and
Chastain resulted in the most unforgivable of mistakes _ an own
goal. Chastain easily intercepted a pass from the German midfielder
Maren Meinert inside the penalty area, but she appeared not to look
up as she played the ball back to Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, Scurry had vacated the goal mouth, charging
upfield. Chastain, who should have cleared the ball, got a stricken
look on her face as it rolled instead toward an empty net. Carla
Overbeck, the American captain, sprinted furiously toward the goal
line, attempting a rescue, but the ball rolled unimpeded into the
net to give Germany a stunning 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In a first-round game, the confused American defense had
surrendered a goal to Nigeria after two minutes, then scored seven
unanswered goals, but Germany was too well organized for such
capitulation. Victory for the Americans appeared suddenly
precarious, as did continued public interest in the World Cup and
the future possibility of a women's professional league.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans are not easily rattled, and they kept moving
forward, creating chances to tie the score. In the 16th minute,
Michelle Akers fired a shot from 20 yards that pounded off the
torso of Meinert and bounced into the penalty area. The German
defense, already down one player after an injury took Bettina
Wiegmann out of the match briefly, reacted slowly, and Tiffeny
Milbrett pounced on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   After a nervous start to the World Cup, Milbrett had regained
her status as the Americans' most reliable scorer, with two goals
against Nigeria and a productive second half against North Korea.
Thursday night, she sprinted onto the loose ball and blasted it
from 12 yards out, placing it underneath Silke Rottenberg, the
charging German goalkeeper, who had no chance for a save. In the
16th minute, the Americans had equalized at 1-1. But the tie would
not hold.
</P>
<P>
   As the first half went to extra time, the American defense found
itself out of position again. Parlow was a step slow, and Chastain
was caught flat-footed, as Wiegmann, a specialist on free kicks and
penalty kicks, took a pass from Sandra Smisek and rocketed a
left-footed shot from 22 yards inside the left post, beyond the
arms of the diving Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans had not surrendered a goal in the second half
of their three previous matches, and thanks to a more cohesive
defense and a vigilant Scurry, they did not again Thursday night.
And now they move to the semifinals, apprehensively, barely. &QL;

GTE SUES 5 INSURERS IN A BID TO SPREAD YEAR 2000 COSTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., R.I., Texas)  (rk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The GTE Corp. has sued five insurance companies seeking $400
million to cover its spending on year 2000 computer repairs and
testing. The case is believed to be the first to test whether
insurers may be compelled to pay for at least some of the tens of
billions of dollars that big companies are spending on year 2000
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits like GTE's for coverage of preventive repair work are
not addressed in the year 2000 liability legislation agreed upon
Thursday by Congress. The legislation, which the White House has
said President Clinton will sign, focuses on stemming litigation
against vendors over defective products and on potential suits
against computer owners for damage resulting from their failure to
repair their computers.
</P>
<P>
   GTE's suit, filed on June 18 in U.S. District Court in Newark,
is based on contract language common in one form or another in
corporate insurance policies, according to insurance lawyers. The
language is known as a ``sue and labor'' clause because it
compensates the policyholder for work it does or for the cost of
lawsuits filed against third parties if such actions are aimed at
limiting future damage claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suit deals with policies that have been widely sold to
corporate America,'' said Mark R. Misiorowki, an insurance lawyer
at the firm of Williams &AMP; Montgomery in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants say that insurers have paid some claims for year
2000 repairs to avoid suits like GTE's, but how much and under what
circumstances has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of potential insurance industry liability for year
2000 problems have varied wildly. One recent study by Milliman &AMP;
Robertson, an actuarial firm, said that claims and legal costs
could run anywhere from $15 billion to $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GTE sued under three policies negotiated with the Allendale
Mutual Insurance Co. of Johnston, R.I., for the period running from
July 1, 1996, to July 1, 2000. The primary policy covered
``destruction, distortion or corruption of any computer data,
coding, program or software'' and, in another section, obligated
GTE to ``sue, labor and travel'' if necessary to safeguard its
property. The contract also said Allendale would contribute to
expenses that GTE incurred in such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   With Allendale as the lead insurer, four other companies
negotiated coverage with identical language and are now defendants:
Affiliated FM Insurance, the Allianz Insurance Co., the Federal
Insurance Co. and Industrial Risk Insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this case as very specific to the language in GTE's
policies,'' said Robert F. Ruyak, a Washington lawyer representing
the company, which is based in Irving, Texas He said many insurance
contracts would not have such clear-cut language referring to
computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   But John J. Pomeroy, Allendale's general counsel, said that the
language was not unusual. He said Allendale had not yet had a
chance to examine the lawsuit in detail.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers have until July 18 to file their initial response.

CAMPAIGN-LOOPHOLE (Washington) _ The Republican Party has sent a
letter to GOP presidential candidates suggesting the party intends
to exploit the same ``soft money'' loophole in 2000 that
contributed to the highly-publicized campaign-finance abuses of
1996, The Arizona Republic has learned. In the June 18 letter, the
Republican National Committee told all of the Republican
presidential contenders to ``channel'' their top donors to the RNC
to help fund ``an aggressive issue advertising campaign designed to
counter the efforts of union bosses and the Democratic National
Committee.'' BY JEFF BARKER. Story to move in the ``A'' Category.
