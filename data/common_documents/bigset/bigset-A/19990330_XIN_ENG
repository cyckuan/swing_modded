<HEADLINE> Feature: the Pride of Budanovci and of Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDANOVCI, Yugoslavia, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Budanovci is a
small village in the west of the Serbian republic where farmers
are busy tilling the land and sowing seeds.
</P>
<P>
But farmers coming from far and wide were not doing their usual
spring chores on Monday. They were hurrying toward a common
destination, to collect a piece of the pride of Budanovci and of
Serbia. What they were after was a tiny piece of what remained of
a downed F-117 by Serbian air defense fire.
</P>
<P>
The farmers swarmed in after the government removed the major
portion of the downed plane to a military museum. With bare hands
and small farming tools, they were looking for scraps of what they
would like to display in their homes: a souvenir for generations
of relatives yet to come.
</P>
<P>
Whenever there was a loud cheer, it was a sure sign that a
piece of the jet plane, once believed to be the best and most
sophisticated fighter ever manufactured by the United States, had
been found. The function of the piece was then explained in
English.
</P>
<P>
The downed F-117 humbly bared the secrets of all its inner
wares to everyone who came to see. The farmers were soon joined by
a group of soldiers who spent a whole morning in a truck to get a
look at the tactical fighter which once flew low over Serbia
without considering the courage and originality of the Serbs who
found a way to down it.
</P>
<P>
The farmers and soldiers extended their thumbs, index and
middle fingers all at once to show the sign of victory, while
chanting the Serbian word for "superb", "superb".
</P>
<P>
With bare hands on his chest, one aged farmer reminded the
young and inexperienced soldiers of a saying that prevailed among
the Serbian resistance fighters during the two World Wars:
</P>
<P>
The war is not won by guns but by courage.

<HEADLINE> Russia Questions Contact Group's Existence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Monday questioned the necessity for the international
Contact Group to exist after it failed to meet on the Yugoslavia
crisis as proposed earlier by Moscow due to the United States'
objection.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Ivanov said the continuous existence of
the six-nation Contact Group has become "a question" since it was
unable to operate effectively at such a critical moment.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
planned visit to Belgrade is to seek measures to stop the "
invasion" of Yugoslavia and reverse the situation there, Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is scheduled to leave for Belgrade Tuesday and meet
Yugoslav leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov condemned NATO's expansion of its bombing targets to
include residential areas, highways, bridges, water supplying
systems, power supply systems and other civilian infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of NATO's air strikes, Ivanov said, the
secessionist ethnic Albanian forces have launched a massive
assault against Serb residents across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
General Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's
international cooperation department, said that Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev is reviewing ways of preventing "invasion" and
solving the Balkan crisis with his counterparts of Russia's
friendly countries, including member states of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) and China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Speaks at ASEM FMs' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan Monday in Berlin put forward proposals for how to promote
the cooperation between Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
At the second ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Tang told his
counterparts from Asia and the European Union (EU), "Equal
attention should be given to all major areas while priority to the
most important one."
</P>
<P>
And, in the areas of economy, science and technology, there is
a great potential for Asia and Europe to deepen cooperation, and
such cooperation will achieve more and quick results, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
ASEM stands for meetings among Asian countries and EU members.
The ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which began Monday in Berlin,
was to make preparation for the third ASEM Summit Meeting
scheduled for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the principles for Asia-Europe cooperation should be
observed. The principles include mutual respect, equality and
mutual benefit, seeking common ground while putting aside
differences, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
evolutionary development and decision by consensus.
</P>
<P>
As his third point of view, Tang advised Asia and Europe to
join hands in promoting the reform of the international financial
architecture. The outbreak and spread of the Asia financial crisis
have plunged Asian countries into severe economic difficulties and
exerted an adverse impact on the global economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Asia financial crisis has reflected the defects of the
current international financial system, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
Tang also suggested it is necessary to further strengthen the
role of the ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Senior
Officials' Meeting in providing policy guidance and making overall
coordination.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Tang announced the Chinese government's
decision to donate 500,000 U.S. dollars to the ASEM Trust Fund,
aiming at helping Asian countries which have been affected by the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government wishes to host the third ASEM Foreign
Ministers' Meeting in the year 2001, and China will as always
continue to make its contribution to closer Asia-Europe
cooperation, Tang said.

<P>
SOFIA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Only eight ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo have applied for the identities of refugees in Bulgaria
since NATO started air strikes on Yugoslavia on Wednesday,
although about 600 Yugoslav nationals bypass the country every day,
Bulgaria's national office for refugees said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Kosovo refugees have poured into Albania and
Macedonia since the air raid started.
</P>

The Bulgarian government has said it could only accept a

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Denies Ethiopian Battle Victory Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Eritrean government
official in Asmara Monday dismissed Ethiopian battle victory
claims as "a complete sham, " according to an Eritrean News Agency
report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia issued a statement Sunday saying that 45,000 Eritrean
troops had been put out of action and 77 tanks destroyed in
fighting along three fronts since February 26.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean official said "these figures are completely
forged. They are claiming false victories citing battles they
once denied," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia was denying that any fighting had taken place around
Tsorona (on the central front along the border) and only
skirmishes had occurred there, now they contend that they killed
and wounded 9,000 Eritreans and destroyed 36 tanks," the official
charged.
</P>
<P>
"In Badme, we reported that during the fighting in February, we
had destroyed and captured 41 enemy tanks, now they have
repackaged that assessment as their own report," noted the
official.
</P>
<P>
The official believed that Ethiopia only released this
statement in the wake of international verification of the massive
losses it suffered in recent fighting.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the two Horn of Africa neighbors renewed their
border fighting in February this year, the two sides have been
exchanging accusations with each other.

<HEADLINE> Research Confirms Dwindling Fish Stocks at Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A month-long research cruise on
waters of Guinea Gulf has confirmed the earlier fear of dwindling
fish catches in the coastal area of West Africa.
</P>
<P>
A team of scientists from six West African countries concluded
their research cruise last Thursday after completing the survey on
the state of fisheries and pollution in the Gulf of Guinea Large
Marine Ecosystem, The Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The research started on February 25 is a collaborative effort
involving Benin, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroun, Nigeria and Togo.
</P>
<P>
According to cruise coordinator Catherine Isebor, the team's
cruise covered 92,300 square kilometers of continental shelves of
the six countries and worked on the 10 to 100 meters range,
generating water samples and sediments for pollution studies.
</P>
<P>
Isebor said that the team of scientists compiled data for the
170 stations covering each country's catch rate within an hour to
determine the percentage composition of fish species in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Sizes of the commercial species are declining daily as a result
of pollution of the waters and over-fishing, the coordinator said,
adding most of the places used as stations are places where water
from the land enters the sea.
</P>
<P>
The pollution of such areas as the Lagos Lagoon, Cotonou Harbor
and Kpeme in Togo has affected the fish sizes which are "very
small and poor", Isebor noted.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that over-registration of fishing vessels may
have also contributed to the present situation, adding that about
250 vessels are licensed for inshore fishing and shrimping in
Nigeria and many more are waiting for the issuance of licences.
</P>
<P>
A meeting is expected to be held next month in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire, to analyse the data collected and to prepare a
comprehensive report on the trip.
</P>
<P>
The research cruise provides a regional approach to addressing
the pollution of shared waters and associated degradation of
critical habitats and natural resources, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper noted that the collaborative efforts
also attempt to demonstrate to both decision makers and others the
direct linkages between pollution and ecosystem health and
economic well-being.

<HEADLINE> UK Has "Fattest Cats" In Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain has the biggest "fat cats"
in Europe, and has the world's best-paid accountants, according to
a survey released Monday by the business magazine Management
Today.
</P>
<P>
The title of fattest cat in the UK went to the chief executive
of drugs giant SmithKline Beecham, Jan Leschly, who last year
received 147 million U.S. dollars in a combination of pay, perks
and shares.
</P>
<P>
Although most UK company executives earn nowhere near such a
record-breaking figure, the chief executives of the top 350
companies last year received pay rises averaging 17.8 percent,
bringing their total average pay to almost 632,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is 25 percent more than French chief executives, the next
highest paid on 508,800. The UK is second only to the U.S., where
CEOs last year pocketed an average 1,048,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found accountants, who have a much bigger role
in running companies in Britain than in Germany or the U.S., are
exceptionally well rewarded in the UK.
</P>
<P>
A British accountant with five years' experience earns on
average 89,600 dollars, 30 percent more than French accountants,
the next highest on 68,000 dollars, and 107 percent more than a
Swede with the same experience, who earns only 43,200 dollars.

<HEADLINE> 2 French Generals Oppose NATO Airstrikes in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Two retired French army generals
have expressed their opposition to the NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
General Pierre-Marie Gallois, 87, who is the first theoretician
of the French nuclear deterrence force, said Monday that he has
signed an appeal entitled "Europe Wants Peace."
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by an organization called "No to War Group"
which has collected more than 150 signatures of French
personalities.
</P>
<P>
"I hate this war because of what it has done," he said, adding
that it is unconceivable that a foreign army could occupy a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
"The result is sad. We would protect these unfortunate Kosovo
Albanians. One has arrived at the contrary (of what was planned),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Another retired French general, the 83-year-old Marcel Bigeard
who is the most decorated army general in France, said that the
NATO strikes would help nothing.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Milosevic will not lower his flag, with the patriotic
spirit of the Serbs who can fight as guerrillas in their country
as they have the tradition," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deployment of a NATO ground force would not
help things either, as "when people are engaged in a guerrilla
war, they would not finish with it."
</P>
<P>
Former commander of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia, French
general Philippe Morillon, had predicted that the Serbs would
carry out a "scorched land policy" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He judged it inevitable for NATO to send ground forces if it
wants to stop the attacks on Kosovo Albanians by Serbs.

Exchange (LIFFE) announced plans to establish a joint venture to
identify new services for customers in wholesale financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will research potential business

organizations.
</P>
<P>
Each organization already has new initiatives to deliver
trading and clearing efficiencies to these markets this year.

<P>
The LCH will launch clearing services for the over-the-counter
market (OTC) -- SwapClear and RepoClear -- and the LIFFE will
further develop its swap futures contract -- the LIFFE Euribor
Financed Bond future.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, the joint venture will be

organizations retaining their existing businesses and individual
development plans separate from the new entity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Defends Policy on Limiting Foreigner's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Monday defended
its new policy on limiting foreigners' business scope, claiming
that it aims at combating poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"The government has an obligation to ensure that economic
liberalization brings benefits to the nationals of Tanzania and
that they are not marginalized during these transitional times,"
the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Iddi Simba, told a press
conference Monday in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, said that the government remains
committed to a free market economy and wishes to maintain friendly
relationship with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
On March 22, the Tanzanian government issued a statement
stipulating that effective from May 1 this year, foreigners will
be barred from doing business in dozens of fields, such as running
small hotels (up to 20 rooms), restaurants, photographing centers,
beauty clinics and tailoring marts.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors include poultry farming, selling chicken meat and
eggs, carpentry and selling of furniture, painting, shoe repair
business, and retail selling of fish.
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreigners will be restricted from running
laundries, bakeries, doing radio repair, selling vegetables and
charcoal, doing watch and iron repair, working as electricians,
selling stationery and becoming auctioneers and brokers.
</P>
<P>
Simba said, "We have an obligation to protect certain sectors
of our economy in order to ensure that Tanzanian citizens have the
chance to contribute to the development of our economy."
</P>
<P>
The policy has also raised international concerns. Last Friday,
the Danish embassy issued a press release pointing out that the
policy will affect the investment climate in Tanzania and urged
the government to reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not reverse the decision," the minister
said at the press conference.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. antimissile missile
failed Monday for the sixth time to hit a flying target, a defense
official said.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known why the Theater High-Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) missile failed to intercept the target missile
Monday morning, said Bob Hunt, spokesman for the Army program
executive office for air and missile defense in Huntsville,
Alabama State.
</P>
<P>
"The telemetry data is still coming in and they're still
analyzing it," Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
The test was the ninth in a series of 13 flight tests for the
THAAD missile program and the sixth attempt at intercepting a
missile. The system has cost 3.8 billion U.S. dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
The target missile was launched from the northern end of the
Army's restricted White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico
State of the United States, said Jim Eckles, a White Sands
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Because the THAAD missile has repeatedly failed to hit its
target, Congress revised its contract with Lockheed Martin Corp.,
making the company financially liable for any misses.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed has to pay the government 15 million U.S. dollars in
accordance with the contract.
</P>
<P>
The target -- a modified Minuteman 2 missile called a Hera --
left behind a squiggly, colorful contrail seen as far away as
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles at higher
altitudes than the PAC-3 antimissile missile, which for the first
time hit a flying target missile March 15 over White Sands,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD missile system is being developed to protect U.S. and
allied troops from attacks by short- and medium-range missiles
such as the Scuds used in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The missile is designed to destroy, early in their flight,
enemy missiles that could be carrying chemical, biological or
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
There were four THAAD missile flight tests in 1995, two in 1996
and one each in 1997 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Genocide Suspect Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Bernard Ntuyahaga, a Rwanda
genocide suspect, was released by the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Monday free of any charges.
</P>
<P>
An press release by the tribunal said that Ntuyahaga, a major
in former Rwandan armed forces who had been accused of murdering
10 Belgian United Nations peace keeping soldiers, was released by
the tribunal based in Tanzania. !0The Registry of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda this morning released
major Benard Ntuyahaga following a written request by Ntuyahaga to
be set free in Tanzanian territory, specifically in Dar es
Salaam,!1 the release said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the registrar with the tribunal has said that
Ntuyahaga is open to trial by any state once he is freed.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's release, the first case in the ICTR history, is in
accordance with the decision by the ICTR Trial Chamber 1 on March
18 in which the Chamber granted the Prosecutor's request to drop
charges against Ntuyghaga.
</P>
<P>
!0This matter is now closed as far as the tribunal is
concerned,!1 the release said, giving no details about the
whereabouts of Ntuyghaga in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, 47, surrendered himself to the Tribunal on July 10,
1998 and was indicted on September 29 with one count, namely crime
against humanity (murder).
</P>
<P>
He was allegedly responsible for disarming and arresting the 10
Belgian soldiers who were sent to escort the Prime Minister Agathe
Uwilingiyimana before they were killed.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR on March 18 granted the prosecution leave to withdraw
its indictment against Ntuyahaga and set him free.
</P>
<P>
But Ntuyahaga has since preferred to stay in the United Nations
 Detention Facility on the outskirts of Arusha, a northern town in
Tanzania, where the ICTR is based for fear of being extradited to
Rwanda or Belgium which have sought his trial in their courts.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1994 by the United Nations Security
Council, the ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be
responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Decline 2 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Monday that new home sales dropped 2 percent in February, but the
sales rate was still considered strong.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive decline since the sales hit a
record high last fall. People purchased new homes at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 881,000 last month, a five-month low and
down from 899,000 in January, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Although down considerably from the record 985,000 pace in
November, sales for the first two months of this year are running
1.4 percent ahead of the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said low unemployment and strong inflation-adjusted
income gains are among the factors supporting sales, along with
high stock prices and low mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
While analysts expect continued strong sales for both new and
used homes, they believe a small increase in mortgage rates --
from around 6.75 percent early in the year to about 7 percent
currently. With an expected moderation in the overall economic
growth rate, there will be a modest sales slowdown from last
year's torrid pace.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median price of a new home was 158,000 dollars
in February, up 1.3 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The department said the supply of unsold homes at the end of
February totaled 301,000, the most in two years.

This is the first time Zimbabwe would sell part of its 40-ton

<P>
The experimental trade will also take place during the same

"The sale of ivory will be done following strict CITES
requirements. An auction will be held and buyers will choose the
ivory they want," Moyo said when he opened the annual meeting of
Campfire in Kadoma of central Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
This was important, Moyo said, to allay speculation that the
National Parks and Wildlife Department would select for sale only
ivory belonging to the government and discriminate that from rural
district councils so as to maximize government revenue.

<HEADLINE> World Solar Program Needs $2 Billion: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of the World Solar
Commission Boris Berkovski Monday said in Harare the World Solar
Action Program (1996- 2005) needs at least two billion U.S.
dollars to implement projects worldwide before the end of the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
He told the Zimbabwe News Agency that projects in energy worth
400 million had been implemented all over the world under the
program since its inception three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the rate at which projects were being implemented was
fast although there was need for cooperation between continents to
accelerate the implementation process.
</P>
<P>
He said most African countries had resources such as dams which
were under-utilized and which could otherwise be upgraded to
provide electricity to those countries or the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for an Afro-European solar bridge in order to
accelerate the implementation for some high priority projects in
Africa. The projects have been identified and prioritized at a
national scale," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said African states could also form sub regional blocks to
harness power from existing infrastructure by combining their
efforts toward upgrading that structure.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that for projects to be implemented quickly there
was need for more action than dialog.

<HEADLINE> German FM Calls for Euro-Asian "Open Partnership" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said Monday in Berlin that an "open partnership" among
Asian and European nations will benefit not only the two regions
but also the world.
</P>
<P>
As the host of the second ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting,
Fischer told his Asian and European counterparts that as both
regions will be among the heavyweights in the multipolar world
next century, "the more we coordinate and cooperate with one
another, the more we will be able to make our mark on the world's
destinies."
</P>
<P>
The ASEM, or the Asia-Europe Meeting, includes 15 members of
the European Union (EU) and 10 Asian countries. The Foreign
Ministers' Meeting, as part of the ASEM process launched in
Bangkok in 1996, was aimed at making preparation for the third
ASEM Summit Meeting scheduled for the year 2000 in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Noting the progress that ASEM has made in the fields of
economics and finance, Fischer urged Asia and Europe to set more
ambitious future goals, such as to create a more stable world
financial and monetary system or even, in the more distant future,
a Euro-Asian free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Although the Asia financial crisis has hurt some Asian
countries' economy, Asia has lost nothing of its significance for
the Europeans, and Europe is convinced that Asia will develop
again into a highly dynamic growth region once the necessary
reforms have been implemented, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"Europe and Asia remain important partners for each other even
in troubled times," Fischer announced, adding, "Europe will
continue its commitment in Asia."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says No Intention to Send Ground Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The White House said Monday
that the U.S-led NATO had no intention of sending ground troops to
Kosovo despite failure of quick success by bombing against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we can meet our military objectives through the
NATO air campaign and we have no intention of introducing ground
forces unless and until there is a peaceful... political
settlement," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
NATO began its campaign of air strikes against Yugoslavia
Wednesday in an attempt to force Belgrade to accept a
Western-imposed peace deal that would allow its troops access to
the province of Yugoslavia. On Sunday NATO widened its scope of
bombing against Yugoslavia to targeting Serb ground forces, tanks
and artillery.
</P>
<P>
"We do have evidence that the (Serb) offensive has steadily
intensified," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton was expected to return to the White
House from the Camp David presidential retreat Monday and to
receive a briefing on the NATO air strikes and the Serb offensive
in Kosovo from his national security advisers.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart also welcomed Russia's decision to send a peace
mission to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"They have a profound disagreement with us over the NATO
mission right now, but we've always said that those who have
influence with (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic, who can
bring the stark message of embracing peace versus continuing to
face NATO air strikes -- is useful," Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique GDP Rises by 10% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique managed a 10-percent
growth of gross domestic product in 1998, after its two digit
growth in 1997, Joaquim Chissano, president of the southern
African country said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a report on the country's situation at the
parliament, Chissano said that Mozambique has maintained a fast
economic growth over the past five years, thanks to correct
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The inflation, which was 6.3 percent in 1994, was reduced to
one percent in 1998, and metical, the country's currency, remain
basically stable despite the international "financial storm" last
year, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, which saw a 8.2 percent growth in 1998, took a
prominent role in the economic growth. Grain output increased to
1.7 million tons last year from one million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor in the economic growth is the new
projects approved last year. The government approved 202 projects
in 1998, with an investment of 837 million U.S. dollars. The
launching of the projects, especially the Maputo-Witbank (South
Africa) high way, have given a great push forward to the economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The improved roads are regarded as yet another factor for the
growth. The mileage of unworthy roads, which registered 26,000 km
in 1992, was reduced to 8,000 km at present.
</P>
<P>
But Chissano said that the foreign debt, which was as high as
5.6 billion U.S. dollars, continued to one of big obstacles to the
nation's development.

ADDIS ABABA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said its defense
forces "successfully repelled all the attacks" that Eritrean army
Monday launched on western border front of Badme near the Mereb
River.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse
said in a statement issued here Monday evening that the Ethiopian
defense forces "destroyed eight Eritrean tanks and captured one".
</P>
<P>
This is a new border fighting between the two armies of the two

Meanwhile, the office said Eritrean forces carried out heavy
shelling at the Zalambessa-Egela front further to the east for the
second day.

captured 13,700 Eritrean soldiers, destroyed 15 tanks and captured
four others in fighting on the Badme front between March 17 and
26.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia said it had killed, wounded or captured over 45,000
Eritrean troops and destroyed 77 tanks in border battles since
February 23.

LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said Monday a Russian peace team heading for Belgrade
was likely to get a good hearing from Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Russians) are listened to in Belgrade, perhaps a
little more than we are," a Reuters report quoted Robertson as
saying at an Italian airbase during a visit there to British
pilots involved in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Robertson hoped the Russians could convince Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end the military action in Kosovo where NATO
has accused him of pursuing against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday sent his three top
ministers to Belgrade for urgent talks with Milosevic to seek a
political end to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they are bringing to President Milosevic a message that
he should stop the violence, stop destabilizing the region,
because that is something that can hardly be in Russia's interests
as well," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia had repeatedly said that they would compromise only
if NATO stopped its strikes.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Free HIV/AIDS testing has
become available in Dar es Salaam, capital of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The service is offered by the Community-based Rehabilitation in
Tanzania, in its Upanga Center in the city, the society said in a
statement released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The society offers a wide range of other services to HIV/AIDS
sufferers, which include counselling, assistance to deal with the
daily problems of living with AIDS and support to AIDS orphans.
</P>
<P>
The center also runs a legal aid unit which educates and
empowers the sufferers to pursue their rights, free legal advice
and representation in areas such as labor conflicts, ownership of
property, orphan legal issues and child custodian matters.
</P>
<P>
"The unit, however, concentrates on preparation of wills and
the subsequent representation in courts," said the statement,
adding that the service is aimed at assisting family members who
are often stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
The society has expressed concerns over the frequent
victimization of families of people living with AIDS in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.5 million people in Tanzania, with a population of 30
million, have been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The number of children orphaned by the deadly disease of AIDS
is rising quickly in Tanzania. United Nations Children's Fund said
that the number of children who lost parents was 200,000 in 1996
in the east African country, but the figure may rise to 800,000 by
the end of this century.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said Monday that despite France's military involvement in the NATO
operation against Yugoslavia, Paris is seeking a diplomatic
solution to the conflict at the same time.
</P>
<P>
"France, which is the origin of the Rambouillet talks,
continues to take the initiatives in favor of peace without
cease," said Chirac when addressing the French people for the
first time since France joined NATO air raids six days ago.
</P>
<P>
France has asked Russia to intervene with the authorities of
Belgrade to pressure them to stop attacks on Kosovo Albanians and
return to the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We will work in liaison with our European, American and
Russian partners. But a pacific solution supposes that (Yugoslav)
President Milosevic stop the repression and accept the moral and
humane rules on which rest today the democracies," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to him to make the necessary gestures," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reference to the situation in Kosovo, Chirac said that the
"behavior of the Serbian authorities is not acceptable."
</P>
<P>
According to Western media reports, operations of ethnic
cleansing are being staged by Serb forces against Kosovo
Albanians, who are fleeing the country in a mass exodus to
neighboring Albania, Macedonia and the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"Europe cannot accept having on its soil a man and a regime
who, for 10 years, have engaged in Slovenia, Croatia, in Bosnia
and now in Kosovo, operations of ethnic cleansing, assassinations
and massacres, of destabilization of the whole region, with as a
consequence more than 200,000 deaths and millions of people
displaced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the speech after consulting with Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin and top government and military officials Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
A poll published by the daily Parisien Monday said that 46
percent of the French people don't approve of the NATO operation,
against 40 percent who approve.
</P>
<P>
The French president admitted that the on-going operation could
bring about major risks to French soldiers and those of other NATO
countries, as well as the people of the region.
</P>
<P>
"This action asks for time and determination. It should thus be
pursued for attaining its objective which is, I repeat, to reduce
the means of repression of President Milosevic," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Half of the 15 Mig-29 warplanes of
the Yugoslav army have been crippled or destroyed by NATO bombings
in the past six days, Agence France-Presse quoted an unidentified
French military source as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet-made ground-to-air SAM missile system of the
Yugoslav army will be destroyed from now till the end of the week,
said the same source.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the Phase II airstrikes being staged by
NATO is more risky for the pilots, because Yugoslavia has kept a
large part of its mobile anti-air missiles unused.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes are bombing Yugoslav ground forces south of
Belgrade in Phase II of the Deliberate Force Operation which began
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The French military source also said that the past bombings on
Yugosalvia's anti-air defense system have achieved "satisfying"
results.
</P>
<P>
It said that France is not going to send more warplanes to the
NATO armada, as the United States and Britain are doing.
</P>
<P>
About 40 French warplanes, including 12 Mirage 2000 combat
aircraft, are participating in the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
On a possible dispatch of ground troops to Yugoslavia, the
source said that it will need 50 days to gather up to 150,000
soldiers for staging such an operation, because a force smaller
than 100,000 men will not match the Yugoslav army.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
extended 10 million U.S. dollars in grant to Uganda to help
develop the rural electrification sector of the country.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony took place at the Ministry of Finance
Monday morning, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The grant is intended for the procurement of equipment and
materials for transmission lines in five Ugandan districts and it
will also be used for new construction work of Kayunga
sub-station, expansion work on Njeru sub- station and procurement
and installation of booster stations.
</P>
<P>
Uganda now produces 180 mega watts of electricity annually, 80
mega watts short of the national demand. Lack of power results in
frequent load- shedding during peak hours and hampering industrial
devolvement.
</P>
<P>
In upcountry areas, electricity is still a rare thing. On
average, five percent of the country's 20 million people have
access to electricity.

<HEADLINE> NATO Strategy a "Single Greatest Mistake" - Owen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua)--The former European Community's
peace mediator in Former Yugoslavia, David Owen, said on Monday
that air strikes alone on Serb forces were NATO's "greatest single
mistake".
</P>
<P>
"The greatest single mistake over Kosovo was to threaten him
(Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic) only with action," the
former British foreign secretary and EC peace envoy to the region
between 1992 and 1995, said in an interview with the BBC.
</P>
<P>
"He has judged events will turn out - whether he is correct or
not - that he can withstand air action,"he said.
</P>
<P>
Owen said that western leaders like the United States President
Bill Clinton had misjudged Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The former peace mediator also pointed out that currently
alleged "ethnic cleansing" in Kosovo was "predictable".
</P>
<P>
The recent policy of so-called ethnic cleansing imposed on
Kosovo Albanians was a "predictable and predicted outcome of air
strikes", said Owen.
</P>
<P>
He said the only way to stop the systematic purge of thousands
of people from their homes was for NATO to send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
"(But) they show, unfortunately, no signs of doing that," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Owen said he believed that Western intervention
in the wars that plagued the Balkans this decade has done "more
harm than good".
</P>
<P>
"I think really now seeing what's happened in Kosovo and
all-out war between NATO and Yugoslavia, you've got to ask
yourself - has this really been a failure?" said the old diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Owen's comments came as Scottish National Party leader Alex
Salmond become the first leading politician in Britain to voice
serious doubts about military action in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the Scottish people, Mr Salmond
attacked the NATO offensive in Yugoslavia as counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
"It is an act of dubious legality, but above all one of
unpardonable folly," Salmond said.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday strongly defended
NATO's action and, in a statement to the House of Commons, denied
it had lead to atrocities against Kosovo Albanians.

<P>
BONN March 29 (Xinhua)--The Foreign Ministers of 15 European
Union (EU) members and 10 Asian countries said Monday in Berlin,
after a day-long meeting, that they were determined to build a
"strong and lasting Asia-Europe partnership".
</P>
<P>
The ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting ended with a joint
statement pledging to strengthen political, financial and social
links among European and Asian nations. The ASEM stands for the
Asia-Europe Meeting.
</P>
<P>
The 14-page " Chairman's Statement", which was issued after the
meeting, also said that building trust, cooperation and
partnership between the two regions will be a priority.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in the statement that Asia and Europe should
work together to enhance understanding of the broader consequences
of the Asian financial crisis, and to share experiences in the
social sector.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Asian financial crisis has been hurting Asian
countries' prosperity and the world economy, the statement
stressed the need to strengthen the architecture of the
international monetary system, calling for increasing regulation
and supervision of the financial sector, and appealing for more
transparency in financial and capital markets.
</P>
<P>
The statement agreed there should be closer cooperation between
business and finance sectors in both regions, saying that close
and growing economic ties between all ASEM partners is an
important element for recovery and lasting growth in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministers said, "the human dimension of ASEM
should reflected the shared interest of the two regions in such
fields as culture, education, environment, science and
technology."
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europe Foundation in Singapore, and the Asia-Europe
Environmental Technology Center in Thailand were listed in the
statement as being important examples in building close Euro-Asian
culture and technology links.
</P>
<P>
The ministers promised that ASEM process would remain "open and
evolutionary", saying that decisions on opening ASEM to other
Asia-Pacific countries would be made in the ASEM summit scheduled
for October 2000 in Seoul. India, Pakistan, Australia and New
Zealand have applied for ASEM memberships.

<HEADLINE> UK, US Embassies Step Up Security After Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Security at the British and
American embassies in South Africa has been stepped up following
bomb threats against them.
</P>
<P>
While reluctant to provide details of security plans, the U.S.
embassy and the British High Commission said Monday they were
prepared for any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
The tightening of security follows threats by a so-called
Serbian Liberation Front to bomb the two embassies in Pretoria,
South African capital, by noon Monday unless NATO's air strikes on
Kosovo are stopped.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified person phoned a Johannesburg newspaper Sunday
afternoon and said: "The Serbian Liberation Front is issuing a
definite declaration that we will bomb the British and American
embassies by noon tomorrow unless the attacks on Kosovo are
stopped."
</P>
<P>
However, in a telephone interview with Xinhua Monday, Alexander
Misic, one of the organizers of Saturday's Serb protest at the
British consulate- general in Johannesburg, said he had not even
heard of such a group.
</P>
<P>
He said the Serb community in South Africa wanted peace and
that they were even opposed to the hurling of eggs toward the
British consulate- general during Saturday's demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"We want to show them that we're pushing for peace, not war,"
Misic said.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that Saturday's protest was staged
spontaneously by Serbs who attended church services and was not
organized by a specific group.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Wharton, spokesman for the U.S. embassy, said their
security was normally very tight but they had taken extra
precautions.
</P>
<P>
"We evaluate every risk that occurs and then react to it
accordingly. This is no exception," he said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British High Commission, Andy Pearce, said
the commission had increased security and the Foreign Office in
London had been informed of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Pearce said they were working closely and effectively with
local police.
</P>
<P>
A South African police spokesman, Lazarus Tlometsana, said
security around embassies had been stepped up with an increase in
visible patrolling on foot and in vehicles.

<HEADLINE> UK's SNP Attacks Nato Bombing as "Unpardonable Folly" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Scottish National Party
leader Alex Salmond criticized Nato's military action in Serbia on
Monday, calling it counter-productive and "unpardonable folly."
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the Scottish people, Salmond said:
"It is an act of dubious legality, but above all one of
unpardonable folly."
</P>
<P>
The bombing "may make matters even worse for the very people it
is meant to be helping", he said.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish nationalist leader said Nato bombing must be
capable of weakening Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
helping Kosovo. But "a bombing campaign will do neither, indeed
the chances are it will make both worse."
</P>
<P>
Salmond warned the bombing had already led to further violence
against ethnic Albanians and a strengthening of Serb resolve.
</P>
<P>
"In virtually every country that has been blitzed this century,
the reaction has been to steel the resolve of the local
population," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SNP leader also urged an early end to the bombing, saying:
"The correct thing to do is not to substitute folly for wisdom,
aggression for diplomacy, or might for right."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former European Community's peace mediator Lord Owen
also said air strikes alone on Serb forces were Nato's "greatest
single mistake".
</P>
<P>
Lord Owen told BBC's Panorama on Monday the threat of ground
action in conjunction with air attacks would have forced President
Milosevic to sign a peace deal.

soccer players, who were jailed for 22 months by a court here last
Wednesday for match-fixing, were punished by the Hong Kong
Football Association Ltd. (HKFA Ltd.) to serve a life-time ban in
soccer.
</P>
<P>
The trio are Kevin Lok Kar-win, 25, Chan Chi-keung, 28, and Wai
Kwan-lung, 22.
</P>
<P>
They were also each fined 30,000 HK dollars (3,870 U.S. dollars)
after they finished serving their sentences in jail.
</P>
<P>
They were already deprived of their registered status in Hong
Kong soccer by HKFA Ltd. following the court judgment.
</P>
<P>
The three conspired with HK teammate Chan Tsz-kong to win bets
by ensuring Hong Kong was beaten by two goals by Thailand in a
World Cup qualifier in March 1997. Hong Kong was beaten with an
accurate score of 2-0 in that match.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Rules out Death Penalty Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela Tuesday once again ruled out the restoration of the death
penalty in his country.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with representatives of the Chinese community
in his residence in Pretoria, Mandela said the death penalty is
the most cruel punishment and that the best way to combat crime is
the establishment of an efficient police force.
</P>
<P>
He said the Constitutional Court has come to an unanimous
decision that the death penalty is against the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"They confirmed the point of view of the ANC (African National
Congress) because there is no evidence, anywhere, that the death
penalty can reduce crime by itself.
</P>
<P>
"What countries are doing which are progressive is to assure
that they have a police force which is properly trained, with
necessary skills and resources, so that criminals will know that
if they committed a crime, they would be locked up."
</P>
<P>
He denied that his government is treating criminals better than
law- abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We are treating prisoners according to international
standards, and no better than the citizens of the country."
</P>
<P>
He said the crime wave in South Africa affects all population
groups, not only the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening to them (Chinese) is happening even on a
greater scale to other members of the community."
</P>
<P>
"I have appealed, therefore, to the Chinese community to regard
 themselves by words and deeds as part of the South African
population," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed the killing of a Taiwanese business man,
Fung Tung Chuang, on February 28 in his shop in downtown
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The widow and son of the deceased were part of the delegation
that met Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese community staged a protest at Mandela's
Johannesburg home two weeks ago, calling for the re-introduction
of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the president met the Chinese
community. After a toddler, Danny Zhong, was gunned down last
year, he met the Chinese community and visited the parents of
Zhong.

<HEADLINE> New Law to Govern Beijing Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new set of regulations aimed at
improving the management of Beijing's tourism industry was
approved here today by the city's lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
The Regulations on the Management of Tourism in Beijing, passed
at the ninth session of the 11th Standing Committee of the Beijing
Municipal People's Congress which ended today, will go into effect
on June 1.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, comprising 62 articles, have detailed
stipulations on promoting tourism, improving tourism planning and
management, and defining legal responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations encourage domestic and overseas enterprises
and individuals to invest in the city's tourism industry, and
outline stricter stipulations for some tourism projects such as
cable cars, which are relatively dangerous if they are not taken
good care of.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the total number of overseas
tourists visiting Beijing soared from 286,000 in 1980 to 2.21
million in 1998, and the city now boasts 1,300 tourism-related
companies employing 220,000 people.

<HEADLINE> India Against U.S. Entities List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- India expressed its strong
reservation Tuesday on continuance of the U.S. entities list
against the country.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi raised the issue during the two-day meeting of
Indo-U.S. experts on export controls which ended here Tuesday. It
said that such restrictions were "unjustified" and interfered with
the "free flow of trade, technology and finance" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
India has regarded the U.S. government's entities list, which
placed export restriction and embargoes from the U.S. on Indian
government departments, research institutions, public sector
undertakings and private companies following its nuclear tests in
May last year, as a "highly unfortunate development".
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, there is no change in ground realities,"
official sources said, implying that both sides were sticking to
their known positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
A press release of the Ministry of External Affairs here,
however, regarded the second round of Indo-U.S. experts talks as
"useful and positive" and "hold the prospect of continued
cooperation in this area".
</P>
<P>
Experts of the two countries held their first round of talks on
export control on November 9-10 last year.

that his country will continue to develop a strategic partnership
with China.
</P>

Yeltsin made the remarks while discussing Russia's foreign
policy during his state of the union address at the parliament. To
further develop the strategic partnership between Russia and China
is not only good for the interests of the two peoples, but will
also help guarantee security in Asia and the world. The fact that
the two countries share the same opinions on the Kosovo issue is
proof of this, Yeltsin said. (Russia-China-Partnership)

"From the very beginning, this intervention has appeared to me

I were to judge by what is now taking place, I would have to say
that this action will only reinforce the power of (Yugoslav
President) Milosevic," Mery was quoted by the daily Aujourd'hui/le
Parisien as saying. Mery, who was the chief of the General Staff
of the French Armed Forces from 1975 till 1980, also called on The
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) not to aggravate the
situation by sending ground forces to Kosovo, saying that will
only bring about "a real mess." (France-Yugoslavia-General)

NANCHANG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The day was just dawning as
Huang Qiaonu left home with a hoe and headed as usual to the big
mountain not far from her home.
</P>
<P>
 Over the past ten years, Huang Qiaonu, a 45-year-old country
woman in Huali Village in the southern region of east China's
Jiangxi Province, has planted some 40 hectares of fruit trees,
cash crops and forests in the local mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Now better off, she can earn as much as 40,000 yuan a year
from her crops, aqua-culture, and bee-raising, as well as pig
raising at the foot of mountains. This amount is much higher than
the average per capita net income of 2,160 yuan for rural
residents in China last year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great change compared with ten years ago", said
Huang, "when my family only earned one percent of what we can earn
these days."
</P>

"There were little farmland available for each family, and we
had no way out but to chop down trees in the mountains and sell
the wood in the markets", she said.
</P>

The southern region of Jiangxi Province is mainly mountainous
with mountainous area accounting for 80 percent of all the local
land area. Per capita arable land was less than 0.06 hectares,
while the mountainous area averaged nearly 0.5 hectares per person,
explained Luo Chuntao, an official in charge of rural work in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Paddy rice cultivation was the only farming available to local
peasants until the late 1980s, said Huang Qiaonu.
</P>
<P>
Cutting down the sugarplum trees didn't help the local people
shake off their poverty, and to make things worse, it was damaging
the local environment.
</P>
<P>
We suffered great losses from tree-felling; well-water turned
bad, farmland became deserts, and the rice yield went down sharply,
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, some 30 percent of the green mountainous
areas in the region, or over 980,000 hectares, had become barren
and waste land, and soil erosion was further accelerating as
millions of tons of mud, rock and water rushed down the mountains
into villages every year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The long-term consequences of the U.S.-led bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia are uncertain. But one short-term result seems
clear -- a strengthening of the domestic political power of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
-- The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 10,000 for the
first time Monday, creating a new bench-mark for the longest-
running bull market in history and underscoring the optimism of
new investors dazzled by the high-tech boom and the nation's
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO air attacks shifted toward Serbian troop concentrations
in embattled Kosovo as the Clinton Administration claimed that
evidence of genocide by Serb forces was growing to "abhorrent and
criminal action on a maximum scale."
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Fund said it had reached
agreement on "a broad framework" to resume financial aid to Russia,
but American officials warned that they would permit only enough
to keep Moscow from defaulting on international loans.
</P>
<P>
-- The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 10000 for the
first time Monday, capturing in a single number both the
astonishing success and giddy exuberance of the U.S. economy this
decade.
</P>
<P>
-- A Lockheed antimissile system failed its sixth test in a row,
throwing an unflattering light on the Theater High-Altitude Area
Defense program during a political debate on building a national
missile defense. The firm also announced it plans to cut 1,200
jobs at its rocket unit.

<HEADLINE> India to Amend Mines Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Union Cabinet
Tuesday decided to amend the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and
Development) Act 1957 to make it an investor friendly one.
</P>
<P>
A new bill to amend the act, which is expected to give more
powers to state governments, will be introduced in the current
session of the Parliament, Information and Broadcasting Minister
and government spokesman Promodh Mahajan told newsmen after the
Cabinet meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Power of approving mining plans is being delegated to state
governments in respect of certain metallic and industrial
minerals. Power of granting mining lease and prospecting license
for areas which are not compact or continuos is being delegated to
state governments except for some listed minerals, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb illegal mining, legal provisions are being
strengthened by delegating powers of authorization, search entry
to state governments, he added.

<P>
In order to protect the ecological environment, the local
government spared no effort to stop the peasants from felling
trees. "Administrative orders proved ineffective for resolving the
problem, and some peasants refused to stop felling trees if they
could find no other way to support their families," said Luo
Chuntao.
</P>
<P>
Local governments began the task of helping the peasants out of
poverty by enabling them to make money through channels other than
felling trees.
</P>
<P>
A research report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences indicated
that the fertile soil in the region is very suitable for growing
fruit trees, and this paved the way to tackling this knotty
problem.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to get the peasants to lay down their
axes, local governments introduced a series of preferential
polices in 1989 encouraging them to reclaim the wastelands and
plant trees.
</P>
<P>
"Threatened by the increasing losses caused by tree-felling, I
chose to reclaim the barren area, and my husband and two sons went
into the cities to look for jobs," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang was among the few local peasants to volunteer for this
experimental project, and was honored as an "excellent contributor
" for her ten consecutive years of afforestation work.
</P>
<P>
Huang's success convinced her neighbors that trees-felling was
not the only way to raise money. Among the more than two million
peasants in the southern region of Jiangxi Province, more than 500,
000 have now followed Huang's example.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the per capita net income for peasants in the region
hit 2,034 yuan, 17 times the figure in the early 1980s. And during
the 1989-1998 period, peasants in the region planted nearly 960,
000 hectares of various trees, causing local soil-erosion areas to
decrease by 130,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, as many as two million poverty-stricken people in
Jiangxi, most of them in the southern region, are now much better
off.
</P>
<P>
In response to the afforestation plan issued by the Central
Government, Jiangxi Province has set the goal of adding more than
1.33 million hectares to its mountainous afforestation areas.
</P>
<P>
"Even without administrative orders, peasants now are willing
to plant trees," said Luo Chuntao.

<HEADLINE> Vice President on Inspection Tour of Henan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu
Jintao today completed his inspection tour of central China's
Henan Province which began on March 26.
</P>
<P>
At the construction site of the Xiaolangdi water control
project, Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China, urged the builders to diligently absorb advanced
technology and international management techniques in order to
guarantee the quality of the project.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted construction quality as the lifeblood of any
project. The Xiaolangdi water control project is closely related
to the flood-control work along the Yellow River, and full
attention should be paid to the quality of the project because
minor mistake can cause huge losses of life and property.
</P>
<P>
In Luoyang, the second largest city in Henan Province, Hu had a
discussion with managers from various major state-owned
enterprises, and said that the sound operation of state-owned
enterprises, especially medium-sized and large ones, is not only
an important economic issue but also an important political issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although many state-owned enterprises are facing
difficulties, the goal of restructuring these enterprises will
find success through the careful implementation of related
policies made by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, the vice president visited the province's
rural areas and farmers. He encouraged cadres at the grass-roots
level to do more to benefit farmers, and make even greater
contributions to the development of the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of building a clean and honest
government, urging all the officials and Party members to enhance
theoretical study, raise political awareness, and promote healthy
practices.

PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The former chief of the general
staff of the French armed forces, General Guy Mery, said Tuesday
that NATO intervention against Yugoslavia is stupid.
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, this intervention has appeared to me

President) Milosevic," Mery was quoted by the daily Aujourd'hui/le
Parisien as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mery, who was the chief of the General Staff of the French
Armed Forces from 1975 till 1980, also called on The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) not to aggravate the situation

announced Tuesday that customs officers seized 7.5 kilograms of No.
4 heroin, worth 7.5 million HK dollars, from two women Monday.

thick clothing while they were approaching the customs counter for
clearance.
</P>
<P>
Upon subsequent personal search, the drugs, being packed into a
number of packets strapped around their bodies, thigh and inside
their shoes, were uncovered.

trafficking cases at the airport. A total of 20.8 kilograms of
heroin, 8.2 kilograms of cannabis resin and 1.1 kilograms of
cocaine were seized.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 suspects were arrested. In most of the cases, the
drugs were concealed by body-packed method, and uncovered after
personal search.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs Strong Institutions: WB Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia needs to build strong
institutions to achieve sustainable economic development, outgoing
World Bank (WB) country director for Indonesia Dennis de Tray said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"During the past 32 years, the only one strong sustainable
institution was former president Soeharto," de Tray said during a
talk organized by the Indonesia Forum Foundation.
</P>
<P>
He said that when Soeharto stepped down on May 21 last year,
the country lost its strong institution.
</P>
<P>
Commenting that Soeharto's policies however caused the present
economic crisis, he said the former president has to bear the
responsibility for this.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto had produced substantial economic growth, but he did
not build strong institutions. He has to be responsible for every
decision he had made," said de Tray, who ends his term as WB
director this month.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that certain lessons could be learned from the last
two years of economic hardship in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
As some other Asian countries, Indonesia has been badly hit by
the prolonged monetary crisis since July 1997. The country's
economy has not recovered from the crisis because of political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"From the crisis, we realize that sustainable development needs
sustainable economic policies and institutions," de Tray said.
</P>
<P>
Most economic institutions in Asia are weak, he pointed out,
particularly in Indonesia whose government in the past 32 years
did not give adequate attention to the weakness of its economic
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves Economic Stimulus Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Cabinet Tuesday approved
a new economic stimulus package, which includes a broad range of
tax cuts, in a bid to kick-start the sagging economy over the next
six months.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said after the Cabinet
meeting that the new economic stimulus package was particularly
aimed at boosting private demand, both in the consumption and
investment aspects, so that there would be sufficient forces to
spur the economic growth under prevailing conditions.
</P>
<P>
The new package consists of expenditure measures, tax
reductions and measures to lower energy prices.
</P>
<P>
The tax cut would cover a value-added tax (VAT) reduction from
10 percent to the pre-crisis level of seven percent, excise tax on
fuel oil from 17.5 percent to five percent, and one baht (2.7 U.S.
cents) per kilogram reduction in liquefied petroleum gas.
</P>
<P>
Personal income taxes will be cut by two percent, tax exemption
will be extended to earners of less than 50,000 baht (1,351
dollars) in net income per year, a 1.5 percent cut of VAT for
business having sale figures of between 600,000 and 1.2 million
baht (16,216 to 32,432 dollars), and 0.25 baht (0.67 cents) cut
per unit of power charge.
</P>
<P>
The package also aims to create 486,000 jobs to expand the
purchasing power of the public.
</P>
<P>
Giving prevailing macroeconomic conditions of stable exchange
rates, low interest rates and inflation, and the bottoming out of
the real economy, the government believed that these stimulus
measures would be sufficient to enable the economy to recover over
the next six months as planned, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
According to the finance minister, the fund of the new public
expenditure programs will come from three external sources,
including 250 million dollars from Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund, 600 million dollars from the Japanese
Export-Import Bank, and 600 million dollars from the World Bank.

<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The French Mirage 2000-D combat
aircraft engaged in the NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia have
succeeded in hitting all their targets in the first two nights of
strikes, said a senior French military officer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the general staff of the French armed forces,
General Jean-Pierre Kelche, displayed video images from
intelligence cameras of the Mirage 2000-D in action to a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The images show that four warehouses situated along a Serb
military airbase were destroyed by laser-guided bombs weighing 1,
000 kilograms during the first night of bombing last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mirage 2000-D also destroyed three warehouses on the second
night of bombings.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO warplanes and missiles have hit from 50 to 60
sites of the Serb military system, and that NATO has the airspace
over Yugoslavia under its control.
</P>
<P>
Kelche said the anti-air defense system was greatly "degraded
in its capacities for coordinated resistance."
</P>
<P>
The objective of Phase II of the NATO air strikes is to "make
Yugoslav President Milosevic understand that he is in the process
of losing the armor of his military system," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Serbian tank forces are being destroyed on
the ground since Phase II of the operation began to concentrate on
the Yugoslav Army ground forces.

Leblanc told Spanish sports daily Marca that relations between

<P>
But there still had some speculation that ONCE would not race

</P>
<P>
Last year, police raided ONCE's team hotels and a team doctor
was placed under investigation on doping charges. ONCE pulled out
of the Tour after that.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Launches New Aid Project in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
Red Cross (ICRC) has recently launched a new project for poor
families in the war-torn Kabul, a report here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Kabul-based ICRC Jpse Anselmo said that under the
project chicken and chick feed are being provided to poor families
who will rear the chickens and after some time they will be able
to sell chicks and eggs in the market to sustain themselves.
</P>
<P>
Anselmo said that instead of giving foodstuff to these
families, the Red Cross decided to enable them to earn their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 chickens and 12,000 kilogram chick feed have been
provided to one hundred destitute families of Kabul, said the
report of News Network International of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The financial condition of the common people in Kabul is
getting worse every day and the number of beggars and panhandlers
is increasing in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Anselmo said his organization intends to launch more projects
of this nature, which include provision of fruit trees to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has launched many projects throughout Afghanistan
including Kabul, Jalalabad, Herat, Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif,
said Anselmo.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Ahern Optimistic over Peace Deal in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Ministers Tony Blair
and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern expressed hope on Tuesday
in Belfast that a Northern Ireland peace deal could be reached
between the rival parties over disarmament which has blocked the
peace process over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
"I genuinely believe all the parties engaged in this want it to
work even more than last year," Blair told students at an
integrated college attended by Protestants and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to find a solution with the same sense of urgency
that we brought to this agreement in the first place," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Both Blair and Ahern are taking part in two days of talks
between political leaders, which could bring a major breakthrough,
or a grinding halt, to the struggling peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he was determined to get the decommissioning issue
resolved before the government's deadline on setting up Northern
Irish Assembly executive passes on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I will not stop or rest until this thing is done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the already delayed Good Friday Agreement,
the Northern Ireland Assembly's executive must be set up by the
end of this week to take over powers from the British government.
</P>
<P>
But Blair did not play down the crucial nature of the current
argument, which threatens to scuttle the Good Friday Agreement as
it approaches its first anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Ahern backed Blair's insistence that compromise must be found
over the disarmament. "We have all moved too far to think about
going back or giving up," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Struggling For Better Scores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The China Youth and Children's
Research Center did a survey on personality development of urban
children recently and found that about 82 percent of children
between the ages of 10 to 15 have no ambitions for achieving
personal success.
</P>
<P>
Further studies have shown that because of the fierce
competition in exams, most urban children feel that they are under
intense pressure, which is in inverse proportion to their desire
for success.
</P>
<P>
Study pressures inhibit students' achievement desires, says Sun
Yunxiao, the deputy director of the China Youth and Children's
Research Center, whose survey also showed that over 95 percent of
urban parents would like their children to pursue further study at
college or university. Students have the right to keep test
results to themselves, he says, it can help nurture a students'
sense of self-esteem and improve the quality of education in China.
</P>
<P>
Sun says that the current college examination system
overshadows primary and middle school education, which is totally
abnormal. Even Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has said that only five
percent of the children are lucky enough to receive a college
education.
</P>
<P>
Although almost all Chinese primary and middle schools push
students to compete for that five percent, it makes the national
college entrance examination system somewhat like gambling, he
says critically.
</P>
<P>
"The nine-year compulsory education is qualification education
not competition education. It should be a quality education open
to all students," he says, "If students come to school just for a
presentable test score, the nine-year compulsory education will
hardly improve the quality of the Chinese people, and it will be
twisted into an elimination education."
</P>
<P>
He also emphasizes that allowing students' test scores to be
seen without their permission is a type of prejudice, which
deprives them of privacy, and should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education passed regulations in 1994 stating
that teachers have no right to rank students according to their
scores or to make their scores public.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, the state education supervisor, has said that test
scores only play a small part of role in judging a student because
the scores keep changing and, since the beginning of the year,
Beijing has explicitly stated that primary and middle schools are
not to rank their students according to their test scores.
</P>
<P>
But, according to Sun, it will take 30 to 50 years to make
their test scores their own affair because it still requires the
cooperation of all of society.

decline to 7.3 percent in 2002 when the work force rises to 21.3
millions.

OTTAWA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Almost two-thirds of sexual-
assault victims are younger than 18 and close to one-third are
under 12, Statistics Canada says in a report.
</P>
<P>
Among the 30,735 incidents reported to Canadian police in 1997,
62 percent, or about 19,000, were young people under 18, says the
report released on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of the total, or about 9,200, were children of

</P>
<P>
The total of 30,735 reported sexual offenses -- 101 per 100,000
Canadians -- reflects an overall drop in violent crimes, a trend
under way for several years,
</P>
<P>
The number began climbing after 1983, and peaked in 1993, with
135 incidents per 100,000 reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Mobilizes Efforts Against Snail Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
has urged relevant departments in China to be on the alert for
possible snail fever epidemics in the areas affected by last
year's summer devastating flooding.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered here today at a national conference on
snail fever prevention and control, Li emphasized the leading role
of governments at all levels, urging local officials to be clear
about their duties and strengthen law enforcement in order to
control the disease.
</P>
<P>
Only 1,888 infectious cases of snail fever were reported
throughout the country last year, marking a successful control of
the disease, in spite of last summer's devastating flooding in
central, eastern and northeastern China, according to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the risk of new epidemics remains, Li said, and he
asked health departments to enhance treatment and surveillance,
and agricultural and water conservation departments to wipe out
freshwater snails, which is an intermediate host of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Regions along the Yangtze River and around Dongting and Poyang
lakes, where the epidemic was most serious in the past, should pay
special attention to disease prevention while conducting post-
flood construction work, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
He asked local governments to allocate the greater part of
disease-control funds to this task, and said the central
government plans to provide subsidies for this effort.

HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Futures Exchange
(HKFE) is forging ahead with the implementation of its merger with
the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK), proposed by the financial
secretary in his budget speech in early March.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with members Tuesday, Geoffrey Yeh, chairman of
the HKFE, said at a media briefing: "The current phase is to
involve the members in the process, to recognize their concerns
and to share with them our recommended plans and our approach."
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sheng, chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission
(SFC), who also attended the HKFE members' meeting, spoke at the
briefing that concerns of members would be taken into
consideration and their views be incorporated into detailed
studies.
</P>
<P>
"The task is complex and the time frame set for it is for
completion by September 30 this year," said the HKFE chairman,
referring to the demutualization, merger and listing of the two
exchanges and their associated clearing houses, a bold initiative
announced by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang early this month in
the 1999-2000 Budget.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that the HKFE divided the work into four phases -- to
appoint financial advisers, to participate in committees and sub-
groups set up by the Financial Services Bureau and the Securities
and Futures Commission, to develop recommendations for
shareholders and to implement the program.
</P>
<P>
The HKFE has already appointed Morgan Stanley Asia Limited as
financial advisor.

<HEADLINE> HK Average Payroll Increases in 4th Quarter of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Average labor earnings for all
the major sectors in Hong Kong recorded an increase of 3.2 percent
in nominal terms in the fourth quarter of 1998 over a year earlier,
according to statistics released Tuesday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
After taking into account a 0.8 percent decrease in the
composite Consumer Price Index (CPI), the corresponding increase
in real terms was 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year-on-year increase in average payroll per person
engaged was largely attributable to the pay rises effected in
early 1998 when many companies made their annual pay adjustments
upon the good business performance for most of 1997, a government
statement said.
</P>
<P>
To some extent, it was also due to increased incidence of
corporate downsizing and restructuring in the latter part of last
year, when the more experienced and skilled workers, who were
usually paid more, were retained, while those of lesser experience
and skill were retrenched.
</P>
<P>
This compositional change in employment could result in a rise
in per capita payroll, notwithstanding a decrease in total payroll
at the same time.

HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Holdings Limited (AsiaSat), Asia's leading
provider of satellite transponder capacity, announced here Monday
it suffered a loss of 9 percent in its turnover in 1998.
</P>
<P>
AsiaSat scored last year a total turnover of 903 million HK
dollars (116 million U.S. dollars) and a profit attributable to
shareholders of 463 million HK dollars (59 million U.S. dollars),
a decrease of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the unfavorable business environment, AsiaSat
successfully launched its latest satellite, AsiaSat3S, on March 21,
in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
AsiaSat Chairman Qin Xiao said that with approximately 80
percent of the company's turnover arising from the Asia-Pacific
customers, AsiaSat continued to be affected by the region's weak
economies and transponder over-supply.
</P>
<P>
"1999 will be another year full of challenges but with the
successful launch of AsiaSat3S the company is well positioned to
react to market demand as the Asian economy starts to recover," he
said.
</P>
<P>
AsiaSat provides service to both the broadcast and
telecommunications markets, covering two-thirds of the world's
population with its satellites.

in the country, one to 1.5 million liters of water is discharged
per second at the peak season in October, an official at the
Ministry of Agriculture said.
</P>
<P>
For the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC), which provides
drinking water to 16 municipalities in the country including five
cities in the Kathmandu Valley, the scenario is different.
</P>
<P>
The country as a whole has not yet faced the drinking water
shortage problem, but the Kathmandu Valley has been hit for
several years, NWSC General Manager Kaushal Nath Bhattarai told
Xinhua Tuesday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"In Kathmandu, the average daily demand is 150 million liters
and the supply is 120 million liters in the wet season (7 months)
and 70 million liters in the dry season (5 months)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So NWSC is able to meet 80 percent of demand in the wet season
and 45 percent in the dry season. The situation in other
municipalities under this corporation is satisfactory," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said due to drought, currently his corporation is supplying
drinking water 3 hours every other day in the Kathmandu
municipality, but in Bhaktapur and Lalitpur, the other two
municipalities in the Kathmandu Valley, water is supplied 8 hours
and 4 hours a day respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year there was a good winter rain as well as
a heavy summer rain, but this year there has been no winter rain,
so the surface sources are dry and the ground water level has gone
down, forcing the corporation to reduce the water supply time to 2
hours every other day in parts of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Surface and ground water are the main sources for the
corporation, the general manager said. He noted that in the wet
season, surface water accounts for 80 percent of the supply and
ground water accounts for 20 percent; in the dry season, the ratio
is 60 to 40.
</P>
<P>
He said Nepal has abundant rainfall but it is available in the
two monsoon months only and cannot be stored in bulk with low
investment.
</P>
<P>
"Even in monsoon season, we cannot supply sufficient water in
Kathmandu because the treatment capacity is only 120 million
liters a day whereas the demand is 150 million liters per day," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Kathmanduites have to install water storage
facilities. The scenario also gives rise to the water transport
service which charges 1,500 rupees (22 U.S. dollars) for one tank
of water.
</P>
<P>
In addition to insufficiency in quantity, the supplied water is
not good in quality. "Some city core areas sometimes, specially in
rainy season, face external pollution problem," General Manager
Bhattarai said, adding that residents are advised to boil the
water before drinking.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank noted in a paper in November 1998
that access to safe water is 67 percent in Nepal compared with 97
percent in Bangladesh and the South Asian average of 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is a common practice for the Kathmanduites to filter the
water before use. The well-to-do families and foreign
organizations just purchase bottled mineral water.
</P>
<P>
"The main factor for shortage of water is non-availability of
sufficient perennial water sources nearby," General Manager
Bhattarai claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said the Melamchi Water Supply Project, which is conceived
by the government to channel water to the Kathmandu Valley from
the Melamchi river about 40 kilometers northeast of Kathmandu, is
thought to be the only reliable water supply project.
</P>
<P>
"Hence fund collection to complete the project has been the
main effort," he said. Some works have been started with funding
from the Asian Development Bank and the Norwegian government, he
added.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Area Sown to Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The amount of land devoted to
crops by 0.6 percent in China this year to 156 million hectares,
according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
</P>
<P>
A recent NBS survey of 50,000 farmers found that the amount of
land sown with grain is expected to reach 114 million hectares,
slightly more than that for last year. Land for rice will increase
by 110,000 million hectares, that for wheat by 130,000 hectares,
and that for corn by 1.1 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
NBS analysts say that there will be a better crop-growing
structure with more high quality rice this year. The amount of
land for oil-bearing crops will also increase by 700,000 hectares
to 13.63 million hectares as a result of the increase in cooking
oil price.
</P>
<P>
Because of macro-economic control policies, the amount sown in
cotton will be reduced by nearly 150,000 hectares to 4.3 million
hectares, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The amount of land for sugar crops will fall considerably
because of rampant sugar smuggling, which has brought down the
price of sugar, and the amount of land for flax and tobacco will
continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that some 1.16 million hectares of arable land
will be used for tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Australian Trade Deficit in February Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's trade deficit
deteriorated to a worst-ever more than 1.5 billion Australian
dollars (945 million U.S. dollars) in February from a deficit of
1.351 billion Australian dollars (851.1 million U.S. dollars) in
January.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance on goods and services widened by 166 million
Australian dollars (104.6 million U.S. dollars) to a seasonally
adjusted 1.517 billion (955.71 million U.S. dollars) -- the worst
figure on record, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose by 85 million Australian dollars (53.5 million
U.S. dollars), or one percent, in February, mainly due to
overseas sales of Australian services.
</P>
<P>
But this was offset by soaring imports, up 251 million
Australian dollars (158.1 million U.S. dollars), or two percent,
due to a rise in purchases of goods such as food, drink, household
appliances, clothing, shoes, toys and books.
</P>
<P>
The result was worse than expected, with economists expecting
firmer exports combined with weaker imports to improve the trade
balance.
</P>
<P>
ABS said exports to major Southeast and North Asian trading
partners plunged by 8 percent in February, in original terms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports to other destinations rose by 8 percent
compared with the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Australia's largest market, Japan, fell 8 percent
while exports to South Korea, the fourth largest market, were down
24 percent, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Exports soared to the Philippines (up 27 percent), Thailand (up
19 percent) and China (up 16 percent), while sales to Indonesia
and Malaysia also rose.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set Up Trust Fund for Pig Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will set up a trust
fund to compensate pig farmers who have had to lose their pigs due
to the outbreak of the Japanese Encephalitis (JE), Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Special Task Force on the Japanese Encephalitis at its
meeting Tuesday agreed to the setting up of the trust fund and the
proposal to this effect would be tabled at the Cabinet meeting
Wednesday, Abdullah, who is chairman of the Special Task Force,
said after chairing the meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The trust fund under the auspices of the Agriculture Ministry
will pay 50 ringgit (13.157 U.S. dollars) to pig farmers for each
pig destroyed by the authorities and an additional 3 ringgit
(0.789 U.S. dollars) for every pig which the farmers in the
affected areas voluntarily decide to put down, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trust fund would also provide 10 ringgit (2.632 U.S.
dollars) for every pig farmers outside of the danger areas want to
destroy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers wishing to destroy the pigs on their own should abide
by the conditions that had been laid down such as ensuring that it
was done under supervision by the relevant authorities as it would
involve ways of disposing of the carcass afterwards, he said.
</P>
<P>
The military and police forces started destroying pigs in the
most affected areas in the southern state of Negeri Sembilan
about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 950,000 pigs would be destroyed including 350,000
from the original areas.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the pigs had to be destroyed to prevent the virus
and the disease from spreading.
</P>
<P>
The JE epidemic, said to spread from pigs to human beings via
the Culex mosquito, has not only badly affected the livelihood of
pig farmers and villagers, but also caused the death of more than
50 people so far.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Further Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 30 (Xinhua) -- In a report delivered to
parliament Tuesday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin appealed for
more reform to make Russia's economy competitive, developmentally
harmonious, highly technological and suitable to meet the new
challenges posed by the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This year's highest priority is to stabilize the effects of the
economic crisis, which erupted last year. The budget situation
must be normalized, the market system needs to be improved and
domestic and international debts should be reduced, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
He said the course taken in 1991 of a "root and branch" reform
of the Russian economy, which includes the creation and
development of market institutions and the gradual entering into
the world system, was and remains correct.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the economic crisis to the imbalance and
disharmony of political power, lack of attention to the social
mood, plus a sustained budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
In an annual state of the nation address to the two chambers of
parliament Tuesday, Yeltsin urged the government to bring the
country out of crisis and enhance the Russian economy's
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin praised the work of the government, which is led by
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, saying they prevented Russia's
economy from a dramatic slide
</P>
<P>
In the report, the president said the constitution should not
be revised before the new parliament is elected.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin appealed for a just and fair general election, which is
due to occur in the next 16 months. He urged the Ministry of
Justice to forbid parties and groups, which have a history of
violating the constitution and stirring up national, social or
religious extremism, from participating in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the Chechen issue, Yeltsin attributed the tension
there to national extremism. He advocated strong curbs on
separatism.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized strikes on organized crimes. He said that
Russia must struggle with illegal activities inside the governing
body without any complicity to prevent crime and corruption.

JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government decided at a
special cabinet meeting Tuesday to send medicine, blankets and
clothes to Kosovo refugees in Albania, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
A cargo plane will leave for Albania later Tuesday or
Wednesday, and Albania has accepted the Israeli offer of
humanitarian assistance, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
After the special meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's

suffered "similar genocide being experienced by Kosovo refugees."
</P>
<P>
But the statement said Israel will not be involved in any
operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has decided to neither
explicitly condemn Serbia by name nor support the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization bombing in Kosovo, which entered its sixth
day.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Sharon urged all sides in the Kosovo conflict to
return to the negotiating table and resolve their dispute
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Local Haaretz newspaper quoted an advisor to Sharon as
explaining that Serb assistance to Jews during the Holocaust more
than 50 years ago is playing a key role in Israel's decision to
refrain from commenting on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Another advisor pointed out that, as the conflicting sides in
Kosovo have been killing each other for generations, "you cannot
single out just one party (to blame).

PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac said in his televised speech
Monday evening that it is justified for NATO to intervene against
what he called ``barbarism'' in Kosovo, but he also said that
France is ready to seek a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 100,000 Kosovo Albanians have arrived in
neighboring countries as the Serbs are emptying Kosovo of ethnic
Albanians. Horrifying testimonies were given by the refugees on
arrival at the borders.
</P>
<P>
-- While officially a ground intervention by NATO is always
excluded, the military circles of France and Britain are talking
about plans to send from 100,000 to 200,000 troops to Yugoslavia.
Meanwhile, three former heads of U.N. peacekeeping forces, General
Philippe Morillon, General Jean Cot, and General Michael Rose,
have criticized the NATO ``airstrike only'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia has started an initiative to relaunch the political
efforts to stop the conflict.
</P>
<P>
-- As the governments of Western countries refuse to plan the
sending of ground forces to Kosovo, the generals of NATO in
Brussels have worked out a hypothesis of a 200,000-men force. But
the conclusion of such studies is that it is particularly delicate
to implement such an operation.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Victory in Drug Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police dealt with more
than 180,000 drug-related crimes last year, 119 of them each
involving more than 10 kilograms of heroin.
</P>
<P>
They also caught more than 230,000 people suspected of criminal
activity, the Beijing-based Legal Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The various kinds of drugs seized by police amounted to nearly
17 tons, the Daily said. It covered a national conference of
police chiefs involved in drug control work in the city of Kunming,
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted conference delegates as saying that China had
some success last year in the drug fight, but there is still a
long way to go.
</P>
<P>
According to Public Security Ministry officials, the amount of
drugs coming from outside China is still a serious problem, and
drug production bases like the Golden Triangle, Golden Crescent,
Central Asian countries, countries near northeastern China, and
the southeastern coast continue to pose a grave threat.
</P>
<P>
China used to be just a conduit for drugs, but it has in recent
years turned out to be a consumer as well, with more drug addicts
and more varieties of drug-related crimes being reported, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The conference has focused on rehabilitating addicts and
cutting the number of domestic consumers, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Serb Ceasefire Won't Halt NATO Bombing: UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) - Britain said Tuesday that an
immediate ceasefire by the Serb forces in Kosovo will not be
enough to stop NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC radio that NATO will not
support the idea of a unilateral Yugoslav ceasefire in Kosovo,
saying it will leave Belgrade's forces in charge of the region.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made as Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
arrived in Belgrade for talks.
</P>
<P>
If Primakov could persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to accept the peace plan agreed in France, "it would be
welcome", Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"I see no sign at present that Belgrade is willing to do that
and certainly we could not accept simply Milosevic calling a
ceasefire leaving him in control of the territory which he has
claimed from the Kosovo Albanians," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any settlement to end the fighting in Kosovo will have to
involve Kosovo Albanians being allowed to return with an
international guarantee for their safety, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has accused Belgrade of trying to "ethnically cleanse"
Kosovo of its majority Albanians, while Yugoslavia repeatedly said
they experienced more attacks recently from the Albanian forces in
Kosovo who were clearly encouraged by NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
The West-sponsored Kosovo peace plan allows Kosovo to enjoy "
substantial autonomy" and requires Western troops to monitor the
implementation of the plan in the region. Both of the requests
were strongly rejected by Yugoslav government which said these
settlements violate its integration and sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says More Attacks Needed to End Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Tuesday that NATO should send more bombers to take part in
the air strikes on Yugoslavia to help end the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The answer to what is happening is to intensify air strikes,"
a Reuter report quoted Blair as saying in Belfast, the capital of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair is on a visit to Northern Ireland, where he is trying to
help end a stalemate threatening the future of the British-ruled
province's peace deal.
</P>
<P>
His statement backed the United States decision to send more
bombers to take part in NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Blair also said ground troops would be needed once a settlement
had been found. But he said the ground forces would not fight
their way into the region.
</P>
<P>
He rebutted suggestions that the NATO air strikes were
responsible for the hundreds of thousands of refugees now fleeing
the region, the Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
There are now more and more reports in western media accused
that NATO is to blame for the floods of refugees escaping from
Yugoslavia, which has been under NATO bombardment for almost a
week.

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said here today that the United States and
China have made "some important progress" in negotiations over
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"Substantial gaps remain, however, in critical areas of trade,
and there are complex issues in front of us," she said in a
statement to the press following her long meeting with Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
She said her meetings with Zhu and State Councilor Wu Yi here

</P>
<P>
The discussions will be held between a team led by Robert
Cassidy on the U.S. side and Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, for the

</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side will set no artificial deadlines in these
negotiations," she said. "Progress will only be driven by
substance."
</P>
<P>
She added that the United States supports China's membership in
the WTO, but "China's accession must be on the basis of a broad
commercially-meaningful package that opens China's goods, services
and agricultural markets to our goods, services and agricultural
providers."
</P>
<P>
She also expressed appreciation of China's efforts for WTO
membership and said that "China has evidenced substantial
understanding of the level of reforms necessary for it to join the
WTO".
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky arrived here on Monday for a 24-hour visit to China,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Continues Working with China on WTO Entry, Daley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Commerce
William Daley said here today that the U.S. will continue working
with China on its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
But, Daley told a press conference here prior to leaving for
Shanghai, it is too much to expect that all issues can be
completely resolved during Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the
United States scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
There has been tremendous progress, he said, but the idea of a
deadline is unrealistic. The U.S. has been working with China on
entering the WTO and will continue to do so until it is completed,
whether this week, next week, or later, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that trade problems between the United States and
China should be addressed in a cooperative way, not by
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States strongly disagrees with China on the
Kosovo issue, it continues the engagement policy and is looking
forward to Zhu's visit.
</P>
<P>
Daley arrived here Sunday afternoon for a five-day visit at the
invitation of Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Shi Guangsheng. He brought an infrastructure trade mission of 18
companies.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital, Daley met with Zhu Rongji and State
Councilor Wu Yi and described their talks as "open and frank".
</P>
<P>
Daley and his party will visit Shanghai and Guangdong province
as well.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Deputy PM Visits Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council (SPDC) and Prime Minister Than Shwe
met with visiting Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
here Tuesday, state-run Myanmar News Agency reported Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Lee arrived in Yangon Tuesday morning on a two-day goodwill
visit to Myanmar at the invitation of Khin Nyunt, First Secretary
of the Myanmar SPDC.
</P>
<P>
Lee also met with Khin Nyunt the same day.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not disclose further details.
</P>
<P>
Lee's visit came more than a month after Myanmar Foreign
Minister U Win Aung officially visited Singapore, one of his
four-ASEAN-nation trips (Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand) in February.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, a three-minister Singapore economic
delegation, made up of Minister of Trade and Industry Lee Yock
Suan, Minister of Communication Mah Bow Tan and Minister of
National Development Lim Hng Kiang, visited Yangon, reaching with
Myanmar an agreement on avoidance of double taxation at the third
meeting of the two countries' Joint Ministerial Working Committee
(JMWC).
</P>
<P>
The JMWC meeting also discussed cooperation in agriculture,
livestock farming, tourism, trade and human resources development
under the bilateral economic cooperation program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March last year, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong also made a 24-hour official visit to Yangon, during which
the two countries reached a memorandum of understanding on mutual
exemption of visas for holders of diplomatic and official
passports.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Myanmar and Singapore has
developed in recent years along with exchange of visits between
state leaders and high ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Singapore's investment in
Myanmar reached 1.484 billion U.S. dollars in 67 projects at the
end of 1998, ranking the first among the 23 countries and regions
which have a total investment of 7.089 billion dollars in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The investment projects cover hotels and tourism,
manufacturing, real estate, industrial estate, construction and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Myanmar and Singapore have a
bilateral trade volume of 992.39 million dollars in 1998, in which
Singapore's export to Myanmar accounted for 88.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Reiterates Stance on Nansha Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman today reiterated China's stance toward the Nansha
Islands in the South China Sea, saying that the principle of "
making joint development while leaving disputes aside" will help
maintain peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remarks at a press conference here
this afternoon when asked to comment on the recent maintenance of
anti-wind facilities in Meiji Reef of the Nansha Islands.
</P>
<P>
"For natural reasons, the anti-wind facilities built for
fishermen in Meiji Reef could not be used anymore. China's local
fishing administrations maintained and refixed the facilities
accordingly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun reaffirmed that China's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands
and surrounding sea areas is "unarguable."
</P>
<P>
"We hope to resolve the problem through dialogue and
consultation," the spokesman said, adding that China is ready to
solve disputes in line with international laws.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to carry out bilateral cooperation with
relevant countries in a bid to prevent the complication of the
matter."
</P>
<P>
He said China's stance to ensure peace and stability in the
South China Sea remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In a recent working group meeting between China and the
Philippines on mutual-trust buildup, the two sides agreed to keep
a restraint attitude and not to take any action that may
complicate the situation.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slumps on Record Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A blow-out in the Australian
trade deficit to a record level damaged the Australian dollar
Tuesday, knocking it back almost half a U.S. cent.
</P>
<P>
The wider-than-expected February trade deficit of a seasonally
adjusted 1.517 billion Australian dollars (955.7 million U.S.
dollars) was markedly worse than economists had predicted.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was trading at 62.93 U.S.
cents from Monday night's finish of 63.33, after spending the day
between 62.78 and 63.25 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the data release the Australian dollar was
trading at 63.17 and it was pushed lower to the 62.90 area soon
after.
</P>
<P>
Following the release of the figures, economists warned that in
the months ahead the goods and services trade deficit would likely
remain within reach of the record level posted in February.
</P>
<P>
"When you have a strong domestic economy and our major trading
partners are doing it tough then the result is a widening in our
external deficits," Michael Blythe, senior economist with
Commonwealth Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Another economist said data released in Japan Tuesday showing a
seasonally adjusted 4.6 percent unemployment rate also damaged the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was buying 0.5860 euro from
0.5889 Monday, while the Australian dollars was trading at 75.53
Japanese yen from 75.13 Monday.

BERLIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said Monday that NATO would continue air strikes on
Yugoslavia and there is no definite date for the end of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
NATO must continue to launch air attacks on Yugoslavia to
destroy the combat capability of the Yugoslav armed forces and
special police, Solana said in an interview with a German
television.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO would not send ground troops to Kosovo until
Belgrade reached a peace agreement with ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Solana praised Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov for
going to Belgrade to seek a solution to the Kosovo crisis. He
wished Primakov would be successful in his efforts.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched massive air strikes against Yugoslavia last
Wednesday, attempting to submit Belgrade by force. But more and
more people, including many westerners believe that air raids
cannot solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>

Primakov is expected to first meet Milosevic in Belgrade, and
then to Bonn on Tuesday to meet German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, who is now the rotating president of the European Union.

Yang Runzhen, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese Land Group, said after a meeting of the land
fund's investment committee that the average profit rate of the
fund in 1998 reached a record of 8.41 percent despite the Asian
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the land group said that real estate investors owe
the current Macao government about two billion patacas (250
million U.S. dollars). If the government can demand the payment of
land-using fees with more efforts, the land fund may approach 10
billion (1.25 billion U.S. dollars) by the time of Macao's
handover at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fund comes from the government's annual land sale,
and a major part of it is deposited in banks or used to buy bonds
which are rather safe.
</P>

The Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese Land Group is entrusted
to manage the fund on behalf of the future Macao SAR Government.

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Shenhua Project, China's
first major energy project to bring together coal mines, a railway,
a power station, and a port, has completed two thirds of its main
projects and expects to be completed by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The main construction items are the development of the Shenfu
Dongsheng Coalfield in the northern part of Shaanxi province and
the southern part of Inner Mongolia, the Baotou-Shenmu Railway,
the Shenmu-Shuozhou Railway, the Shuozhou-Huanghua Railway, and

</P>
<P>
The official said today that it will be important for energy
development in central and western China and for ensuring energy
supplies in eastern and southern China.
</P>
<P>
The construction is going well and the Shenfu Dongsheng
Coalfield now has an annual production capacity of 16.8 million
tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 172-km Baotou-Shenmu Railway and the 269-km Shenmu-Shuozhou

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Set up Tribunal over Consumers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has planned to
establish a special tribunal to protect the consumers from
sub-standard goods imported and produced by unscrupulous
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Industry and Commerce Iddi Simba told a press
conference Monday that the set-up of the tribunal is part of the
government preparations to put into effect the Fair Trade
Practices Act of 1994 in order to protect consumers and create a
more conducive environment for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Simba said that consumers' complaints will be collected by
officials from his Ministry and the culprits, whose products will
be tested by the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS), will be
brought before the special tribunal, national newspapers reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The government will any time from now appoint the chairman of
the special tribunal and the judges who will carry out the task of
hearing cases against businessmen who bring sub-standard goods
into the country or produce low quality products from their
factories," he said.
</P>
<P>
Simba said that the tribunal would operate differently from
other courts by only hearing cases of consumers complaining
against sub-standard products.
</P>
<P>
"The Fair Trade Practices Act was brought into force because a
majority of consumers do not know of their rights and hence they
need protection, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that Tanzania has planned to strengthen the
TBS in order to enable it to cope up with the new demands of
imported goods influx.

<TEXT>
<P>
The province imported 280,000 cu.m. of timber, worth 47 million
U.S. dollars, in the first two months, double the amount for the
same period last year. The increase was helped by dropping tariffs
on timber import and a national program of preserving the
country's forests.
</P>
<P>
The demand for plywood has also climbed as the price rose 70
percent over last year.

Some 88 percent of the province's timber is imported from

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Vows to Wipe Out "White Pollution" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
China's largest cotton producer in the northwest, has a plan to
get rid of the "white pollution" caused by plastic sheets that
local farmers used to use.
</P>
<P>
In the next six to seven years, according to the plan, Xinjiang
will vigorously apply plastic sheeting recovery technology and
environmental friendly products to more than 300,000 hectares of
irrigated farmland, according to Alim Kateerh, a regional
government official in charge of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang benefited greatly from the use of plastic sheeting, so
it will be the biggest victim if no alternative is found, some
experts warn.
</P>
<P>
Plastic sheeting was introduced to Xinjiang in the late 1970s
and has been widely used in agricultural production to help
increase cotton, corn, and wheat output.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show cotton output of the autonomous region doubling
with the use of the new material. With a sixth of China's land,
Xinjiang produces about a third of China's cotton thanks to the
plastic sheeting and other applications.
</P>
<P>
But, waste plastic left in fields does not decompose easily and
destroys the land and affects crops. A study in the city of Hami
found that there was an average of 38.7 kilograms of plastic
sheeting left over on every hectare of cotton field last year,
costing farmers more than 500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The plastic waste was either burned by farmers, causing serious
air pollution, or simply strewn everywhere and can be seen on the
branches of trees or electric lines.
</P>
<P>
A Xinjiang Agricultural Environment Monitoring Station employee
said that the region has benefited from the use of plastic
sheeting in the past, but now its ecology is being damaged.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Xinjiang has developed machines to
collect the plastic waste and government departments are
concentrating their efforts on developing new materials and
biodegradable plastic sheeting to replace the present sheeting.
</P>
<P>
"We'll learn a lesson from this. We want to develop the economy
and protect the environment at the same time," said Alim Kateerh.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Says Eritrea Lost 3,400 Soldiers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Tuesday its
defense forces killed, wounded or captured over 3,400 Eritrean
soldiers Monday during the heavy fighting at the western Badme
front near the Mereb river.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian government spokesperson Selome Taddesse said in a
statement issued here Tuesday morning that during Monday's
offensives near the Mereb river, "over 3,400 Eritrean soldiers
were killed, wounded or captured out of the five Eritrean brigades
that were involved in the fighting".
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian defense forces destroyed one Zu-23 anti-aircraft
weapon, eight tanks and captured one (tank)," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea resumed heavy
fighting again Monday at the Badme front after a two-day halt.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia said Sunday that its defense forces killed, wounded or
captured 13,700 Eritrean soldiers, destroyed 15 tanks and captured
four others in fightings on the Badme front between March 17 and
26.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea denied these claims Monday, saying "these figures are
completely forged," according to a report from Asmara, Eritrean
capital.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia was denying that any fighting had taken place around
Tsorona (on the central front along the border) and only
skirmishes had occurred there," an Eritrean government official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The border conflict between the Horn of Africa neighbors broke
out last May and erupted again in early February after an
eight-month lull. Eritrea occupied the disputed Badme area in
May, last year but was pushed out of the area last month.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have accepted a peace proposal put
forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) but the
diplomatic efforts to persuade both sides to accept an immediate
ceasefire have failed.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has decided to provide
automated telephone services to all district and country
headquarters throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced by Rebecca Kadaga, State Minister for
Works, Housing and Communications, at the Eighth East African
Tripartite Communications Meeting here Monday, Radio Uganda
reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the delegates from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
that in a bid to improve telecommunication services, the
government has restructured and reformed the sector, with the
Uganda Communications Commission set up as a regulatory body.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has split Uganda Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation into Uganda Telecom Limited and
Uganda Posts Limited. The Communications Bill for the
privatization of the former was passed by parliament in the
1997/1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of posts and telecommunications sector is
expected to increase telephone density, improve quality of
services and to satisfy customers' various demands. Uganda's
telephone density is three telephones for every thousand people,
one of the lowest in the region.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Warns Against Land Fragmentation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has cautioned the people in the eastern district of Tororo about
the dangers of land fragmentation and called on them to transform
their small pieces of land into viable productive units.
</P>
<P>
He issued the warning Monday when addressing Tororo district
leaders in eastern Uganda, according to a press release from the
president's office.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that most of the land in the district has been
fragmented, the president said the land can be rescued using
modern methods of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also cautioned the people about aggravating the
problem of land fragmentation with archaic inheritance practices
and advised family members to share the returns from the land
rather than cut up the land into small uneconomical units.
</P>
<P>
Farmers were urged to plan carefully so that they go into
agricultural activities that will give them high financial
returns. Agricultural experts were encouraged to give guidance on
production.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Uganda is regarded as the basket of food for the
country. The president is touring the region and campaigning for
the ruling National Resistance Movement in the coming referendum
next year.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces
have arrested 104 rebels of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army
who were found selling guns along the Uganda-Sudan border.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Monitor Daily quoted Katumba Wamala, the fourth
division commander of the Uganda defense force, as saying Monday
that the arrested were detained in the northern district of
Kitgum.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese rebels were arrested with 90 guns, he said, adding
that the Ugandan army would return the prisoners to Sudan because
they could not be charged under the Ugandan law.
</P>
<P>
However, Wamala did not give a specific date for the hand over.
 At Apyeta, 20 kms from the Sudanese border, the Sudanese rebels
and other elements are always either plundering local people's
food items or raiding their gardens.
</P>
<P>
The rebels has been fighting the Khartoum government for more
than a decade. It reportedly has more than 50,000 soldiers.
Therefore, it is the largest rebel group in southern Sudan.

<P>
The ministry has a list of priority projects for the next
century. The first 39 will be given priority in the state's annual
investment plan,depending on availability, the ministry says.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ming, the vice-minister of agriculture, said at a press
conference today that sustained development is what the reality of
China's situation calls for. The country's agricultural
productivity is still low and per capita availability of
agricultural resources is also limited, making it impossible for
the country to rely solely on further input of resources to obtain
economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu says that with the plan, China will seek sustained economic
development and hope to get more foreign investment and technology.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the country to adjust the rural economic
structure, increase investment in agriculture, and promote
regional development and foreign cooperation in the next century.
</P>
<P>
China has emphasized agricultural development over the years,
and since 1993, the ministry has had eco-agricultural development
trials in 51 counties, according to Lu.

TIRANA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- NATO spokesman Jan Joosten said
Monday that NATO did not launch attacks against Yugoslavia from
Macedonia's airspace, according to report from Skopje, the capital
of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the 12,000-strong NATO troops deployed in
Macedonia was to implement the Kosovo peace agreement once it is
signed, Joosten told the press.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that NATO's airplanes could protect Macedonia,
which is bidding for NATO membership, from possible attacks from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Joosten said that the United States had sent 1,500 marines to
Macedonia to protect the U.S. embassy there. They do not belong to
the NATO, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy was attacked last Thursday and Friday by
furious Macedonian demonstrators who protested the U.S.-led NATO's
air strikes against neighboring Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Grant Long scored 12 of his 14
points in the fourth quarter to rally the Atlanta Hawks back for
an 83-82 away win over the Indiana Pacers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The hard-won victory, second in a week, moved the Hawks within
1-1/2 games of the first-place Pacers in the Central Division as
it won 10 of their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Johnson who replaced point guard Mookie Blaylock, a
victim of flu, scored a season-high 17 points as the Hawks had
five players score in double figures, including Dikembe Mutombo
who had 14 points and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Johnson cut the deficit to 81-79 with 1:18 left before Long
buried a 17-footer from the corner to knot the game at 81-81 with
38 seconds remaining. After a miss by Indiana, Long forced a foul
with 3.4 left and sank both free throws to give Atlanta the lead.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller, who finished with 17 points for the Pacers, made
one free throw to award the victory to the Hawks by one point.
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles, Shaquille O'Neal scored 26 points, Glen Rice
scored half of his 24 in the fourth as the Lakers rolled to a 116-
98 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant added 20 points and Dennis Rodman pulled down 17
rebounds for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 21 points and Tony Massenburg had 16
and 12 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who have lost five straight and
18 of their last 19 games since beating the Lakers on February 23.
</P>
<P>
Both Gary Payton and Detlef Schempf scored 20 points apiece as
the Seattle SuperSonics opened a 21-point fourth-quarter lead and
coasted to a 109-101 win over the Dalas Mavericks who lost seven
of their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
Schempf hit 7-of-10 from the field and grabbed nine rebounds as
Seattle rebounded from Sunday's embarrassing 104-87 loss at
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
In Denver, the Los Angeles Clippers who pulled off the most
stunning upset of the season by beating Utah Jazz with huge margin
the day before yesterday, slipped to their customary pitiful form.
</P>
<P>
Chauncey Billups posted season highs with 24 points and nine
assists to lead the Denver Nuggets to a 100-88 victory over the
league-worst Clippers.
</P>
<P>
Antonio McDyess also scored 24 points and pulled down 15
rebounds and Nick Van Exel added 22 points for Denver.

<HEADLINE> Media Industry in Gulf, Mideast to See Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The media and communications
market in the Gulf and the Middle East is about to see mergers and
sales, the Khaleej Times daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The media industry will experience what the U.S. witnessed in
the mid to late 1980s and what Europe is currently
undergoing: strategic alliances, mergers and acquisitions," the
daily quoted Rakesh Wahi, development manager of the Dubai-based
Communications Development Corporation (CDC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
A shake-out in the media industry is inevitable as a result of
an expected economic downturn and low advertizing rates in the
region, said the manager.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the U.S.-based Communications Equity Associates,
CDC has been involved in a number of media and communications
projects in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that satellite television and later the
electronics industry are expected to be one of the most attractive
areas for investment.
</P>
<P>
Currently Middle East countries generate the largest chunk of
advertisement revenue from the newspaper industry, with the
television industry standing at the second, he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation will change, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, satellite televisions in the region will
have a maximum short-term gain, although electronic media is
likely to emerge as the sector with maximum growth in the next
decade, he said.

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided Monday to
shut down three Palestinian National Authority (PNA) offices in

political activities in the city. Chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat dismissed the decision as an election campaign ploy.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has decided neither to
explicitly condemn Serbs by name nor to support NATO's bombing
campaign in Kosovo. However, he will issue a blanket condemnation
over the violence against innocents and urge the parties concerned
to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The general strike in the public sector ended Monday after
the Histadrut Labor Federation and the Treasury signed a wage

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi have said cases of crime committed in March have fallen
compared to last month, as a result of the retrieval of illegal
arms.
</P>
<P>
"Some 25 guns and 95 rounds of ammunition have been recovered
since March 1," said Nairobi provincial police chief Isaac
Muthuuri who is responsible for the security in the capital and
its environs, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Also found were six pistols and an AK-47 assault rifle, whereas
several suspects were arrested in the operation, said the police.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted this month by a Nairobi firm,
the Strategic Public Relations and Research, the biggest single
worry Kenyans face is their personal security.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the ruling party Kenyan African National
Union (KANU) scored only 40 percent in its fulfillment of an
election pledge -- to make police more effective in fighting
crimes.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- World champion Lenny
Krayzelburg bettered his 200-meter backstroke American national
record with the second-best time in history on the second day of
the United States short course swimming championships in New York,
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg's winning time of one minute and 56.95 seconds
shattered his previous mark of 1:57.38 set last year.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shock to me," Krayzelburg said. "I have been feeling
really good in workouts, so I felt I should be able to go pretty
fast. I'm getting really close to the world record. This was a big
confidence boost."
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg, who won the 100m and 200m backstroke world crowns
at the World Swimming Championships in January last year in
Australia, was 38-hundredths of a second off the world record set
in 1991 by Spain's Martin Zubero.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Russian national women's
volleyball team canceled next week's exhibition tour to the United
States because of the bombing in Kosovo and shooting at the U.S.
Embassy in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Please do believe that only the unforeseen circumstances and
the present situation make it impossible for us to send our
ladies' team to your country," Valentin Joukov, president of the
Volleyball Federation of Russia, notified U.S. national volleyball
team director Bob Gambardella of the decision today.
</P>
<P>
Joukov said he was hopeful the U.S. team would still make a
scheduled trop to Moscow on June 12-20. But Gambardella said that
trip also was being put on hold.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply saddened by the current events in the Balkans,"
Gambardella said in a faxed response to Joukov today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition matches were preparation for the World Cup in
Japan in November, one of the qualifying sites for the next
Olympics.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Norway has pledged to grant
 16.1 billion shillings (about 23 million U.S. dollars) to the
Tanzanian government in development aid this year.
</P>
<P>
The assistance was announced following a two-day consultative
meeting held last week in Dar es Salaam between delegations from
the two countries which had reviewed development cooperation,
press reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main areas of support will be in roads, energy, education,
health, micro-finance, environment and political reform.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) will receive 2.5 billion
shillings while other funds would be disbursed for industrial
development and cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian delegation noted that economic situation in
Tanzania continued to be positive despite severe weather
conditions during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Norwegian delegation made commitment to
further helping Tanzania ease external debt burden.

<HEADLINE> Chinese History Museum Looking For Emblem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Museum of Chinese History has
started searching for a suitable emblem for itself, similar to
those of other prominent museums like the British Museum and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in the United States, a senior staff
member, Zhang Yanping, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that it is more than 80 years old, the
museum still has no unique symbol for itself, making it somewhat
inconvenient for cultural exchanges with foreign countries and for
its publications and souvenir business, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
They need something with national characteristics and visual
impact and have placed an advertisement in newspapers nationwide.
People will then be asked to choose a design from among all those
submitted, which will be exhibited in the museum after the
deadline of June 15.
</P>
<P>
A committee of experts that includes the prominent painter Jin
Shangyi, a famous Dunhuang scholar Chang Shana, and academician of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of
Engineering Wu Liangyong will choose the winner.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, the curator of the museum, says that this is meant
to put the museum more in the public eye to better commercialize
the business, which has traditionally been regarded as a money-
loser.
</P>
<P>
The museum was built at the former National Historical Museum
which was established in 1912 and then moved to the new site on
the east side of Tian'anmen Square in 1959.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate hits a
record high of 4.6 percent in February, reflecting the country's
severe economic situation, an official agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed also climbed to a record high of 3.13
million, posting a 27.2 percent rise from a year earlier, the
Management and Coordination Agency said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said the unemployment
figure is "severe", and he vowed to "make greater efforts" to
tackle the country's unemployment situation.
</P>
<P>
The previous jobless rate record was 4.4 percent in January
this year.
</P>
<P>
February's jobless rate for men came in at 4.7 percent against
4.6 percent for women, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job
opening for job seekers in February was 0.49, unchanged from that
in January. It means there were only 49 job opening for every 100
job seekers.

<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court (
SPC) released a set of rules today on judicial assistance between
mainland courts and those of Hong Kong in adjudicating civil and
commercial deals that took effect today.
</P>
<P>
They are based on the Basic Law of the HK Special
Administrative Region, according to Tang Dehua, vice-president of
the SPC, and are a legal document with "historic significance".
They are expected to play an important role in guaranteeing quick
and fair settlements in civil and commercial disputes. They also
symbolize the effectiveness of the "one country, two systems'
policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expected to see more legal assistance between Hong Kong
and mainland courts, promoting common prosperity and development.
</P>
<P>
The rules require all legal documents to be served through a
provincial-level people's courts or higher and the High Court of
the Hong Kong SAR. The SPC can also directly commission the High
Court of the Hong Kong SAR to serve its legal documents by
submitting a letter of commission within at least two months after
it is received.

CHANGCHUN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in the northeastern

using man-made milk substitutes.
</P>

According to Zhao Shulan, a zookeeper, the 4-month-old
chimpanzee now weighs three kilograms, eats four meals a day and
swings from a bar. It has been dressed in clothes to keep it warm.
</P>
<P>
The baby chimpanzee was born on November 12, 1998 to a 10-year-
old father and a 12-year-old mother. The two chimps were gifts of
the Japanese city of Sendai after it established friendly ties
with Changchun in 1993.

The mother deserted the baby chimp soon after it was born. It

HAVANA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- President of Cuban National
Assembly Ricardo Alarcon on Monday condemned NATO attacks against
Yugoslavia as a "virtual war against international rights"
threatening the existence of United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The so-called humanitarian intention of NATO action was carried
out by missiles and bombs that have made numerous victims, Alarcon
told the press here.
</P>
<P>
"It is a virtual war against international rights and the very
idea of civilization, because it brutally attacks a country that
neither strikes another, nor exceeds its frontiers by an action of
this type," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. bases its birth on the necessary prevention of
conflicts, but NATO air strikes have put in danger the existence
of the international body, he added.

The Cuban government strongly criticized NATO military
operation against Yugoslavia.

WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. computer experts said a
new computer virus, called "Melissa macro" or W97M Melissa virus,
has attacked more than 50,000 computers at about 100 sites around
the world, the Associated Press said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new virus spreads via infected E-mail and attacks computers
loaded with Microsoft's Word 97 or Word 2000 programs, according
to Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), Carnegie Mellon
University.
</P>
<P>
The new virus can allow documents to be E-mailed to other
people without warning, which is a potential security breach
affecting businesses and governments.
</P>
<P>
CERT experts said that if a computer user opens an infected
word-format document, the virus propagates itself by reading the
user's e-mail address book and sending an infected message to the
first 50 entries.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts said, the virus may not cause direct
damage to a computer's memory or programs.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Industrial Production Slows Down in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial production
recorded an estimated year-on-year growth of 10.3 percent in the
first quarter of this year, 0.7 percent behind the target set by
the National Assembly, Vietnam Investment Review reported.
</P>
<P>
The figure is also 2.7 percent down from the first quarter of
1998, the English newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Total industrial output in the first quarter of this year
reached 2.86 billion U.S. dollars, about 997 million dollars of
which was produced in March, according to Vietnam's General
Department of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Production in Vietnam's state-owned enterprises grew just 4.3
percent during the period, valued at 1.26 billion U.S. dollars.
The March figure was 445 million U.S. dollars, a mere 3.3 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested enterprises, including those in the oil and
gas sectors, registered a growth rate of 22.6 percent, with a
production value of 987 million U.S. dollars, accounting for
nearly one third of Vietnam's industrial output in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese economists attributed the slow growth in industrial
production to stagnant demand in the country and the
economically-hobbled Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"Overall industrial output of the first three months of this
year was in a downward trend from last year's period, mostly due
to the worsening slump of domestic market demand," Vietnam
Investment Review quoted the General Department of Statistics as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Difficulties with low market consumption have caused some
industries to cut back their production," it added.

<P>
PYONGYANG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A leading newspaper of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Monday that
Japan's request to take part in the so-called inspection of DPRK's
underground facilities is totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Rodong Sinmun made it clear in a commentary that U.S. officials
have been invited to visit, not to inspect, these facilities under
an agreement reached between Pyongyang and Washington.
</P>
<P>
DPRK has never invited Japan to the implementation of the
agreement and Japan has made such a request in order to gain
something for itself, it said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also slammed South Korea for saying that the DPRK-
U.S. agreement aims to force Pyongyang to give up its nuclear
development program, describing such an allegation as an insult to
the DPRK people.
</P>
<P>
It said DPRK has been faithfully implementing the provisions of
the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement and has never built any nuclear
facilities.
</P>
<P>
It added that what Japan and South Korea had said brought to
light their anti-DPRK stand and their purpose to overrule the
outcome of the fourth DPRK-U.S. negotiations on the DPRK
underground facilities.

<HEADLINE> Coconut Pest Threatens Sri Lankan Plantations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A coconut pest has been attacking
Sri Lanka's coconut plantations and has already destroyed 30
percent of crop in the worst affected areas, officials with the
Coconut Research Institute (CRI) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pest, identified as Aceria Guerreronis, is so small that it
cannot be seen with the naked eye, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture has enforced strict quarantine
measures in the affected Kuliyapitiya and neighboring areas in
North Western Province.
</P>
<P>
The CRI has warned of the possibility of the pest spreading to
other areas and requested coconut growers to promptly notify any
pest incidence.
</P>
<P>
The pest has been reported to be a serious pest of coconut in
Latin America, Africa, and more recently in southern India.
</P>
<P>
As wet conditions are conducive to pest population buildup, the
rainy weather that prevailed Sri Lanka during the second half of
last year could have accelerated its multiplication in large
proportions.
</P>
<P>
The pest is said to cause serious damage to nuts by sucking the
sap, resulting in malformed and small-sized nuts, immature nutfall
and drying of the outer skin appearing in patches.

SOFIA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian transportation sector has
suffered direct losses of 6.85 million Deutsche marks (3.84
million U.S. dollars) in the first three days of NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia, Transport Minister Wilhelm Kraus said Monday
here.
</P>
<P>
From March 25 to 27, road transportation registered an average
loss of two million Deutsche marks (1.12 million dollars) daily,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the decrease of passengers, Bulgarian passenger trains
were running almost empty while only three freight trains traveled
between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He added as more than 60 percent of goods had been hauled by
land between Bulgaria and the European Union countries, Bulgaria's
largest trade partner, through Yugoslavia, businessmen had now to
pay more fees for detours through Romania and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Air transportation lost 40,000 Deutsche marks (22,400 dollars)
in the three days.
NATO should compensate for all the losses thus incurred to
Bulgaria, the minister demanded.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister Predicts Quick Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda predicts an economic recovery "within the next four
or five months" thanks to a stimulus package launched on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The package envisages sweeping tax cuts and an injection of 53
billion baht (1.43 billion U.S. dollars) to boost liquidity and
prop up the flagging domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said in remarks made public on Tuesday that the package
was not the only measure, as additional measures might be
necessary to simulate the economy on a continual basis. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said the economy had already improved greatly in the past
year but more was required to kick-start business activities,
employment and consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
"In the past year, the economy is better. The exchange rate is
more stable, inflation is not higher than expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the private sector's debts were still high
and people's spending had dropped.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans (NPL) have risen to almost 50 percent of
total lending portfolios of financial institutions. However, with
the slowing down of growth of the NPLs and the passage of the new
bankruptcy and foreclosure laws, Tarrin said he believed the NPLs
would decline to about 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, however, cautioned against
overoptimism, saying it was not possible for the economy to
rebound quickly after the stimulus package was put into practice.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, the government will carry out tax cuts that
cover a value-added tax reduction from 10 to seven percent, an
excise tax cut on fuel oil from 17.5 to five percent, one baht/kg
reduction in liquefied petroleum gas, a two percent
across-the-board reduction in personal income taxes and increased
deductible amounts, tax exemption for earners of less than 50,000
baht (1,351 dollars) in net income per year.
</P>
<P>
It also includes the waiver of a 1.5 percent VAT for a business
which has a sale figure of between 600,000-1.2 million baht
(16,216-32,432 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Up to 15 Refugees Killed by NATO Bombs:Australia Aid Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- At least nine and possibly up to
15 refugees had been killed in Yugoslavia as two refugee centers
near the country's capital were severely damaged by NATO bombings,
an Australian aid group operating in Yugoslavia said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The number of injured is still unknown ... and four other
refugee centers may also have been damaged by (NATO) bombs," said
Steve Pratt, head of Yugoslavia operations of Australia's aid
group Care Australia.
</P>
<P>
The two refugee centers were near the city of Nis, southeast of
Belgrade, Care Australia said in a statement received by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The centers, part of a network of centers housing Bosnian,
Croatian and Serbian refugees, usually provided shelter for a
combined total of 85 refugees, mostly elderly women and children
that fled Bosnia during the 1995 conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugee centers were old military barracks
abandoned by the Yugoslav military more than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"They were not directly hit, they don't seem to have been
deliberately targeted. But they were within 100 or perhaps 200
meters of other military targets that had been hit and these
centers were close enough to suffer severe damage and to create
fatalities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one refugee had been confirmed killed in Kosovo's
capital of Pristina in a refugee center close to police
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"Again this was a refugee center too close to a NATO target. I
suppose this is the way things are in war but it is extremely
sad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Fraser, chairman of Care Australia, launched an appeal
for Yugoslavian refugees Tuesday morning in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Care Australia's field staff confirmed tens of thousands of
refugees were moving into Montenegro while up to 100,000 people
were moving into Albania.
</P>
<P>
"And Macedonia must now have reached the point where it cannot
take any more refugees because of its own general ethnic balance
and so what we are seeing here now is a catastrophic movement of
people in all directions. We are talking about 100,000 in two or
three days," said Pratt.

<HEADLINE> Metallurgical Industry Leads Energy Conservation Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry
led all other industrial sectors in energy conservation during
1998, according to Shan Yihe, deputy director of the State
Administration of Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
 Shan told Xinhua News Agency today that the sector saved six
million tons of standard coal valued 3.4 billion yuan during the
year.
</P>
<P>
 The average amount of standard coal used to produce one ton
of iron and steel dropped to 1.29 tons, down 58 kg. on the 1997
level, said Shan.
</P>
<P>
 China's metallurgical industry raised its annual output from
80 million tons in 1993 to well over 100 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
 However, falling prices since 1994, combined with rising
costs for raw materials, fuel and transportation, caused the
sector's profits to fall dramatically from 29.4 billion to only
two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
 "Fierce competition has forced the industry to rely on energy
conservation and reducing costs to offset losses." Shan said.
</P>
<P>
 Metallurgical experts attribute the industry's excellent
performance in 1998 to active measures related enterprise adopted
to optimize their production structures.
</P>
<P>
 Shan noted that China's metallurgical industry consumes
substantially more energy than its foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
 He cited the main reasons as the lower quality of energy and
raw materials used by the sector, as well as the lack of advanced
energy conservation technology."
</P>
<P>
 "However, this also indicates the great potential for saving
energy." said Shan.
</P>
<P>
 He disclosed that the industry will work diligently to
fulfill its target of reducing energy consumption required to
produce a single ton of iron and steel to one ton of standard coal
by the year 2003.

<P>
Experts note that medium- to large-sized enterprises are the
primary force involved in the bulk of overseas projects. They also
point out that overseas projects accelerated the development of
related domestics industries which supply most materials and
facilities.

Most contract involve small to medium-sized projects in Asian

<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the newspapers carry front-page reports on a refugee
exodus from Kosovo amid a new wave of NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian home buyers will soon be able to borrow money
with the same certainty about interest rates offered by U.S.
mortgagees as the National Australia Bank is using a U.S.
subsidiary to develop a home loan with a 30-year fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Anger of the Liberal Party in New South Wales state over
Saturday's disastrous election performance turned up a notch
Monday when Peter Collins, ousted four months before the election
as leader of the party, denounced those who ousted him and called
for resignation of the party's state director Remo Nogarotto.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>

The Australian Financial Review:
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gasoline Price Posts Record Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The average retail price for
unleaded gasoline in the United States jumped a record 6.5 cents
this week to 1.082 U.S. dollars a gallon, the Department of Energy
(DOE) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest increase in fuel costs since the DOE began
tracking weekly gasoline prices in August 1990. Last week's
average price stood at 1.017 dollars a gallon, the first time
gasoline topped 1 dollar a gallon in over four months.
</P>
<P>
The price of gasoline has increased this month by almost 17
cents a gallon and the current price is 5.2 cents higher than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Fuel costs are rising due to higher crude oil prices caused by
the oil producers' promised cuts in oil output, and refinery
shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) signed an agreement last Tuesday for tough new
export limits to remove just over 1.7 million barrels per day(bpd)
from the world crude market. Non-OPEC countries Mexico, Norway,
Oman and Russia also have promised their cooperation and will cut
their own production by another 388,000 bpd, bringing total curbs
to 2.1 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a fire last week at a Chevron Corp. oil refinery
in California, which can handle 240,000 bpd, continues to disrupt
gasoline refining at the facility.

<HEADLINE> Anti-NATO Demonstration Held in Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 Portuguese staged a
demonstration in front of the U.S. embassy in Lisbon on Monday to
protest against NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Shouting slogans such as "No force" and "We want peace",
demonstrators demanded that NATO immediately halt its military
action against Yugoslavia and seek peaceful ways to solve the
Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
An angry protester, who described the large-scale bombing
launched by NATO as a bad example, said that the NATO's action
would not help settle the Kosovo issue, but would rather intensify
the crisis and lead to more casualties.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the opposition People's Party asked the
parliament to give a clear picture of what stand Portugal is
taking in the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia and the Communist
Party accused the government of having a hand in the military
action.

COLOMBO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will invest six billion
U.S. dollars in infrastructure in the next 10 years to develop the
power sector, transport, industrial parks and environment
projects, the official Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Infrastructure Investment (BII) has already
invested 500 million dollars in a housing project and a combined

</P>
<P>
The report quoted BII Director General Ranjith Thabrew as
saying that its primary goal was to help provide a correct climate
for infrastructure investment in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for overseas private capital inflows for
infrastructure development and also urged local financial
institutions and investors to provide financing for it.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka needs to develop medium- to long-term project credit
facilities and primary and secondary rupee-bond market to finance
infrastructure development, said Thabrew.
</P>
<P>
He said the crucial elements of structural policy for private
sector investment were already in place. These include trade
policy, tax incentives, competition, regulatory policy and
corporate governance.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Monday that his country will continue to resist the
ongoing NATO attacks resolutely and effectively.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic briefed his Belarussian counterpart Alexander
Grigorievich Lukashenko in a phone talk on the latest developments

to achieve their goals.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Serbs have never yielded to force and will not now
yield to anyone."

Milosevic accused NATO of spreading lies and rumors and pointed
out that it is NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia that have led to the
current crisis in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his gratitude to President Lukashenko and the
Belarussian people for their firm support to the Yugoslav people
in their struggle against the "war of aggression" launched by the
U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, on his part, denounced the NATO military strikes on
Yugoslavia, saying that the aggression against a sovereign and
independent state posed a direct threat to peace and stability of
Europe and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Belarus' strong support for Yugoslavia's resistance
to the NATO attacks, pledging to render all necessary aid to the
Yugoslav people.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar Has New View Of Dunhuang Grottoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Research on the Dunhuang Grottoes
on China's Silk Road usually places this period of magnificent art
somewhere between 366 A.D. and 1368, but a Chinese scholar at the
Dunhuang Research Institute is determined to re-write this history
by adding 567 years.
</P>
<P>
Hu Tongqing, who is in his 40s, has spent years at the
institute in Lanzhou in the capital of Gansu Province, which
contains both the caves and the Silk Road, and came to this
conclusion after years of analyzing mountains of documents and
files.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang art came to light in 1900, when a Taoist named Wang
Yuanlu discovered nearly 50,000 documents and pieces of art in one
of the 492 caves at Dunhuang, which are also known as the Mogao
Grottoes. Since then, thousands of Chinese and foreign scholars
have come to study these unique stone sculptures and documents.
</P>
<P>
It was generally accepted that the work on them started in 366,
when the first of the Mogao caves was dug by a Buddhist monk, Le
Zun, and ended in 1368. And it was further agrees that only the
caves and artwork produced in that time period can be referred to
as Dunhuang Art, because of its unique style. Everything made
after 1368 is considered rough and not to be included in Dunhuang
Art.
</P>
<P>
However, Hu Tongqing insists that, among the 492 caves, 221
have a large number of artworks produced between 1368 and 1935.
Some of the work of this period, he says, is as fine and beautiful
as that of the 366-1368 period.
</P>
<P>
Most of the wooden structures and buildings were also built
during the latter period, he says, and that the end of Dunhuang
Art should be given as 1935, when the Jiuceng (Nine-Story)
Pavilion, the most important and eye-catching building in the
Mogao Grottoes, was rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, most of the artwork of the latter period is
related to Taoism, which is a major religion whose artwork is
seldom seen among relics from the earlier period.
</P>
<P>
But, people have paid little attention to Dunhuang relics made
after 1368 and they have not been protected so well, Hu says, and
is asking the authorities to take greater steps to protect this
Dunhuang Art.
</P>
<P>
Hu's views are shared by some Dunhuang scholars elsewhere.
Professor Zheng Binglin of Lanzhou University speaks highly of Hu
and says that this new opinion really reflects historical truth
and is good for research on Dunhuang and for protecting the
artwork.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses NBA Star Sprewell Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A judge today dismissed a
lawsuit refiled by Latrell Sprewell against the NBA and the Golden
State Warriors, stemming from his well-chronicled attack on coach
P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court for Northern California Judge Waughn
Walker today rejected the complaint filed by Sprewell, who is
currently with the New York Knicks, and ordered him and his
attorneys to pay all legal costs of the NBA and the Warroirs.
</P>
<P>
Walker dismissed the original lawsuit on July 30, but Sprewell
went against the recommendation of the judge and refiled it,
claiming the Warriors and the NBA acted improperly after the
December 1, 1997 incident at practice in which he choked Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell accused the NBA of shredding and doctoring crucial
documents in the investigation of the matter and denied attacking
Carlesimo a second time, something the Warriors and the league
contend.
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleged a violation of Sprewell's civil rights
and racial discrimination against him, claiming there is a double
standard for blacks and whites in punishment and contract terms.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and expect that Judge Walker's decision now puts this
matter to rest for both Latrell and the NBA," NBA chief legal
officer Jeffrey A. Mishkin said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Thompson, an attorney for Sprewell, said his side will
appeal today's ruling.
</P>
<P>
"Latrell knew there would be negative publidcity and we knew
it would be unpopular," Thompson said. "But we feel strongly about
the discrimination issue and we're not about to give up now."
</P>
<P>
The orginal lawsuit was for $30 million, while the second suit
was for unspecified damages. The lawsuit hoped to cap the penalty
for his attack on Carlesimo at $1 million, the cost in salary of
his original 10-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell saw Warroirs management terminate the two-plus years
and $23.7 million of his contract after the original suspension.
The following day, the NBA banned Sprewell for one year - the
longest non-drug sanction in league history.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell filed grievances against the Warriors and the NBA.
His contract was reinstated and the ban was reduced by five months
after an arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
Although Sprewell was considered a winner after the ruling by
NBA arbitrator John Feerick, the original lawsuit claimed that the
action by the Warriors and the league was too severe.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell sat out 68 games, which translated to $6.4 million in
lost salary.
</P>
<P>
When the lockout was lifted on January 21, the Warriors
shipped Sprewell to the Knicks for guard John Starks and forwards
Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Confirms He Wants to Co-Owning Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan confirmed today
he has had preliminary discussions about co-owning the Charlotte
Hornets.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three months retired from the NBA as a player, Jordan
is considering a move back to the league as a team owner.
</P>
<P>
"In response to reports, I can confirm that I have been
contacted by George Shinn and David Stern regarding co-ownership
of the Charlotte Hornets," Jordan said in a release today issued
through agent David Falk's office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Hornets and NBA officials revealed that Jordan showed his
interest earlier this month in buying a 50 percent of the NBA
franchise.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage however, the discussions are very preliminary
and I am unsure whether I will be able to make an investment on
terms that are acceptable to me," Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, as a North Carolina native, I would welcome the
opportunity to be involved in growing the Hornets into an elite
NBA team," Jordan said. "It would be premature to comment any
further."
</P>

servicemen working with NATO or studying in NATO member countries,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Leonid Ivashov, head of the ministry's International Military
Cooperation Department, said there was no possibility of
continuing cooperation with NATO because of its military strikes
against Yugoslavia.

Russia would work with NATO only in humanitarian projects,

Sergeyev would not meet with NATO officials in the near future.

<P>
BUCHAREST, March 29 (Xinhua)-- Four Boeing airliners of the
Yugoslav Airlines (JAT) on Monday landed at the Baneasa airport
here to avoid intensifying NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Transport Ministry said in a statement JAT had
requested for the landing, which was approved by Romania in line
with relevant international civil aviation regulations. But the
landing's length of the airliners just with crew members on board
had not been decided, said a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Romanian Defense Ministry on the same day denied
press reports that Romania on Friday permitted a Russian airplane
flying over its airspace to transport arms to Yugoslavia. No
Russian military or civilian airplanes had entered Romanian
airspace since NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on
Wednesday, it stressed.

<HEADLINE> Dancing Belgraders Show Defiance of NATO Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Yugoslavs
gathered in central Belgrade Monday to attend a concert for the
second day to show their defiance against NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
Air-raid alarm was cleared shortly after 07:00 (05:00GMT) in
the morning and no more air sirens were heard in the capital
during the day.
</P>
<P>
The Belgraders were still immersed in the joy over the downing
of a U.S. F-117a stealth bomber Saturday night, the first time
that the type of high-tech aircraft went down in combat.
</P>
<P>
Many danced to the live music provided by popular bands at the
Republic Square, overlooked by the statue of Knez Mikhajlo, a
national hero that fought foreign invaders in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of NATO bombings in other parts of the
country during the day amid news that Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov will arrive here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere filled with festivity, the Belgraders, some
with toddlers and pets, sang and danced.
</P>
<P>
They continued their celebration of the downing of the F-117a,
showing paper cannons with the sign "Only for the Invisible."
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, your plane is burning," read another sign.
</P>
<P>
"They have lost many planes and they'll lose more," said
Dalibor, 17.
</P>
<P>
His brother, who got married only six months ago, serves in the
army and left Belgrade 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
"We've heard nothing from him ever since and my mother is very
upset," Dalibor said.
</P>
<P>
It was somewhat better for Rada, 50, who could talk with her 20-
year-old son by phone, Mitrovich, at least for one minute each day.
</P>
<P>
He's fine so far, but Rada was worried, weeping and smoking
nervously.
</P>
<P>
Natasha, 27, has a cousin in the army.
</P>
<P>
"He called us two days ago from a hospital and told us that he
had lost three fingers in the bombing," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many of those attending the concert were school children, who
are now having their spring break until April 2.
</P>
<P>
"Killers, let me grow up," said one poster held by a boy.
</P>
<P>
Wrath against the west is running high.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton plus Blair and Shroeder equals 100 Hitlers," a sign
said.
</P>
<P>
Facing upward toward the sky, one woman extended a sign telling
NATO forces that they face those who have no fear to die.

<HEADLINE> China to Mark Discovery of Earliest Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The History Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences will hold a gala this summer to
mark the 100th anniversary of the discovery of oracle bone
inscriptions, which are like the cuneiform writing of the ancient
Near East and hieroglyphic writing of ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
They are one of the oldest forms of writing in the world. Their
descendant the "han zi" (Chinese characters) are still in use by a
fourth of the world's people. The inscribed animal bones and
tortoise shells, known as oracle bones, were used for divination
by kings of Shang Dynasty (16th BC -11th BC).
</P>
<P>
The celebration will be held with cooperation of the city
government of Anyang in Henan Province, where the bones were first
found at the Yin Ruins of the late Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Chinese archaeologists have found more than 160,000
pieces of inscribed bone and 10,000 characters, only about 1,000
of which have been deciphered.
</P>
<P>
This summer, the sponsors will invite scholars to the gala and
will publish collections of research developments on the oracle
bones, issue commemorative stamps, souvenir badges, and hold a
number of exhibitions, cultural performances, and tourism
activities.

<HEADLINE> China to Raise Safety of Beer Bottles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The State Quality and Technical
Supervision Administration recently required that all beer bottles
produced and sold in China meet compulsory State standards from
April 1, in a bid to reduce beer bottle explosion cases.
</P>
<P>
No beer in bottles manufactured under the old standards can be
sold after June, Li Fengwen, director of the administration's
standardization department, was quoted by today's "China Daily" as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The new bottles will be distinguished by a special mark "B" for
"beer," Li said. The bottle must also display the name of the
bottle manufacturer and the production date.
</P>
<P>
The new measure is aimed at reducing the number of beer bottle
explosions, most likely to occur with bottles that have been used
for many years, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Beer producers are no longer allowed to use soy sauce or
vinegar bottles, which are not able to withstand the same pressure
or heat as beer bottles, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Exploding beer bottles topped the list of consumer complaints
last year, according to the China Consumers Association.
</P>
<P>
"We suggest that the new bottles should not be used for more
than two years, but that is not compulsory," Li said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Stand-by Credit for Uruguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved on Monday a 12-month stand-by credit of 95
million U.S. dollars for Uruguay to support the government's 1999
economic program.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan government achieved all main objectives under the
1998 program. Inflation dropped to 8.5 percent by year's end,
while real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was estimated at
4.5 percent for the year, notwithstanding a sharp slowing of
economic activity in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic activity has continued its significant
slowing in the first few months of 1999, while the depreciation of
the Brazilian real last January posed a further challenge to the
Uruguayan economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 1999 program projects a 1 percent contraction
in real GDP, assuming negative output growth in Brazil and
significant slowing of growth in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The IMF praised the Uruguayan government for its responding
quickly by taking some corrective fiscal measures and adapting
slightly the exchange rate policy to face the more difficult
external environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF, the Uruguayan government does not intend
to make drawings under the stand-by credit, and will treat it as
precautionary.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Hopes for Good Cohabitation with US Sport Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government highlighted
Monday the possibilities for the island's cultural and sport's
interchange with the United States on the basis of the strictest
mututal respect.
</P>
<P>
During a well-attended press conference, the President of the
Cuban Parliament Ricardo Alarcon described as excellent the
baseball encounter that took place the previous evening between a
Cuban selection and the Orioles of Baltimore team of the Major
Leagues.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon had the same expressions of praise for the concert that
also offered Sunday in a joint manner Cuban and American musicians
in the island's largest theater.
</P>
<P>
"These encounters are revealing of the potentialities both
nations have, of a normal and civilized relation existing,"
emphasized the parlamentary leader.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon expressed his certainty that the US authorities will
allow the fulfilment of the agreements reached so that both
baseball teams face each other again next May at the Orioles
headquarters in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
He specified that that the very US legislations are the ones
that stop Cuban players performing in the Big Leagues with a
civilized relation or that baseball players from that country can
play games on the island with local teams.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, the Cuban selection lost by two innings
against two before the Orioles, in a very moving game that was
decided in three innings and which was the first presentation here
of a team of the American Big Leagues, in over 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The match, which held the attention of all the Cubans, was seen
by President Fidel Castro, who later received at the government's
headquarters the players of both teams.
</P>
<P>
Later, Castro also received the 44 American and 48 Cuban
musicians who for over a week shared a creative workshop named
Music Bridge around the World. The workshop ended the previous
evening with a joint concert in which musicians, styles and
rhythms intermingled.

<HEADLINE> Premiership Still to Decide on Full-time Refs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Premiership soccer club chairmen
have opted to delay any decision on the appointment of full-time
referees to the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
A pilot scheme to promote the nine leading Premiership referees
to full-time status next season has been recommended by a working
party of club representatives and the Premier League's own
referees officer Philip Don.
</P>
<P>
But at a meeting on Monday the 20 Premiership chairmen chose to
put back a firm decision in favour of further talks.
</P>
<P>
Premier League spokesman Mike Lee said: "We believe the issue
of full-time referees requires further consultation and discussion.
</P>
<P>
"Dave Richards (acting Premier League chairman) and Philip Don
will be talking to the clubs over the next few weeks to look at
the proposals and to ensure a full and comprehensive consultation.
"
</P>
<P>
The working party of Don, Tottenham director of football David
Pleat, Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell and
Everton club secretary Michael Dunford had considered the move at
length.
</P>
<P>
They argued that full-time referees would be likely to improve
standards and be better prepared to deal with the growing
pressures in the game.
</P>
<P>
Full-time officials would also be able to spend time training
and developing other referees, as well as building closer links
with clubs, players and managers.
</P>
<P>
If the move is eventually approved and the pilot scheme - which
could run for longer than just one season - proves a success, it
is likely that it would be extended to introduce more full-time
officials.

<HEADLINE> Walker to Learn his Fate in Next 24 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- European 200m champion Doug Walker
should hear his fate within the next 24 hours after failing an out-
of-competition drug test last December.
</P>
<P>
The report of the four-strong inquiry team headed by Michael
Beloff, QC will be delivered to the country's governing body, UK
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
The banned steroid Nandrolone appeared in Walker's urine
samples, although the Scot has always denied the charges placed
against him.
</P>
<P>
And he is ready to challenge any decision to suspend him in the
courts if the ruling goes against him.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Walker's lawyers will argue UK Athletics do
not have the authority to ban him as the alleged offence took
place before he allegedly failed the test.
</P>
<P>
"If the decision does result in suspension we feel there are a
number of legal challenges possible, which we will vigorously
pursue," said Walker's lawyer, Nick Bitel.

<HEADLINE> FA Wants Keegan Full-time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The impetus for Kevin Keegan to
stay on as England coach continues to grow, with two of the most
powerful men in English football suggesting they would be happy
for the Fulham boss to become England's full-time manager.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Fulham owner Mohamed Al-Fayed reportedly said he
would be willing to allow Keegan to cut short his contract at the
Second Division club.
</P>
<P>
And now the Football Association's acting chairman, Geoff
Thompson, and the chairman of their international committee, Noel
White, said they would be more than happy for Keegan to stay.
</P>
<P>
Keegan originally agreed to take the England job on a short-
term basis because of his contract with the Craven Cottage outfit,
which runs for a further 18 months.
</P>
<P>
But speaking in the Daily Mail newspaper, Thompson said it
might still be possible to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped there was a possibility of him staying on, and I'd be
delighted if he felt like that," Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage it's a matter for Kevin to decide. Let's see how
it goes. But a day like Saturday should make things easier."
</P>
<P>
White added: "The final decision is his. We can't twist his arm.
</P>
<P>
"But we can demonstrate the nation wants him. That might tempt
him to change his mind."
</P>
<P>
Keegan, on the other hand, has continued to keep his options
open, saying: "There might be a solution somewhere, but I'm not
going to look for that yet, because I don't think it's the right
time.
</P>
<P>
"I mean who knows in the future? I'm not going to be rude to
everybody and say to the England fans 'That's it, I don't care'.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying is that we struck a deal - that's what I want
to stick to at the moment and then let's see," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Moves to Lay Siege for English Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The security sub-committee of the
10th World Youth Championship has taken special measures in a bid
to curb the more than 3,000 English football fans who are expected
to storm Nigeria during the championship.
</P>
<P>
A member of the committee said that given the temperament of
the English fans particularly the unfortunate clashes involving
them and the French security personnel at last year's World Cup,
the committee has evolved special measures to ensure a hitch-free
championship tagged Nigeria '99.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the number of personnel who have been
undergone special training on security maintainance during the
World Cup would be beefed up at the Kano and Bauchi stadiums where
the English team would be playing their group matches.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the English fans who are expected to fly
directly to Aminu Kano International Airport would be under close
surveilance from the moment they touch down until the moment they
depart the country after the championship on April 24.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee would also take similar measures at
other stadiums where countries with record of soccer hooliganism
would be vying for honours during the Nigeria '99 championship
which is scheduled to open on April 3 in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Kano and Bauchi where U.S. and England teams would
be playing, the Lagos National Stadium, venue of the opening and
closing ceremony of the championship, is also receiving special
attention by the committee because of the expected large crowd of
Nigerian soccer fans who would throng the stadium during the
championship.

<HEADLINE> Belgraders Hold Concert, Show Defiance on NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of
Yugoslavians gathered in central Belgrade Monday to attend a
concert running for the second day to show their defiance against
NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
Air-raid alarm was cleared shortly after 07:00 (05:00GMT) in
the morning and no more air sirens were heard in the capital
during the day.
</P>
<P>
The Belgraders were still immersed in the joy over the downing
of a U.S. F-117a stealth bomber Saturday night, the first time
that the high-tech aircraft went down in combat. Some waving paper
cannons with the signs like "I'm sorry, your plane is burning."
</P>
<P>
Many danced to the live music played by popular bands at the
Republic Square, overlooked by the statue of Knez Mikhajlo, a
national hero that fought foreign invaders in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of NATO bombings in other parts of the
country during the day amid news that Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov will arrive here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere bordering festivity, the Belgraders, some with
toddlers and pets, sang and danced.
</P>
<P>
"They have lost many planes and they'll lose more," said
Dalibor, 17.
</P>
<P>
His brother, who got married only six months ago, serves in the
army and left Belgrade 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
"We've heard nothing from him ever since and my mother is very
upset," Dalibor said.
</P>
<P>
It was somewhat better for Rada, 50, who could at least call
her 20-year-old son, Mitrovich, on the phone for one minute each
day.
</P>
<P>
He's fine so far, but Rada was worried, weeping and smoking
nervously.
</P>
<P>
Natasha, 27, has a cousin in the army.
</P>
<P>
"He called us two days ago from a hospital and told us that he
had lost three fingers in the bombing," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many of those attending the concert were school children, who
are now having their spring break until April 2.
</P>
<P>
"Killers, let me grow up," said one poster held by a boy.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Ahern Join Efforts to Push N.Ireland's Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Monday the peace process in Northern Ireland had come too
far to go back and urged divided politicians to compromise.
</P>
<P>
"We've come too far to go back now. And if we were to go back
on the hope and possibility of a peaceful future for the people of
Northern Ireland, it would be the greatest betrayal of the people
I can think of," he told reporters in Belfast before starting
talks with his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he was sure the majority of Northern Irish
politicians wanted the peace process to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Ahern joined Blair Monday night as the two leaders put their
weight behind efforts to break an impasse over the disarming of
Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas that has stalled the
province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ahern shared Blair's determination to use the talks, set to
continue through Tuesday, to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
"I quite frankly don't know if we can or not," he was quoted by
Reuters as saying. "We'll do our best and I think we have moved so
far, done so much, built so much hope and confidence -- and at the
same time we cannot say that what we have done is concluded."
</P>
<P>
The key participants at the meetings include pro-British
Protestant leader David Trimble, Catholic Irish nationalist leader
Seamus Mallon and Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing
Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
British government has set this week as the final deadline for
a transfer of some home-rule from Westminster to the Provincial
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Failure to reach an agreement could also trigger a crisis in
the assembly over who should sit in the 10-member executive, the
linchpin of Northern Ireland's new political structure.
