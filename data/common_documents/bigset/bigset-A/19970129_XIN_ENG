<HEADLINE> EU Trade Surplus With Mediterranean Hits 13.7 Bln ECUs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's trade
surplus with the 13 Mediterranean countries rose to 13.7 billion
ECUs (some 18 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A report from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office, considered
the figure as "remarkable." In 1994, the surplus was 10.4 billion
ECUs (about 13.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the report, trade relations with the Mediterranean
are of major importance to the EU though their share of the EU's
total external trade has shrunk somewhat in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, EU imports from the Mediterranean countries rose by 4
percent over 1994. Exports were up sharply by 10 percent after a
slight fall of 0.5 percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Prepared to Pay Costs to Krabbe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- World athletics governing body
the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) said Tuesday
it would not appeal the decision by a German tribunal ruling that
former World Champion sprinter Katrin Krabbe had been penalised
too severely for a drugs related offence.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, released by Krabbe's lawyers, clears the way
for an out of court settlement between the sprinter and the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
A Munich tribunal judged in March 1996 that the IAAF had been
excessive in extending from one to three years the suspension
imposed on Krabbe by the German Athletics Federation for a
positive drugs test.
</P>
<P>
Krabbe, who completed the 100m and 200m sprint double at the
1991 world championships in Tokyo, was forced out of athletics
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
She failed a drugs test while training in South Africa in
January, 1992, but escaped on a technicality.
</P>
<P>
She opted out of the Barcelona Olympics but tested positive for
the banned substance Clenbuterol in a random test seven months
later.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has expanded the
Buint-Ukhaa Airport, the biggest airport in the land-locked
country, to accommodate jumbo jets including Boeing-767.
</P>
<P>
The runway of the Buint-Ukhaa airport in Ulan Bator is extended
to 3,100-meters long and 60-meters wide, sufficient for jumbo
aircraft like the Boeing-767 to land and take off, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The original airfield limited the carrying capacity of landing
planes to under 150 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Buint-Ukhaa airport now services not only domestic air
routes to capitals of its Aimaks (provinces), but international
routes to Beijing, Moscow, Osaka, Seoul, Berlin and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The airport will improve its air control system in March.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Attractive Market for Hong Kong: TDC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is an
increasingly attractive market for Hong Kong suppliers because of
its large population and further liberalized market, according to
a Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) official here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on the Business Opportunities in the
Philippines, TDC's Director for South East Asia Terence Lo said
that "with good long term potential due to strong growth in the
economy and income, the Philippines is a promising export market
for our companies on many different consumer products."
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has a huge consumer base of more than 68
million people with high purchasing power. Per capita income
showed a substantial double-digit growth during the past few
years, Lo said.
</P>
<P>
From January to November 1996, Hong Kong's total exports to the
Philippines increased by 9 percent year-on-year to 15.44 billion
HK dollars (1.99 billion US dollars), according to figures
provided by the TDC.
</P>
<P>
Major items included textiles, semi-conductors, computer parts,
telecommunication equipment, watches and clocks, garments and
electrical apparatus.
</P>
<P>
And investment is another field that Hong Kong has great
potential. "By investing in the Philippines, Hong Kong companies
can take this opportunity to promote its services export," Lo
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's investment in the Philippines totaled 768.28
million US dollars from 1985 to 1996. In 1996, Hong Kong was the
largest foreign investor in the country.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Air Raid Against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and
seven others injured today in an air raid carried out by a rival
faction against the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Jets belonging to northern warlord Rashid Dostum bombed Jabul
Seraj, 77 kilometers north of Kabul, which was captured by the
Taliban last Thursday, according to reports reaching here this
evening from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The air raid came a day after the anti-Taliban alliance, made
up of forces of Dostum and ousted government commander Ahmad
Masood, destroyed part of the strategic Salang highway in an
attempt to prevent the Islamic student militia from advancing into
their northern stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The Salang highway, which links northern and southern regions
of Afghanistan through the Salang tunnel, some 120 kilometers from
Kabul, is the quickest route to the northern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban's forces today exchanged artillery fire
with troops loyal to Masood at the mouth to the Panjsher valley,
Masood's stronghold, close to the Salang highway.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control two thirds of the Afghan territory,
have made major gains in the battle fields north of Kabul over the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia Monday offered a ceasefire only if the
anti-Taliban alliance gives up their demand to share power and
bows to the militia's strict Islamic rule.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Holds Talks With Syrian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- EU special envoy to the Middle
East Miguel Angel Moratinos today held talks with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk Sharaa on the Middle East peace process and the
European role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, the EU envoy told newsmen that "we have to
work seriously for the resumption of negotiations along the
Syrian-Israeli track, and we hope that this will take place but no
one can say when."
</P>
<P>
He added that the issue is not something of a compromise
formula, but thorough examination by the parties concerned of the
prospective resumption of negotiations is needed. they have to
exert further efforts in this direction.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he was carrying ideas to push forth the peace
process, but declined to elaborate about these ideas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources here say that Moratinos' visit to
the region aims at holding talks with Syrian officials on the
latest developments in the peace process, and ways and means to
promote an effective European role in this regard. It also aims at
examining the role the EU may undertake in future to help bring
about the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived in Damascus last evening from Israel where he
had talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levi.
</P>
<P>
The EU special envoy had stated following the meeting with Levi
that the task of the EU was focussed on restoring confidence in
the peace process, particularly along the Syrian-Israeli track. He
further stated that the EU role was not different from that of the
United States, but were rather complementary.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Moratinos Middle East tour is taking place
in the wake of the European foreign ministers' meeting and their
decision to augment their effective role in the peacemaking
process alongside the United States. Moratinos had actually taken
part in the efforts that culminated in the Hebron redeployment
accord. The EU has also sought to participate with the US in
extending whatever guarantees the concerned parties needed for the
implementation of the agreements reached.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chungshan Cruiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The famous "Chungshan" Cruiser,
which was sunk in the Yangtze River by Japanese planes nearly 60
years ago, was successfully lifted out of the water today.
</P>
<P>
The warship was christened "Yongfeng" when it was completed in
1913.
</P>
<P>
In 1910, the government of Qing Dynasty ordered the cruiser
from Japan, along with other warships, hoping that its powerful
new weapons could augment the navy's strength and help wipe out
the humiliation left over from the Sino-Japanese Sea War
(1894-1895).
</P>
<P>
The ship was 62.1 meters long and 8.9 meters wide. With a water
replacement weight of 780 tons and carrying eight cannons, it
could sail at a speed of 13.5 nautical miles an hour. It needed
108 to 140 men aboard to operate.
</P>
<P>
In July of 1917, the head of the navy force, Cheng Biguang, led
all the warships, including "Yongfeng" to help Dr. Sun Yat-sen
(1866-1925) fight against Yuan Shikai (1859-1916), who had
attempted to establish himself as the new emperor.
</P>
<P>
For the next few years, Dr. Sun, the forerunner of the
democratic revolution in China, commanded many battles on the ship.
</P>
<P>
In March of 1925, the ship was renamed "Chungshan" in memory of
Dr. Sun, who just died in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the ship was
attacked by Japanese planes and soon sank on October 24, 1938, in
the Yangtze River, in the battle to guard the city of Wuhan
in central China's Hubei Province.

<HEADLINE> More Canadians Invest in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- More Canadians are investing in
the stock markets, propelled by low interest rates and the growing
popularity of mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 37 percent of adult Canadians participated in the
stock markets, up from 23 percent in 1989, according to a study by
the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE).
</P>
<P>
Direct ownership of stocks declined to 9 percent from 12
percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, indirect ownership through mutual funds rose
twofold to 16 percent, the study found.
</P>
<P>
The trend toward indirect ownership is not surprising given the
growth in the domestic mutual fund industry and the vast array of
choices facing investors, said TSE president Rowland Fleming.
</P>
<P>
"People are looking for more professional advice, and they are
getting that through mutual funds," Fleming was quoted as saying
by a media report today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 37 percent of Canadians who own shares, about one third
are both direct and indirect investors. This group tends to trade
more actively, with more than half making two to 10 trades a year.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that men outnumber women two-to-one among
investors and have more appetite for risk. Women are more likely
to invest through mutual funds rather than directly.
</P>
<P>
The typical Canadian shareholder is a man in his 40s with a
university education and an above-average income.
</P>
<P>
Share ownership ranks the second most favorite investment
vehicle for Canadians after home ownership, up from No. 5 in 1989,
the study found.

<HEADLINE> Wine Consumption in Greece Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Wine consumption in Greece
declined sharply during the past 15 years, although a steady
increase of 5 percent annually is expected over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a branch report published today by the
Institute of Economic and Industrial Studies.
</P>
<P>
Per capita consumption of wine in Greece is 30 liters annually,
one of the highest figures worldwide but lower than the European
Union average of 37 liters and about half the corresponding
consumption on other Mediterranean countries of Europe such as
Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
White wine accounts for 75 percent of total domestic
consumption, red 15 percent and rose 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wine consumption in general accounts for 20 percent of total
consumption of alcoholic drinks in Greece, compared to 34 percent
in 1982. Due to its comparatively low price, house wine remains
the favorite of Greeks, accounting for 60 percent of consumption,
compared to 40 percent for bottled wine.
</P>
<P>
With exports about 10 times the volume of imports, the wine
trade with foreign countries showed an 11.5 billion drachma (48
million U.S. dollar) surplus in 1994. Two countries -- Germany and
France -- absorb 68 percent of Greek wine exports.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 18 percent of Greece's wine production is exported,
although these exports account for just 1.5-2 percent of total EU
exports. In 1994, the value of Greek wine exports amounted to 15.1
billion drachmas (63 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imported wines account for only 2 percent of
domestic consumption. Of these wines, the majority originate from
Italy (36 percent) and France (21 percent).

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Confidence Reaches 7-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in the
U.S. climbed to a seven-year high in January, its third
consecutive monthly increase and an unexpected sign of strength in
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a New York based research group, said
this morning that its Consumer Confidence Index rose 2.6 points to
116.8 in January, its highest level since October 1989, when it
reached 117.
</P>
<P>
The January figures were well above economists' estimates for
the month.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence is watched closely for indications of
consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S.
economy. Today's report is also one of the earliest economic
indicators for January.
</P>
<P>
A separate measure of sentiment about current business
conditions showed the greatest improvement in more than seven
years, rising by more than 4 points to 139.8 in January.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the next six months was also positive, with
that index gaining 1.6 points to 101.5, its second straight
advance after weakening in both October and November.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence survey is based on a representative
sample of 5,000 U.S. households.

<HEADLINE> UK GDP Grows 0.8 Pct in 4th Quarter of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew by 0.8 percent in the final quarter of last year,
slightly stronger than the 0.7 percent recorded in the previous
quarter, according to figures released Monday by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The figure was in line with City economists' forecast and took
the annual growth in the fourth quarter to 2.6 percent, showing
the economy is growing at a manageable pace.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth for 1996 as a whole was 2.3 percent compared
with 1995, slightly less than the government's forecast of 2.5
percent, strengthening Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth
Clarke's view that interest rates should be left unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, led by business and financial activities,
continued to be the engine of economic growth. Overall the sector
expanded by 0.9 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Although industrial production was slightly stronger than in
the third quarter, manufacturing grew only about 0.4 percent in
the fourth quarter, suggesting that strength in the pound is
holding back companies in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Construction picked up well in the quarter but agricultural
production fell.
</P>
<P>
Clarke welcomed the figures, saying that the economy was going
"from strength to strength" in 1996 and that the outlook for 1997
was even better.
</P>
<P>
Analysts concluded from the figures that Clarke would continue
to resist the Bank of England's pressure for higher interest rates
at next week's monetary meeting.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the relatively robust growth figure, Clarke is
expected to cite November's fall in factory output and December's
weak retail sales figures as reasons not to raise base rates yet.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Under Pressure Over Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal cabinet
came under renewed pressure from the republican movement today as
it met for the first time this year to consider details of its
proposed people's convention.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Australian Republic Movement (ARM) Malcolm
Turnbull said in a statement that time was running out for
Australia to become a republic by the year 2000, although it was
still possible.
</P>
<P>
He repeated the ARM's call for the federal government to bypass
the people's convention, due to be held this year, and move
straight to a national plebiscite on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The plebiscite plan, under which Australians would be asked
whether Australia should have an Australian as its head of the
state, has also won recent support from Opposition leader Kim
Beazley and Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot.
</P>
<P>
Turnbull said he feared the people's convention had simply
become a delaying tactic for a government which had failed to
match its "populist rhetoric" on the republic with political
action.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the government was elected on a promise it would
put this issue in the hands of the people, it has slipped and slid
and failed to deliver on it, we are not asking Prime Minister John
Howard to become a republican, and all we're asking him to do is
to give people an opportunity to express a view," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Satisfied with Elections in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The preliminary results of the
Chechen elections, which show that Aslan Maskhadov was likely to
win the presidency, provides "a serious chance" for Moscow to
reach agreement with the Chechen leadership on the future status
of the Russian republic, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
today.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov's victory "provides a serious chance for the center
and the new Chechen leadership to continue negotiations and arrive
at mutually acceptable decisions on Chechnya's status within the
Russian Federation," Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky quoted
Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who has been recovering from pneumonia in an official
residence outside Moscow, paid a surprise visit to the Kremlin
today and met Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin there.
</P>
<P>
He discussed with Chernomyrdin Monday's elections in Chechnya
and said he was satisfied with the way the elections had been
organized.
</P>
<P>
Other reports reaching here said that Maskhadov, former Chief
of Staff of the Chechen Armed Forces, was likely to win the
presidential election in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Maskhadov, who was head of the Chechen
coalition government, has won more than 60 percent of the votes in
most of the 63 constituencies where vote counting is over, the
reports cited the Chechen Central Electoral Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the polls are expected to be known on
February 2. According to the Chechen election law, a candidate
must win more than 50 percent of the votes to be the president.
</P>
<P>
A total of 766 candidates, including 44 women, contested the 63
seats in the Chechen parliament on the same day. The first
preliminary results of the elections are expected to be published
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
About half a million voters were registered in the 63
constituencies before the elections. However, the exact number of
those who came to the polls will be reported only after all the
results are summed up, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The elections were watched by more than 70 representatives from
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ambassador Denies More Missiles for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador in Athens
Valery Nikolayenko today denied reports that Cyprus was
negotiating a further purchase of missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, at a meeting with leader of the Greek
opposition Coalition of the Left Nikos Constantopoulos who is to
visit Russia on February 3-5, said there was no need to create
more tension in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat called on Turkey to keep calm and try to
approach matters in a way that would lead to the beginning of
negotiations to resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
A Russian general was quoted as saying Monday that Moscow may
offer Cyprus more missiles to counter Turkey's threats of a
preemptive strike aimed at Nicosia's decision to buy a
Russian-made air defense system.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow might sign a contract to supply the Republic of Cyprus
with the Tor-M1 missile system," the general, who declined to be
named, told the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprian government has denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
On Cyprus' earlier decision to purchase S-300 missiles from
Russia, the Russian ambassador said the deal was of a commercial
nature but could act as a negotiating card in the balance of
power.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Renews Mandate of Force in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council renewed the mandate of a 4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping
force in Lebanon for a further period of six months, until 31 July
1997.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Force was established in 1978 to
oversee the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from Southern Lebanon,
according to a relevant resolution of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli armed forces occupied a large part of Southern
Lebanon after its 1982 invasion and kept it as a buffer zone, which
resulted in sporadic counterattacks by the Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the Security Council reiterated its strong
support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political
independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
It condemned all acts of violence committed in particular
against the U.N. peacekeeping force and urged all parties to put
an end to them.
</P>
<P>
The council also encouraged further efficiency and savings
provided they do not affect the operational capacity of the force.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan drew attention to the 177 million U.S. dollars' debt
member states failed to pay to the U.N. peacekeeping force. Its
annual cost is 125 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Filipinos Differ Over ID System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has issued an order recently to implement a national ID system in
the country. To the surprise of many, however, this plan has
triggered a hot debate over whether the Ramos administration is
tightening control over the public.
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos have already gotten piles of identities: the
Social Security System (SSS) ID, the Government Service Insurance
System (GSIS) ID, Medicare ID, Driver's License, Bureau of
Internal Revenue Card and others.
</P>
<P>
However, they lack an ID at national level to help them
transact business with ease and greater convenience with
government agencies. To serve this purpose, Ramos has signed an
executive order to implement the national ID system later this
year.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, every citizen will get a free computerized ID
on a voluntary basis. The card, to be machine-readable and
tamper-proof, will bear a personal reference number, voter's ID
number, taxpayer's account number, blood type, forefinger mark,
the SSS and GSIS numbers.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace also expects the card will facilitate
the entry and departure of Filipinos to and from the country, help
the government monitor the entry of undesirable aliens and reduce
crimes which have already been very serious in the country.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, however, triggered widespread opposition from
citizens and the senate. Opponents said the ID system is not as
innocent as the Presidential Palace portrays it to be, warning of
a return to martial law or an authoritarian government under which
citizens could virtually lose their right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
Business people, who have been the main target of rampant
kidnappings in the country, have voiced the strongest opposition.
They said the new ID would lead to more bribery or kidnappings
rather than protection.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country recorded 147 kidnapping cases involving
241 hostages. It was widely believed that some of these crimes
were committed by police or other law enforcers who have access to
all kinds of IDs.
</P>
<P>
"Despite repeated assurances from the government, violation of
the card holders' privacy is highly possible," a businessman said.
"With the sort of technology available and all kinds of chances,
it becomes easier to access more detailed personal data on the
card holder."
</P>
<P>
The critics' opposition to the new ID stems from fear or even
misunderstanding, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The opponents argue that with the new ID system, all their
activities would be monitored by the authorities. To allay their
worries, Ramos suggests they read the entire text of his order
before hurling "wild opinions".
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the debate on the new ID system, Ramos said it
must "proceed from an unbiased appreciation of the facts and
produce enlightenment for the people instead of all sound and
fury."
</P>
<P>
Another main opponent of the national ID system was the senate.
A majority of senators have voiced anger over the ID system,
alleging surveys have shown that in virtually all countries with
national IDs, the cards have led to police abuses.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here said the power struggle is the real cause
behind the senators' stand. The senate, which fell to the hands of
the opposition parties in a senate coup last year, is using the ID
plan as an excuse to make things difficult for the Ramos
administration.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople has accused Ramos of
usurping congressional power by issuing a legislative order which
is actually a law. He urged the president to respect the
separation of powers between the executive and legislative
branches and warned that Ramos faces impeachment unless he
withdraws his order.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that the ruling Lakas-NUCD coalition-controlled House
of Representatives would kill without delay any motion tabled by
the senate in parliament challenging the president's order, Ople
finally turned to the Supreme Count to question the legality of
Ramos' move. But the president said he was confident that the
Supreme Court will sustain his authority to issue the order.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' political rivals have also charged that the ID system is
part of the government's efforts to extend Ramos' term beyond
1998. They said the Ramos administration was using the system to
muster the required number of signatures for "the people's
initiative campaign" pushing for a constitutional amendment that
would enable Ramos to extend his term.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the allegation was groundless as the
Supreme Court has actually already killed the people's initiative.
It would also be highly unlikely for Ramos to seek re-election
after undergoing a clot-removing surgery on his neck, they added.
</P>
<P>
Although the ID system is now in trouble waters, the
Presidential Palace expressed confidence that as the initial furor
over the ID system gradually dies down, the public will eventually
accept the new ID that will bring much convenience, less trouble
to their life.

<HEADLINE> Britain Defends Veto Over EU Racism Monitoring Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
confirmed that it blocked the establishment of a European Union
(EU) center to monitor racism throughout the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today, British Home Office
minister Timothy Kirkhope said that the British government
supported the idea of a monitoring unit controlled by national
governments, but it should not be made subject to EU law.
</P>
<P>
"The UK fully supports the creation of a European monitoring
center on racism and xenophobia and wants such a center to be as
effective as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "The current proposals for the center would
actually limit its activity and it could not gather information
about racial harassment and violence."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to discuss this idea with our European
partners. Our aim is to reach a solution that results in the best
possible measures," he added.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the British side would like to have the
center operate outside the framework of the European Court, the
European Parliament and the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
Britain's 14 EU partners have already made it clear that they
fully supported the creation of the center under Article 235 of
the EU Treaty.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that most EU governments were angry at London's
refusal to approve the formation of the EU unit and a senior EU
Commission official openly criticized Britain's isolating position
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The British government may say that it is ready to support
some other proposal for a monitoring center, but the fact remains
that Britain alone is preventing an agreement at present on the
proposal which is actually on the table," he said.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Asserts Support for Sudan's Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid today reaffirmed the league's firm
stance of support for Sudan's territorial integrity and full
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Meguid made the remarks during a meeting with Sudanese
Permanent Delegate to the Cairo-based Arab alliance Ahmed al-Tayeb
al-Kurdefani, who briefed him on the latest developments on the
eastern and southern borders of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief also reiterated the keenness on cementing
security and stability in this "sister country" and the need for
the neighboring countries to abide by the principle of
non-intervention in domestic affairs of other states.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of keeping to the good-neighbor
policy in accordance with the international law and other relevant
documents which regulate relations among countries.
</P>
<P>
Meguid expressed satisfaction over the Sudanese government's
diplomatic drive to expound those developments by sending
Sudanese envoys to some Arab and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has charged that the U.N. is
serving as a cover for the "Ethiopian aggression" on his country
and the schemes destructing its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Bashir leveled the accusation in a speech he delivered at an
emergency meeting of the Security and Defense Conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sudan accused Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda of behind the
attacks launched by Sudanese rebels along its borders, but these
countries have denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said recently that the latest
development in Sudan is its domestic affairs and there is not
evidence of involvement of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Egypt objects to
the division of Sudan and supports its sovereignty and integrity,
he said.
</P>
<P>
While Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has blamed the
Sudanese government for the turmoils in the country and reaffirmed
that Egypt will not favor any party involvement in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of northern and southern opposition forces began
attacking Sudanese army units along the eastern border of the
country more than two weeks ago in what they say is a bid to
pressure the Sudanese government and pave the way for a popular
uprising. The front has widened to its southern and northern
borders recently.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus in Close Touch With Russia: Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government is in
touch with the Russian government on Cyprus problem and there is
close cooperation between the two countries, a government
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides described the current visit to the region by high
ranking Russian officials as "a show of Russian interest in
efforts to settle the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Tchizhov, a Russian Foreign Ministry senior official,
is visiting Turkey and Greece and will arrive in Cyprus Thursday
as part of a fact-finding mission to pave the way for a visit by
a Russian Deputy Foreign Minister. The visit is expected to take
place in about a month, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official will stay on the island for five
days. He will be received by President Glafcos Clerides and meet
with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Last month, President Clerides sent Demetris Christofias, the
General Secretary of the left-wing Akel Party, as his envoy to
convey his message to Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Tchizhov is also expected to meet U.N. Secretary-General's
special representative for Cyprus Han Sung Joo, who is to arrive
here Wednesday for talks with President Clerides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Recent days have witnessed intensified international peace
efforts to defuse the tension on this Eastern Mediterranean
island following Cyprus government's decision to buy Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike at the missiles if they are
deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.

<P>
He said the danger to the building especially came from
the archaeological excavations in the eastern side of the
mosque. He repeated the call for immediate halt to the
digging, warning that failure to do so could lead to
eruption of violence between Israel and the Moslem world.
</P>
<P>
His warning was apparently part of the Palestinian campaign
against Israel's attempt to strengthen control over eastern
Jerusalem. A day earlier, Palestinian Religious Affairs Minister
Hassan Tahboub said Israeli archeologists were digging under the
mosque, based on claims that new plastering had been found
in a tunnel close to it.
</P>
<P>
Israel strongly dismisseded the charges as pure lies. Amir
Drori, director-general of Israel's Antiquities Authority, said
there was no tunneling under the Temple Mount, but that
teams had plastered walls to strengthen a tunnel running
outside the Old City walls for tourist use.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav Monday dismissed the charges as
baseless after checking with Drori, Jerusalem police chief Arye
Amit and other officials. He relayed this to Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and they agreed to notify the Wakf of
this.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the state-run Israel Radio today, a senior
official of the Antiquities Authority repeated the denial,
saying all the excavation works were carried out outside the
Temple Mount area and under full engineering coordination to
avoid damages to any building nearby.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini today
said that preparations were under way to hold an Arab summit
to discuss Israel's moves to strengthen its control over the
Arab eastern part of the holy city which he described as
"grave violation" of peace accords.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that a dispute surfaced over
Israel's controversial archaeological excavations underneath eastern
Jerusalem since Israel's opening of an exit to the
archaeological tunnel near the underground of Al-Aksa Mosque in
late September.
</P>
<P>
The dispute later led to a three-day widespread
Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed across the Palestinian territories
that killed over 70 people and wounded 1,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian
disputes. Israel has claimed it as the eternal and undivided
capital, while the Palestinians want eastern part of it to
be the capital of a future Palestinian state.

a United Nations mission in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The three-month mission was authorized by the UN Security
Council on January 20, with a mandate to support the verification

The 15 Spanish-speaking Canadian observers will verify the
cease-fire, the separation of combatant forces, and the disarming
and demobilization of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional
Guatemalteca forces, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
They will be part of a 155-person military component that will
be attached to the UN Mission for the Verification of Human Rights

ADDIS ABABA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) today
announced that it will establish a training institute for peace
and capacity building in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor

The institution, which will render services to neighboring and
other countries, is to focus on planning, curriculum revision and
management training, the UNESCO director general said.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the institution, the fourth of its kind in
the world, has its own contribution in mitigating shortage of
skilled manpower in Ethiopia, Ethiopian Minister of Education
Genet Zewdie said on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The first three training institutions were set up by UNESCO in
Switzerland, China and Germany.
</P>

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The government of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) protested today against the entry of
an Iranian navy vessel into the UAE's territorial waters, the
UAE's official news agency Wam reported.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian navy vessel entered the territorial waters of the
UAE on January 19 without any permission from the UAE's
authorities concerned, and towed away a tugboat loaded with cars,
chemical fertilizer and construction material, Wam said. But it
gave no details on the location of the waters and the nationality
of the tugboat.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's foreign Ministry has sent a letter to the Iranian
ambassador in UAE, protesting against "the violation of UAE's
territorial waters", Wam said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE also called on Iran to "stop such violation and
arrangement that would impose negative effects" on the
relationship between the two countries, Wam said, adding that
Iran should be committed to the international laws and principles
of good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Iran have disputes on the sovereignty of three
islands in the Gulf, which were known as Big Tonbu, Small Tonbu
and Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
Information was not yet available on whether the waters in which
the Iranian navy vessel entered were near the three
islands.

<HEADLINE> University Research Must Be Focused o UK's Needs, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- University research must be
better aligned with the needs of British industry if Britain is to
sustain its scientific and engineering excellence and enhance
innovation, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee Annual
meeting, CBI President Colin Marshall said, "If scientific
education and the orientation of the long-term strategic research
base is not aligned to the needs of industry, it's very difficult
to see how Britain can maintain, let alone enhance its
competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
The development and application of technology, along with a
well trained and highly educated workforce, is regarded in any
country as a significant determinant of competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
Marshall said it was vital that the government continued its
investment in the science and engineering base, at least at the
current level of 6 billion pounds (9.6 billion US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The CBI believes that the Technology Foresight program has been
a highly productive link between the research base and industry
and it is vital that the initiative continues.
</P>
<P>
"The key objective of the Foresight exercise is to identify
national priorities in order to inform public spending," Marshall
said.
</P>
<P>
The CBI had serious concerns about the Research Assessment
Exercise and proposed delivery of funding through the "Centers of
Excellence" concept to sustain research infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
These Centers of Excellence should range from departmental
level, to underpin basic science, to those created to support more
strategic or applied research. Inter-Disciplinary Research Centers
should also be expanded, according to the CBI.
</P>
<P>
Marshall said it was vital to ensure the quality of Britain's
science base as it played a major role in attracting inward
investment.
</P>
<P>
"So far, overseas companies are investing in Britain because of
the excellence of our science base; and it's consequently
essential to maintain its quality," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Ambitious Airport Expansion Plan Approved in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli National Council
for Planning and Construction today approved in full the
controversial Ben-Gurion 2000 Plan, aimed at expanding the
country's sole Ben-Gurion International Airport so as to handle
more travelers in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Under the ambitious plan, a new terminal will be built and the
first stage will take four or five years to complete.
</P>
<P>
Both Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy and Chairman of the
Knesset (parliament) Economics Committee Elie Goldschmidt held
that the committee should only approve the first stage of
the airport expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Levy said last week that he did not think Ben-Gurion can
or should be Israel's only international airport. It would be
better to approve a limited expansion of Ben-Gurion and in the
meantime begin work on a second international airport, he added.
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt agreed with the minister saying that if the entire
plan was to be approved, it would bury all the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
Following the approval of the plan, environmentalists and local
residents said that it will make life unbearable for residents
of the area and they declared they will continue to protest against
the plan.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force Monday
selected Lockheed Martin Corp. to make 40,000 smart tail kits for
high-accurate anti-armor bombs.
</P>
<P>
The "munitions-dispenser" bombs would carry different types of
explosives such as mines that they would sow across battlefields
and airfields against tanks and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bombs will use global positioning satellites and adjustable
tail fins to compensate for wind and other factors after they are
dropped from high altitude by warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said the first 40 tail kits will be delivered in
the spring and the weapons would be initially assigned to B-52
bombers and F-16 attack jets. They will be used later by
radar-evading F-117A "stealth" fighters, F-15E attack jets and big
B-1 bombers.
</P>
<P>
The 500-million-dollar "wind corrected munitions dispenser"
program began after the 1991 Gulf War. Air Force officials said
the program has been extremely successful.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has expressed satisfaction with the general elections, which were
held in Chechnya Monday, presidential spokesman Sergei
Yasterzhembsky told a briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in the
Kremlin, the president talked about the organization of the
presidential and parliamentary elections and vote results,
Yasterzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
The polling of the general elections began in Chechnya Monday
morning at 07:00 Moscow time and closed at 20:00. According to the
preliminary results of the polling, Aslan Maskhadov, who holds a
moderate view on Russian-Chechen relations, has won more than 60
percent of the votes in most of the 63 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin believes the results of the voting offer a real chance
for relations of the federal authorities with Chechnya as a
subject of the federation developing on a civilized way.
</P>
<P>
The president emphasized that the status of Chechnya should be
determined on the prerequisite that Chechnya didn't break away
from the Russian Federation.

<HEADLINE> US Labor Costs Advanced at Quicker Pace in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Employment costs in the U.S.
rose by 2.9 percent last year, the fastest pace in two years, the
U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the increase in its Employment Cost
Index, which measures salaries, wages and benefits, was the
steepest since a 3 percent advance in 1994 followed by a gain of
2.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries increased by 3.3 percent in 1996, the
fastest since a 3.6 percent gain in 1991. But benefits rose only
by 2 percent, the smallest gain since the U.S. government began
tracking labor costs in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the labor costs in the fourth-quarter
rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent, up from the 0.6 percent
increase in the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Employment Cost Index is considered one of the best gauges
of inflation pressures in the U.S. since compensation represents
about two-thirds of the cost of a product.
</P>
<P>
If labor costs go up significantly, it often means either
higher prices for consumers or smaller profits for businesses.
</P>
<P>
But Analysts said that many businesses that have experienced
rising labor costs recently have absorbed the higher costs without
converting them to consumers.
</P>
<P>
As a result, consumer inflation in the U.S. rose by a moderate
3.3 percent last year and by an even smaller 2.6 percent when
volatile energy and food items are excluded.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the U.S. economy appears to have picked
up at year's end. They expressed concern that a major increase in
employment costs could persuade the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to
raise interest rates to keep the economy from overheating.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-maker, will
meet on February 4-5, the first meeting of this year.

MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Aslan Maskhadov, who held a safe
lead in the presidential election in Chechnya, said pacification
of the people and solution of political problems are prior to
other tasks of his office, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Grozny today, Maskhadov said he still
upheld the independence of Chechnya but by the way of political
methods.
</P>
<P>
An Islamic state should be formed in Chechnya, the de facto
elected president said, but this should not be done in haste and
thoroughly. The new leaders of Chechnya will not divide other
countries on religious or other principles, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov also expressed the determination to solve the crime
problems, such as kidnaps, and acknowledged his key task was to
overcome the economic crisis in the republic.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not offer any posts or privileges to his
close commenders before the elections. But the only exception was
Vakha Arsanov, who was offered the post of vice-president, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Five Traditional Sites Handed Over in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has officially
handed over five Buganda tranditional sites under its
control to the administration of the Buganda Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The five traditional sites, mostly tombs of the late kings of the
kingdom, were handed over by the Second Prime Minister and Minister of
Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities, Moses Ali, at a ceremony
held here today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the handover ceremony, Ali said a traditional
site like the kings' tombs at Kasubi near Kampala with its unique
archtectural design has acquired international recognition as a
magnificent tourist attraction and a traditional site worthy
of inscription in the UNESCO's world heritage list.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the director general of UNESCO will be arriving
in Uganda tomorrow to assess the potentiality of the Kasubi
tombs for nomination on the world heritage list.
</P>
<P>
The Buganda Kingdom, the largest among the five Kingdoms in
Uganda, was officially reinstated in July, 1993 in accordance
with a bill, known as the Constitutional Amendment Status, 1993,
which amends the 1967 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The 1967 constitution banned traditional rulers and their
kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ugandan government reiterated once again that though the
country's traditional rulers and their kingdoms were reinstated,
Uganda remains a republic and any new kings, acting as traditional
and cultural leaders, are not allowed to play political and
administrative role in the country. enditem

PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its
happiness over the nomination of French diplomat Bernard Miyet as
the assistant secretary general of the United Nations in charge of
peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
"Up to the end of 1995, France was the biggest contributor of
troops to U.N. peace keeping operations. It always provides a
large number of blue helmet peace-keepers and remains the biggest
creditor to the United Nations as such," said French Foreign
Ministry in a communique.

The seat of U.N. assistant secretary general in charge of
peace-keeping operations was until now occupied by the new U.N.
secretary general Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"In this essential sector of activity of the organization, our
country has woven with the U.N. secretary general the relations of
confidence and close cooperation. It is indispensable that the
relations will prolong in the future, because of the challenges
with which the international community is faced," it said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry said that the United Nations should have
at its disposal a capacity of action in peace keeping field, so
that it can fully put into work the resolutions and fully play the
role of preventing conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Miyet "should contribute to" the
development of this aspect, said the communique.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Calls for Firm Stand Against Corruption (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin called on members of the Chinese Communist Party to take a
firm and clear-cut stand and persevere in the ongoing battle
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against corruption is a serious political struggle
and has an important bearing on the future of the Party and the
country," Jiang told the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Chinese Communist
Party here today.
</P>
<P>
The commission is the highest disciplinary organ of the Party.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, both the central and the local Party discipline
inspection commissions did a lot of work and enjoyed widespread
public support for their fighting against corruption, improving
Party style, building an honest and clean government and
mobilizing the people to participate in it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we must realize that combating corruption will remain our
task over the long period to come in the country's reform and
opening to the outside world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, the Party is facing a severe situation in the
fight against corruption, and the heavy responsibility of
rectifying Party style," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Party and government organizations at all levels must
deepen their understanding of the gravity of the fight against
corruption and place equal emphasis on the economic and cultural
work, the Chinese president said.

"Violations of the law and discipline, particularly those
committed by the senior officials from the Party and government
leading organs, law enforcing and judiciary departments and
economic administrations will be thoroughly investigated and dealt
with," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the tremendous progress China has made over
the past 18 years in its reform and opening to the outside world
and its modernization drive fully proves that the Chinese
Communist Party has been successful.
</P>
<P>
"But the Party must pay utmost attention to the phenomena of
ostentation, extravagance and squandering which are rampant in
some parts and sectors of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
With a huge population, poor industrial foundation, low
per-capita resources and weak comprehensive national strength,
China is facing both the economic and technological pressures of
the western countries, and has many other handicaps and new
problems to overcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to catch up with the middle-level developed
countries, China has decades of arduous work ahead," he said.

<HEADLINE> Communist Party Communique Calls for Stricter Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A communique issued today by the
Communist Party of China (CPC) requires Party members, especially
officials, to be honest and self-disciplined.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection of the CPC, which ended here today,
reviews the progress made in 1996 in the battle against
corruption, studies the speech delivered by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on anti-corruption, and determines the goals for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The communique released at the end of the meeting says the
Party has made headway in forming an honest work style, but
corruption is still a serious problem and there are growing
numbers of big cases.
</P>
<P>
It urges Party officials to be more disciplined in terms of the
number of houses they own, using public money to pay for their
personal entertainment, random use of official cars and providing
favorable conditions for their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be put on the investigation of officials in Party
and government departments charged with breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
Party officials are responsible for relieving the financial
burden of farmers and state-owned enterprises, and streamlining
private coffers in enterprises and institutions, according to the
communique.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that all Party officials, those above provincial
level in particular, must observe regulations and keep in line
with the central government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the communique sets some detailed disciplinary
targets for Party members to follow.

<P>
HANOI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's official newspaper
"Nhan Dan" claimed today that reports by two major radios, the
Voice of America (VOA) and the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC), were slanderous.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the two western radios had distorted a
Vietnamese government plan to mobilize people to build a national

</P>
<P>
The recent reports by VOA and the BBC called the plan a policy
of "forced labor."
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Communist Party daily described the reports as "a
gross interference in the internal affairs of an independent state
and a member of the United Nations with full-fledged sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are also insults by people who claim to have
the right to teach others, but who have little knowledge of
historical and social traditions thousands of years old," the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Holds Talks With EU Envoy on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad held talks here this afternoon with visiting European
Union Middle East envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two men also discussed the Syrian-Israeli track concerning
the possibility of resuming bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Syrian television, Moratinos said that
any peace in the Middle East must incorporate Syria.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we have decided to promote strong future relations as
well as partnership with Syria in order to establish peace,
stability and prosperity in the whole Middle East region," the EU
envoy said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he said that the gap between Syria and Israel was
still deep, therefore, much remained to be done to overcome
differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On the EU role to activate the peace process, he underscored
that the EU always tries to bolster peace. The EU had played and
would continue to play a political and economic role with a view
to building confidence between the two parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources accompanying the EU envoy said that the EU
countries will maintain their efforts to push forward the peace
process along all tracks. They added that after his meeting
Tuesday with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-shara, the EU
envoy was less optimistic about the resumption of Syrian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara had asked the EU envoy for clarifications about the
initiative put forward by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
regarding a call for the resumption of negotiations on the basis
of the U.N. Security Council resolution 242.
</P>
<P>
Israel upholds that the resolution does not specify complete
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories. Syria rejects
Israel's interpretation of the Security Council resolution.

It was quite wrong to spread slanderous reports in an attempt

"Nhan Dan" stressed.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that the Vietnamese people's ardent will for
national independence and freedom, as well as their desire to be
rid of poverty and backwardness, had become a motive force for
rallying the whole nation to strive for the prosperity of the
country regardless of sabotage by hostile forces.

<HEADLINE> 4 Injured in Scuffle outside Pakistan's Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Workers from the Pakistan
People's Party (PPP) resorted to scuffles today with Police
outside the Supreme Court building, causing injuries to four,
including one lady police constable.
</P>
<P>
Police, deployed to avert any eventuality, made a baton charge
on the crowd after the women workers and their male counterparts
refused to vacate the gate of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 PPP workers who gathered before the building of
the Supreme Court were demonstrating against the Court verdict
which rejected PPP Chairperson Benazir Bhutto's petition
challenging the dismissal of her government last November.
</P>
<P>
The agitated workers started pelting stones on the police, who
reacted by baton charging on the crowd. The aggressive women
workers, while raising slogans against the decision, the Judiciary
and the President, climbed onto the gate of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The stone pelting resulted in broken side windows of a few cars
while denting many others.

<HEADLINE> HK &AMP; Macao Affairs Office Spokesman on HK Legal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Most of the existing Hong Kong
laws can be adopted as laws of the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), Zhao Bingxin, a spokesman from the
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said today
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This way of handling the current Hong Kong laws not only
satisfies the demand that some necessary changes should be made to
the existing laws, but also conforms to the principle, set out in
the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, that the
existing laws shall basically remain unchanged, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Zhao said of the more
than 640 ordinances and over 1,160 clauses of subordinate
legislation that are in force in Hong Kong, only 25 cannot be
completely or partially adopted.
</P>
<P>
He said some clauses of the Bill of Rights Ordinance,
formulated unilaterally by the British Hong Kong authorities, have
authorized that the ordinance is superior to both the previous and
later laws in Hong Kong, and contravenes the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Zhao pointed out that Britain formerly clearly defined that the
original Hong Kong laws are in accordance with the international
conventions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
During the Sino-British negotiations on the Hong Kong issue,
the British side also said that there is no need to formulate a
human rights ordinance, he added.
</P>
<P>
But in 1991, the British stipulated the Bill of Rights
Ordinance, despite Chinese opposition, and made a series of
significant changes to the existing Hong Kong laws, which did not
contravene the Basic Law or the international conventions on human
rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
This move by the British ran completely counter to the
stipulations of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law that the
original Hong Kong laws shall basically remain unchanged, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the freedoms of speech and association, Zhao
pointed out that the British Hong Kong authorities have violated
the Basic Law by unilaterally revising the Societies Ordinance and
the Security Ordinance, as the previous ordinances did not
contravene the Basic Law or the international conventions on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
He also quoted Article 27 of the Basic Law, which says "Hong
Kong residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and of
publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of procession
and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to form and join
trade unions, and to strike."
</P>
<P>
This shows that assembly and procession are legally guaranteed,
and it is a misunderstanding that these activities will be
prohibited, if the revised the Security Ordinance not is adopted,
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Xu Ze, director of the political affairs department of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said that if a legal vacuum is
created because some previous Hong Kong laws are not adopted as
SAR laws, the SAR government will deal with them itself.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' GNP Growth Rise in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross national
product (GNP) growth accelerated to 6.8 percent in 1996 from 5
percent in 1995, the National Statistical Coordination Board said
today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the board showed the economic growth in
1996 was well within the government's target of 6.5 percent to 7.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The board said a significant rise in net factor income from
abroad was a crucial factor for the GNP growth. Net factor income
amounted to 1.32 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, 55.6 percent higher
than the level in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The overall gross domestic product (GDP), primarily pushed by
domestic production, rose to 5.5 percent in 1996 from 4.8 percent
in 1995, data showed.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, Socio-economic Planning Secretary
Cielito Habitlo said from a long-run growth of only about 2
percent, the agriculture sector recovered significantly, growing
by 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But on the production side, industry and services showed a
decline with the growth of 6.3 percent and 6 percent in 1996,
compared with 7 percent and 5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The decline in industry sector could be traced to slowdown of
the merchandise exports to 8.8 percent as perennial export
leaders, garments, semiconductors and electronic micro-circuits,
were affected by weaker demand on the world market, he said.

party last April, said the court's decision will play an important
role in strengthening the democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
The PTI will participate in the February 3 general elections
with "more dedication, devotion and enthusiasm", imran added.
</P>
<P>
There has been no formal response from Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party yet. However, Awais Gangash, an official from the
Media Department of PPP, told Xinhua that the Court's decision "is
a scar on the federation of the country."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Muslim League (N), widely considered to be the
most potential political party to win the forthcoming elections,
expressed the hope that Benazir Bhutto will accept the court
decision.
</P>
<P>
Liaquat Ali, Political Secretary of the PML(N), said in a
telephone interview with Xinhua that the uncertainty prevailing in
the country's current political situation will now be reduced as a
result of the Supreme Court's ruling today.
</P>
<P>
"Everything goes on as expected," he said. "Our party will win
the elections."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Supreme Court today upheld the presidential
proclamation last November by a 6-1 verdict, dismissing Benazir
Bhutto's petition challenging the dismissal of her government.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member bench of the court, which concluded the
hearing earlier in the day with Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in
the chair, met at 3:30 pm (1030 GMT) and then announced a 12-page
short order.
</P>
<P>
According to the verdict, the Presidential Order last November
contained enough substance, and an ample material had been
provided to conclude that the ousted government of Benazir Bhutto
could not be run in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court today also rejected the petition filed by the
Speaker of the National Assembly, Yosuf Raza Gillani, and ruled
that the dissolution of the National Assembly was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party(PPP) Benazir Bhutto
has said that her party will go ahead with the general elections
if the Supreme Court rejected her petition.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Laghari sacked the Bhutto Bebazir government
on November 5, 1996, accusing her of mass corruption, misruling,
economic disrupt and extra-judicial killings.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly was also dissolved on the same day. And
the President announced that general elections will be held on
February 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Benazir filed her first petition on November 13, 1996,
challenging the dismissal of her government. But it was returned
by the Supreme Court on November 19 on the grounds that it
contained frivolous, un-necessary and scandalous material.
</P>
<P>
The modified petition was re-submitted on November 21, but it
was again returned. Finally, the regular hearing on the petition
started on November 29.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Supreme Court decision today will have
a tremendous impact on Pakistan's political situation in the
coming days.

JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will have a satellite
in 1998 specially designed to accommodate the increasing number of
handphone users in the country, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The satellite will be launched from Kazakhstan in 1998 by
using a Russian-made rocket," Minister of Tourist, Post and
Telecommunications Joop Ave said.
</P>
<P>
Designed by Iskandar Alisyahbana and Adiwoso, two experts from
semi-private Pt. Telkom, the satellite will be named "Satelit
Garuda".
</P>
<P>
It was expected Indonesia will have around 600,000 cellular
phone users by the end of the sixth Five-Year Development Plan
(from 1994 to 1999).
</P>
<P>
But the number, Ave said, has in fact been already reached in
1996.
</P>
<P>
"It might double in 2000," he added.
</P>
<P>
When the satellite is launched, he said that people from the
remote areas of Indonesia can use cellular phones to contact other
people in the country.

NICOSIA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' total exports in the
first 10 month of 1996 reached 540 million Cyprus pounds (about
1.08 billion U.S. dollars) compared with 453.7 million pounds
(about 907.4 million dollars) for the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to a quarterly report released today by the
Department of Statistics and Research, total imports (covering
imports for home consumption and imports placed into bonded
warehouses) rose by 11.6 percent to 1.549 billion pounds (about
3.1 billion dollars), compared with 1.388 billion pounds

<HEADLINE> China on Safeguarding Sino-British Joint Declaration (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Such a revision means that rallies and demonstrations can be
held freely, which will weaken police departments' jurisdiction
and consider only some people's right to hold rallies and
demonstrations, ignoring most people's freedom to enjoy a normal
life.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions raised by the legal panel do not abolish the
freedom to hold rallies and demonstrations, but stand for putting
such freedom under effective laws and maintaining a good
environment for investment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To ensure Hong Kong residents' rights and freedom is an
important part of the Chinese government's basic principles and
policies toward Hong Kong, which have been prescribed in the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the relevant provisions of the Basic Law with those
of the Bill of Rights Ordinance, the stipulations on the Hong Kong
residents' rights are broader than those outlined in the Bill of
Rights Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Only by implementing the Basic Law, can the Hong Kong
resident's basic rights and freedom be fully guaranteed, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions of the legal panel are by no means to
"retreat" and "damage people's confidence in Hong Kong as alleged
by some people," but are aimed at safeguarding the seriousness of
the the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as well
as Hong Kong's legal system, it says.
</P>
<P>
This will benefit Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and
boost people's confidence in enforcement of laws, it adds.

Suggestions put forward by the legal panel of the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
are reasonable and legitimate, according to the commentator's
article.
</P>
<P>
It notes the legal panel suggested that articles in the Bill of
Rights Ordinance, which override other Hong Kong laws and run
counter to the Sino-British Joint Declaration and contravene the
Basic Law, will not be adopted as laws of the HK SAR.
</P>
<P>
The relevant content in the ordinance copied from the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights can be
adopted as laws of the HK SAR, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The entire ordinance cannot be abolished because both the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law stipulate that
the provisions of this covenant shall remain in force and shall be
implemented through the laws of the HK SAR.
</P>
<P>
As for the laws amended according to the Bill of Rights
Ordinance, the article notes that after careful consideration, the
legal panel proposed that only the revised Societies Ordinance and
the Security Ordinance will not be used as laws of the HK
SAR, and most of the other amended laws will be submitted to the
HK SAR.
</P>
<P>
These suggestions follow the principles of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration which maintain that the laws previously in force
in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged. They also show
respect for a high degree of autonomy for the Hong Kong SAR,
therefore they are completely reasonable and legitimate, the
article says.

The article says that most of the countries and regions of the
world abide by a legal system that gives governments jurisdiction
over the founding and activities of some organizations and bodies,
and also the power to prohibit foreign political organizations and
bodies from conducting activities in the countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for Hong Kong, an international trade and
financial center, to maintain its stability and prosperity by
preventing foreign political organizations or bodies from
conducting political activities in the region, and prohibiting
such groups of the region from establishing ties with foreign
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Societies Ordinance revised by the British Hong Kong
government has abolished these stipulations and contravened
stipulations of Article 23 of the Basic Law. So it is reasonable
that it will not be used as a law of the HK SAR.
</P>
<P>
It is common in most nations and regions of the world for
rallies and demonstrations to fall under the jurisdiction of
essential administrative limits. Even in some developed countries,
such activities must first be approved.
</P>
<P>
For 100 years or more, Hong Kong has also carried out this type
of system, and no one has said that such stipulations violate the
human rights convention, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
The British Hong Kong government has changed the original
provisions of the Security Ordinance, which states that rallies
and demonstrations must have police approval before they can be
held, to read that rallies and demonstrations can be carried out
after simply reporting their plans to police departments.

BAGHDAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Iraqi
Airways company has said the Iranian government is blocking
efforts made to restore five Iraqi planes kept in Iran since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Jumhuriya Daily today quoted Director General of the
Iraqi Airways Rabi Mohammed Saleh as saying the Iraqi Foreign
Ministry is making continuous efforts to bring back the airplanes
from Iran and his company also has been contacting world airlines
for mediation.
</P>
<P>
A number of Iraqi passenger or military aircraft flew to
neighboring countries such as Iran, Jordan and Tunisia, to avoid
air strikes by U.S.-led allies during the Gulf War.

The Iraqi Airways has confirmed that the Iranian side is using
two of the five planes for internal flights in violation of
international norms, said Saleh.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are two Boeing 747s, two 737s and one
707 in Iran now, adding that the Iranian government even does not
allow inspection and maintenance work on the aircraft by Iraqi
technicians.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Cancels Passports of Mrs. Tang Liang Hong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Home Affairs
of
Singapore said today that all passports issued to Madam Teo Siew
Har,
wife of Mr. Tang Liang Hong, the defeated Workers' Party election
candidate, have been cancelled with effect from Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry said that it was informed by the
Inland
Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) on Monday that they were
investigating Mr. Tang's tax matters.
</P>
<P>
It said that as Madam Teo had been involved in moving some of
her
husband's files from his office to their home, and might also be
taking
care of his tax matters, the Comptroller of Income Tax decided
that she
should not be allowed to leave Singapore until investigations are
completed.
</P>
<P>
After considering these facts, the Minister for Home Affairs
directed
the Controller of Immigration to cancel all the passports issued
to Madam
Teo under the Passport Regulations with effect from January 27,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Madam Teo and her daughter were stopped by the Immigration
Authorities
from leaving for Malaysia on Monday night and Madam Teo's passport
was
taken away, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tang went into hiding overseas soon after the general
election of the country early this month, allegedly on the ground
that his life was threatened after he was labeled an
anti-Christian and Chinese-chauvinist during the election campaign
period.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tang, who is now in London as reported by local media, is
facing an increasing amount of legal battles back home as Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and six other
ruling People's Action Party (PAP) members are suing him again,
this time over remarks he made accusing them of abusing the court
process to bury him politically and financially.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, the Senior Minister and nine other PAP
members obtained a worldwide injunction on Monday to prevent Mr.
Tang from disposing of his assets if he has to pay for damages and
legal costs in their defamation suits against him.
</P>
<P>
Under the Mareva injunction, which Justice Lai Kew Chai
approved on Monday, Mr. Tang will have to set aside up to 11.2
million Singapore dollars (about eight million US dollars) for
possible damages and legal costs if he decides to liquidate his
assets.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tang's family house in Singapore was raided in the midnight
Monday and Mr. Tang, according to a local television report,
questioned the timing of the IRAS actions to seize documents from
his home and office for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
The IRAS said it had been monitoring Mr. Tang Liang Hong's tax
case from the middle of last year, well before the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
It said all tax-payers who fail to give their accounts as
required when filing their annual tax returns would have their
case identified for review.
</P>
<P>
This review is normally performed in June of the tax year.
Particular attention is paid to cases where tax-payers report
significant variations in their earnings.
</P>
<P>
Some cases would then be selected for further monitoring and
this was the case with Mr. Tang, the IRAS reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
On the raid on Mr. Tang's home, the IRAS said raids on the
office and residence of tax-payers under investigation are
normally undertaken when it suspects material documents might be
tampered with.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the
Ministry of Defense of Ethiopia have completed a week-long
military justice training program presented by a team of U.S.
specialists, a local paper said today.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian Herald" quoted a press release from the U.S.
embassy as saying that during a workshop, over 30 military and
civilian members of the Ministry of Defense examined topics such
as "the rule of law", "the role of a military in democracy", "the
role of the military in law enforcement", "peacekeeping
operations", and the "relationship between the military and the
press".
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the latest training is part of the
U.S.-sponsored training program on military justice being
provided to the Ethiopian national defense force.
</P>
<P>
The first phase was conducted in Addis Ababa in May 1996
during which U.S. training experts met with national defense
force officials to discuss the purpose and structure of the
program.
</P>
<P>
The second phase took place in the U.S. and members of the
national defense force were provided briefings on the U.S.
military and civilian justice systems and visited both military
and civilian courts and observed various processes in both.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that the military justice training program
provided by the U.S. government will continue and will expand to
new topics in the future, the report added.

in Pudong district of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This joint venture with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China is named International Bank of Paris and Shanghai or IBPS.
</P>
<P>
With the approval, IBPS will be able to start operations in
Pudong and, in addition to the existing business in foreign
exchange, deal in Renminbi deposits, loans, settlements,
guarantees, treasury bonds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
"This earmarks a significant milestone in BNP's development in
China," said Didier Balme, Chief Executive of BNP China and Hong
Kong Group.
</P>
<P>
"Being able to deal in Renminbi means we will be able to offer
an ever wider range of banking services to our multinational
clients and potential investors in China.
</P>
<P>
"We have already been looking for suitable premises in Pudong
for the new office, which is expected to start operation in the
coming months," he added.
</P>
<P>
IBPS, a 50-50 joint venture between BNP and the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, was the first Sino-foreign joint venture
commercial bank to open in Shanghai in 1993. It also maintains a
representative office in Suzhou in the Chinese province of
Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
Other than the joint-venture bank offices, BNP operates three
full branches in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Tianjin, and three
representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
The first Western bank to open a representative office in
Beijing in 1980, BNP is one of the world's leading corporate
banks, with offices in about 80 countries. It has been operating
in Hong Kong for 38 years and ranks as one of the top ten banks
here. It currently employs over 1,000 staff in China and Hong
Kong.

Division 948 under the Front 250, which broke away from the Khmer
Rouge and joined the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces months ago.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Thailand to Strengthen Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
and visiting Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh today
agreed to strengthen their two countries' trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting between Ramos and
Chavalit, who arrived here this noon on a two-day visit, the first
to the country since he took office last November.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Ramos praised the
Philippine-Thai Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation for its
role in promoting bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
He said since the establishment of the commission in 1994,
bilateral trade has expanded dramatically. According to Ramos,
trade between the two countries rose to 1.19 billion U.S. dollars
in 1996 from less than 600 million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the joint commission will convene its second meeting
in Thailand this year and discuss measures to double its current
trade volume by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chavalit said enhanced economic and trade
cooperation between the Philippines and Thailand will contribute
to the development of the entire Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
After the summit, a memorandum of understanding was signed to
strengthen bilateral cooperation in telecommunications through
exchanges of information on new technologies, policies and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the two leaders expressed support to
conclude a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation
between the two countries, which will be discussed soon by
negotiators from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The officials of both countries are drafting an agreement on
science and technology cooperation, especially in the areas of
aquaculture, deep-sea fishing and fish processing, according to a
press release from the Presidential Press Office.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also renegotiate their bilateral
agreement on the avoidance of double taxation, the press release
said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Accuses US, Israel of Plotting against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's Vice-President
Al-Zubeir Mohammed Salih today accused the United States and
Israel of being behind a conspiracy to topple the Islamic system
in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is the choice of the Islamic system in Sudan
that has forced the United States and Israel to create the
present crisis in Sudan," said the visiting Sudanese vice-
president.
</P>
<P>
Salih, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit, made the
remarks in his meeting with Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, in which he delivered a message from Sudanese
President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, according to the state-run
Tehran Radio.
</P>
<P>
While calling for an end of the conflict in Sudan, Rafsanjani
voiced his regret over the loss of innocent life and property
damages inflicted to that country and expressed Iran's support
for the territorial integrity of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Salih said "the people and government of Sudan regard Iran
as a friend of the African country and put a lot of value on the
stance and views of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the Iranian president on the latest situation
and developments in his country, noting that a number of foreign
countries are meddling in the internal affairs of Sudan with the
collusion between Israel and Eritrea and Ethiopia against his
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition groups in southern Sudan have
nothing to do with the present crisis on Sudan's borders
although they may attempt to make use of the present situation.
</P>
<P>
He said Khartoum is trying to seek support of the United
Nations and friendly Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has accused its neighbors Ethiopia and Eritrea of
invading Sudanese territory and backing an opposition offensive
launched earlier this month. But Addis Ababa and Asmara have
denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
In his two-day state visit to Tehran, the Sudanese vice-
president is accompanied by Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman
Mohammed Taha and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Attack Hezbollah Bases in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out
at noon today an air strike at suspected guerrilla bases of the
Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But no words on casualties were given by security sources.
</P>
<P>
This was the third air attack launched by Israel at Hezbollah
targets in south Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area reported that Israeli warplanes
launched the air strike at Tellat Mlita in Iglim Al-Toffah, or
Province of Apple, at 1:40 p.m. (11:40 GMT) and fired at least one
air-to-surface missile at the hill.
</P>
<P>
Iglim Al-Toffah is a mountain area some 60 kilometers
southeast of Beirut, and it is often used by Lebanese Muslim
guerrillas as a springboard to attack the Israeli forces in the
south Lebanon border strip occupied by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also carried out reconnaissance flights at
low altitude over the areas of Nabatiyeh and Iglim Al-Toffah,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces in the so-called "security
zone" fired sporadic artillery fire at Jabel Al-Rafih in Iglim
Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
A relative calm has shrouded south Lebanon for three weeks,
following a spate of violence during the days around the New Year
in which one Israeli soldier was killed and 13 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and retaliatory bombardments
by the Israeli forces constitute a daily scene on the last
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> China on Safeguarding Sino-British Joint Declaration (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A commentator's article from
Xinhua in Beijing today deals with some suggestions on how to
handle the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance better for
safeguarding the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions, which were raised by the Legal Panel of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), concern how to dispose of the Bill of Rights
Ordinance enacted by the British-Hongkong government and major
revisions that have been made on the existing Hongkong laws in
line with it.
</P>
<P>
These suggestions are essential measures adopted to safeguard
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and provide the necessary
legal environment for Hong Kong's smooth transition and for its
long-term stability and prosperity, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the Bill of Rights Ordinance is a
product of Britain's changing policy toward Hong Kong, and that
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, especially the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong SAR, already sufficiently guarantee Hong Kong
residents' rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Chinese side has smoothly solved problems of how
to apply "the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights" and "the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights" in the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The two covenants, stipulated by the United Nations, took
effect in 1976 and Britain signed them the same year and applied
them to Hong Kong, except for some articles.
</P>
<P>
Because China is not a signatory of the two covenants, the
question about whether the two covenants would continue to apply
in the region after July 1, 1997 arose. China and Britain,
therefore, discussed the matter during negotiations on Hong Kong's
future, the article explained.
</P>
<P>
The British side said to the Chinese side that the two
covenants, either in Britain or Hong Kong, would be carried out in
the common law, in ordinances, and in administrative measures, and
that it was unnecessary to formulate a special human rights law.
</P>
<P>
It also made a commitment to the Chinese side that the Hong
Kong laws are in complete accord with the two covenants and
provide sufficient guarantees for human rights.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Britain clarified this matter in a report to the UN
Commission on Human Rights, which said that the British legal
system operates in accordance with the covenants, and that it
realizes the duties as prescribed in the covenants through the
enforcement of the existing laws.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that everyone can find provisions in the
laws that guarantee his or her rights, and that there is no need
to make the covenants part of the British law.

<TEXT>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the Chinese side agreed in Annex One
of the Joint Declaration that the provisions of the two covenants
as applied to Hong Kong would remain in force.
</P>
<P>
Article 39 of the Basic Law also made the likewise stipulation
and further explained that the provisions of the two covenants
"shall be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong SAR," in
accordance with Hong Kong's conditions.
</P>
<P>
In this way, China settled the matter of how to apply the two
covenants in the Hong Kong SAR, although it did not take part in
the two covenants on human rights, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
During the first five years of the transitional period, the
British side did not raise any objections about these matters, and
the British Hong Kong authorities did not say that any of the
original Hong Kong ordinances did not conform to the two covenants
either. Since the signing of the two covenants, Britain has never
formulated a special law on human rights.
</P>
<P>
In March, 1990, just before the Basic Law was to be formally
passed at China's National People's Congress, the British side
presented to the Chinese side a draft on Hong Kong's human rights,
and said that "the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights" should be formulated as a separate law, as part of Hong
Kong's laws.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated opposition from the Chinese side, the British
side, on June 5, 1991, named the draft, which was to be passed by
the Legislative Council, "the Bill of Rights Ordinance".
</P>
<P>
The following day, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that
it regretted the British side's insistence on formulating "the
Bill of Rights Ordinance" which would have a negative effect on
implementation of the Basic Law in the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also said the Chinese side reserves the right
to examine the existing Hong Kong laws, including "the Bill of
Rights Ordinance", at a proper time after 1997, according to
relevant provisions of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The article said it is not accidental that the British side
passed "the Bill of Rights Ordinance" at the beginning of 1990,
but one of the British series arrangements that would change its
policies toward Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The dispute about human rights in Hong Kong, which is still
going on, was provoked by the British side, and "the Bill of
Rights Ordinance" is the result of Britain's going against its
commitment, the article noted.

<P>
The article says that the British-Hong Kong autorities are
violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law by
placing the Bill of Rights Ordinance above Hong Kong's existing
laws.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 3 of the ordinance, any existing laws
which contravene the ordinance are to be abolished. In Article 4
it says that any subsequent laws must conform to the ordinance,
meaning that the Bill of Rights Ordinance has legally precedence
not only over previous laws, but also later ones, the article says.
</P>
<P>
This violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration and
contravenes the Basic law, it says, quoting Article 2 of Annex 1
of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, "After the establishment of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the laws previously
in force in Hong Kong (i.e., the common law, rules of equity,
ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law) shall be
maintained, save for any that contravene the Basic Law and subject
to any amendment by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
Article 8 of the Basic Law has the same stipulations. In Item 2
of Article 11, the Basic Law says, "No law enacted by the
legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should
contravene this law."

<HEADLINE> China On Safeguarding Sino-British Joint Declaration (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's National People's Congress decided on April 4, 1990
that "the systems, policies and laws to be instituted after the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall
be based on the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region."
</P>
<P>
This shows that the Basic Law takes precedence to all other
laws, and that no other law has an equal position, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
The British side made every effort to deny the overriding
status of the Bill of Rights Ordinance. The fact is that the
precedence is not something imposed by the Chinese side but
precisely recognized by the British side on its own. Because the
British side first put forward a draft of the Bill of Rights
Ordinance, the original Article 3 said that "this ordinance
paramounts all laws in effect." The British side changed the
headline to "the influence on laws previously instituted," but no
change was made in the article's contents.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the UN's Committee on Human Rights in 1995, the
British government admitted the precedence of the Bill of Rights
Ordinance over all laws in Hong Kong. The report says that
interpretations of any laws in effect and laws to be enforced
later in Hong Kong should conform to the Bill of Rights Ordinance
as closely as possible, and wherever interpretations cannot
conform, the Bill of Rights Ordinance should be placed above any
other laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
The British-Hong Kong authorities made use of the illegal
pre-eminent position of the Bill of Rights Ordinance to wantonly
revise the laws in effect in Hong Kong. So far, more than 50 laws
and regulations have been revised, and further changes are being
made.
</P>
<P>
This directly goes against the provision of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration that the laws will basically remain unchanged,
the article says.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, signed by the Chinese and British governments
on December 19, 1984, is binding both to the Chinese and the
British. The British side can not unilaterally make any important
revision to laws previously instituted in Hong Kong, the article
stresses.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the fact that the laws in effect in Hong Kong remain
unchanged does not imply that all of the laws in force in 1984
will be permanent, the article says.
</P>
<P>
However, it says, any important revision to laws in effect must
be made on the basis of an agreement reached through negotiations
by the Chinese and British sides. It is necessary for the both sides
to abide by the joint declaration, and it is illegal for the
British Hong Kong autorities to revise other laws in effect in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the articles placing the ordinance above other
laws give courts at all levels in Hong Kong the power to ignore or
abolish some of the laws in effect. It is also in violation of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration as well as the Basic Law, which
says in Item 2, Article 81, that "the judicial system previously
practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained except for those
changes consequent upon the establishment of the Court of Final
Appeal of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
The article cites a lawyer in Hong Kong as saying that it is
unprecedented in the history of Hong Kong that the judicial organs
could abolish a law, or part of one, based only on the
stipulations of another law.
</P>
<P>
In short, the article says, the Bill of Rights Ordinance is
only a specially-added power to a law and has no legal grounds. It
has led to changes and the invalidity of many laws previously
instituted in Hong Kong, it is harmful to the relative stability
of existing laws in Hong Kong and it may cause confusion of the
future legal system in HK SAR. Therefore it should be rectified
and restore original features of the system of common laws.

<HEADLINE> Thorough Implementation of Jiang's Speech on Taiwan: Editorial (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- An editorial to be carried in
Thursday's People's Daily, marking the second anniversary of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposition on the
Taiwan issue, calls for more exchanges between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits to promote the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1995, Jiang delivered a speech titled "Continue
to Promote the Reunification of the Motherland."
</P>
<P>
"The important speech by Jiang Zemin precisely illustrated the
essence of Deng Xiaoping's thinking of `peaceful reunification,
one country, two systems,' putting forward an eight-point proposal
for developing relations across the Straits and promoting the
process of peaceful reunification of the motherland at the present
stage, and (the proposal) is a programmatic document to guide the
work on Taiwan," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Occurrences over the past two years have proved that the
important speech has had a truly profound and historical
significance in boosting ties between the two sides and the
process of the motherland's reunification, the editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
The underlying theme of the president's speech was to stick to
the principle of "one China," as Taiwan is an inseparable part of
China, and adherence to the principle of "one China" is a
political basis for safeguarding cross-straits relations and
peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities advocate "splitting the country and
ruling under separate regimes" and "two equal political entities,"
which in fact are aimed at tearing apart China's sovereignty and
territory and creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Chinese people will definitely not allow this and will
carry on determined struggles against it," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Since June, 1995, the fight against separatism and Taiwan
independence has illustrated the Chinese people's strong
determination and ability to safeguard national sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and to strike hard against separatist
activities and Taiwan-independence forces in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's speech put forward a range of constructive suggestions
on cross-straits relations, creatively formulating the proposal
that the two sides can negotiate and reach agreement while
"putting an end to the hostile situation across the Straits under
the principle of 'one China'." This can be the first step in
peaceful reunification negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal, which considers both the current and future
situations, conforms to the wish of the majority of Taiwan
compatriots, but regretfully it has not been taken seriously by
the Taiwan authorities," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits has made it clear that, under appropriate political
conditions across the straits, it is ready to hold discussions
with the Straits Exchange Foundation in Taiwan to develop a
procedure to carry out political exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Taiwan authorities are sincere in their desire
to return to the principle of "one China," and cease their
activities to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in
the international community, the two organizations can work out
such a procedure when the time is right, the editorial said.

<P>
In his speech, Jiang advocated broad economic and trade
cooperation which should not be affected by political disputes. He
also stressed the need to protect the interests of Taiwanese
investors, and called for direct shipping, commercial and mail
exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that compatriots across the straits should
strengthen contacts so as to boost mutual understanding, and
should protect the fine traditions of the Chinese culture. He also
emphasized that the Taiwan compatriots' lifestyles and interests
should be fully respected and protected.
</P>
<P>
"Despite some twists and turns in the political relations
across the straits over the past two years, we have been
persistently carrying out the proposals to boost personnel,
economic and cultural exchanges across the straits," the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation released two regulations on
cross-straits shipping and cargo transportation, which were
well-received in Taiwan. It is pleasing to see that personnel,
economic and cultural exchanges have maintained a strong momentum,
it said.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that the Taiwan authorities, under pressure
both from within and without, have to respond to the important
speech of President Jiang Zemin, and at least gesture to make
strategic readjustments regarding some questions in the
cross-straits relations," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that in deed, the Taiwan authorities
still stick to their separatist stance, continue with their
activities of creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan,"
and further block economic and trade relations with the
mainland.

<HEADLINE> Dutch FM: NATO Expansion Should Avoid Destabilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van Mierlo said today that the eastward expansion of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should avoid
destabilization in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The organization's expansion towards Russia's border was "a
fact of life" and it must be done in a way that eased Moscow's
security concerns and did not destabilize Europe, said van Mierlo.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a joint news conference after talks with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and European Trade
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work out a new framework in which the security of
Russia can be safeguarded; also the feelings of the Russians," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is determined to push ahead with expansion of the
Western military organization by inviting some of the former
Warsaw Pact member nations to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The plan aroused Russia's concerns which said NATO's expansion
would pose a threat to its national security. Russian Foreign
Minister Yvegney Primakov told NATO foreign ministers at their
December meeting in Brussels that expansion could produce new
divisions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Duma (lower house of the parliament) was hesitant in
ratifying the Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START II,
because of the concerns.

KUNMING, Southwest China, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China
outplayed the United States 2-1 in a soccer friendly match here
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The host team, pumped up by the partisan home crowd, opened the

</P>
<P>
Hao, capitalising on a defensive loosehole of American
defenders, rounded the American goalie to hit the goal.

Chinese team. The teenager found the net with a rebound on a
perfect pass from Hao.
</P>
<P>
China led 2-0 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese eleven continued its fierce attacking in the second
half, making many gold chances. However, they failed to convert
their third.
</P>

Eric Wynalda, who capped for the U.S. team in the 1990 and 1994
World Cup, got some consolation for the visiting team with a goal
in the 73rd minute.

HANOI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Vietnamese have invested
217 million U.S. dollars in their homeland since 1993, when the
government began to adopt a series of preferential investment
policies for these expatriates.
</P>
<P>
An official report said today that in one instance, a
Vietnamese residing in the United States set up a pharmaceutical
manufacturing project in Vietnam which was capitalized at 21
million dollars.
</P>

Most of the other investment projects were capitalized at an
average of four million dollars, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country's economy benefited from remittance of 800
million dollars by Vietnamese expatriates.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Afforestation To Play Greater Role in Helping Needy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Afforestation will play a
greater role in the nation's efforts to help the needy, China's
vice-minister of forestry said today.
</P>
<P>
Li Yucai said last year his ministry channeled a total of 300
million yuan (37 million US dollars) into projects in mountain and
desert areas where most of the relatively poor people live.
</P>
<P>
Among the 592 impoverished counties listed by the State
Council, 496 are in mountain or desert areas, Li said.
</P>
<P>
There, he pointed out, afforestation rather than other
industries might be the most suitable way for farmers to improve
their working conditions and earn more income.
</P>
<P>
"The mountain and desert areas usually are not suitable for
grain farming, but they may be productive if they are afforested,"
the vice minister said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ministry launched a comprehensive pilot
development project in 24 selected counties. The program has now
spread to 50 counties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Helping the needy through afforestation will be one of the main
tasks for our ministry this year," Li said, "and the work will be
continuously be enhanced by more funds and favorable policies."
</P>
<P>
According to the vice minister, since 1986 the ministry has
helped more than two million needy people in mountain areas.

"Everything goes on as expected," he said. "Our party will win

</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Supreme Court today upheld the presidential
proclamation early last November by a 6-1 verdict, dismissing
Benazir Bhutto's petition challenging the dismissal of her
government.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member bench of the Court, which concluded the
hearing earlier in the day with Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in
the chair, met at 3:30 p.m. (local time), in which it announced a
12-page short order.
</P>
<P>
According to the verdict, the Presidential Order last November
contained enough substance and an ample material had been provided
to conclude that the ousted government of Benazir Bhutto could not
be run in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court today also rejected the petition filed by the
Speaker of the National Assembly, Yosuf Raza Gillani, and ruled
that the dissolution of the National Assembly was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party(PPP) Benazir Bhutto
said earlier that her party would go ahead with the general
elections if the Supreme Court rejected her petition.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Laghari sacked the Benazir government on
November 5, 1996, accusing her administration of mass corruption,
misruling, economic disrupt and extra-judicial killings.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly was also dissolved on the same day. And
the President announced that general elections would be held on
February 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Benazir filed her first petition on November 13, 1996,
challenging the dismissal of her government. But it was returned
by the Supreme Court on November 19 on the grounds that it
contained frivolous, unnecessary and scandalous material.
</P>
<P>
The modified petition was re-submitted on November 21, but it
was again returned. Finally, the regular hearing on the petition
started on November 29.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Supreme Court decision today will have
a major impact on Pakistan's political situation in the coming
days.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam left here today for Muscat, Oman, ending
a two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Khaddam briefed UAE President Sheikh Zayed
Bin Sultan Al Nahyan and other top officials on the latest
developments in the Middle East peace process and the Arab
situation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined his country's commitment to the peace
process and Syria's desire to resume negotiations with Israel at
the point where they suspended a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the peace talks, Khaddam said that Syria insists
on Israeli withdrawal of its troops from the Golan Heights and all
other occupied Arab lands, adding that the peace talks between the
two sides should be resumed based on the principle of trading
lands for peace.
</P>
<P>
In response, Zayed voiced UAE's support for the Syrian
position on the Middle East peace process and on resumption of
peace talks with Israel, saying a just and comprehensive peace in
the region can never be achieved until Israel returns all the Arab
lands it has occupied.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for boosting international efforts,
particularly efforts by the United States in order to free the
region from what will threaten the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, following his tour to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
Khaddam arrived in the UAE, the third leg of his seven-nation
trip in the Middle East, which will also take him to Oman,
Bahrain, Qatar and Yemen.

<P>
KIEV, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A new party, Women of Ukraine,
will soon appear on the country's political stage, says Allan
Komarova, director of the Institute of Human Problems.
</P>
<P>
She said the main aim of the party, which held its first
congress on January 18 but was waiting to be registered, was to
boost the political involvement of women.
</P>
<P>
"Women of Ukraine, founded by 14 female scientists, journalists
and members of women's groups, is the result of six years of
studying the state of affairs in society," said Komarova.
</P>
<P>
Women were an important force in Ukraine, but at the moment
their potential had not been realized in the political sphere,
Komarova added.
</P>
<P>
Women account for 54 percent of the Ukrainian population but a
mere four percent of Parliament deputies.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Institute of Human Problems shows
that 28 percent of women today are ready to take part in an
election, yet at present female participation in politics remains
limited.
</P>
<P>
Though membership was limited to women, Komarova said the party
was in no way linked to a feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
She placed the party on a democratic and centrist platform,
saying that it planned to take part in the next presidential
election.

<HEADLINE> Controls on Bars to Be Tightened in HK After Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Controls on karaoke bars
throughout Hong Kong are to be tightened after a blaze at the Top
One karaoke bar left 16 people dead, South China Morning Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some legislative measures are under consideration and they
include adding karaoke bars to the Fire Safety (Commercial
Premises) Bill and the Occupational Safety and Health Bill, both
of which are under the scrutiny of the Legislative Council, Alex
Fong Chi-wai, deputy secretary for security, said.
</P>
<P>
The security branch yesterday met seniors officials from the
police and the Fire Services, Home Affairs, Building, Urban
Services and Regional Services departments.
</P>
<P>
The police and Fire Services would also step up safety
inspections at bars, Fong said.
</P>
<P>
The government is not only focusing on unlicensed karaoke bars,
he stressed. "Even if it is licensed, it doesn't mean it is free
from fire safety problems."
</P>
<P>
Also under consideration is a stricter licensing system.
</P>
<P>
Now karaoke bars can operate under a general restaurant
license, light refreshment license or a liquor license, but no
license is required if it does not sell cooked food or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Five people appeared in court yesterday on murder charges
following Saturday's suspected triad attack on the bar at Tsim Sha
Tsui, which left 15 dead on the site and one more in hospital.

PARIS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has rejected the idea of a sharing of
responsibilities between Paris and Washington for the South
Command of NATO.
</P>
<P>
-- In a message sent to the U.S. Congress and entitled "Support
to a democratic transition in Cuba," U.S. President Bill Clinton
said that the international community is ready to invest 4 to 8
billion U.S. dollars to help the island nation build a
market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
-- After several of its pilots were hospitalized after having
the traditional week-long training program "Conduct after
Capture," the British Royal Air Force has suspended the program,
dubbed "training of torture," which left its pilots in the
wilderness three days without food, money and survival equipment.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Abdelhak Benhamouda, the chief of Algeria's central trade
union was assassinated Tuesday outside the headquarters of the
union in central Algiers. The assassination of Benhamouda, a
close ally of Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, is believed to
be a reaction by the Islamic extremists to the hardline speech
made by Zeroual last week.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has launched a campaign against Germany
over the banning by the Bavarian government of the religious cult
of Scientology, which originated from the United States. The

rejected the accusation and denounced what it called "anti-German
campaign of hatred."

KAMPALA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS-stricken east African
country of Uganda has witnessed a record sales of 10 million
condoms in 1996, local newspaper "the Monitor" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans consumed 9,979,930 condoms during the past year, a 66
percent growth over that of 1995, Dr. Elizabeth Madraa, chief of
the Sex Transmitted Diseases/AIDS Control Program of the Ministry
of Health, was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Madraa said the increase of the condom consumption "means
that the education is slowly going down to the people."
</P>

Uganda and Thailand are the only two countries in the
developing world where the HIV epidemic appears to be stabilizing
or even declining.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Issue Smart Telephone Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao will issue a set of new
telephone cards called the "smart card" as of February 3 to
replace the current magnetic telephone card, which will gradually
retire.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Telecommunications Company (CTM) announced today that
the new card, which contains a tiny electronic circuit, will have
great potential in the future, when it may be used not only for
telephone calls, but also for taking public buses or anything
payable with card.
</P>
<P>
After the issue of the new smart card, the CTM said it will
stop selling the magnetic card. Public telephones to use the card
have begun to take the place of the old magnetic ones.
</P>
<P>
The first set of new cards to be issued include three high-tech
theme cards, with a face value of 70 patacas (about nine U.S.
dollars), 100 patacas (about 13 dollars) and 200 patacas (about 26
dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Another commemorative card for the Year of Ox, with a face
value of 100 patacas, will be on sale at the same time.
</P>
<P>
There are about 500 public telephones in Macao, serving 24
hours a day. Users can either use coins, magnetic cards or the new
smart cards to make calls.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Shipping Deal Has Little Impact on HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A deal signed here last week
on direct shipping links between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan
will have "little immediate impact" on Hong Kong's role as a
regional shipping center, a Trade Development Council (TDC) report
says.
</P>
<P>
Trade, however, will increasingly be lost by the territory as
more ports open for cross-straits shipping and infrastructure in
both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan is improved, today's South
China Morning Post quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the new cross-straits routes are proved reliable and
cost-effective, and more ports are open for direct cross-straits
shipping in the future, the cargo diversion effect on Hong Kong
will be greater," the report says.
</P>
<P>
"But the cargo diversion effect is to be offset by increased
business opportunities for Hong Kong as cross-straits economic
ties further improve."
</P>
<P>
The TDC report concludes that Hong Kong will continue to be the
major player in aiding Taiwan's investment and trade in the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that the immediate impact would be very modest,
with less than one percent of the territory's cargo throughput
likely to be diverted.
</P>
<P>
Under the minute concerning direct shipping services between
Fuzhou and Xiamen of the Chinese mainland and the Kaohsiung port
in Taiwan, the services will be limited to transshipment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the total amount of such transshipment through the
territory reached 2.2 million tons, or about one percent of Hong
Kong's total port cargo throughput.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar is facing its
worst ever drought for years which might lead to a food crisis,
the official Daily News reported today.

<P>
A survey carried out by the paper said in both islands of
Unguja and Pemba, hundreds of acres of cassava, beans, banana
plantations have been badly affected by the drought.

The drought has led to severe shortage of these crops in the
markets and forced the prices to shoot up by as much as three
times.

In the villages in central and southern Unguja, hundreds of
orange trees have shrunk, livestock is having a hard time
searching for grass and water, and some of the livestock keepers
are rushing to sell their cattle to avoid an even more serious
loss.

<HEADLINE> Australia Faces Teacher Crisis: Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia would only have 60
percent of the teacher graduates it will need in the year 2003,
and it would take at least eight years to rectify the worsening
teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Education Union (AEU) national research officer,
Roy Martin, warned today that even if the government moved
straight away to alleviate the problem, it would still take around
eight years to take effect.
</P>
<P>
"We have to consider the fact that it takes four years to train
a teacher, and we are also running down the teacher training
section of universities and it will take another three or four
years to build those up again, therefore, it possibly could be
anything up to eight years lag time in terms of solving the
problem."
</P>
<P>
There were increased expectations and workloads on teachers, as
well as decreased resources and increased antagonism from
governments, Martin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned that teaching is not seen as being a
desirable profession and there is concern that the people who are
in the profession do not perceive themselves as being well
regarded financially or well regarded in terms of society."
</P>
<P>
"There are issues of pay, public regard, the government's
relationship with teachers, issues of supply and demand,
qualifications, registration and conditions of employment," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to Grow 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Investors'
Association (MIA) has forecast a 15 percent growth on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) for the first half of 1997 to beyond
1,350 points for the Composite Index (CI).
</P>
<P>
MIA said in its stock market outlook for 1997 released here
today that the second board index, meanwhile, might move within a
range of 580 points to 720 points.
</P>
<P>
However, the market might face strong resistance at around the
1,290 level, its president PHS Lim said, adding "should such a
level be overcome, there would be an even chance to see the KLSE
CI reaching 1,350 this year."
</P>
<P>
The primary bull trend at this juncture was still fundamentally
intact with the current price earning ratio at 25.3 times in terms
of the 100 stocks in the Composite Index basket, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Malaysian stock market is trading at a
prospective price earning slightly below 20 times based on 1997's
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Movements of the CI would also greatly be affected by the 10
highest paid up capital companies on the KLSE, Lim said, citing an
example, if the National Power Corporation's share price could
improve by a ringgit, this counter could have an 0.94 percent or
10.19 points impact on the CI.
</P>
<P>
In terms of sectoral growth, manufacturing, construction and
service sectors were expected to perform satisfactorily in 1997,
contributing 12.5 percent, 8.0 percent and 8.8 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions, including stock broking services, which
performed very well in 1996, are expected to have another good
year in 1997 with corporate earnings projected to improve by a
moderate rate of 18 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors that will perform well this year are the services
and food industries while the construction industry is forecast to
grow moderately by 8.8 percent against nine percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000), an estimated 87.5
billion ringgit (about 35 billion U.S. dollars) is to be invested
in infrastructural facilities, of which 75 percent will come from
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that the moderate economic growth rate targeted at 8.3
percent real Gross Domestic Product for this year against 8.2
percent for 1996 should augur well for the Malaysian stock market.
</P>
<P>
"As the fear of an overheating Malaysian economy was now over,
those foreign institutional investors who once harbored the fear
should greatly welcome the Malaysian capital market now," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 628 companies are listed on the KLSE.
</P>
<P>
According to MIA, the KLSE second board index is likely to be
as high as that of its CI by the year 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has decided to lease
local factory sites to foreign investors free of charge in an
effort to lure more foreign high-tech investments.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and Economy said today that starting
next month, foreigners willing to invest more than 20 million
U.S. dollars in high-tech sectors will be entitled to rent-free
use of land at two foreigners-only industrial complexes for up to
20 years.
</P>

respectively.
</P>
<P>
If a foreign business invests more than 100 million U.S.
dollars in the manufacturing sector, 75 percent of its real-estate
expenses will be exempted
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in other sectors, which can contribute to
expanding social infrastructures, restructuring local industries
and improving the financial status of provincial governments, will
also be able to receive the 75-percent rent-exemption.
</P>
<P>
"The new measures, devised to resolve the structural problems,
are expected to help improve South Korea's employment and
current-account conditions," the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia launches House-to-house checks for Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Immigration
Department today launched house-to-house checks for foreign maids
who have no valid documents or work permits.
</P>
<P>
Four maids -- three Indonesians and one Filipina -- were
detained in a two-hour operation this morning carried out by 32
immigration officers who checked a total of 350 houses in
Petalling Jaya adjacent to the capital city, deputy
Director-General Aseh Che Mat said.
</P>
<P>
A man who employed one of the Indonesian women was also
detained for harboring an illegal immigrant while his driver was
detained for obstructing the immigration officers in performing
their duties, the official told a news conference at Immigration
Department headquarters after the operation.
</P>
<P>
He said 41 notices of investigation were issued to houses which
had foreign maids. The employers, absent during the check, were
asked to present themselves at the immigration office to show the
documents of their maids, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a similar operation today in the northwest state of Pulau
Pinang, immigration officers detained nine foreign maids who had
no documents, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The checks and other enforcement actions would be intensified
after the amendments to the Immigration Act come into effect on
February 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendments which provide for harsher penalties, the
maximum fines are raised from 10,000 ringgit (about 4,000 U.S.
dollars) to 30,000 ringgit (about 12,000 U.S. dollars) for anyone
employing illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has given a two-week long amnesty that
allows illegal immigrants or foreigners who have overstayed to
leave the country by paying a compound of 1,000 ringgit (about 400
U.S. dollars) only. The reprieve expires the day after tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
According to Aseh, only 1,508 people including 937 Indonesians,
have so far taken advantage of the offer.
</P>
<P>
From August 15 to December 31 last year, the government
launched a campaign for registering the illegal foreign workers
whose number was estimated to be some 1.5 million for legal stay
in the country. But reports said there are still one million
illegal immigrants in the country now.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is determined to get rid of the illegals as they are
involved in more and more criminal activities, creating social
problems for the country, reports said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Tourism Shrinks in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign tourists
visiting South Korea last year declined for the first time since
1980, resulting in a travel deficit of 1.55 billion U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Korea National Tourism Corporation (KNTC) said today that
incoming tourists in 1996 totaled 3.68 million, down 1.87 percent
from the 3.75 million in 1995 and far below the 4 million target
set for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Corporation blamed the decline in foreign tourists on the
country's political unrest.
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese tourists, which used to account for more
than half of incoming tourists, was 1.53 million last year, down
8.4 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 4.65 million South Koreans traveled abroad last
year, up 21.7 percent from the previous year's 3.82 million.
</P>
<P>
As a result, South Korea's travel revenues stood at 5.42
billion U.S. dollars and travel expenditures amounted to 6.97
billion U.S. dollars, recording a deficit of 1.55 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rebuffs U.S. Allegation on Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's official mouthpiece
today rejected the latest allegation by new U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen on Iranian possession of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The official English daily Tehran Times carried an editorial
entitled "Slamming Iran Not to Benefit Clinton Administration."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cable News Network (CNN) recently,
Cohen mentioned Iran among other countries allegedly possessing
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times editorial said that "hitting out at Iran is
not only an everyday occurrence in the United States but it is
now part and parcel of the empty rhetoric of any U.S. politician
who intends to woo the influential Zionists."
</P>
<P>
It noted that the American officials, who are not
logic-oriented, mostly blindly reflected the views and indulge
the whims of the Israeli lobby, which is bossing the
U.S. politicians and pulling the strings of the White House
officials.
</P>
<P>
The editorial claimed that Iran is the chief victim of the
chemical weapons deployed by Iraq at the war fronts against the
Iranian troops during the eight-year war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
"If Iran had chemical weapons in its arsenal, it would have
used them in wartime against the Iraqi aggressors. In fact, such
warfare could have helped the Iranian army to a great
extent. However, no international observers reported the use of
chemical weapons on the part of Iran," it argued.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that Iran is a signatory to the
international conventions banning the use of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Iran-slashing policy of the United States has
not benefit any previous U.S. cabinets which have taken office
since the victory of the Islamic revolution, nor will it do in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the daily said, "instead of holding a futile hostile
attitude toward Iran, Washington had better adopt a realistic
approach, which will at least prevent the isolation of the
United States from its own allies."
</P>
<P>
It concluded by saying that "let us hope that other members of
the U.S. administration will not follow the example of
Cohen... and give priority to their national interests over
those of the Zionist regime."

<HEADLINE> Bahrain, Qatar Fail to Sign Mend-ties Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) meeting has failed to persuade member countries Bahrain and
Qatar to sign an agreement designed to help end their territorial
disputes, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, a delegate to the four-side
council committee meeting, returned home without saying anything
about the result of the session which ended in the Saudi western
coastal city of Jeddah at midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The four-side committee groups also foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman to settle the
Qatari-Bahraini border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The KUNA said the committee, formed during last December's GCC
summit in Doha, Qatar, opened the meeting Tuesday hoping that the
two countries will sign a memorandum of understanding aimed at
clearing the atmosphere for a possible final solution to the
territorial conflict between them.
</P>
<P>
But the committee again failed in convincing the two countries
to agree to the memo, it said.
</P>
<P>
The three previous committee meetings held earlier this month
in the Saudi capital Riyadh and Qatari capital of Doha and charged
with the same mission also ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain have been locked for decades in a dispute
over a cluster of small and potentially oil-rich islands,
sandbanks and reefs in the Gulf, controlled by Manama since the
1930s, but also claimed by Doha.
</P>
<P>
Doha presented the dispute to the International Court of
Justice at the Hague, the Netherlands, in 1991, a move opposed
by Manama which insists on a regional solution.
</P>
<P>
Ties were further strained after Bahrain accused two Qataris
of spying, which Doha denied, and boycotted the six-member GCC
summit in Qatar. Bahrain later pardoned the two Qataris.
</P>
<P>
The remaining issues to be sorted out for the signing of the
agreement were the suspension of media campaigns and the full
commitment of mediation efforts employed by Saudi Arabia, who
chairs the committee.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also stipulates prevention of any hostile act
against each country from the other.

CHONGQING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 242
overseas-funded enterprises had opened in the Chongqing Economic
and Technological Development Zone in China's Sichuan Province by
the end of 1996, involving a total investment of 910 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 9.6-sq-km zone was approved as a state-level development
zone in 1993, and more than two billion yuan has been used in
infrastructure construction there, making it one of the best spots
for overseas investment in the city.
</P>
<P>
It is to consist of three industrial parks, including Dangui
Industrial Park, which covers 1.5 sq km, whose first two phases of
construction have been completed at a cost of 35.7 million US
dollars. Major projects include a Sino-Japanese clutch plant and a
gearbox plant. Economists say that the park is expected to have
20-30 billion yuan in output value annually by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Some pillar industries - automobiles, electronics, foodstuff,

<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of fire disasters
and losses from fires in China last year were down 3.5 percent and
6.4 percent respectively from the year before, according to a
senior official with the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
China had a total of 36,856 fire disasters last year, causing
property losses of 1.03 billion yuan (about 120 million US
dollars). The number was declining, but there were some
conflagrations which caused great human and property losses.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fires were attributed to inadequate safety
precautions in buildings, a lack of fire-control systems, and
inadequate awareness about the danger of fires among the relevant
personnel as well as the general public.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Inflation Drops to Lowest Level Since </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia's annual inflation
rate fell to its lowest level in more than two and a half years
with the consumer price index (CPI) rising by 1.5 percent,
official figures released today showed.
</P>
<P>
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures showed the CPI
increased by just 0.2 percent in the December quarter -- the
lowest quarterly change since the same period in 1993, and it
contributed to the lowest annual change since early 1994.
</P>
<P>
The figures confirmed the federal government's optimism which
led to a revision of the CPI forecast in yesterday's mid-year
budget review to a one percent increase from the two percent
expected last August.
</P>
<P>
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello said today that the fall in
mortgage interest rates was the major reason for the Australia's
annual inflation rate dropping to its lowest level in more than
two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
"I don't speculate on interest rates future movements but the
major reason why they are falling is that mortgage interest rates
have fallen a negative 7.6 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expected the inflation rate to continue to fall, and said
"this is great news, we are back at an inflation rate of 1.5
percent, it means for wage earners prices aren't rising against
them."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Reduce Foreign Manpower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is planning to issue
laws aimed at replacing expatriate laborers with nationals in both
public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwaiti Minister of Planning Ali Fahd Al-Zumei,
the government intended to replace expatriates with Kuwaitis in
the public sector by 10 percent annually and in the private sector
by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a "comprehensive and demanding 14-step
strategy" to be executed over the next six months, Al-Zumei told
the parliament Tuesday. But he did not elaborate on the strategy.
</P>
<P>
The one-million-strong foreign workforce in Kuwait outnumber
local employees by more than five times.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's unemployment rate is 1.75 percent. About 68 percent of
workers employed in the Kuwaiti public sector are Kuwaiti
nationals, while in the private sector they only account for 5.5
percent, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
All Kuwaitis constitute just over 16 percent of the overall
workforce with 130,000 in the public sector and 62,000 in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Over 50,000 Kuwaitis more are expected to join the workforce by
the end of this century, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
"The government feels we should reach a balance in the
workforce. Within the next six months, we'll have a clearer view
with regard to jobs in the private sector," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti government would "establish something in
June" this year to make the private sector to respond in view of
the salary differences between expatriates and Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good chance of solving the unemployment problem,
but we must be realistic," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
There are huge differences in salary between expatriates and
Kuwaitis. Now salaries for those in the public sector cost the
country 65 percent of its oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
Financial statistics released at the Kuwaiti parliament showed
that annual salaries of expatriates in the Kuwaiti public sector
amount to 158.4 million Kuwait dinars (522.7 million U.S. dollars)
while those for the Kuwaitis account for 1.086 billion dinars
(3.584 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Motorola Israel Develops Cellular Voice-Dial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Drivers using cellular phone
will no longer fuss over dialing numbers while on road, as a new
device can now understand the user's spoken language and dial
itself, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
Motorola Israel has developed a new Dialog product based on
voice identification technology developed by local company ART,
said the latest issue of bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
The Dialog, which was launched at a recent Telecom '97
Exhibition in Tel Aviv, allows drivers to voice dial on cellular
phones with both hands on the steering wheel. The device may help
prevent road accidents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The device can be "taught" to identify names and numbers in any
language.
</P>
<P>
The user just presses a button and voices the name of person to
be dialed and the system locates the required number from a
pre-set list of telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
The system also allows for storage of "notes" on incoming calls
-- up to 10 seconds duration each -- without the user having to
search for a pen and paper.
</P>
<P>
Shamai Wasserman, head of Motorola Israel's technology and
advanced products division, said that the company plans to
export Dialog as an accessory to the cellular telephone market.
</P>
<P>
Motorola Israel, located in Tel Aviv, is a major subsidiary
corporation of the Illinois, U.S.A.-based electronics giant. It
recorded a local sales turnover of more than 1 billion
U.S. dollars for 1996, according to the bi-weekly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Needs More Professionals (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among those banks, BOC is the top handler of international
business and has hundreds of overseas branches and
offices. Therefore, it has more advantages compared with other
domestical banks, in learning international practices and having
employees trained abroad.
</P>
<P>
People at CCB, which used to take charge of financing key
projects, know more about government functions than banking
business matters.
</P>
<P>
ICBC and ABC each have a huge army of grass-root workers but
the majority of them only have a senior or junior middle school
education.
</P>
<P>
The lack of professionals has made it hard for these banks to
improve their performance, management and services.
</P>
<P>
The new banks, where the personnel is relatively younger and
better educated, pose a threat to the overstaffed four giants.
</P>
<P>
The four big banks employ 1.9 million people, with ABC the
giant with a payroll of 800,000 people. ICBC comes next with half
a million workers while CCB has 400,000 staff and BOC 200,000
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the big banks face the dilemma of suffering a
shortage of professionals but being overstaffed.
</P>
<P>
At present, the banks are mainly solving the problem by sending
their personnel for professional training in their own schools for
lectures by Chinese or foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ABC, ICBC and CCB are trying to explore
international business and open more overseas branches and
offices, following the example of BOC.
</P>
<P>
ABC has been successful in turning its Singapore branch into a
training base for its staff.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, these banks have tried to improve their efficiency
through strategic changes, mergers of loss-making branches, and
finding new work for surplus personnel.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts said that along with the gradual opening-up
of the country's banking sector, foreign banks, with their more
experienced and better-trained staff, present a big threat to
Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
Domestic banks should adopt better means to speed up the pace
of training employees to improve their viability and to accelerate
the country's efforts to commercialize and internationalize the
banks.

concern about the shortage of professionals in the banking
industry. They said that the problem has cast a negative impact on
the reform and development of the industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
They urged Chinese banks to employ more professionals,
otherwise it will be difficult to enhance their viability in both
international and domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the problem to the blind expansion of business
and setting-up of branches in the past decade, as well as the
outdated structure and work-style of banks which were transformed
from former government institutions.
</P>
<P>
Overstaffing has hindered the banks' efforts to employ more
professionals.
</P>
<P>
According to some bank officials, China now has 16 commercial
banks, and most of them were established in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The country's four oldest and largest commercial banks, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Agricultural
Bank of China (ABC), the China Construction Bank (CCB) and the
Bank of China (BOC), had the role as government institutions in
the distribution of government funds rather than commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Many staff members in the four banks used to be government
officials, while the majority of bank employees working in
grass-roots units have a poor education background.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Arrested on Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Japanese House of Councillors
member Tatsuo Tomobe was arrested today on suspicion of fraud over
a scheme involving a mutual aid fund run by the members of his
family.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came hours after the upper house voted unanimously
to deprive him of judicial immunity.
</P>
<P>
Under Japan's Constitution, Diet members have the immunity from
arrest while the parliament is in session unless they are caught
in the act of breaking a law or the Diet approves police to arrest
them.
</P>
<P>
Tomobe, 68, is the 17th Diet member to be arrested in Japan's
postwar period while the legislature is in session, and the first
 since the December l995 arrest of former Labor Ministry Toshio
Yamaguchi, who is now on trial for breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
Tomobe's wife Mikiko, 61, who chaired the Orange Kyosai board,
their son Momoo, 29, and three other Orange Kyosai executives,
were arrested Monday on suspicion of cheating about 145 million
yen of 12 people between July, 1994 and October, 1996 without the
intention to pay the interest or repay the principal.
</P>
<P>
Tomobe is suspected of receiving 53 million yen (about 442,000
U.S. dollars) for private benefits, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Kyosai fund, which collected more than eight billion
yen (66.67 million U.S. dollars) between 1992 and 1996, is run by
a pension fund named Nen-Kin-Kai, which enjoys Tomobe's political
support.
</P>
<P>
Police questioned Tomobe about the Orange Kyosai Sunday night
at the hospital where he is recovering from a
stroke. Investigators believe that he is fit enough to be detained
or arrested.
</P>
<P>
On November 12,1996, police raided Tomobe's home and the
offices of the Orange Kyosai in a probe into the suspected
violations of the Investment Law through the collection of
deposits from the general public without authorization.
</P>
<P>
Under Japan's Investment Law, an unlicensed institution is not
allowed to take deposits from non-members.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that the investigation will focus on the
alleged use of about one billion yen (8.33 million U.S. dollars)
to buy political influence in the 1995 upper house election.
</P>
<P>
After failing in four elections between 1983 and 1992, Tomobe
won a seat in the upper house in July, 1995.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's Vice-President Al-Zubeir
Mohammed Salih has said that "Sudan deems it necessary to
exchange views with friends in the region and the Islamic world."
</P>
<P>
Salih made the remarks in a meeting with Iranian First
Vice-President Hassan Habibi shortly after his arrival in Tehran
Tuesday, according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said that Salih delivered to
Habibi a message from Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed
al-Bashir to his Iranian counterpart Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Salih said that Sudan was now in a state of emergency because
its enemies attempted to destroy the Sudanese unity and national
identity.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has accused its neighbors Ethiopia and Eritrea of
invading Sudanese territory and backing an opposition offensive
launched earlier this month. But Addis Ababa and Asmara have
denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Habibi said that it is necessary for the two
Islamic states to exchange views in the wake of the recent
developments in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said that facts about the present situation in Sudan had to
be communicated to all Arab and Muslim nations of the world,
especially to those with which Sudan had cordial relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also discuss bilateral relations with
Sudanese officials.
</P>
<P>
In his two-day state visit to Tehran, the Sudanese vice-
president is accompanied by Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman
Mohammed Taha and other senior officials.

TOKYO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Japanese lawmaker Tatsuo Tomobe
was arrested by police on Wednesday for involving in a fraud
scheme which allegedly netted at least 145 million yen (about 1.21
million U.S. dollars), local press reported today.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses Iraq of Cease-fire Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities
reported 27 cases of cease-fire violation by Iraq in three months
from September to November 1996, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian complaint was delivered by Iran's permanent
representative to the United Nations Kamal Kharazi to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA's report said that the violations included movement
of Iraqi forces in the no man's lands, construction of bunkers
and installation of heavy and light arms in these areas.
</P>
<P>
At least seven cases of violations involved infiltration of
smugglers supported by Iraqi forces into Iranian territory and
their confrontation with Iranian border guards, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that on October 31, six Iraqi intelligence
officers and anti-government elements infiltrated into Iranian
territory. They fled into Iraqi territory after encountering
Iranian boundary police, it said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war from 1980 to 1988. Iran
wants to normalize its relations with Iraq, but there are some
problems, including the prisoners of war, which block the way for
improvement of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries agreed and maintained a cease-fire
since August 1988, there is no real peace between the two
rivals. During the past years, both sides reported the other's
ceasefire violations to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In the border areas, there is a "no war and no peace"
state. The two countries still keep a large number of their
armed forces along the borders.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Declares Famine National Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
declared the looming famine stemming from the prolonged drought a
national disaster.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued here last night said President
Daniel arap Moi had made the proclamation to waive customs duty
and Value Added Tax on some specified imported foods to feed the
drought-hit people.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moi said the Kenyan government would import maize
to ensure food supply amid severe drought.
</P>
<P>
The current famine has hit Eastern, Northeastern provinces and
some parts of the Central, Rift Valley and Coast provinces with
at least 3 million people victimized in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Agricultural Ministry said Kenya harvested 24
million bags of maize (90 kilos per bag) last year, a 17 percent
drop compared with 29 million bags in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
estimated that Kenya would need to import at least 1.3 million
tons of food grains in the 1996/97 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government this week increased the capital base of
the Contingency Fund from about 0.5 million U.S. Dollars to some
35 million U.S. Dollars in the wake of the looming famine.
</P>
<P>
The government has also set aside 5 million U.S. Dollars in
the current budget for relief food and a further 1.5 million U.S.
Dollars for purchase of famine relief supplies.

<HEADLINE> Dutch FM: NATO's Expansion Should Avoid Destabilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van Mierlo said here today that NATO's eastward
expansion should avoid destabilizing Europe.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion must proceed in a way that eases Moscow's
security concerns and avoid a destabilization in Europe, said van
Mierlo at a joint news conference after talks with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and European Trade Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we have to work out a new framework in which the
security of Russia can be safeguarded."
</P>
<P>
Russia fears that NATO's expansion would pose a threat to its
national security.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Russian Foreign Minister Yvegney Primakov told
the NATO foreign ministers during a meeting in Brussels that the
expansion could lead to a new division of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia's State Duma has been hesitating to ratify the Second
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) due to NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomrydin is to hold talks
here next week with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on NATO's
expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Van Mierlo, who is also the current president of the European
Union, said that it is important to avoid destabilization in
Europe when NATO implements its expansion plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- An international consortium of
15 banks from Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium
signed a loan agreement in Beijing today with the China Petroleum
Engineering Construction Corp (CPECC) for 80 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to CPECC president, Qin Anmin, the loan, which is one
of the largest of its kind for a Chinese company, will be used for
building large oil storage facilities and oil and gas pipelines in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Qin says that the oil storage facilities project is the largest
China has ever undertaken by winning international bidding, and
the contract is worth more than 398 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two oil storage facilities will have an annual crude oil
handling capacity of 20.5 million tons and daily gas handling
capacity of 7.6 million cu m. The total length of the pipeline
will be 264 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
CPECC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the China National
Petroleum Corp, has become involved in oil and gas exploration,
development, drilling, laying of oil and gas pipelines, and
construction work.

<HEADLINE> 900,000 College Students to Graduate this Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 900,000 college students
will graduate from colleges in China this summer, the highest
since New China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Around 50,000 are post graduates studying for master's or
doctor's degree. But most, around 849,000 students, are
undergraduates following two-year or four-year college courses.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 out of the college students have paid part of their
college tuition fees, which means they will in turn have a bigger
say in choosing jobs.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission has issued a circular to help
the large number of students to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels, departments in charge of
providing jobs for college graduates, colleges and universities
should actively create more job opportunities for the students,
the commission urged in the latest circular.
</P>
<P>
It encouraged regions, departments and work units to create
better conditions for job-hunting students, and recruit as many
college graduates as they can.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also asked students who receiving master's or doctor's
degree to work in colleges or universities, high-level research
institutes, and state-owned high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
An SEC official said that China has smoothly reformed its
method of enrolling college students. And a new system of job
seeking is being formed as the socialist market economy is being
established.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-plus self-paid students will look for jobs
themselves instead of relying on the government.
</P>
<P>
The way self-paying students find their jobs will provide a
reference, and become a base for a new system under which future
students will look for jobs, said Chen Xi, SEC section chief in
charge of college students' employment.
</P>
<P>
All colleges and universities in China will charge part of the
tuition fees this Autumn when Chinese schools enroll new students.
</P>
<P>
It means that an experiment that started four years in Dongnan
University and Shanghai International Studies University is being
promoted nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Verdict on Benazir's Petition expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Pakistan
is expected to announce its judgment today on deposed prime
minister Benazir Bhutto's petition against the dismissal of her
government.
</P>
<P>
The court is also likely to announce its verdict on the
petition filed by National Assembly Speaker Yosuf Raza Gillani,
challenging the dissolution of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On January 19, a seven-member bench of the court headed by
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah gave Benazir's counsel Aitzaz Ahsan
eight days to defend her against the dissolution of her government
by President Farooq Leghari on November 5, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed on November 13, 1996. But it was
returned by the Supreme Court registrar on November 19 on the
grounds that it contained frivolous, un-necessary and scandalous
material.
</P>
<P>
The modified petition was re-submitted by Aitzaz Ahsan on
November 21, but it was again returned. Finally, the regular
hearing on the petition started on November 29.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto has said that if her petition was accepted by
the Supreme Court, she would call a conference of all political
parties to formulate a policy for the future governance of the
country.
</P>
<P>
If the Supreme Court rejected her petition, she added, the
situation for her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) was not going to
change as it was already in the election process and stood a fair
chance of regaining power.
</P>
<P>
The PPP's arch rival, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) led by
Nawaz Sharif, however, does not see any chances of the National
Assembly or the Bhutto's government being restored.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that whichever way the Supreme Court verdict
goes on petitions of Benazir and Gillani challenging the
dissolution order will have a tremendous impact on Pakistan's
political situation in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Accuses Opposition of Distablizing Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
on Tuesday accused the opposition of plotting to "distablize the
country" and stressed that the country's internal differences
could only be solved through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
All the problems and differences in Yugoslavia "could only be
solved through dialogue, consultation and compromise in keeping
with the country's constitution and laws," said Lilic in
meeting with visiting Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The president said that all political forces in Yugoslavia
should try to maintain the stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Without national stability, there would be no economic
development in the country, which would also affect regional
stability and development," Lilic stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the country is strong can its people develop their
culture and democracy," Lilic added.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian opposition has been leading a protest campaign both
in the Yugoslav Capital of Belgrade and other major cities since
last December, after Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling
Socialists refused to admit defeat in last November's local
elections.

<HEADLINE> "China Threat" Not in China's History: US Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S Ambassador to China James
Sasser has said in Beijing that the so-called "China threat" is
not in China's history.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the ambassador noted
that in modern times, or over the last 500 years, China had not
been known as an expansionist, or aggressive nation.
</P>
<P>
According to Sasser, the Chinese government and people are much
more interested in focussing on economic development and
developing their own country.
</P>
<P>
"The resources are being devoted to internal development of the
economy and enhancing the quality of life of its people," he
stressed, adding, "those are not the actions of a country which is
threatening" to others.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, he said, China's performance is almost
spectacular. In 1996 the economic growth was within the range of
9-10 per cent, while inflation was brought down and held
stable. Sasser said he considered that a great achievement for the
Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
China has also made a number of achievements in foreign
affairs. He mentioned particularly the signing of the Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty, which was a significant and historical event in the
country's foreign affair record in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sasser said the positive momentum that has been projected in
Sino-US relations had been a very laudable achievement in Chinese
diplomacy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On US-China relationships, the ambassador noted, despite
problems in trade, human rights and proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, the common interests between the two countries
are much larger than the problems which seem "to divide our great
nations."
</P>
<P>
China and the US have common interests in trade, with the US
being the third largest direct investor in the Chinese economy,
after Hong Kong and Taiwan. Its market presently absorbs about
five per cent of China's total gross domestic products, with
bilateral trade extremely large and growing at a substantial pace.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share collective interests in security in the
Asia-Pacific region, as well as cooperation in trying to keep a
nuclear-free Korean Peninsular, he added.
</P>
<P>
"As we move in the areas of more cooperation in environment, in
trying to control international terrorism and criminal activity,
as well as illicit narcotics," he said, "that is something that
will benefit both nations and the whole world."
</P>
<P>
According to Sasser, it is essential to continue a policy of
intensive dialogue between China and the US to discuss common
interests and problems as they arise. And these should be done
through a continuation and regularization of high-level
conversations between the leaders of the two governments.
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraged to see there is more and more of that,"
Sasser noted.
</P>
<P>
The coming visits by President Jiang Zemin to the US and
President Clinton to China is very important in keeping a positive
momentum on the relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also mentioned the 58-strong congressmen that
had visited China since his arrival as ambassador last
February. Those visits helped the understanding of China on the
part of the US people.
</P>
<P>
As more people visit China and come to understand what is
happening here, the US Congress and the public will have a better
appreciation of China's achievements, as well as the problems
China has to deal with, Sasser added.
</P>
<P>
On US's annual review on China's Most Favored Nation (MFN)
trading status, Sasser agreed with President Clinton that annual
re-examination of MFN for China is irritative and abrasive to the
bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that in the future US congress will
decide that the MFN concept has outlived the truthfulness, and the
U.S. could move to a permanent normal trading status with China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ambassador said, he was optimistic about
negotiations between the US and China on China's joining the World
Trade Organization. The US should be more flexible in the
negotiations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Meets Qatari Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has met here with a senior Qatari official and sought
support from the Gulf state for Lebanon's reconstruction, the
state-run Radio Lebanon reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting Tuesday night, the Qatari Energy and
Industry Minister Abdullah Ben Hamad Al-Attiya stressed his
country's continuous support for the Lebanese government and the
process of reconstruction and development in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al-Thani
"was committed to the development of ties with Lebanon," and
that his current visit was in line with that policy.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari minister asserted that his country was keen on
"extending support to Lebanon on all fronts," and he was here to
discuss cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Radio Lebanon said that the talks between Hariri and Al-Attiya
in the premier's Beirut residence covered issues on the bilateral
relations and the situation in Lebanon and the region.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari minister arrived in Beirut Tuesday night for a
24-hour visit to examine ways in which the Gulf state could
finance some of Lebanon's reconstruction projects, well-informed
official Lebanese sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, when meeting with the Qatari emir on a visit to Paris
earlier this month, received promises from the emir that Doha
will participate in Lebanon's reconstruction projects, besides
efforts by a few international donors.

<HEADLINE> Weather Department to Play Greater Role in Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's weather forecasters
have been urged to help in the fight against natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
China suffers losses of dozens of billion kilograms of grain
every year due to droughts and floods, a Chinese official has told
a national conference.
</P>
<P>
The country frequently falls victim to natural disasters, over
70 percent of which are related to the weather, Yan Hong, deputy
director of the State Meteorological Administration, said at the
conference recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's agricultural sector will be at the mercy
of nature for a long period of time, stressing that frequent
droughts and floods are an important factor restricting China's
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Yan called on meteorological departments to play a greater
role.
</P>
<P>
At present the majority of the poverty-stricken rural
population in China live in areas where both the environment for
existence and agricultural conditions are poor.
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters, in particular weather-caused disasters are
frequent in the areas, but the climatic resources are also
abundant in those areas. However, the inhabitants are poorly
educated and lack necessary technology and knowledge to utilize
the resources, according to Yan.
</P>
<P>
He said that meteorological departments, as a public service
sector, should give full play to their advantages in science and
technology and information and help the farmers in
poverty-stricken areas change their meteorological resources into
realistic agricultural advantages. This should be done by
enhancing their ability to prevent and fight against natural
disasters and also by improving their educational levels.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, meteorological departments in China
have put into practice 926 poverty alleviation projects in 722
counties across the country, imported 405 foreign techniques and
held 872 training classes. The practice has brought about over 1.7
billion yuan in social and economic returns, Yan said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Diet Approves Arrest of Lawmaker in Fraud Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese House of Councillors
today deprived its member Tatsuo Tomobe of judicial immunity for
suspected involvement in a fraud scheme that allegedly had netted
at least 145 million yen (about 1.21 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The upper house's approval of the arrest of Tomobe has paved
the way for police to detain the lawmaker, a former member of the
leading opposition New Frontier Party (NFP).
</P>
<P>
Police are expected to issue a warrant later in the day for the
arrest of 68-year-old Tomobe, who has been hospitalized since
January 16 for a stroke, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Tomobe is implicated in a money scandal involving a mutual aid
fund run by the members of his family.
</P>
<P>
Tomobe will be the 17th Diet member to be arrested in the
postwar period and the first since December, 1995 when former
Labor Minister Toshi Yamaguchi, who is now on trial for breach of
trust, was arrested.
</P>
<P>
Tomobe's wife Mikiko, 61, who chaired the Orange Kyosai board,
their son Momoo, 29, and three other Orange Kyosai executives,
were arrested Monday on suspicion of cheating about 145 million
yen of 12 people between July, 1994 and October, 1996 without the
intention to pay the interest or repay the principal.
</P>
<P>
Tomobe is suspected of receiving 53 million yen (about 442,000
U.S. dollars) for private benefits, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Kyosai fund, which collected more than eight billion
yen (66.67 million U.S. dollars) between 1992 and 1996, is run by
a pension fund named Nen-Kin-Kai, which enjoys Tomobe's political
support.
</P>
<P>
Police questioned Tomobe about the Orange Kyosai Sunday night
at the hospital where he is recovering from a
stroke. Investigators believe that he is fit enough to be detained
or arrested.
</P>
<P>
On November 12,1996, police raided Tomobe's home and the
offices of the Orange Kyosai in a probe into the suspected
violations of the Investment Law through the collection of
deposits from the general public without authorization.
</P>
<P>
Under Japan's Investment Law, an unlicensed institution is not
allowed to take deposits from non-members.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that the investigation will focus on the
alleged use of about one billion yen (8.33 million U.S. dollars)
to buy political influence in the 1995 upper house election.
</P>
<P>
After failing in four elections between 1983 and 1992, Tomobe
won a seat in the upper house in July, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, US to Finish Defense Pact Talks Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Negotiating panels from the
United States and the Philippine governments are expected to
finish their talks on forging a new defense pact covering visiting
U.S. troops before June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency today quoted Foreign Affairs
Secretary Domingo Siazon as saying that the two panels would
buckle down soon to draft a new bilateral defense agreement which
is expected to be ready by June for submission to the senates of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said he and U.S. Ambassador to Manila Thomas Hubbard had
discussed the matter and agreed to facilitate the formation of
their governments' respective panels for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement has become necessary as the existing Mutual
Defense Treaty has no clear provisions to govern visiting U.S.
troops after U.S. forces left the country following the Philippine
Senate's rejection in 1991 of a U.S. treaty seeking an extension
of U.S. bases in the country for another 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it was widely believed that the lack of
adequate provisions covering visiting U.S. troops was partly
responsible for the temporary suspension of the annual "Balikatan"
military exercises between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) --There is great potential for
closer cooperation in industry and agriculture with the Republic
of Moldova.
</P>
<P>
The message was given by an envoy from Moldova on the eve of
the fifth anniversary of the two countries forging diplomatic
links.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Cusnir, Charge d'affairs ad interim of the Embassy of
the Republic of Moldova to China, made the remark during an
interview with Xinhua to mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
He said Moldova and China have both made great efforts to
develop active cooperation and long-term, sincere friendship.
</P>
<P>
He added that Moldova gives top priority to developing good
relations with China among Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
China and Moldova established diplomatic relations on January
30, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Moldova announced its independence on August 27, 1991, Cusnir
recalled, adding that China supported the people of Moldova to be
masters of their own destiny and took the lead in recognizing the
Republic of Moldova.
</P>
<P>
China occupies a pivotal position in the world, he said, adding
that forging diplomatic ties with China was of great significance
for the strengthening of Moldova's sovereignty and independence.
</P>
<P>
There is friendly cooperation and mutual support and
understanding between Moldova and China, with both countries
sharing a common desire for developing mutually beneficial
relations.
</P>
<P>
Cusnir spoke highly of China's efforts in supporting Moldova's
independence and territorial integrity. He said his country also
supports China's reunification policy.
</P>
<P>
Since the forging of diplomatic ties five years ago, there have
been frequent consultations between the two foreign ministries,
and broad co-operation between the two legislative departments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 16 co-operative documents on politics, economy, culture and
science, which were signed by both sides during a series of
high-level visits, have laid a good legal foundation for the
co-operation between the two countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cusnir believed that there is great potential for greater
cooperation in industry and agriculture.

<P>
SOFIA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's new President Petar
Stoianov today authorized Nikolai Dobrev, prime minister nominated
by the ruling Socialist Party, to form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the presidential mandate, Dobrev told the press
that he will try to bring the most respected experts and
politicians into his cabinet and work with all political forces to
get the country out of the current economic and social crisis.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians of the Democratic Left headed by the
Socialist Party decided that they will organize a coalition
government. If that effort fails, they said, they will form a
provisional government accountable to the current parliament whose
mandate expires this summer.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition parties insist that Socialists give up
their right to form a new cabinet and let the president to
directly form a caretaker government so as to pave the way for an
early general election.
</P>
<P>
They also threatened to call mass protest rallies to thwart the
Socialists' effort in forming a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party, which led the former coalition government,
is only half way through its four-year term. It named Dobrev as
new primer minister on January 8 after the resignation of the
former prime minister Zhan Videnov in last December.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Province Leader in Aquatic Products Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Average annual per capita
consumption of aquatic products in China's Fujian province was 90
kg last year, keeping it first in China, as it has been for eight
years.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has made considerable progress in fishing, breeding and
processing and caught 2.84 million tons of aquatic products in
1996, a 10.7-percent rise over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 36 vessels were added to the oceangoing fleet,
bringing the total number to 178, and last summer, a fleet of 500
vessels was sent to the northern coast of Fujian and output was
doubled.
</P>
<P>
Acreage for marine breeding was expanded by 6,600 ha last year,
and output of fresh water eels, abalone, and turtles is greater
than in all other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Ten new aquatic processing factories have been built with a
combined output of 20,000 tons a year, providing one billion yuan
in value. Fujian's exports of roast eel make up 40 percent of the
world's total.

<HEADLINE> Call For More Mature Business People in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese business people are
being asked to adopt new management concepts and to increase their
knowledge for a new generation of more mature managers.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director of China's Administration of State
Property, Pan Yue, made this comment at the closing of a national
training course for board members of companies.
</P>
<P>
"The effort to develop a market economy in China calls for the
cultivation of a contingent of mature entrepreneurs as soon as
possible," Pan said, noting that as China develops a socialist
market economy, companies must learn to face increasingly stiff
market competitions and to be responsible for their own gains and
losses.
</P>
<P>
"Mature enterprises call for mature entrepreneurs, and mature
entrepreneurs can bring up mature enterprises," Pan said. China is
replacing its planned economic system with a modern corporate
system to meet the demands of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
"This task has fallen on the shoulders of managers of
state-owned enterprises and I must say they are facing the
challenge of embracing new management concepts and increasing
their bank of knowledge," Pan said.
</P>
<P>
China's effort to develop more mature entrepreneurs will focus
on training board members, Pan pointed out. More than 4,200 board
members were trained in the first session that was started in
August of last year.

<HEADLINE> East China Speeds up Power Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The East China Power Group is
to inject more money into power construction by adding 10
generating units with a combined capacity of 2.585 million
kilowatts this year.
</P>
<P>
Ten other power projects, with a combined generating capacity
of 8.2 million kw, and auxiliary transmission projects
will also be launched later this year.
</P>
<P>
Qian Zhongwei, director of East China Power Administration and
general manager of East China Power Group, said that east
China produced 195.7 billion kwh of electricity in 1996, up
6.9 percent over 1995. The region also installed 16 new generating
units with a combined capacity of 2.35 million kw last year.
</P>
<P>
With the increased generating capacity, the east China power
grid will be able to produce sufficient electricity to meet the
demands of economic development in Shanghai, Jiangsu,
Zhejiang and Anhui provinces this year, said the director.
</P>
<P>
According to Qian, the east China power grid is now able to
supply 212 billion kwh of electricity annually. The power demands
of the three provinces and Shanghai this year is estimated at 213
billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
It means a near balance will be achieved for for the whole
year under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
As one of the country's most economically-developed regions,
East China has spent 82.17 billion yuan (one U.S. dollar equals to
8.3 Chinese yuan) on power construction over the past decade,
including the use of 12.9 billion worth of foreign funds, and
added 21.43 million kw of generating capacity and completed the
installation of 3,180 km of high-voltage power transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the entire east China power grid had
an aggregate generating capacity of 42.78 million kw and generated
200 billion kwh of electricity a year, both showing marked
increases over the 1983 figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Alligators have snapped
their way back from the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago only dozens of them still existed. But now
the toothy alligators have found heaven in Xuancheng, in east China's
Anhui Province where a marshy home has been established for more
than 5,000 alligators.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Crocodile was on the brink of extinction in the
early 1970s, and China set up a natural protection zone for
them in 1983. This not only provided effective protection for the
species, but also made major breakthroughs in artificially
breeding the reptiles.
</P>
<P>
The survival rate of artificial breeding has reached 91
percent, and the number of Chinese alligators has risen from just
dozens when the home was first established to more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Chinese alligators have been sent to many zoos
across the country.

<HEADLINE> India Sees Capital Flight to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- There has been a capital
flight of 11.3 billion U.S. dollars from India to the United
States through abnormal trade pricing in the past couple of years,
according to the latest issue of the quarterly journal Finance
India.
</P>
<P>
The development of the global price matrix and an analysis of
India's trade with the United States have resulted in the
estimation of a significant capital outflow through over-invoiced
imports and under-invoiced exports.
</P>
<P>
While comparing India's import prices from the United States
with average and adjusted world import prices from the United
States, the analysis showed that the value of over-invoiced
India's imports ranged from 660.8 million to 481.7 million U.S.
dollars during 1994 and 840.4 million to 587.1 million dollars
during 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under similar comparison of Indian export prices to the United
States, the value of under-invoiced Indian export prices ranged
from 5.2328 billion to 1.5936 billion dollars during 1994 and
4.7439 billion and 1.214 billion dollars during 1995.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested detection and control of capital flight
from India to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Becomes Environment Crisis in Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- New Delhi and other prominent
towns of the national capital region (NCR) are suffering from
excessive air, water and noise pollution, a latest major study on
the NCR, sponsored by the Indian Ministry of Environment and
Forests, has found.
</P>
<P>
Due to unchecked immigrants from other states as well as rapid
industrialization, the national capital territory of Delhi and its
surrounding areas are faced with serious ecological degradation,
shortage of basic civic amenities and lowering of living
standards.
The situation will reach a crisis level by the turn of the century
unless proper environmental planning is resorted to, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
An important finding of the study is that Delhi and its nearby
NCR towns of Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Panipat and Meerut are the most
polluted in terms of air quality and fall in the dangerous
category.
</P>
<P>
A survey of noise levels in the residential, commercial,
industrial and silence zone areas of Delhi and nearby towns
revealed that the noise equivalent level was above the standards
prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board in most of the
urban settlements.
</P>
<P>
The report also stated that the surface water bodies are
grossly polluted as a result of uncontrolled waste water
discharges.

<HEADLINE> Thai Oil Imports Soar 47 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's oil imports were
posted at about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars during the first 11
months of last year, a 47-percent rise over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the country imported 4.3
billion dollars' worth of crude oil, 68.6 percent more than the
same period of 1995, but the import value of refined oil products
was at 1.2 billion dollars, merely up 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the oil imports was fueled by the growing
domestic demand for oil in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's oil consumption, excluding that by the petrochemical
industry, rose by 10.1 percent in the first 11 months of last
year, an average of 884,470 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The growth gap between imports of crude oil and refined oil
products was mainly due to the change in the demand pattern in the
country, after two new oil refineries went into production in
eastern Thailand's Rayong Province earlier last year.

That will bring extra costs of 6 billion marks (about 3.96

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian President Outlaws Crimea Government Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
today outlawed a resolution passed by the Crimean parliament last
week to sack the Kiev-backed prime minister and replace the
present government with a new Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma presented his decree to the Constitutional Court which,
he said, was likely to declare the move unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian presidential office said that under the
constitution, only the president has the right to appoint or sack
the Crimean prime minister. So the parliament's unilateral
decision to remove Arkady Demidenko is unlawful.
</P>
<P>
But the speaker of the Crimean parliament, Vasily Kiselev, said
legislators would stick to their resolution.
</P>
<P>
Crimea, which has a mainly Russian population, is part of
Ukraine but was given autonomous status last year. Its parliament
passed a new constitution which was approved by Kiev.
</P>
<P>
On January 23, the parliament voted 52 to 29 for a resolution
to remove Prime Minister Arkady Demidenko and make the present
government an acting one until a new team is elected by February 5.
</P>
<P>
The document said deputies were conforming to the Ukrainian
constitution, approved last June, by forming a Council of
Ministers to replace the present government.
</P>
<P>
But Demidenko told deputies the decision was illegal and that
he would protest to Kuchma and he accused them of trying to win
cabinet posts for themselves in the new Council.
</P>
<P>
Crimea, which has a population of 2.7 million, was part of
Russia for nearly two centuries until Moscow "gave" it to Ukraine,
then a Soviet republic, in 1954.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The protectionism practiced
by the United States are obstacles for the integration of the west
hemisphere, said a senior Latin American banker today.
</P>
<P>
Sebastian Cunha, president of the Latin American Bank
Federation (FELABAN), made the remarks at a meeting here with
Panamanian bank representatives.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries "should not assume protectionistic
positions in the negotiations nor demand, at the same time, that
the weakest countries open up their economies without any
restrictions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank official noted that hemispherical integration was
gaining more and more strength every day despite the lack of
uniform without any restrictions."
</P>
<P>
Cunha believes that Latin America needs an original
integration. "We have to develop our integration as something new,
unique and special, a joint venture -- which is very common at the
moment -- and not as a federal state," he said.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government from the west hemisphere,
except Cuba, promised to establish a Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Latin American banking system, the Brazilian
banker said that it was prepared to integrate but global
legislation on this matter hadn't existed yet.
</P>
<P>
He cited the case of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur)
where legislation does not allow -- as in the European Union --
financial operations such as the Banco de Brasil to provide loans
for a company in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"What we are discussing in the FELABAN is what would be the
best way to do it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seeks Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
seeking 15.7 billion U.S. dollars in foreign aid to finance a
total of 648 government-sponsored projects in 1997, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have released details of the 648 government-proposed
projects. The value of the projects is 19.91 billion U.S. dollars
and 15.7 billion U.S. dollars is needed in foreign project
assistance," National Development Planning Agency Deputy Chairman
Rahadi Ramelan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The projects would be put forward at the Consultative Group for
Indonesia (CGI) meeting in Tokyo, possibly in June, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank-chaired CGI, which was formed in 1990, consists
of 20 countries, including Japan and several other financing
agencies.
</P>
<P>
The CGI pledged 5.26 billion dollars in aid to Indonesia in
1996, compared with 5.35 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ramelan said projects in the transportation, education, mines
and energy and social sectors will get top priority.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia proposed 689 projects worth 21.24 billion dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Ramelan failed to mention if the loans would further increase
the country's foreign debt, which, according to an official
estimate, has reached the psychological level of 110 billion
dollars.

BUDAPEST, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has become a

The Hungarian customs seized 1,137 kilograms of narcotics last
year, of which, 815 kilograms were hashish and 316 kilograms were
heroin, a Hungarian News Agency report said.

Recent findings show that a drug trafficking route has emerged
with drugs from east and southeast Asia being transported to the
European countries via the Balkan peninsula and Hungary.

Of the cases discovered in Hungary last year, those involving
small amount of two or three kilograms increased sharply,

<HEADLINE> Italy to Prod EU to Reopen Talks With Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy will urge the European Union
(EU) to resume stalled talks on closer ties with Croatia, Foreign
Undersecretary Piero Fassino told reporters after holding talks
here today with his Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader.
</P>
<P>
Fassino said that reopening negotiations, deadlocked last year
amid concern over civil liberties in Croatia, towards a
cooperation accord would help strengthen stability in the Balkans
and consolidate the post-Dayton process.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Peace Agreement signed in the United States in 1995
ended the years-long civil war in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Italian diplomat said that Italy would also like to see the
EU restart its Phare aid program in Croatia, which was suspended
last year.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Sanader, who conveyed an invitation from
President Franjo Tudjman for Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro to visit Croatia, hailed the Croatia-Italy relations as
having been "constantly improving over the past year."
</P>
<P>
The two deputy ministers also studied Croatia's bid to join in
the trilateral cooperation accord between Italy, Slovenia and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Fassino said that for the moment Croatia might be involved in
projects which "directly concern the country."

<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The government has decided to
continue giving top priorities to develop Italy's aerospace
sector, Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of a report on small and
medium-sized industry, drawn up by the Association of Aerospace
Industries (AIA), Bersani said the crisis in Italy's aerospace
industry is subsiding but the sector still needs to be put into a
position where it can compete, an effort in which the government
intends to play an important role given the sector's central and
strategic position.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue the policy of getting the aerospace
sector back on its feet". At the same time, however, the sector
"must do it part in getting competitive", said Bersani.
</P>
<P>
The aerospace industry, Bersani underscored, is strategic for
its place on the international level and its technological
ramifications. "Italy has set important objectives like that of
entering European programs. Such a policy merits coherence between
the actions of government and companies " he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bersani, in the near future the key to
competitiveness in the sector will be organizational. "We must
allow small and medium sized companies to be put on a level where
they can compete, he said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Improves Traffic Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Successful traffic control
measures have helped reduce the road accident rate in Beijing last
year.
</P>
<P>
Traffic flow at intersections increased by five to 10 percent
and traffic eased up on 52 sections of road which used to have
serious, frequent traffic jams, Hu Cenglin, an official in charge
of the capital city's traffic, was quoted by China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
New measures this year to enhance efficiency and traffic safety
in Beijing include improving traffic management on roads that pass
primary and secondary schools, and setting shorter time limits for
dealing with injury and damage compensation claims, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
A new traffic patrol system last year resulted in faster
response to traffic accidents, and congestion improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, traffic police dealt with 16,000 traffic jams,
removed 42,000 obstacles, and speedily handled more than 5,000
minor accidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
The death rate from traffic accidents in the capital in 1996
was 8.04 persons per 10,000 vehicles, down 0.46 from 1995, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Later this year the time limits for deciding damage and injury
compensation will be shortened to 15 days from 45 days and 30 days
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The time limit for applying for replacement licence plates and
passes will be reduced from 30 to 15 days, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Application forms will be available from any vehicle management

<HEADLINE> Pilot Farmer of China's Better-Off Policy   (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- When farmer Gong Shiquan became
the richest man in his village he never turned his back on his
poorly off neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old farmer-turned-businessman in Haihewan Village,
Shuanggang Township, in the suburbs of Tianjin, decided to share
his good fortune, not by handing out his money, but by helping his
fellow villagers make their own fortunes.
</P>
<P>
Now Wang heads a mini business empire that last year had a
turnover of 680 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The rags to riches transformation has taken place in Gong's
village, Haihewan, once a fortified settlement for troops of the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Just a decade ago more than 1,000 poor farmers were forced to
seek loans of 1.2 million yuan from their local government in North
China's biggest port city, Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Gong started a transportation business 13 years ago, and soon
become the number one wealthy person in the locality, with
private property totaling hundreds of thousands yuan.
</P>
<P>
Haihewan became one of the earliest beneficiaries of China's
policy to encourage prosperity in its vast stretches of rural area.
</P>
<P>
The village's poverty-stricken situation remained unchanged
until Gong became a model of rural better-off people. The annual
average per capita income of local farmers was then less than 200
yuan, though the country's reform policy provided farmers with
opportunities to become prosperous.
</P>
<P>
During the Spring festival, Chinese New Year, in 1986, Gong
visited every family in his village, and was stunned by what he
saw -- fellow villagers with not enough food or clothes.
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked by the looks from villagers which suggested a
longing for prosperity, because I knew very well what poverty
means to a farmer," Gong recalled.
</P>
<P>
He tried his best to aid the poor farmers, but he soon found
that it was impossible for him to help all his villagers by just
donating a limited amount of money.
</P>
<P>
Later, he sold his truck for 50,000 yuan and asked some of the
villagers to start a business with him. Some 17 households each
raised 1,000 yuan and built a furniture factory. Eight months
later each of the households earned a profit of 8,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Engagement with China Correct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that his administration's policy of "constructive
engagement" with China is the correct one.
</P>
<P>
At his first news conference at the White House since his
inauguration, Clinton told reporters: "I still believe that the
(China) policy we're following is the correct one."
</P>
<P>
"It does not mean that if we had followed a policy of isolating
ourselves from China, when no one else in the world was prepared
to do that, that we would have gotten better results," the
president said.

<P>
The success of the Gong's furniture factory drew the attention
of other villagers. It was expanded into a well known local
business involving 88 households. The following year Gong turned
the factory into a motorcycle factory after researching the market
potential.
</P>
<P>
A few months later the motor-cycles produced by Gong and his
villagers were being sold in Hebei, Shanxi and provinces in
northeast China, as well as in big cities including Beijing and
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1989, the total output value of the factory
reached 12 million yuan, and all the families involved in the
project began a new life as wealthy villagers.
</P>
<P>
To help more people get rich, Gong decided to transform his
private factory into a collectively-owned one.
</P>
<P>
The factory set up a group company, with Gong as its general
manager. Thanks to aid from the local governments, the annual
output value of the company has ranked first among the motor-cycle
businesses owned by townships in the country.
</P>
<P>
As the secretary of a Communist Party village branch secretary,
Gong has led all the villagers in pulling down old shabby houses
over 100 years old, to replace them with 150 new homes with a
total floor space of 15,000 square meters. The house building
project cost more than 80 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The village has now channeled over 200,000 yuan yearly to set
up a welfare system for the elderly, providing free meals and
pocket money for them. It also invest money in education and
cultural undertakings.
</P>
<P>
So far, the group company has six factories and a joint
venture. The annual output value of the village in 1996 totaled
680 million yuan. It generated 48 million yuan in taxes and
profits and the annual per capita income on average
was 6,500 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1978, Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping put
forward the policy of encouraging some people and regions to
become prosperous sooner in order to eventually achieve common
prosperity of the entire Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Economists cited Gong's work as a successful example of this
policy.
</P>
<P>
But Gong has his own explanation to his success.
</P>
<P>
"This is not alms, but a road leading to common prosperity,"
Gong said.
</P>
<P>
"I also get more benefit from common prosperity," he said. "Now
my property is much more than hundreds of thousands of yuan."

<HEADLINE> Troop Withdrawal Starts in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military has
begun to withdraw its troops from a southern Philippine town as
stipulated in an interim truce it signed Monday with the rebel
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Lt. Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Army's 6th Infantry
Division, said the pullout from Buldon town in central Mindanao,
which started on Monday, would be gradual, according to today's
Philippine Daily Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the situation in the town warrants, the
government troops deployed there since January 1 will be pulled
out.
</P>
<P>
The military and the MILF on Monday signed an interim
cease-fire agreement to end the week-long fighting that started on
January 16 and left six soldiers and 40 MILF rebels killed.
</P>
<P>
Lanang Ali, chairman of the MILF cease-fire committee, said
MILF field commanders in Buldon have started complying with the
terms of the agreement, which calls for the removal of MILF
checkpoints along a highway linking Buldon and another town.
</P>
<P>
Army Maj. Gen. Joselin Nazareno and Ali will meet on February 9
to assess if the cease-fire accord was "implemented to the
letter."
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway group of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is currently the biggest anti-government
group in the country after the MNLF struck a peace deal with
Manila last September.
</P>
<P>
The MILF rejected the MNLF-government peace accord and wanted
its own peace talks with the government.

<HEADLINE> Too Few Men Causes Social Problems in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- There are more women than men in
Poland and the imbalance in the sex ratio has become a major
social problem, the press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance has been caused mainly by the shorter life
expectancy of males, which was 67.6 in 1995, compared with 76.4
for women.
</P>
<P>
Smoking, drinking and other bad habits are cited in a report by
the Health and Social Welfare Ministry as the main causes of early
death among men.
</P>
<P>
The report shows the sex ratio between men and women in Poland
is 100:105 in rural areas and 100:108 in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Among elderly people in their 80s, the ratio is an astonishing
100:230.
</P>
<P>
Poland saw a significant imbalance between the sexes after
World War II, because of the deaths of so many Polish men during
the war.
</P>
<P>
The situation improved in the 1950s, but since the mid 1960s,
the average life-span of Polish men has been falling steadily.

<HEADLINE> Clash in Indonesia's Province Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A two-day clash between
residents of two villages near Tembaga Pura, Timika, in
Indonesia's easternmost province of Irian Jaya, is now under
control, a military officer said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Trikora Military Command Johny Lumintang said
Tuesday the clash started Sunday after a man, a resident of Banthi
village, was caught having sex with the spouse of an Utikini
villager.
</P>
<P>
Utikini villagers protested and demanded compensation, which
was rejected by Banthi villagers, leading to the clash, the Antara
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lumintang said five people were killed and 20 others injured in
the clash.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the incident from recurring, leaders of the two
villages held talks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lumintang said troops sent to the villages Tuesday had
contained the unrest.
</P>
<P>
Timika is the site of the giant Freeport Indonesia Gold and
Copper Mines, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Freeport Mcmoran. It
covers an area of 26,400 square kilometers and its surroundings
are also home to stone-age tribes.
</P>
<P>
The area has seen frequent unrest in recent years, often
involving clashes between the indigenous communities and the
authorities or Freeport employees.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Garment Exports Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' garments and
textile exports dropped by 2.8 percent in 1996 to 2.7 billion U.S.
dollars from the figure for 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Garments and Textile Export Board attributed the slight
drop to sluggish demand from quota countries, which account for 77
percent of the Philippines' total annual apparel exports, the
local paper Philippine Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 garments export volume also failed to meet the
3-billion-dollar target the board set for that year.
</P>
<P>
Shipments to quota countries went down by 6.13 percent to 2.1
billion dollars from 2.3 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the quota countries, the United States remained the biggest
buyer of Philippines garments and textiles in 1996 despite a
7-percent drop in its imports to 1.6 billion dollars from the
figure for 1995.
</P>
<P>
But export turnover to non-quota countries rose 9.1 percent to
680 million dollars from 623 million dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Smokeless Coal Power Plant Being Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Work on a thermal power
station, believed the largest of its kind in the world, has
started in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Zou Jiahua was a VIP guest at a ceremony to mark
the start of work in Yangcheng County.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, zou said that operation of the
Yangcheng Power Plant has opened a new way in the running of power
plants by allowing foreign participation.
</P>
<P>
The plant will also mean electricity being 'transported'
between different provinces rather than just coal, he added.
</P>
<P>
The anthracite-fuelled plant will be equipped with six
350,000-kw generating units, generating an estimated 10 billion
kilowatt hours of electricity a year. All of the power produced
will be fed to energy-short Jiangsu Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
The first generating unit will become operational in 1999 and
the whole project will be completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost around 13.3 billion yuan, which is to be
raised and repaid by the Yangcheng International Power Company,
which consists of six companies from Shanxi, Jiangsu and the
United States.

WELLINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's foreign trade

deficits since July 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics NZ said in a press release received today that in
December 1996, NZ exports were valued at about 1.709 billion NZ
dollars (1.179 billion U.S. dollars) and imports at about 1.699
billion NZ dollars (1.172 billion U.S. dollars).

has been improving since a low point in February.
</P>
<P>
It added that "In recent months, the exports trend has also
shown a small deterioration but the imports trend is declining at
a faster rate."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A national "Century Tour For
Environmental Protection," a campaign involving legal checks and
publicizing by media, will spotlight conservation of sustainable
resources around the country this year, according to today's
"China Daily."
</P>
<P>
The campaign organizing committee made the announcement at a
ceremony yesterday in Beijing. This is the campaign's fifth year,
Last year, the theme was "Protection of Water For Life."
</P>
<P>
China is rich in resources, but they are comparably sparse per
person. For example, the supply of ten kinds of important
available mineral resources will not be able to meet the demands
of development in the next four years, said Yang Zhenhuai,
deputy-director of the Environment Protection and Resource
Conservation Committee under the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
This year, legal systems on the protection of land, water,
forestry, minerals, energy, oceans, grasslands, animal and plant
species, the climate and travel resources will be broadly
publicized.
</P>
<P>
Continuous efforts are being urged to promote the clean-up of
six polluted lakes and rivers and the shut-down of 15 kinds of
heavy-pollutant industries.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the country's 15 ministries, commissions and Party
departments, the five-year-old environmental protection campaign
will conduct more checks on law implementation and make full use
of televisions, radios and newspapers.

<P>
LISBON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- European soccer ruling body UEFA
will kick off a campaign against racism with a Europe vs Africa
match which gathers the best players from the two continents.
</P>

Racism now becomes common in the pitch and out of, it's main
the reason for Wednesday night's all-star match at Benfica's
120,000-capacity Stadium of Light.
</P>
<P>

affairs, says the match, scheduled for a 9:15 p.m. kickoff,
demonstrates a commitment "to stamp out the racism and racist
incidents that have regrettably become a feature of some sporting
occasions."
</P>
<P>
German national team coach Berti Vogts and former Dutch
national team manager Rinus Michels have compiled a European squad
to face the African team coached by Algeria's Rabah Madjer and
Mawade Wade from Senegal.
</P>

Vogts and Michels also brought together Italian Pierluigi
Casiraghi, Portuguese Joao Pinto of Benfica, Dutchman Ronald de
Boer and Germany's Matthias Sammer.

The African All-Star squad includes six of Nigeria's Olympic
gold-medal winning squad and three of South Africa's African
championship winning squad.
</P>
<P>
Benfica have players in both squads, with Portugal's Joao Pinto
in the European camp and Paulo Antonio of Angola in the African.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks surrendered
big gains today, with major indexes ending barely higher as bonds
retreated from an early rally.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose almost 100 points
near the open and held a gain of about 90 through much of the
session, lost 4.61 points to 6,656.08. The blue-chip barometer has
slid 228 points over the past five sessions, more than halving the
year's impressive gain to 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 4-to-3
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaled
526.42 million shares, up from 435.55 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list, up more than 11 points
during the session, close unchanged at 765.02.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.08 to 402.86, the Nasdaq
composite index rose 1.56 to 1,354.37, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index rose 1.91 to 588.07.
</P>
<P>
Stocks got an early boost from the bond market, where interest
rates fell sharply after the Labor Department reported that
employment costs, which constitute two-thirds of a product's
price, rose 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter, meeting analyst
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
But bonds pulled back as more traders used the big gains to
grab some profits.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose this morning, the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond fell as low as 6.83 percent from late Monday's 6.94
percent, which was its highest finish since late September. But as
bonds retreated in the afternoon, the long-bond yield jumped back
to 6.92 percent.

Clinton was answering a question at the White House news

</P>
<P>
"I have been assured personally by the highest levels of the

Janet Reno said Saudi Arabia had failed to provide answers to key
questions that the U.S. investigators wanted.

said his balanced budget will help to renew public schools,
rebuild crumbling classrooms, double funding for public charter
schools, increase funding for Goals 2000 by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the program will help U.S. students to reach high
standards and master the basics of reading, writing, math and
science.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan would help realize the nation's goal that
every 8-year-old can read, every 12-year-old can log onto the
Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college, all the Americans
will have the knowledge they need to meet the challenges of the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton did not specify the outlay to education in his
new budget which will be announced earlier next month, he said the
budget will more than double the investment in technology, to take
children up to computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"It will also enable us to connect our schools and our libraries
to the Information Superhighway," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised to increase by a third the investment in
partnerships with teachers and industries to develop quality
educational programming and technology. "In short, the budget will
connect our children to the best educational technology in the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said the doors to college education will be opened
wider. The national support for college education in the year 2002
will be more than double than present, from 24 billion U.S.
dollars to 58 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the budget will fully pay for a 1,500 dollars of
tuition tax credit, a Hope Scholarship for the first two years of
college and to achieve the goal of making two years of college
education as universal as a high school diploma is today.
</P>
<P>
It will also allow a working family to deduce up to 10,000
dollars a year for taxes for the cost of any college tuition or
job training.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Clinton said, the budget will increase funding for
scholarships to make 130,000 more students eligible for the
maximum scholarships and 218,000 older, low-income Americans
available for college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also declared continued reform in student loan programs
to make college loans easier for students to get and easier to pay
back.
</P>
<P>
He said, the new budget will cut interest rates on loans to
students and cut fees for four million low- and middle-income
students in half. Fees on two and a half million more will be cut
by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new plan also include an increase in funding for
work-study positions for students, increasing position from
700,000 to 1,000,000 per year. Part of the positions will be
tutors for children in reading.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acknowledges Mistakes in Fund-raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
acknowledged that he made mistakes in last year's campaign
fund-raising, but denies selling access to the White House.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first press conference of his second term,
Clinton defended his participation in White House receptions with
major Democratic donors.
</P>
<P>
According to a list of coffees released by the White House last
week, bankers had contributed some 325,000 U.S. dollars to
Democrats at one coffee attended by Clinton. Another regulator
donated 500,000 U.S. dollars at another coffee with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the coffees themselves are a very good device,"
Clinton said. "But I do believe, particularly if sponsored by a
political party, it's not appropriate for the regulator to be
there."
</P>
<P>
The Senate Government affairs Committee is about to launch an
investigation of the practices of Democrats in campaign
fund-raising. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno is also
considering whether to name a special prosecutor to investigate
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans questioned whether Clinton had made
solicitations in fund-raising by changing his positions on some
major issues when he invited bankers to coffees in the White
House. Such a practice violates the U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters, "I can tell you categorically no
decisions came out of the those coffees where I or anyone said,
`this person is contributor: see what you can do.'"
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he had never made a decision for anybody
because they were contributors of Democrats or his. He denied that
he had sold access to the White House for 250,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton reiterated that the campaign finance system
should be reformed.
</P>
<P>
"We all know we need a new way to finance our campaigns,"
Clinton said, adding, "Anyone who is involved in politics must
accept responsibility for this problem and take responsibility to
repair it."

<HEADLINE> Cardiff Set to Host EU Summit in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major announced here today that Cardiff, the capital of Wales,
would host the European Union (EU) summit in 1998 when Britain
holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a written answer to a parliamentary question, Major said
that "the European Council (conference) will be held in Cardiff"
at the end of Britain's six-month EU presidency in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Major stressed that he believed that the venues of EU summits
should be moved around and London should not automatically be
chosen.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's entirely right to have one in Cardiff as well,"
Major was quoted by BBC television as saying this evening.
</P>
<P>
Around 5,000 government leaders of the 15-nation bloc and
journalists are expected to converge on the Welsh capital,
bringing an expected 15 million pounds (about 25 million U.S.
dollars) into the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders are due to decide at the summit which countries
have qualified to join the single European currency by their
economic performances in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. to Focus on Syria-Israel Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Tuesday that his meeting with Middle East leaders in the
upcoming months in Washington will focus on the question of peace
between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told his first news conference after his inaugural that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinians chairman
Yasser Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak will come to Washington in the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
"A major focus of our discussion" will be that peace issue,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"there will never be a comprehensive peace in the Middle East
until we resolve this matter with Syria -- between Syrian and
Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised the United States will try its best to bridge
the gap between Syria and Israel when they sit on negotiating
table to settle their disputes.
</P>
<P>
"What our experience has been...that when both parties want to
make peace -- no matter how far apart they seem -- we find a way
to get there," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton warned: "If they're not sure it's time to make
peace, no matter how close it seems to an outsider, we don't seem
to be able to bridge the gap."
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that any negotiations with Israel will not
be possible unless the Israeli Likud government accepts the
land-for-peace formula. But Netanyahu dismissed it as precondition
for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is focused on Golan Heights, part of territory,
snatched by Israel during the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes US, Europe Share NATO South Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- France has proposed that the
Naples-based South Command of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) be shared between Europe and the United
States, through a dividing of the command into two.
</P>
<P>
France suggested that the South Command be carved into a
regional command, which will be headed by a European officer, and
a "functional command," which will remain under the control of
the Americans and command all NATO air and navy forces in the
Mediterranean, including the U.S. Sixth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was delivered to the United States by the
diplomatic advisor of French President Jacques Chirac, Jean-David
Levitte, who traveled to Washington last Friday, local media
quoted "coordinated sources" in Paris and Brussels as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told visiting NATO secretary general Javier Solana today
that France is ready to join a renewed trans-Atlantic alliance,
which must comprise "a clearly identified European pillar," and
has "a more balanced sharing of responsibilities between
Europeans and Americans."
</P>
<P>
Solana expressed his confidence that NATO will find a solution
to the dispute between France and the United States over its south
command.
</P>
<P>
The United States Defense Department and State Department today
commented differently on the French proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that Washington has not changed its position
of maintaining its entire control of the south command, which is
vital to U.S. interests. But the State Department said that the
U.S. government will continue to discuss with Paris over the
problem.
</P>
<P>
France has threatened to stop its process of returning to the
NATO integrated commanding structure -- from which President
Charles de Gaulle withdrew in 1966 -- if the military alliance
does not take on a clearer European identity.
</P>
<P>
The two countries could reach a deal before the meeting of NATO
chiefs of staff to be held in mid-April in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
A NATO summit will be held in Madrid in July to decide the
layouts of the reform of the alliance and the policy of its
eastward expansion.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Help Sudan Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government
today appealed to African countries to help Sudan solve its
conflicts with Ethiopia and Eritrea peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters here today on the latest developments in
the eastern border areas of his country, the Sudanese Minister of
State in the Ministry of External Relations, Bishop Gabriel Roric
Jur, said that African countries can solve their conflicts by
themselves instead of waiting for external intervention.
</P>
<P>
He added that external intervention would jeopardise the steps
taken by the governments related.
</P>
<P>
''The Sudanese government believes African states can solve
their own problems,'' he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state, who arrived in the country last
Saturday, met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation, Jakaya Kikwete here Sunday and briefed
him on the developments on the Sudanese eastern border.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Jur told reporters that his government was interested
to see that the political crisis in the southern part of his
country and in the eastern border areas were solved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister of state said his country had already
communicated the development in those areas to the United Nations
Security Council, the Organization of African Unity and the
League of Arab States.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister further said steps taken by his
government and the adoption of the federal system by his
government was a clear testmony that Sudan was in favor of
peaceful solutions.
</P>
<P>
He said under the federal system Sudan had been divided into
26 states, 10 of which are in the south and the rest are in the
north. The minister said the purpose was to provide a vider base
and equal footing in political participation and equitable
distribution of the national worth.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sudanese government last April signed a political
charter with one of the rebel movement faction -- the Sudan
People's Liberation led by Rick Macar.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Jur said the political charter speaks of holding a
referendum in southern Sudan to allow the people in the south to
express their political aspiration within the united Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister of state, who left here this afternoon
to Zimbabwe on the same mission, is also scheduied to visit
Kenya. enditem

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Judge: Electoral Commission Can't Annul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade's first municipal
court supported on Tuesday the appeals of ruling Socialist Party
of Serbia and Radical Party and annulled the decision of Belgrade
Electoral Commission of January 14, the court's presiding judge
said.
</P>
<P>
Judge Dragoljub Jankovic said that in ruling on the parties'
appeals, court had found that the commission, as a body
subordinate in law to the court, had no legal authority to void
court rulings.
</P>
<P>
"The first municipal court had full legal grounds and authority
to rule on these appeals," Jankovic said in an interview to
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade Electoral Commission two weeks ago annulled 45
rulings of the first municipal court and recognized the
preliminary results of the second-round elections for municipal
assemblies. According to the results, the opposition Zajedno
coalition won 60 seats in the 110-seat city council, and the
coalition of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and the
Yugoslav Left (JUL), won 23 seats.
</P>
<P>
Four days later, the Socialist Party of Serbia and the Serbian
Radical Party appealed against the annulments by the electoral
commission.
</P>
<P>
Jankovic said the commission argued that the relevant rulings
were administrative documents and as an administrative body the
commission had the right to annul these rulings.
</P>
<P>
"Even if this was so, and even if the rulings were
administrative documents, which they were not, an electoral
commission would still not have the authority to void them,"
Jankovic explained.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear that a lower body cannot under any procedure
and in any case annul documents adopted by a higher body. This
point is beyond dispute."

<HEADLINE> US CBO Looks A Smaller Budget Deficits Through 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) said today that federal deficits through 2002
would be smaller than they expected last year.
</P>
<P>
The latest projection would narrow the positions between the
U.S. government and the Congress as they commence their
balanced-budget efforts this year.
</P>
<P>
The CBO said in a report to the Congress that there will be 154
billion dollars of budget deficits in 2002 and both sides have to
agree the savings to reach the balanced budget in that year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is about one-third less than a shortfall of 210
billion which the CBO expected last year. The CBO foresaw last
year a deficit that was about 100 billion dollars higher than
White House's projections.
</P>
<P>
CBO attributes its improved deficit outlook to slowed Medicare
and Medicaid spending, higher revenue collections, enactment of
legislation revamping welfare and lower than expected debt
payments by the government.
</P>
<P>
CBO's new figure move it closer to the deficit estimates which
the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has been
making, easing partisan tension in the issue of balancing the U.S.
budget in the next six years.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is very good news in this report," said Pete
Domenici, Chairman of the Budget Committee of the U.S. Senate.
"Yet it makes clear that to balance the budget by the year 2002
much still needs to be done."

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Meets with Russian Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian deputy
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said here Tuesday his country
believes that Yugoslavia is capable of solving the political
crisis that arose following the November local election disputes.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic in Belgrade,
Ivanov, who arrived Sunday for an official visit, said the
election problems was an internal affair of Yugoslavia and Russia
rejects decisively interference by any side from abroad, as it
could further complicate the situation.
</P>
<P>
"That is why this visit should not be interpreted as mediatory,
but as the support of a friendly country to solve problems within
Yugoslav institutions and thus contribute to the internal and
external stability of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,"
official Tanjug news agency quoted Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
A political crisis erupted since November 19 when Serbian
opposition coalition Zajedno began to organize daily
demonstrations in Belgrade to protest against the annulment of the
November 17 local election results. Zajedno claims election
victory in 14 major cities and demands full recognition of its
victories. The daily demonstrations in Belgrade have kept going on
until now.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Lilic and Ivanov dealt with the current
situation in Yugoslavia and the further promotion of comprehensive
relations between the two countries, in the first place economic
cooperation, according to a Yugoslav cabinet statement issued
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
President Lilic told the Russian official that Yugoslavia held
that problems and misunderstandings can be overcome only within
state institutions, under the laws and constitution, by agreement
and political compromise.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that he considered the report drawn up by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to be
very good, and in the first place a constructive basis for
resolving current misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
An OSCE mission visited Belgrade late November and confirmed
the Zajedno victory in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Serbian President Slob}dan Milosevic also met
with Ivanov on the election disputes in Serbia and bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Ivanov stressed the importance of constant
political dialogue between Yugoslavia and Russia, two countries
whose bilateral relations and all-round cooperation are
characterized by a steady and intensive development, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides underscored the joint stand that internal affairs
and problems should be resolved within legal institutions of each
state, which rules out external interference in the internal
affairs of other countries and imposition of solutions contrary to
the principle of equality in relations between states and nations.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have urged Yugoslav authorities not to use
force to crack down the opposition's peaceful demonstrations as
they did in 1991, or otherwise economic sanctions could be imposed
against Yugoslavia, which could be a disaster for Yugoslavia's
difficult economy.

LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Two missiles were fired at an
Army patrol Tuesday evening at around 1840 GMT in nationalist west
Belfast, Northern Ireland, according to a police spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) said that two mortar
devices were fired at the Army Land Rovers in the Springfield Road
area of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
However, they appeared to have missed the military vehicles and
hit a building.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that although there were no reports of
serious injuries, two women were treated in hospital for severe
shock.
</P>
<P>
No one has so far claimed responsibility for the attack.
However, security sources said that the devices used in the
attack, two propelled recoilless improvised grenades (PRID), are a
common weapon in the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) armory of
home-made missiles.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened at a time of heightened tensions in
Northern Ireland following a series of hostilities recently by the
IRA and its pro-British Loyalist foes' revenge attacks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expects to Meet Yeltsin in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Tuesday that he is looking for a summit with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in March to discuss the NATO-Russia
relationship.
</P>
<P>
In his first news conference of the second term, Clinton said:
"I expect to have that meeting in March, and I expect it to be an
important one, and I hope a successful one."
</P>
<P>
"We have a huge, full agenda. And we have been given no
impression by the Russians that we aren't still going to have the
Yeltsin-Clinton meeting in the March time frame," the president
told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO has decided its enlargement into some Eastern
European nations, which once had been members of the Warsaw Pact.
And Russia has expressed its strong opposition to the enlargement,
describing it as a threat.
</P>
<P>
The United States, while determined for the NATO enlargement,
has been trying to alleviate Russia's concerns over the move.
</P>
<P>
The White House has suggested that the U.S-Russia summit could
be delayed because of Yeltsin's health.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said he had no private information on Yeltsin's
health that was different from Russia's public statements. "I have
no reasons to believe, based on any information I have, that his
condition is any different from what the Russian government has
said it is," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Privatize Air Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is planning to privatize airlines, airports and
aviation safety organizations in a bid to make the industry
more dynamic and competitive.
</P>
<P>
Ketso Gordhan, a Transport Ministry senior official, said at
the opening of a British Airways world cargo facility at
Johannesburg International Airport today that the South African
government will seek partners for local airlines' run.
</P>
<P>
The privatization aims to help local industry get management
skills and advance technology, Gordhan said.
</P>
<P>
The Sun Air will be privatized within six months, while South
African Airways is trying to find a partner before the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an aviation safety agency, independent of the
Ministry of Transport and without government subsidies, would
also be created to oversee air safety.
</P>
<P>
British Airways spokesman Richard Poulton said at the opening
ceremony the seven-million-Rand (about 1.52 million U.S. Dollars)
facility was the first of its kind in South Africa since the
company came to the country 65 years ago. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU Encourages TV Programs to Spread EU Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
encouraged Europe's television producers to stage debates and
produce documentaries about the EU's plans to fight an ignorance
which it feels fuels Euroscepticism.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with some 60 public and private television
producers, the EU's executive body made an offer of about 24
million U.S. dollars to finance programs seeking a better
understanding of the EU's single currency and integration plans.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the EU commissioner in charge of
single currency, said last week in Portugal that the EU must do a
better job to explain to its citizens why they would benefit from
the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem today is the lack of information available to
European citizens," said de Silguy, adding that around 80 to 90
percent of Europeans consider themselves badly informed about the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted polls result as saying that the British have
turned sharply against the EU while the vast majority of Germans
want a referendum on a single currency.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been organizing the campaign to dispel
criticism from the European Parliament saying that the commission
has not carried out campaigns on the EU's single market and the
EU's intergovernmental conference well enough.
</P>
<P>
Among the broadcasters who attended the meeting were the BBC,
the French television channels France 2 and FR3, Germany's ARD and
Belgium's RTBF and BRT.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Urged to Contribute More to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The group of 77 and China
today urged developed countries to make more contributions to the
United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) in order to implement
its programs.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued here at the on-going 19th session
of the UNEP Governing Council, the group said they cannot support
the call for revising the program of work by deleting many of the
projects which they are concerned about.
</P>
<P>
Clarkson Umelo, Nigerian Ambassador and permanent
representative to UNEP, told the session which takes place every
two years that "what is lacking is the will by the rich countries
to help the developing nations manage their environment."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Xia Kunbao, deputy leader of the Chinese
delegation, said he supports the view held by the group of 77 and
China.
</P>
<P>
He said developed states should take more responsibility,
especially on providing financial and technical assistance to
developing countries to help them implement programs on
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The program areas which the developing countries are concerned
about should not be deleted in the revision of the Program of
Work 1996-97, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official added that they should be taken as the
priority areas when formulating the Program of Work 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
These include the protection of seas, fresh water, air,
biodiversity, environmental education and publicity,
environmental legislation and enforcement, sustainable production
and consumption patterns.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. delegation today called for reform and
budget cuts in the U.N. environment agency, saying that "we find
this agency with a set of problems, it is in a state of crisis."
</P>
<P>
William Dilday, leader of the U.S. delegation, rejected the
demand put forth by the developing countries, saying, "throwing
more money at UNEP's problems is not an answer to the problems."
</P>
<P>
Some West countries led by the United States want UNEP's
governing structure, its programs and administration to be
reformed comprehensively and called for steep cuts in the UNEP
budget.
</P>
<P>
UNEP has seen its budget drop sharply over the last few years
as some west countries link more contribution to reforms in the
agency.
