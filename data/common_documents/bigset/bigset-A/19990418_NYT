DRAFT DAY LIVES UP TO EXPECTATIONS FOR CLAIBORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ US cornerback Daylon McCutcheon had to wait about
six hours longer than teammate Chris Claiborne to hear he had been
drafted Saturday, but he was just as happy, after being selected as
the first pick in the third round by the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the longest days of my life,'' McCutcheon said.
``It was long but it was exciting. I'm really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon spent the day watching the draft in Pasadena, and
wasn't sure when he would be selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were interested, but I didn't know they were more
interested than any other team,'' he said. ``It's a lot of pressure
off my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Claiborne had a much less stressful day, hosting
about 30 friends and family at a swank West Los Angeles hotel.
Despite a couple of early trades that shook up the draft, Claiborne
was selected by the Detroit Lions with the ninth pick overall,
which was exactly where he had expected to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been calling lately. They tied me up all morning,''
Claiborne said. ``The good thing about Detroit is I can be on a
good team and be in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Claiborne was slated in some early mock drafts to go as
high as fourth, he wasn't complaining about going to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed the process because I'm able to fulfill my
dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne was also happy the Lions run a 4-3 defense similar to
USC's. He thinks he can start at middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger adjustment might be the cold weather he'll experience
for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always adjust. It doesn't matter,'' Claiborne said. ``It's
something new. It's something different.''
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible for even his closest friends to detect any
nerves from Claiborne on draft day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real calm, considering what he was up against. It
wasn't like he was nervous,'' said former USC cornerback Brian
Kelly, who plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and who attended the
draft party.
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance was UCLA point guard Baron Davis, looking as
though he were taking mental notes for his own future party, should
he decide to enter the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon's situation could be interesting. He is going to an
expansion team that will have plenty of veterans, but could start
rookie Tim Couch, the No.1 pick in the draft, at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Browns) have a great tradition,'' McCutcheon said. ``It
gives me a chance to go in there and prove we belong in the league.
Now it's up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon leaves Thursday for Cleveland's first mini-camp. As
for Claiborne, he has one more piece of business. He's having a
post-draft party Monday night at the Key Club in West Hollywood.

MEDICAL BOARD REFORM STILL A BIT WOBBLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID PARRISH  
 and JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly a year into the latest effort to reform the state agency
that polices doctors, officials at the Board of Medical Examiners
acknowledge that, on the surface at least, their performance to
date looks shaky.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's backlog of cases is at nearly 1,000 _ and growing.
Reports alleging physician misconduct are taking longer to resolve.
Some cases have been so poorly handled they must be reinvestigated.
</P>
<P>
   But to Claudia Foutz, executive director of the medical board,
those apparently negative indicators are actually evidence of a
turnaround for the troubled agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking charge of the medical board last May, Foutz said
she has struggled against a bureaucracy that favored quickness over
quality and found it easier to review medical charts than listen to
patients' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to build this organization from the ground up,'' she
said. ``Now we have the infrastructure in place _ the quality is in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the agency has come under a steady stream
of criticism from legislators, good-government groups, patients and
even some doctors _ all charging that the Board of Medical
Examiners, or BOMEX, has not effectively policed errant physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Burke, executive director of Arizona Common Cause, said
that because of the state's high number of retirees _ who often
require more medical care _ and an aging baby-boomer population now
creeping into its senior years, it's important to have a competent
medical board.
</P>
<P>
   ``BOMEX is increasingly not there when people need it,'' Burke
said.
</P>
<P>
   To change such attitudes, Foutz said, she has imposed more
thorough and professional investigative standards. Three
experienced investigators were hired this month _ bringing the
total to seven _ all in an effort to improve the handling of
complaints made against Arizona's 14,500 licensed allopathic
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say, check back with us in a year to see what we have
accomplished,'' Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the problems at BOMEX to be remedied has been a
decadelong vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Three successive state auditor general reports have accused the
medical board of what amounted to regulatory malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent report _ released last September _ auditors
revealed that out of 117 cases reviewed, only four patients had
been interviewed. Complaints were not fully investigated, and the
board often issued toothless ``letters of concern'' to physicians
when stiffer disciplinary actions were warranted, the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 report, auditors did note some small
improvements from past reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog of unresolved complaints _ 862 _ was high, but that
was a 40 percent drop from four years earlier. Also, the time it
took the medical board to resolve a complaint was down to an
average of 200 days _ still above the agency's stated goal of 180
days.
</P>
<P>
   Foutz said rebuilding the medical board has slowed the agency
down in the short term and has even reversed the modest
improvements cited in the 1998 audit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the audit, the backlog of complaints has climbed by 14
percent, to 984. Medical board staff members conceded the average
time to resolve cases is no longer 200 days cited in the September
audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll guarantee you, we'll be above it,'' said Eric Nickell,
the board's compliance manager.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the Legislature watching Foutz and her impact said it
may take longer than a year to turn around an agency as
dysfunctional as the medical board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy to hear about a backlog of a thousand cases, but
I recognize things were in bad shape when she took over,'' said
Rep. Herschella Horton, D-Tucson, the ranking Democrat on the House
Health Committee. ``Two years is not too long to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Susan Gerard, chairman of the Health Committee, also
expressed concern about BOMEX's increasing backlog and length of
time to resolve complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had basically a non-functioning system, so you have to
give them some time,'' said Gerard, R-north-central Phoenix. ``I
would definitely say in a year, if there is not significant
improvement in the backlog of cases and getting the case time under
200 days, then something would have to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the resurgence in the backlog has been the
attention now being paid to the quality of the investigations,
Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 completed investigations recently had to be reopened
for a more thorough review just before they were to be decided upon
by the agency's 12-member board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have determined that under past leadership the way in which
cases were investigated, the way in which people were interviewed,
the choices of who to interview and who not to interview, are not
the standards that we apply today,'' Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 1,000 backlog cases _ all in various stages of review
_ also will have to be examined individually under the new
standards, said Thomas Adams, who was hired in January to head
BOMEX's enforcement operation after retiring from the Washington
State Police, where he oversaw the investigation division.
</P>
<P>
   The new investigative standards require _ among other things _
that all patients who make complaints be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we were very good at doing record reviews, but we
were not very good at doing interpersonal contact and
information-gathering,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   After re-examining one complaint, they found that the wrong
doctor had been investigated in the case of a misdiagnosis of a
patient's cancer. Past investigations had zeroed in on the doctor
who referred the patient, even though it was the radiologist who
said there were no signs of cancer. A second radiologist did
discover the cancer, but it was too late for effective treatment,
and the patient died, Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, after the new investigators are at full speed,
the backlog of cases should be whittled down, Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   But given the cumbersome legal structure and lean staffing
levels, she said, BOMEX won't be resolving complaints significantly
more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the vary nature of the regulatory design here in Arizona,
you have a built-in six-month delay,'' Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   And the board's goal of resolving the average case in 180 days?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 180 days is unrealistic, given the statutory
framework,'' Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   That legal structure would be changed under House Bill 2487
before the Legislature, allowing the BOMEX executive director to
dismiss cases deemed meritless without sending them to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Because the board meets only six times a year, it often takes
four to six months to resolve even the simplest cases, Foutz said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which Gerard said seem likely to pass, also would give
the executive director the power in particularly serious instances
to send the case to an administrative hearing for a license
suspension or revocation &UR; _ without first having to get approval
from the agency's board.
</P>
<P>
   Burke of Common Cause said that ultimately the agency may be too
small to deal with a booming state population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restructuring _ that's like rearranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic,'' Burke said. ``The real central issue is expanding their
personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Foutz said that after restructuring issues are dealt with during
the current legislative session, she plans to approach the
Legislature next year to ask for more staff, something previous
executive directors have shied away from doing.
</P>
<P>
   Those monitoring the medical board's progress, like Horton, seem
willing to give Foutz some more time to make the necessary changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I have confidence in her,'' Horton said. ``I'm not
ready to throw her out.'' &QL;

NO U.S. GROUND TROOPS, CANDIDATE FORBES SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Steve Forbes joined the growing debate among GOP
presidential hopefuls on the critical question of what to do in
Kosovo, saying American ground troops should not be used in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said Friday the United States should arm and train
Kosovar gue rillas to fight the ground war and continue the aerial
bombing cam paign. The ultimate goal of the war, he said, should be
the removal of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo sevic and the
installation of a democratic government in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' comments came during a campaign stop in Arizona, a state
whose Republican primary he won in 1996. This time, however, he
faces an uphill battle, largely be cause Arizona Sen. John McCain
is in the GOP primary race. McCain has also become the most
forceful advocate of using American ground troops to end the war, a
move Forbes sees as foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should send in American ground forces,''
Forbes said. ``With proper leadership, we don't have to. You have
the Koso vars.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes comments came the same day that another presidential con
tender, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said that any intervention in the
Balkans _ by air or ground _ was not in the national interest.
Kasich made the comments in an op-ed piece in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes argues that it would take four or five months to deploy
American soldiers, which would be enough time to train and equip
the Kosovar resistance. He ripped Presi dent Clinton for his
``drift and bad judgment'' in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those that are skeptics, look what the Afghans did to the
Soviet Union on their own terrain when they were armed. That way,
the aggressors know they can't wear out a NATO peacekeeping
force,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was less specific when asked how military leaders would
ensure arming the ``right'' people and not extremist groups who
could end up further destabilizing the region. Many of the weapons
that the United States supplied to Af ghan rebels ended up in the
hands of terrorists throughout the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said the CIA and other intelligence agencies need to
deter mine whom to arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You support those who are the real leaders. You have tens of
thousands people now willing to fight. They know what the stakes
are,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experts tell us it's going to take four or five months to
put in ground troops, anyway. So instead of putting in Americans,
why not use the four months to train the people who know the
ground, have the motivation to fight. . . . They'll do the ground
fighting, and we'll fight them from the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate downplayed con cerns that arming the resistance
would inflame tensions in the re gion, including in Russia, which
opposes the NATO action. Russia, Belarus and Serbia have talked in
recent days of forming a Slavic alliance to fight the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also oppose arming the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said the actions need to be part of a diplomatic effort
to make it clear that all of Europe opposes the genocide of a
``murderous nationalist'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a very positive impact on Russia and give
heart to the democratic reformers there,'' Forbes said. He said
Russian nation alists would soon get the message that the rest of
the world would ``pass them by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And while the kleptomaniacs in the Kremlin and the old-line
com munists in the Duma can beat their chests about their brother
Slavs, remember _ Serbia is not even bordering Russia . . . and if
they want to beat their chests because they did it 50 years and 80
years ago over Serbia, then fine. But I think most Russians have
more pressing matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes chided other Republican candidates who were slow to take
a position on the war in Kosovo, including Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Bush was being too reluctant to discuss
issues by avoiding the questions until after the Texas Legislature
adjourns, Forbes responded, ``The fact that you're asking the
question is the answer,'' Forbes said. ``Look at our Web site. Call
him up and say, `Where's yours, Governor?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush led the GOP field in Arizona in a recent poll, beating
McCain by a margin of 9 points. Forbes was well back in the pack,
but he vows to hotly contest the state.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also returned to his theme of tax cuts and tax reform
during his stop in Phoenix, pointing to his 1996 call for the flat
tax as evidence his campaign is setting the agenda this year.
Nearly every GOP candi date now has a plan for tax reform, Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing magnate is about to launch a major media campaign
next month in several early primary states, including Arizona, Iowa
and New Hampshire. Many Republicans criticized Forbes in 1996 for
spend ing millions in attack ads against the eventual GOP nominee,
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said the ads are in produc tion. But he emphasized that,
while they would not be negative, the spots would spell out his
positions on issues and where other candi dates stand. &QL;

TRADE FOR CHECO GIVES DODGERS SOME INSURANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Los Angeles Dodgers had their eye on
right-handed reliever Robinson Checo before trade talk surfaced
with the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tried to sign Checo as a free agent during the
offseason, but Checo chose to sign with the Tigers because he liked
his chances to make their club.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's trade that sent pitchers Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas
to the Tigers, the Dodgers now have Checo, as well as minor-league
pitchers Apostol Garcia and Richard Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy for my friends (in Detroit), but I'm happy that
I have a new club and a new chance,'' Checo said before Saturday's
game against San Diego. ``My agent talked with the Dodgers during
(the winter) but it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Checo, signed originally by the Boston Red Sox after playing in
Japan, will be used in middle relief. The Dodgers like the
27-year-old's ``live arm.'' Checo's fastball has been clocked in
the mid-90s. He also throws a slider, change-up and split-finger
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone said Checo worked out for the
Dodgers in the Dominican Republic during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's versatile enough to be an emergency starter or
reliever because he has a powerful arm,'' Malone said. ``(Mlicki)
wasn't going to get the innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Checo is 1-3 with a 5.57 ERA in seven major-league appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled: Kevin Brown has been on the disabled list four times,
but not since May 1996. Darren Dreifort was on the disabled list
twice, but not since June 1997; Carlos Perez's only stint lasted
the 1996 season when he had left shoulder surgery and Ismael Valdes
was on it twice, the most recent being in September.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park hasn't been on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Last Sunday's rainout with Colorado was
rescheduled as part of a day-night doubleheader July 22. A 7:10
p.m. start will be added to the already scheduled 1:10 p.m.
game.... One-time free-swinging right fielder Raul Mondesi drew a
first inning walk, the 10th straight game he's reached base on
balls. It was his 12th walk of the season. He has 12 walks. A year
ago he didn't collect his 11th walk until June 7, the Dodgers' 67th
game.... In the bottom of the first inning LoDuca threw out Quilvio
Veras trying to steal second. It was the first time in 14 attempts
an opponent was thrown out.... The Dodgers' Jacob Brumfield started
in center for Devon White, who was 1 for 19 on the road trip.

A DAUGHTER FACES HER FEAR FOR MOTHER'S SAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ I wasn't sure I really wanted to run in the
Race for the Cure yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   I ran because I am afraid of what will happen if I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is strange like that, at once both motivating and
paralyzing a person.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no fear as motivational or as paralyzing as the
fear seen reflected in your mother's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I know.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, it stared at me.
</P>
<P>
   The fear was of the body that had betrayed her. The fear was of
the cancer that ate away at her. The fear was of the chemotherapy
that they said would cure her.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the fear was of dying, of becoming a statistic, of
becoming one of the thousands that cancer kills every year.
</P>
<P>
   She fought the fear every day.
</P>
<P>
   The fear became motivational for her. The woman who literally
wore out the phrase ``It's nothing I can't handle'' transformed
herself into a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was mostly subversive, as simple as a smile in the
waiting rooms she prepared to enter for chemotherapy, and yet as
hopeful as believing a cure was just a little activism away from
becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to find a cure,'' she'd say in a way that made
you really believe it was true.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come in time for her, though.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Francis Paoletti Floyd died on June 8, 1997, after a
four-year battle with cancer. She was 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Her fears then became mine.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest fear is that one day it will be me.
</P>
<P>
   So, I ran yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   I ran through downtown Fort Worth with 12,000-plus other women.
It wasn't until I started running, though, that the enormity of the
disease hit me.
</P>
<P>
   I was surrounded by daughters and wives and sisters and mothers,
people just like me, people who were affected by cancer. The
reminders came in the pink signs pinned to their backs. There are
two kinds _ ``In memory of ... '' and ``In celebration of ... .''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to remember those already gone and to celebrate
those still fighting.
</P>
<P>
   There were 22 names on the ``Star-Telegram'' sign I wore on my
back. Eleven are survivors. Eleven already had died. My mother was
just one of them.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself reading the names on other people's backs as I
passed by them. I wondered what their lives were like? How long had
they been sick? What was the doctor's prognosis? Did they still
have hope? Did their families?
</P>
<P>
   But they were, still, just names.
</P>
<P>
   So, I kept running yesterday, thinking it would be just like my
daily runs.
</P>
<P>
   And it was.
</P>
<P>
   Then at around the first-mile marker of the race, I passed a
woman in a pink T-shirt. Everybody gets a white T-shirt for
running. The pink T-shirts are special, reserved for survivors,
women who had or have the disease and are still fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   The sign on her back didn't have a name. It simply said: ``Seven
years cancer free.''
</P>
<P>
   I read that, and I wasn't quite as afraid.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of women out there still fighting, fighting the
disease, fighting the fear, fighting for themselves and fighting
for women like me.
</P>
<P>
   If my mom were still alive, I knew she'd be running. too.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, I ran because I was afraid of what will happen if I
don't.
</P>
<P>
   I also ran because I could.

RANGERS LOSING PATIENCE WITH WINLESS CLARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Doug Melvin's genius has given the Rangers
John Wetteland, Rick Helling and, at crunch time last year, Todd
Stottlemyre, a resume any general manager would be proud to own.
</P>
<P>
   If only he could hide Mark Clark under a rock somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin spent $9 million of Tom Hicks' money to sign the free
agent right-hander for two years when he couldn't lure Randy
Johnson or Roger Clemens to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After his third consecutive pounding yesterday, this one at
Network Associates Coliseum, Clark is well on his way to being
Melvin's worst decision since: (a) extending John Burkett's
contract for two years or, (b) signing Kevin Gross.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say bust?
</P>
<P>
   The A's slapped Clark senseless in a four-run first inning en
route to an 11-3 victory over the Rangers. Whatever good feelings
the Rangers might have accumulated after a three-game sweep of the
Mariners have quickly dissipated in the bloody reality of two
merciless beatings here.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly disturbing because the Rangers have now
seen every team in the AL West and they know they should dominate
this division.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, without Johnson, aren't half the team they once
were. The A's, despite what we've seen in the first two games here,
are still too young to contend. The Angels have their own Care
Flight helicopter standing by.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, if they were playing anywhere near their
capabilities, could have this division wrapped up by the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they have seen their starting pitchers post a 3-6 record
with a 7.93 ERA while giving up four or more runs nine times in
their first 12 games. And the middle of their vaunted batting order
is producing more temper tantrums _ Juan Gonzalez sent a stack of
paper cups flying after struggling again in batting practice _ than
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just blame the pitching,'' second baseman Mark
McLemore pointed out. ``We still have to go out and score runs to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the three-game sweep in Seattle the atmosphere around
the team has been strangely tense and uneasy. Manager Johnny Oates,
not bothering to hide his irritation, publicly questioned starting
pitcher Aaron Sele's pitch selection after Friday night's 8-2
shelling by the A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people are a little uptight,'' McLemore admitted.
``But I'm not sure it's the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager? Maybe so. But try standing in his shoes, watching
his starting pitchers put his team in a hole almost every time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to figure out a way to play better from behind,''
Oates said reflectively. ``You can do that occasionally, but it's a
difficult thing to do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 11-3 beating, Oates was smiling and relaxed, a stark
contrast to Friday night's obvious unhappiness with Sele. There was
little reason to smile about Clark's performance, however.
</P>
<P>
   Signed because Melvin thought he would at least give the team
innings, Clark has failed to last beyond the fifth in any of his
three starts. That his earned-run average actually ``dropped'' to
10.68 yesterday after he allowed five runs in five innings tells
you all you need to know about the quality of those innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen much different in any of his three starts,''
Oates said. ``He's gone about five innings in each of them, thrown
about a hundred pitches. He's had a lot of 0-2 counts that turned
into deep counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi hit the first of his two home runs on a hanging,
batting-practice slider to give the A's a 2-0 lead in the first.
Instead of closing the door there to keep his team in the game,
Clark softened again, allowing a single to John Jaha and walking
Ben Grieve. That set up Mike Macfarlane's two-run double off the
left-field fence on a pitch Clark said he put right where he wanted
it.
</P>
<P>
   So did Macfarlane.
</P>
<P>
   If the first was critical, the sixth was almost equally so.
Rafael Palmeiro's two-run homer in the top of the inning had cut
the A's lead to 5-3 and Oates asked his bullpen to hold it there.
No dice.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the left-handed hitters they have in the lineup, it's
a perfect opportunity for our left-handers to give us a couple of
innings and let us get back in the game,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Good idea, bad execution. The A's immediately put up a 3-spot
against Mike Munoz, the rout was on and Clark very deservedly took
his second loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I gave up the four runs in the first, I thought I
threw the ball much better today than I did in my first two
starts,'' Clark said. ``On this club, if you go out and keep the
club in the game, you're going to win a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a good theory. Melvin, among others, might feel a
little better about that $9 million if he'd put it into practice.

SWEPT OUT BY A RIPTIDE OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Shortly before 9 a.m. Saturday, a firetruck loaded with portable
stadium lights, each folded in half like an enormous silver tulip,
slowly pulls away from the 54th Street exit of the Sierra Palms
apartment complex in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the high block walls lining the street are the
garages, carports and parking spaces for the complex's numbered
buildings, stacked like hotels in a Monopoly game.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow plastic police tape stretches from parking spot No. 348
past spot 360, angling over vehicles and around the trunks of newly
planted trees, keeping the curious away.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians and investigators move in and out of a downstairs
apartment, some carrying bags, which they place in nearby police
vans, others with camera equipment and light stands.
</P>
<P>
   They've been here all night, and the muted talk among them is
about packing up and getting a little breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a chance to spend some time together away from the
scene, and talk. Or not talk.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman walks along the curving sidewalk next to the
building and approaches a man with a press badge pinned to his
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   With one hand she manipulates a wooden cane. In the other she
carries a package of disposable children's diapers. Around her neck
is small necklace made of sea shells.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called me from the office yesterday afternoon,'' she
says. ``I baby-sit my grandchildren, you know, and my husband was
at the grocery store. They told me to lock up and wait. I heard a
boom and a loud commotion. I suppose that's when the officer was
killed. Do you know how old he was?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight, she is told.
</P>
<P>
   He had three children and a grandchild. His name was Jim
Snedigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pray for him,'' she says. ``I suppose that's all we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another resident of the complex, Andy Weis, cautiously
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   He'd spent most of the evening outside the complex's walls,
where officers kept residents while they searched for jewel thieves
trying to lose themselves in the maze of pink stucco and twisting
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   They found one in the apartment where Snedigar was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been here two months,'' Weis says. ``I came out here
to get away from the city. Guess it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   People visit a place like this the day after a tragedy because
they want explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Only there are none, or at least none that make sense in the
face of a second police funeral in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, something about what happened must be explained, so they
go to the spot where it happened. A few weeks ago it was an
industrial park in west Phoenix where Phoenix Officer Marc Atkinson
was fatally shot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's this apartment complex in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, this land was pristine desert. Initially, it was
carved into rectangles and transformed into farmland. It stayed
that way for years, until the fields were replanted with houses and
apartments, which sprout up in rows of pink stucco buildings with
red tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Palms has the look of a medieval city, walled and gated
and set off from the surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   There's a McDonald's restaurant at 56th Street and Ray Road. And
a Circle K across the street. And a Club Disney nearby. And Danny's
Family Carousel car wash. But there is no neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The outskirts of Phoenix are surrounded by walled enclaves like
this, each built for privacy and protection, its block walls
butting up against roads and freeways. Which lead to downtown.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the city's ocean laps against suburbia's
shoreline, its rising tide swallowing a little more peace and quiet
each day.
</P>
<P>
   More on some days than others.
</P>
<P>
   Too much on Friday, when a sudden wave of violence swept onto
the beach and dragged a good man out to sea. &QL;

OFFENSE IN SPOTLIGHT ON 1ST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - They had just settled into their seats in the
draft room Saturday morning when Indianapolis threw a haymaker
Cardinals officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts bypassed Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams and
chose the player the Cardinals expected to get _ Miami running back
Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of panicking _ trading away the eighth pick overall
_ the Cardinals stayed put and performed a rebounding exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   They took the best wide receiver available, Ohio State's David
Boston, and then watched as Eastern Michigan offensive tackle L.J.
Shelton slipped closer and closer to them with their second
first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Once Seattle, picking 20th overall, traded the selection to
Dallas, which was seeking defensive help, the Cardinals knew they
were going to get Shelton with the next pick.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, vice president-player personnel, celebrated by
waving his arms over his head like a winning prize fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it could have turned out any better,''
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals then added Florida linebacker Johnny Rutledge in
the second round and Wisconsin pass rusher Tom Burke, who led the
nation with 21 sacks, in the third.
</P>
<P>
   With seven more picks in Rounds 4-7 today, it's too early to
grade the draft. But Gary Horton, former NFL scout who is the
editor of the ``War Room'' draft publication, gives the Cardinals
high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they look like smart sons of guns,'' Horton said.
``What they did was just great. They not only know their own
(draft) board, but they have a feel for other teams' boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at both of their first-round picks and you can see
that they know the strengths and weaknesses of the draft. As much
as I like (Brigham Young offensive tackle) John Tait, had they
taken him, they wouldn't have gotten a wide receiver at Number
21.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals considered taking Tait with the eighth pick after
the Colts shocked everybody by taking James.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams then made another surprising move when they
passed on Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey, considered the top
defensive player in the draft, to take North Carolina State wide
receiver Torry Holt, a favorite of the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed in some ways earlier today because we
thought we would get a shot at one of those top guys,'' Ferguson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals listened to two offers to move down from the
eighth pick, including one from Minnesota, which picked 11th and
coveted Arizona cornerback Chris McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials debated whether to take Tait, the Tempe
McClintock High School product, or Boston until the final three
minutes they were on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know whether to take a Butterfinger or a Baby Ruth,''
Ferguson said. ``Then, I did what I always to _ I took a
Butterfinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson described the decision as ``very, very difficult,
particularly since the team is looking for a young left tackle to
replace starter Lomas Brown, who left in free agency for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we (had) a great need for an offensive lineman and
there was a great player (Tait) sitting there who wanted to be a
Cardinal,'' Ferguson said. ``But you have to be able to score to
win. If you don't have a shooting guard, you won't win basketball
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build an exciting football team. We want to have an
explosive offense. . . . The decision came down to who is going to
score touchdowns. We've added 50 pages to our playbook in getting a
player like this guy. This gives us many weapons to possibly win a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals think Boston, who averaged 120.9 yards receiving
last season, is fast enough to stretch defenses. He recently was
timed in the 40-yard dash in 4.7 seconds. He also could be their
punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my role being the domino-type (role) of Randy Moss at
Minnesota and how he complemented Jake Reed and Cris Carter,'' said
Boston, 6 feet 2, 208 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the Cardinals had Boston, a 20-year-old junior who
turned pro with a year of eligibility remaining, rated almost even
with Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very, very close,'' Tobin said. ``Holt is a guy who
has done it for one more year, his senior year. He is a little bit
more mature than David Boston, but, really, David Boston has more
measurables than Torry Holt. He's bigger and stronger and he's
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like Ricky Williams and Edgerrin James. It's a
kind of pick-'em type thing, depending on who you talk with.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley sports fans remember Boston. His game-winning catch beat
Arizona State and quarterback Jake Plummer in the Rose Bowl three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Boston recently listed Plummer, now starting quarterback as the
Cardinals, as the opposing player he most respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I never had been on the same field with somebody who
showed the amount of composure and type of leadership he showed in
(the Rose Bowl),'' Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Boston pick, Ferguson assured Cardinals fans he hadn't
forgotten about the offensive line. ``We will find an offensive
tackle,'' he said. ``I'll stake my job on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who had rated Shelton second at offensive tackle
on their draft board, thought they might have a chance to get him
after the Oakland Raiders chose Georgia offensive tackle Matt
Stinchcomb at No. 18 and the New York Giants took Notre Dame
offensive tackle Luke Petitgout with the next selection.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 30 minutes, the Cardinals received six calls to
trade the 21st pick _ four to move down and two to move up.
</P>
<P>
   They again stayed put and took Shelton, 6-5, 322 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you guys can't accuse me of being a defensive coach after
drafting two offensive guys in the first round,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals used their top two selections on offensive players
for the first time since 1993. They hadn't taken a wide receiver
first since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting (Shelton) was a really big hit, and I think we got a
hell of a player,'' Ferguson said.

TACKLE ATE WAY OUT OF 1ST LOVE - BASKETBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ - L.J. Shelton, newest contender to become guardian
of Jake Plummer's backside, didn't make it to professional sports
with his long shot but as a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Until his senior year in high school, Shelton, who was chosen
21st overall by the Cardinals in the NFL draft on Saturday, fancied
himself as a shooting guard. He was adept at jacking up
three-pointers and dreamed of a career in the NBA, just like his
dad, Lonnie Shelton, a 10-year power forward who was on the Seattle
SuperSonics 1979-80 world championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Although an all-area prep pick in basketball-rich Michigan his
senior year, Shelton had grown to 250 pounds on a 6-foot-5 frame.
He loomed rather large in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more football scholarships available than basketball
scholarships,'' Shelton said. ``There comes a time when you have to
make a decision about the way you want to go with your life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just looking for a free ride to college. He never
imagined he would develop into a first-round NFL draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are excited that he yielded to ``natural
selection,'' as Shelton describes it, and traded in the sneakers
for shoulders pads at Eastern Michigan. He developed quickly as an
offensive left tackle and became something of a natural selection
for the Cardinals on Saturday. They have a need after seven-time
Pro Bowler Lomas Brown bolted to Cleveland via free agency and had
Shelton rated higher than two left tackles who were chosen just
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have two other prospects at Shelton's position but
neither, to borrow a phrase from Shelton's past sports life, is a
slam dunk. Anthony Clement, the largest player ever drafted by the
Cardinals (6-7, 355), was selected in the second round last year to
be groomed as Brown's successor. Then Clement, who didn't miss a
snap in college, suffered a herniated disk that required surgery.
He missed all of 1998. It remains to be seen how effectively he
will come back. He has not yet been cleared for the minicamp that
opens April 29, offensive line coach George Warhop said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand is Matt Joyce, who continues to improve but who
never has played regularly at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton will have an opportunity to leap to the front of the
line when training camp opens July 30 in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they have a promising guy at quarterback in Jake
Plummer, so I'm honored that they trust me to protect his blind
side,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   After the reality sank in that he wasn't going to be the next
Reggie Miller, Shelton began knocking the stuffing out of defensive
ends around the Mid-American Conference. In 33 successive starts he
made 25 touchdown blocks, 69 downfield blocks and averaged an 85
percent blocking efficiency per season.
</P>
<P>
   Further, as the protector of quarterback Charlie Batch's
backside, Shelton was on the field for 2,312 snaps and gave up only
eight sacks in a passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said that five-years of weightlifting and indiscriminate
training-table dining allowed him to bulk to 322 pounds from 250 _
``a natural selection thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My body just grew,'' he said. ``When I weighed 250 I knew I
had the frame to hold more weight. I've kept my mobility and
agility.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to rough up the best of the MAC, but NFL scouts
weren't convinced he was big-time until they observed him in a week
of practice at the Senior Bowl, where Shelton made the best
defensive prospects look like just another MAC pass rusher. His
draft projection skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   He was regarded as the second-best left tackle in the draft to
Tempe native John Tait, who was chosen 14th overall by Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But tackles Matt Stinchcomb of Georgia and Luke Petitgout of
Notre Dame were chosen 18th and 19th by Oakland and the New York
Giants, respectively just before the Cardinals grabbed Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to keep calm,'' Shelton said. ``I knew I had a rating
above those guys. It was just God doing his work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals thought so, too. Warhop breathed more easily when
Tampa Bay did not choose an offensive lineman at No. 15, and then
Seattle didn't at No. 20. That coupled with the Raiders' and
Giants' somewhat surprising picks set up the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of what you like,'' Warhop said. ``There
were a bunch of tackles who were so close together in rating. As I
was watching it unfold, I said, `Please, God, let one of them be
there at 21.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, Cardinals vice president for player personnel,
gushed about Shelton's size, footwork and athleticism. The caveat
is that Shelton played only three games of football in high school
and 33 in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't played football that much but he's smart, he's
tough, he's got a nasty streak _ things we like that are going to
help him become a good pro,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the mean streak comes from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a mean player, and I like to emulate the way he
approached the game, which was with a lot of intensity,'' Shelton
said. ``I like to model myself after him in that way. But at the
same time, he had to watch out for technicals. I can just let it
go.'' &QL;

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - On Friday night, Bob Ferguson didn't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He strolled around a lake near his home in Gilbert, smoking a
cigar. He listened to the words of his wife, imploring him to come
to bed. And even when he relented, rest was fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to his job than you ever want to know.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Cardinals strung together another wonderful
draft. An exercise in risk and recovery. Made possible by another
stroke of fortune, an organization continuing its long waltz with
Lady Luck.
</P>
<P>
   But if you ever wanted to see the dynamics of a unique family
facing a daunting and daring future, this was the day.
</P>
<P>
   All afternoon, they disappeared and reappeared. Ferguson with
deep bags under his eyes. Mr. Beige dressed in black. Bill Jr.
crewcut replaced with rebellious long hair. Michael in jeans and an
ever-present beeper. And, of course, the old man, the picture of
calm. All wearing stickers saying ``YES! to Rio Salado''.
</P>
<P>
   A five-headed monster reaching consensus on four picks arising
from three intertwined futures. And it was the tenuous start that
opened the windows to an organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the phones and rolling the dice, they selected a wide
receiver _ Ohio State's David Boston _ with the No. 8 pick. They
had passed on Chris Claiborne, a linebacker who would've closed the
book on Jamir Miller. And they passed on John Tait, an offensive
lineman whom Ferguson loved, one who could be a genuine superstar
at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very player sitting there that wants to be a Cardinal as
much as I do in the future,'' Ferguson said at the time. ``It will
be debatable in the next few weeks, by the way . . .''
</P>
<P>
   As Ferguson explained the pick, he immediately pointed to a pair
of drawings decorating the room. Colorful renditions of the Rio
Salado Project propped up on easels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have this,'' Ferguson said. ``These aren't just
pictures of something we want. To look at and wish will come true
one day. All of this is designed.''
</P>
<P>
   David Boston, pizzazz pick. Designed to stoke the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Three different futures: The new stadium. The football team. And
that of Ferguson, whose contract expires next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build an exciting football team here, and we're
going to have an explosive offense to run the engine,'' Ferguson
said. ``Now, we can line up as well as Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, before he was done:
</P>
<P>
   ``We will find an offensive tackle,'' Ferguson pledged. ``I'll
stake my job on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Cardinals got lucky. In the matter of three
hours, a thorny debate had disappeared. A bizarre abundance of
quarterbacks pushed down the talent. The Raiders and the Giants
chose a pair of tackles that inspired no one. L.J. Shelton, a
tackle rated just behind Tait by most experts, had slipped all the
way to No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals pounced, and everyone walked away happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it could've worked out much better,'' Coach
Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that more problems don't exist. They must sign Miller. Like,
yesterday. They must stay ahead of the suddenly surging Redskins,
who took advantage of Mike Ditka's infatuation with Ricky Williams.
By sending the Redskins seven draft picks, four of whom they
shipped to the Bears in order to acquire cornerback Champ Bailey,
Ditka immediately altered the future of the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Redskins are ecstatic, and they probably should be,''
Ferguson said. ``But I'd like to see David Boston vs. Champ Bailey
any day of the week. And we're going to get a chance to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside every war room _ one of the worst cliches in sport _
there is dissenting opinion, mixed agendas, battles over whom to
select. But the Cardinals are different. Theirs is an interlocking
of three futures. The combination worked on Saturday, a cooperative
effort that might be an important step in the evolution of a
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   The football team made off fine. The draft can only help Rio
Salado. But in the long run, the future of Ferguson might be the
most important issue facing the team. One that's finally turned the
corner. &QL;

DRAFT DAY A SUCCESS, BUT AREN'T THEY ALL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The Arizona Cardinals tried to trade their top
draft choice to Mesa for 5,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   When that failed, the team invested in its future by selecting a
fast young wide receiver and a left tackle as big as Eastern
Michigan, where he played.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobin, wearing a ``Rio Salado Crossing ``Yes''!'' button,
announced he was pleased with the choice of Ohio State's David
Boston. He was just as happy with L.J. Shelton, who measures
6-foot-5 and weighs 322 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, also wearing a Rio Salado button, emerged from the
draft room and thrust his arms into the air like a prize fighter
who had just scored a first-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, he said, has ``great hands'', which is a plus for a
receiver. Shelton is blessed with ``great feet'' and ``a nasty
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach and player personnel director felt good about what
they had done, so much so they made a brief appearance on stage at
the Cardinals' draft party at the Rockin' Rodeo nightclub in Tempe.
Some fans had been watching big-screen TV coverage of the NFL draft
since 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Fans cheered and toasted their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Vince nor Bob had to duck flying beer bottles, further
evidence that the Cardinals are far more popular than in years past
and a sign that their draft strategy met with public approval.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to grade the Cards' performance, although the
media is obligated. This is the age of instant coffee. Instant
pudding. Instant analysis.
</P>
<P>
   So here is mine. Even though they didn't get either player they
wanted with the No. 8 pick (Indianapolis beat them to running back
Edgerrin James; St. Louis got receiver Torry Holt) the Cardinals
deserve high marks.
</P>
<P>
   Boston can back up Frank Sanders and Rob Moore. More
importantly, the Ohio State receiver who is only 20 years old gives
the offense the flexibility of using more three wide-out sets.
Boston also returns punts, filling another need.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton was rated the second-best tackle in the draft, and he
was the best one available when the Cardinals picked again at No.
21.
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is that most Cardinals fans will endorse the
additions because they favor any personnel moves designed to
protect Jake Plummer and help him succeed.
</P>
<P>
   This was by all accounts a wonderfully successful draft. Of
course, they all are, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   Every spring, every team selects the players it wants. Every
team addresses its needs. Every team is upgraded, improved. To my
knowledge, not one NFL coach or general manager ever stood before
the public and said, haltingly, ``I . . . I don't know what to say.
We ``really'' screwed up. I'm deeply sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Cardinals, and for every NFL team, draft day is the
happiest day of the year. The Cleveland Browns started the fun by
selecting Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch. Team president Carmen
Policy said Tim is a ``solid human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Philadelphia also chose a quarterback. Eagles Coach
Andy Reid called Donovan McNabb ``a fine person.''
</P>
<P>
   On and on it went. As one team after another offered
testimonials to the high character of its top selectee, one began
to wonder how many, if any, model citizens would be left on the
board by the time Arizona's turn came.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards might be forced to draft the Best Available Athlete
without regard to his citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin knew whatever they did couldn't create the excitement the
New Orleans Saints provided. Trading up to get the fifth pick, the
Saints selected Texas running back Ricky Williams, the Heisman
Trophy winner. To get him, New Orleans happily gave Washington _
which drove a hard bargain _ all of the Saints draft picks this
year, plus their first and third next year, along with a Mardi Gras
float and 200 pounds of shrimp remoulade from Antoine's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cards patiently waited to make their first pick, Mike
Ditka appeared on ESPN. Dressed in a brightly colored sports shirt
and smugly puffing a footlong cigar, the Saints coach looked as if
he could have been vacationing in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka had said all along Williams was ``the'' player he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen for a reason,'' Iron Mike said, thankfully
stopping short of _ yet coming the closest of any NFL coach in this
draft _ suggesting it was God's will. &QL;

D-DAY NOT A GAMBLE FOR SOME  
 MCALISTER, TAIT GO IN TOP 14 PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For Chris McAlister and John Tait, D-Day offered
potential wealth and no big surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Who said the NFL Draft was a crap shoot?
</P>
<P>
   The where and when almost came up like loaded dice for
McAlister, a University of Arizona cornerback, and Tait, an
offensive tackle from Brigham Young University who played at
Tempe's McClintock High School.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister figured to go among the first 10. Sure enough, the
Baltimore Ravens picked him at No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Tait's agent, Eric Metz, figured he'd go between Nos. 10 and 15.
The Kansas City Chiefs took him at No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Two more players from the state, center Grey Ruegamer and
fullback Jeff Paulk of Arizona State, went in the third round.
Ruegamer went to Miami as the No. 72 pick overall. Paulk, also of
Tempe's Corona Del Sol High, went to Atlanta as the 92nd pick
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-5, 304-pound Ruegamer is noted for his aggressiveness and
versatility. Aggressiveness is also Paulk's trademark. At ASU, the
6-1, 250-pound back was nicknamed ``Jurassic Paulk.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the McAlister and Tait picks, there were some of the
speculative winds that regularly blow through these draft
proceedings. McAlister had talked to the St. Louis Rams, who had
the No. 6 pick, and to Arizona Cardinals, who held No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards were tempted by Tait, whom some scouts and fans still
think was their best bet to protect quarterback Jake Plummer. Tait
was still on the Cards' board three minutes before they announced
they would take Ohio State receiver David Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, both teams and players were happy. Everybody
seemed to get what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   For McAlister, that appears to be a starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any intention of stepping in and not starting,''
McAlister said. ``I plan to play my best ball and earn the job.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlister's hopes are bolstered by a philosophy held by Ravens
owner Art Modell, who told the ``Baltimore Sun'' that he expects a
first-round pick to start as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   With McAlister, the Ravens are expected to move veteran
cornerback Rod Woodson to safety, while second-year player Duane
Starks will line up at the corner opposite of the 6-foot-1,
206-pound McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens weren't scared away when news of an old charge for
petty theft during McAlister's 1995 season at Mount Sacramento
Junior College (Walnut, Calif.) resurfaced. He appeared in court
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens also took McAlister despite an evident need for
offense. Last season, they finished last in the AFC in total
offense. They took cornerback Starks in last year's draft, also
with the 10th pick.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation behind the Ravens' choice was clear. They
couldn't resist McAlister, a 1998 first team All-American who has
the size, speed and strength to be a ``so-called impact player.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlister's 18 interceptions rank third in UA history. He is
only the seventh player in college football to ever return a
kickoff, punt and interception for a touchdown in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts say he could be the next Ronnie Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: He and Tait will be among football's next
generation of wealthy men.
</P>
<P>
   Based on last year's rookie contracts, McAlister can expect a
four-year deal that is worth at least the $9.5 million landed by
Starks.
</P>
<P>
   For Tait, the ballpark expectation is the $8.56 million package
that Carolina gave to Jason Peter, last year's No. 14 pick from
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-6, 317-pound Tait was the first offensive lineman taken.
His size, agility and evident maturity _ he spent 1997-98 on a
church mission _ was very tempting for the Cardinals, who wound up
taking Eastern Michigan tackle L.J. Shelton at No. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got their tackle a little bit lower and a receiver,''
Metz said. ``It's a subjective process, and they went with who they
liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're biased, and we think Jake would be lot better
having John Tait protect his back side than the Eastern Michigan
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   All along, Kansas City showed interest in Tait, who went
shopping for a Chiefs cap after he was picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent a lot of time with him at the Senior Bowl and at
private workouts following that,'' Metz said. ``They were really
hoping for a shot at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they would do anything to get this guy. They said he
could be a 12-year starter. They were pretty clear-cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will be the real test, Tait said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years from now, if people say John Tait was the best
offensive lineman in the draft, I'd be happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tait could move into the Chiefs line opposite their first pick
last year, Victor Riley, who started as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a great fit with a great organization,'' Metz
said. &QL;

DRAFT-DAY BLITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Five teams that &QL; 
 &UR; improved the most &QL; 
 &UR; 1. Washington Redskins: Love that trade with cigar-smoking
beach-bum Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints. He might
have saved a franchise that is ownerless and has a coach (Norv
Turner) and general manager (Charley Casserley ) who could be
headed out of town. The Redskins got the player they wanted,
Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey, and much of the Saints' draft this
year and next.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Detroit Lions: They watched teams deal above them and then
stayed pat and took Southern California linebacker Chris Claiborne,
one of the top players in the draft. Then, they moved up into the
first round in a trade with Miami and were able to get massive
offensive lineman Aaron Gibson of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Chicago Bears: Sure, they got lucky. But after years of
being the bumbling Bears, who's complaining? Still, if Indianapolis
doesn't bypass Ricky Williams and Washington doesn't trade down
with New Orleans, the Bears could have had a disastrous draft. But
then they made a deal with Washington, got four of the seven picks
the Redskins obtained from New Orleans and still got the
quarterback they were desperate to have _ UCLA's Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Cardinals: Passing on Brigham Young offensive tackle John
Tait at No. 8, or at least not trading down and then taking him,
was risky. But when Eastern Michigan offensive tackle L.J. Shelton
was there at No. 21, everything fell perfectly. Earlier, they got a
speedy wide receiver (Ohio State's David Boston) to give
quarterback Jake Plummer another weapon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. St. Louis Rams: Coach Dick Vermeil is another coach who
better win, especially after they got Indianapolis running back
Marshall Faulk in a trade and North Carolina State wide receiver
Torry Holt at No. 6 overall. Nobody improved more at the skill
positions. &QL; 
 &UR; Five teams &QL; 
 &UR; that stagnated &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Philadelphia Eagles: Unless the Eagles are putting in the
veer offense, Donovan McNabb was not the choice with the second
pick overall. Eagles fans said it best, as they chanted, ``We want
Ricky (Williams),'' for an hour before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. New England Patriots: Who's going to start at running back?
The Patriots, who had two first-round picks, had to get a back with
one of them. Instead, they got a center and a middle linebacker.
Finally, with their third selection, they got LSU runner Kevin
Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Oakland Raiders: Their needs were outside linebacker,
defensive end, running back and quarterback, yet for the second
year in a row, they took an offensive tackle. Georgia's Matt
Stinchcomb will fill the Oakland-Alameda County Stadium. Or is that
the Rose Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Minnesota Vikings: Central Florida quarterback Daunte
Culpepper won't help the Vikings get the Super Bowl. He's a two- to
three-year project. Why didn't they take a cornerback with their
other first-round pick? The Vikings, usually brilliant on draft
day, outsmarted themselves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. (Tie) New York Jets: Love their first-round pick. Hope Coach
Bill Parcells was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; San Diego Chargers: Love their first-rounder, which went to the
Cardinals in last year's trade that brought Arizona Andre Wadsworth
and others. Chargers fans can't say, ``See you next year.'' Tampa
Bay has their 2000 first-round pick. &UR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Best trade &QL; 
 &UR; Washington: Getting New Orleans' first-, third-, fourth-, fifth-,
sixth- and seventh-round picks this year and Nos. 1 and 3 next
year. They will have three first-round picks next season unheard of
in the league. The Redskins then traded back up with the Bears and
got Bailey at seventh overall. &QL; 
 &UR; Worst trade &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans: See above. What was Ditka thinking? He mortgaged
the franchise for Williams. &QL; 
 &UR; Best pick &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bears were afraid they would have to take McNown with the
seventh pick overall and get ripped. They got him at No. 12 and
also a bushel of draft picks from the Redskins. &QL; 
 &UR; Worst pick &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis never should have taken Miami running back Edgerrin
James fourth overall. Trade down, if you want him that badly. The
Colts traded away Faulk and bypassed Williams. They could hear
about it for years. &QL; 
 &UR; High-dive award &QL; 
Florida linebacker Jevon Kearse, projected to be a top-10 pick,
slipped to Tennessee at No. 16. &QL; 
 &UR; Wish-I-had-laid &UR; -off-the-donuts award &QL; 
Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner, was considered the top player
in the draft before the season, yet got overweight and slipped to
No. 5. &QL;

COYOTES PULL OUT HARD FOUGHT VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - They've played here before, but considering the
circumstances, maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise that when
they blasted the cannons just prior to the pre-game introductions
at America West Arena, a few of the Dallas Stars players
instinctively ducked.
</P>
<P>
   There weren't too many places to hide once the puck dropped,
either, in a penalty-filled, emotionally charged and taxing game
Saturday that saw the Coyotes literally pound out a 2-0 victory
over the new team they love to hate the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough not being out there today,'' said Dallas Drake,
the Coyotes' gritty, do-anything right wing, who was given the day
off by Coach Jim Schoenfeld. ``In a game like that, it's pretty
hard to hold your emotions back _ even from where I was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet I wanted to be involved, especially after seeing Keith
(Tkachuk) out there fighting, but there's no reason for me to be
out there running somebody and then risk being out for the first
couple playoffs games.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in their final regular-season game before opening a
best-of-seven series at home against St. Louis on Thursday, the
Coyotes (39-31-12) let it all hang out in a four-hour marathon that
featured 31 penalties, 119 penalty minutes, two game misconducts
and six 10-minute misconducts.
</P>
<P>
   It also included a whopping 64 hits and several tense moments
when one almost got the feeling veteran referee Terry Gregson might
pull the plug and end the game early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the game was really on the brink of getting out
of control,'' said Schoenfeld, who guided the Coyotes to the
second-best finish (90 points) in their 20-year history. ``There
were some hard hits, but I don't think it was a situation where
there ever was a danger of a bench-clearing brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   That's debatable, especially after Stars goalie Eddie Belfour
inexplicably skated out near center ice during a break and daringly
slew-footed Coyotes captain Tkachuk, who had his back turned at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cross checked me,'' Belfour said, explaining why he did it.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour got nailed with a two-minute minor for tripping and a
10-minute misconduct. He later picked up another minor for
cross-checking Tkachuk twice in the back, which led Tkachuk to turn
around, swing a flurry of punches at Belfour's face mask and then
clean the clock of Dallas defenseman Darryl Sydor, who had jumped
in to protect the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I did. I'm glad I did it,'' Tkachuk said, noting
Sydor paid the punishment for Belfour's crime. ``Yeah, I saw
Belfour's face on Sydor's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reichel and role player Stephen Leach accounted for the
scoring, Reichel burying a second-period, one-timer with the
Coyotes enjoying a two-man advantage, and Leach tapping in a Juha
Ylonen feed in the third, in which the crowd let Belfour have it
with mocking chants.
</P>
<P>
   The league-leading Stars (51-18-12), whom Phoenix could meet in
the second round if both teams advance, were booed lustily
throughout the game by the spirited crowd of 15,836. The loudest
chorus came when the pre-game scratches were announced and Derian
Hatcher's name was heard.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Hatcher learned he was suspended for seven
games for his controversial hit last Wednesday that prematurely
ended Jeremy Roenick's season and left the Coyotes star center with
a shattered jaw.
</P>
<P>
   The swollen-faced Roenick watched the game from the stands and
probably wasn't surprised that the first period featured only 310
seconds of five-on-five hockey and just 396 seconds of the same in
the second. And Belfour's 14 minutes of penalties?
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't surprise me about Eddie,'' Roenick said of his
former Chicago Blackhawks teammate. ``Eddie's a rambunctious kind
of guy. He's a different bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's antics nearly overshadowed the solid play in nets from
his All-Star counterpart, Nikolai Khabibulin, who stopped all 27
shots he faced in recording his eighth shutout _ a club record _
while also improving to 32-23-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way for me to end the season and go into
playoffs,'' said Khabibulin, whose performance helped the Coyotes
snap a five-game losing streak. ``At the same time, I don't think
we should get too excited about this because they didn't play a lot
of their better players. But we did have a good team effort, and we
played pretty good defense, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock rested his four leading scorers. Joe
Nieuwendyk and the Stars' entire No. 1 line of center Mike Modano
and wingers Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen were healthy scratches.

THRIVING SUNS OWE CHAMBERS THANKS  
 1988 SIGNING PUSHED CLUB TO BIG TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   Nov. 8, 1992  &QL; 
San Diego _ Newly acquired forward Charles Barkley scored 32 points
and grabbed 16 rebounds as the San Diego Suns made their debut at
the sparkling new Southwest Airlines Center by beating the
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Clippers, 111-105. ...
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix _ City Council members discussed the growing transient
problem in Phoenix's downtown, particularly in the abandoned
warehouse district near Third Street and Jefferson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
We'll never know if that's the way it would have turned out.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little doubt that the Phoenix sports landscape
dramatically changed when the Suns signed Tom Chambers to the first
unrestricted free-agent contract in NBA history on July 5, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final piece in a dramatic overhaul of the franchise
that began in the wake of a 1987 drug scandal, when Jerry Colangelo
put together a group to purchase the Suns and hired Cotton
Fitzsimmons as player personnel director.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons engineered a trade that would bring point guard
Kevin Johnson from the Cleveland Cavaliers and a draft pick the
Suns would use to take Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo named Fitzsimmons head coach, and the club signed
Chambers, one of the league's most feared scorers, to pair with
Johnson, the lightning-quick playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   A franchise was reborn.
</P>
<P>
   The club will honor Chambers, a special assistant to Coach Danny
Ainge, at halftime today of the Suns-Seattle game at America West
Arena _ a building that might never have been erected if Chambers
hadn't arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, a 6-foot-10, 225-pound forward who could shoot with
range, score inside, run the floor like a guard and finish at the
basket as well as anyone, will join Connie Hawkins, Dick Van
Arsdale, Alvan Adams, Paul Westphal and Walter Davis on a new
``Ring of Honor'' along the south rim of the arena's upper tier.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, a senior executive vice president with the club,
has photos on his office wall of the handful of players he believes
are responsible for turning around the franchise and getting the
arena built.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers and KJ are the two most important links.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry (Colangelo) might dispute this, but if we hadn't turned
it around and had to stay in the (Veteran's Memorial) Coliseum, we
might not have the Phoenix Suns today,'' Fitzsimmons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not be having this conversation in this building.
That's just what I think with the way this (pro sports) business is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo always has denied that he was prepared to move the
Suns if the club didn't get a new arena. And the groundwork was
being laid for an arena before Chambers signed.
</P>
<P>
   But with Chambers and KJ running Fitzsimmons' beloved two-man,
screen-and-roll game on the wings, the Suns made the biggest
turnaround in NBA history at that point, improving from 28
victories in 1987-88 to 55 in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   That club started a playoff streak that is at 10 years and
counting, and it reached the Western Conference Finals before
falling to the powerful Los Angeles Lakers of Magic Johnson and
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers averaged 25.7 points a game and KJ more than 20 points
and 10 assists. That started a string of four consecutive season of
50-wins or more. The Suns were fun to watch. Their games were the
place to be seen. And it started the momentum toward a new home for
the team, which set attendance records at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers was the centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom played a big role in our ability to build the new arena
and in all of the other things that kind of dominoed from that,''
Colangelo said. ``Tom was an absolute perfect fit at the top of his
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he and KJ teamed up, it was a beautiful work of art. We
owe a great deal of gratitude to Tom. He was a pleasure to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers came to Phoenix with a reputation for being aloof and
for having a nasty temperament on the court.
</P>
<P>
   He once punched out teammate Tim Perry, and during a comeback
attempt last season he got into an altercation with the team's
strength coach, Robin Pound.
</P>
<P>
   He was criticized in 1993 when, after the Suns moved into the
new arena and reached the NBA Finals, he didn't show up for a
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers has said he regrets that day, and he has become a
quieter, more religious man since his playing days ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to when he played, he's mellowed 100 percent,''
Fitzsimmons said. ``But I wouldn't have wanted him mellow when he
was playing for me. He was fiery, confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was part of his competitiveness, and that's what
made him as successful as he was. He got mad. He got a lot of
technicals. That was fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said the team knew Chambers was temperamental when it
signed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he came with a little bit of a reputation,''
Colangelo said. ``But the fact is, from time he came to Phoenix he
felt loved and appreciated. He was a happy guy, and he performed
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers asked the Suns to hold the ceremony today so that
Westphal, now head coach of the Sonics, could be present. Westphal,
then a Suns assistant, was the first to call Chambers to tell him
the Suns wanted him on their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a plan,'' Chambers said. ``And they wanted me from
Day One more than anybody else. I really wanted to start from
scratch, and be a part of a team that was building itself back
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But few imagined how well Chambers and KJ would meld.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody envisioned that,'' Chambers said. ``I
knew KJ was going to be an All-Star. The things he could do,
breaking people down, passing, hitting the open shot, you could see
he would have a great career.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I knew I wanted to be part of that style of play, running
up and down, trying to score 120 points a night. It obviously
played to my strengths. I was always a runner.''
</P>
<P>
   If KJ envisioned it, he isn't saying. He didn't return repeated
phone calls for comment. Maybe only Fitzsimmons saw the potential
for a two-man game that would rival any that have played in the NBA
_ including John Stockton and Karl Malone of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could not possibly defend those two people,'' Suns Coach
Danny Ainge said of the Chambers-KJ pick-and-roll. ``People don't
give Tom enough credit for being one of the most gifted athletes
who has ever played in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect a guy who is that big to be able to run, and
jump and shoot and do all the things he could do. He was one of the
greatest scorers I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, who once coached ``Pistol'' Pete Maravich, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a late bloomer,'' Fitzsimmons said. ``He's tell you he
wasn't that good in high school or even college. But he became one
of the great scorers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he and KJ had spent their entire careers together, you'd
still be talking about Stockton and Malone, but you would be
talking about Chambers and Johnson, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, 1990, Chambers set the Suns' record for scoring in
a game, chalking up 60 points in a game against the Sonics at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had been forced into the eighth row of Section 208,
Chambers still would have swished it from there,'' wrote ``The
Arizona'' ``Republic's'' Mark Armijo that night.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers was around long enough to enjoy the new building he
helped build, serving as sixth man during the 1992-93 Finals
season. His career wound down after two more seasons in Utah,
another in a pro league in Israel and a couple of comeback attempts
with Charlotte and the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40, Chambers has undertaken another building project:
Phoenix rookie Pat Garrity and the club's other young players. The
once fiery, confrontational temperamental and supremely talented
forward has become the mentor and tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Chambers said. ``I always thought when I was
playing that when I was done, I was done. I didn't imagine myself
coaching. I love spending time at the ranch (in Utah) and with my
family. But I'm one of those people that needs to be doing
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been around something for 20 years, there are some
withdrawals. It's like an addiction. I couldn't be any happier with
the way this has all worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad I was part of this. A lot of things have
happened in this city involving sports. And I love the fact that
I'm mentioned, along with KJ and our teams, when people talk about
what has evolved. I take a lot of pride in that.'' &QL;

NHL OWES GREAT ONE EVERYTHING  
 GRETZKY PUT NEW FACE ON SPORT THAT HAD ONLY REGIONAL IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 Analysis 
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Wayne Gretzky is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Not about retiring, which the Great One will do today amid a
cavalcade of celebration and sorrow. He's leaving the game on his
own terms, something nobody has the right to question.
</P>
<P>
   But Gretzky's wrong when he says the NHL owes him nothing. It's
a line No. 99 has been using all season long, at every stop in
almost every NHL city, when the obligatory question was asked if
this might, indeed, be his final tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
   But he's wrong. The NHL owes Gretzky everything. ``Hockey'' owes
him everything.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he brought hockey out of the dark ages. He put a
face on a sport that didn't really have much of an image outside of
Boston, Detroit, New York and Chicago _ the four U.S. teams of the
original six.
</P>
<P>
   He made it popular enough to bring expansion to the Sun Belt,
for teams not only to survive in places like the desert and the
Florida coast, but flourish. He saved franchises in Edmonton and
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He packed arenas. He invented new ways to score goals. He set up
teammates with passes from impossible places. He gave a name to the
space behind the net. They call it the office. Gretzky's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed the game,'' Gretzky's former teammate, goalie Grant
Fuhr, said. ``What else can you say?''
</P>
<P>
   You can say thanks for the memories. The Coyotes were smart
enough to recognize that Saturday during their regular-season
finale at America West Arena. Before the pre-game introductions,
the team strung together a touching tribute of highlights in honor
of the greatest player who ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   The packed crowd watched with eyes glued to the giant television
monitors as a fitting ballad was softly piped over the speaker
system. It was Fan Appreciation Day in the Coyotes' den, but the
fans were the ones exuding most of the appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe he's actually going to hang them up,''
said Adam Keller, the former general manager of the Roadrunners,
who got Gretzky to play for his team during an exhibition game in
the Valley not long ago in a game against Gretzky's Los Angeles
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   And to think, Gretzky almost played in this town for real. Three
years ago, after leaving the St. Louis Blues and becoming an
unrestricted free agent again, Gretzky seriously entertained offers
from the Coyotes to make Phoenix his final NHL home.
</P>
<P>
   How close did it come to happening?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it a lot,'' Gretzky said earlier this season.
``It would have been interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it would have. But in the end, the Great One was easily
swayed to New York and a chance to play in the biggest U.S. market
on the biggest stage. He was reunited with close friend and former
teammate Mark Messier, and he liked his chances of winning another
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But Messier left after one season. The Rangers missed the
playoffs the next. And this season, with a tired, banged up, but
still effective Gretzky, they missed the postseason again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 27 teams that would have loved to have had Wayne
Gretzky,'' Coyotes President Shawn Hunter said Saturday. ``The fact
we were close three years ago was very exciting. He definitely
would have launched hockey in Arizona to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I think we can feel pretty good how this market has
received the NHL. In three short seasons, we've established Phoenix
as a premier NHL city.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, had Gretzky signed on with the Coyotes, and
joined forces with the likes of Keith Tkachuk, Rick Tocchet and
Jeremy Roenick, there wouldn't be a retirement party to go to today
on Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he still felt like this was the time to call it quits
and leave the game he changed, the 61 records he set, the millions
of fans he turned on to hockey, he'd still be playing beyond today
if he was playing for the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be getting ready for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Hunter said. ``I didn't think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said it would take a miracle to change his mind. The
closest that came to happening was his wife, actress Janet Jones,
and his agent, Mike Barnett, trying their hardest to get him to
reconsider and play at least one more season.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, just one more year. One more year to let the fans see you
play. One more year as an ambassador in a season when the league's
new big-time television contract kicks in. One more year because
the NHL still needs you.
</P>
<P>
   But Gretzky knew he was done. He said he gave it serious thought
around Christmastime. The days, the weeks and the months that
followed only helped cement his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the year, after a bad game, I said to my kids in the
car, `This is my last year,' '' Gretzky said. ``The next day I was
getting phone calls from the school that I was retiring. And that
was in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants it to end. But it couldn't last forever. The
records will. The memories will. The history will. The classiness
will. So should the number. Here's yet another call for the NHL to
permanently retire jersey No. 99 and hang it from every rafter in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be another player like Gretz again,'' said
Fuhr, now of the St. Louis Blues. ``He's one of a kind. Nobody
could ever do the kind of things he did and nobody probably ever
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Wayne. The NHL owes you. Hockey owes you. And just saying
thanks doesn't even begin to cover it. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - Before the Diamondbacks' first day game this season at
Bank One Ballpark on Saturday, third baseman Matt Williams jokingly
suggested the roof stay closed only when they batted to keep the
shadows from playing havoc with their vision.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Tony Womack would like to have seen it closed,
period.
</P>
<P>
   The roof stayed open halfway, enough for Womack to lose Barry
Bonds' high fly in the shadows with two out and nobody on in the
first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants scored four runs after that, pushed
across another four in the next two innings, and kept the
Diamondbacks from breaking even for the first time in franchise
history with an 8-5 victory before a paid crowd of 36,674.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks (5-7) wrap up the three-game series this
afternoon. With the sun peeking through and Womack working on
judging shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Womack's transformation from infielder to outfielder hasn't been
easy in his first week with the club since coming off the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   He misplayed a line drive in the Los Angeles Dodgers' series.
Saturday, he said he saw the ball off Bonds' bat. Second baseman
Jay Bell drifted out but couldn't find the ball. As it kept sailing
upward, neither could Womack, who raised his arms helplessly, as
the ball dropped behind him and Bonds trotted into second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's another learning experience _ the hard way,''
Womack said. ``There are no excuses. I didn't build it (BOB).''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Andy Benes blamed himself.
</P>
<P>
   A slow starter, Benes worked hard in the off-season to pick up
where he left off last season, when he closed with 27 scoreless
innings and a three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much for that,'' the right-hander said.
</P>
<P>
   After three starts, Benes is 1-2 with a 12.08 earned-run
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel sorry for myself,'' he said. ``I feel sorry for
the people who had to watch that.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes gave up six hits, eight earned runs and a pair of homers _
two-run shots by shortstop Rich Aurilia and catcher Scott Servais _
in three innings. His day was done.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter said he's not concerned with Benes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had good stuff to start the game,'' Showalter
said. ``He's going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't after Womack lost Bonds' ball.
</P>
<P>
   Benes walked Jeff Kent, grazed J.T. Snow's right forearm with a
pitch and got behind Ellis Burks, who doubled in three runs. Benes
then walked Charlie Hayes, who was booed profoundly before each
at-bat after charging and swinging at pitcher Todd Stottlemyre in
Friday's game. Again, Benes fell behind in the count, and Servais
singled in Burks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to work off of the fastball, and, to this
point, I haven't been very good with it,'' Benes said.
</P>
<P>
   Benes, the Giants killer who had a personal seven-game winning
streak against the club end, said the lost ball in the first was no
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody scored, and I had all sorts of opportunities to get out
of the inning, and that's my fault,'' Benes said. ``That's nobody's
problem but mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Vladimir Nunez, John Frascatore and Greg Swindell shut
down the Giants on three hits after the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks wasted opportunities to edge closer, leaving a
runner on second in the first inning with one out and had runners
on second and third with two out in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Womack hit a line drive that was inches foul along the
third-base line that would have scored two runs. But, a pitch
later, Womack grounded back to pitcher Kirk Rueter to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   With two down in the fifth, left fielder Bernard Gilkey was
thrown out trying to steal third base with catcher Damian Miller
and his productive history against Rueter at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernard has played long enough to know not to go there,''
Showalter said. ``That was a lapse of judgment on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   Rueter, who came in with a 14.85 ERA after two starts, wasn't
brilliant but good enough to earn his first win. He gave up eight
hits, walked three and struck out three. &QL;

ASU FOOTBALL USES SPRING BALL TO PREPARE NEW LOOK FOR TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Look out. Arizona State may just nickel and dime
you to death in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The changing face of the Pac-10 has forced league defenses to
re-evaluate their schemes. With the Sun Devils likely to face
three- and four-wideout offenses on a regular basis, finding a
multitude of quality defensive backs was a priority in spring
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league has really changed,'' defensive coordinator Phil
Snow said. ``Five years ago, everybody just tried to knock you off
the ball and play-action pass. Now there are still two or three
teams trying to run it, but for the most part, it's a one-back
league now, and we've had to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive breakdowns played a significant role in a
disappointing 5-6 finish in 1998, and the secondary took much of
the heat. While other factors played a part _ an inconsistent pass
rush and struggles at linebacker _ the Sun Devils did not get the
production it wanted from a position riddled with injuries and
depth problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added some things to the package, and in some ways we'll
look a lot different than we have,'' Snow said. ``You need to do it
anyway, because if you run something for three or four years, and
don't change much, the offenses will catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils appear to have found a quality assortment of
defensive backs with the addition of junior college players and the
development of several quality underclassmen, especially safety
Alfred Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff also used the spring to shift several players
on defense. Stephen Trejo is back at outside linebacker, Eric
Fields is playing in the middle and safeties Christon Rance and
Courtney Palmore are corners.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's work is far from done. The spring gave no real indication
that the linebacking unit will be more productive in 1999. And
despite the likely return of Tariq McDonald, and the promise showed
by Justin Taplin, the staff may be more concerned about their
inexperienced receiving corps than it's letting on.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of good news: The Sun Devils' recruiting class appears
to be in good academic shape, and all have a good shot at
qualifying. That hasn't been the case lately.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said he left spring football with a good
feeling about his team's personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I like the attitude, chemistry,'' he said. ``This team
did a really nice job of responding coming off winter workouts and
maintaining the momentum we created.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also realize as a coaching staff we've still got a long way
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a position-by-position look at ASU based on the
productivity in spring football: &QL; 
Quarterback &QL; 
The pressures Ryan Kealy felt last season did not come from
blitzes. They were internal, the result of a sophomore trying to do
too much when things around him were breaking down. The bottom line
is this: Kealy is a quality quarterback when he just goes out and
plays.
</P>
<P>
   The old Kealy _ the one that set numerous freshman records _
returned during the spring with a little more attitude. A shortage
of team leaders set the Sun Devils back in 1998, so his take-charge
approach thrilled Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   He also experienced some knee tenderness. The staff said it's
not concerned, but it's ominous enough that a capable backup needs
to be ready. Watch for that job to be won in Camp Tontozona.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Cooper, a 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman, finally got some
repetitions in the spring and showed potential. Did he appear ready
to take charge in a Pac-10 game? No.
</P>
<P>
   Junior college transfer John Leonard is expected to give Cooper
a run at Tontozona. Cooper will have the edge in familiarity with
ASU's system, but Leonard has college game experience, even if it
is at a lesser level. He passed for 2,765 yards and 31 touchdowns
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-on Griffin Goodman did enough in the spring to warrant a
look. &QL; 
Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   The only sure thing about the line in 1999 is its bookends:
tackles Marvel Smith and Victor Leyva.
</P>
<P>
   It's a solid foundation to begin with. The 6-6 Smith is so
dominating he may not stick around for another season, and Leyva
has done everything ASU has asked.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Peters, a freshman All-America, is also a lock to start,
but where? He seemed to be the sure replacement for Grey Ruegamer
at center, but after spring ball, offensive coordinator Dan
Cozzetto wasn't ready to commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends what happens during the summer and how everything
else falls in place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peters was impressive as a 10-game starter at left guard last
season but Cozzetto wants to see whether other players step up at
the guard spots. The top candidates on the left side include Korey
Ramsey; junior college transfer Kenneth Williamson, who looked
solid in the spring but may not be ready to take over; and Kyle
Kosier, who has moved from the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Right guard could go to senior Thomas Schmidt, who played at
guard and tackle last season, but don't be surprised to see some
incoming recruits make a case for one of the guard spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have what is believed to be the biggest class of
offensive line recruits to come to ASU. The five freshmen average
6-6, 308. Additionally, two junior college transfers, Steve York
and Marquise Muldrow, will report in early August. &QL; 
Running back
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Redmond is the heart and soul of this offense, and now that
he's healthy, he'll carry the load. Watch for his role to expand to
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Daveron Hightower and Gerald Green will get their minutes, but
the forgotten player in the mix might be Delvon Flowers, who was
the considered the No. 1 junior college player in the nation by
several recruiting publications. Flowers is a fast, flashy runner
who may find his way onto the field. &QL; 
Fullback
</P>
<P>
   Of all the departures, the loss of Jeff Paulk may hurt the Sun
Devils most.
</P>
<P>
   Paulk's contributions often went unrecognized because he did
little in terms of catching or carrying the ball. But as a blocker,
there are few better.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has considered going to zone blocking, which is similar to
what the Dallas Cowboys did when Daryl Johnston went down, but the
emergence of Terrelle Smith may force the Sun Devils to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the surprise of the spring,'' Cozzetto said.
</P>
<P>
   The senior, who gave linebacker a run last season, is a fiery,
determined player who is aching for minutes. He showed promise in
the spring, especially with redshirt freshman Darrel Turner
sidelined and sophomore Jack Each not making a strong enough case
for the job yet. &QL; 
Wide receiver
</P>
<P>
   No position was hit harder. ASU lost its top three receivers,
who combined for 77 percent of the wideouts' receptions.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who missed spring ball in order to regain his academic
eligibility, should start after averaging 14.2 yards per catch and
grabbing four touchdowns. Also seeing time will be Taplin, who
didn't have a reception last season but made a lot of noise in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Sun Devils hope to keep up with the Joneses, and line
up more than two receivers on occasion, they'll need some players
to step up at Camp Tontozona.
</P>
<P>
   Among those battling for roles include Brian Forth, Joey Graves
and Clifton Jones, and junior college transfers Ryan Dennard and
Richard Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Dennard was slowed by an injury in the spring but showed promise
when he got healthy. Williams won't report until August, but he
watched almost every spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Boyer, who ASU hoped might regain his academic
eligibility, appears to be all but out of the picture. He has yet
to qualify. &QL; 
Tight end
</P>
<P>
   If ASU feels comfortable about a spot, it's this one.
</P>
<P>
   The staff has acknowledged that it failed to get the tight end
the ball enough last season, and considering what the Sun Devils
have to work with, it's probably right.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Heap made a handful of circus-like catches, finishing with
12 receptions and four touchdowns. He's as sure-handed as they
come.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget Kendrick Bates, a 6-6 senior who got lost a bit in
the Heap excitement but is capable of big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Long snapper Brian Jennings will also work his way into the mix,
primarily as a blocker on the team's short-yardage goal line unit. &QL; 
Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   This unit was a mixed bag last season. The development of junior
college transfers Erik Flowers and Junior Ioane was a highlight,
but the Sun Devils still need to prove they can consistently put
pressure on the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   No one looked better in the spring than Flowers. The rush end
treated each practice like a game and sacked the quarterback four
times in the spring-ending scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are disappointed that they went through the
spring without Ioane, who barely missed being eligible, but they
feel good about the progress the tackle made in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, ASU hopes for a big year from 6-8, 245-pound
Quincy Yancy, who has made strides each season but is due for a
breakthrough year. He'll be pushed by 6-5, 256-pound redshirt
freshman Mike Pinkard, who is clearly talented but inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Reilly, a 6-2, 300-pound senior, continues to find himself
in the starting lineup even though he's not the biggest or
strongest lineman available. His work ethic and knowledge of the
game keeps him in there.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Townsend, who was a redshirt at Southern California in
1997, will step in as a backup. He's not a dominant pass rusher but
demonstrated he can be a capable tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are anxiously awaiting the arrival of 6-4,
300-pound tackle Tony Aguilar, one of their most coveted recruits. &QL; 
Linebacker
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right mix at linebacker, and enough healthy bodies,
was a problem for ASU last season, and it proved to be one of the
team's least effective positions.
</P>
<P>
   The shuffling is under way again and the Sun Devils hope this
mix works. Sophomore Fields, one of the team's most promising
players last season in seven starts outside, moves to the middle
even though he has never played the position.
</P>
<P>
   Trejo, who has played all three linebacking positions at ASU, is
back outside in what the Sun Devils calls the Sam spot. The team is
still waiting for a big season for the junior and hopes this role
is what will prompt it.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Archuleta, who had 18 tackles for losses last season,
returns to the other outside spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three linebackers back that have played, and we wanted
to put all three of them in a position for them to start because
they understand the package,'' Snow said about the shuffling.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils won't know until the fall what they'll get from
junior college transfer Adam Tanke, who was sidelined with knee
problems during the spring. Another JC transfer, Jamall Anderson,
and recruits Solomon Bates and Josh Amobi, will get close looks at
Tontozona. &QL; 
Cornerback
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' pass defense fell to seventh in the Pac-10 and a
shortage of healthy players at cornerback contributed to the
problem. The shifting of several players from safety and the
addition of several junior college standouts could rectify that.
</P>
<P>
   ASU returns starting cornerbacks Courtney Jackson, who is one of
the Pac-10's best when healthy, and J'Juan Cherry. Cherry may be
the team's most athletically gifted player, but he needs to
fine-tune his technique to fulfill his potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils get depth now that Courtney Palmore and Christon
Rance have moved over from safety. Palmore's 5-11, 185-pound frame
is more suited for corner, and Rance likes his new position.
</P>
<P>
   And in the fall comes junior college transfer Nijrell Eason, who
may prove to be the most talented of all the recruits. Look for
Eason to make an immediate impact. &QL; 
Safety &QL; 
No position was more contested in the spring. Overall, the results
were promising.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Williams, Brandon Falkner and Craig Koontz all made
strong cases for time at free safety, and Willie Daniel and Monte'
Franks duked it out at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   With the demands the Pac-10 now places on defensive backs, all
these players should see time. &QL; 
Kicking game
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baker stepped in as a freshman last season and gave ASU
one of the few consistent areas on the team: punting. He finished
17th in the nation in net punting, and his 45.7-yard average per
punt set an ASU single-season mark.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's security at place kicker will be challenged in the fall
by incoming recruit Mike Barth. &QL;

KANAAN WINS POLE ON TWISTING COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ What time is it? It's Tony Kanaan time.
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan, one of nine Brazilian drivers starting today's Toyota
Grand Prix of Long Beach, won a career-first pole position Saturday
after a speedy 107.454 mph qualifying run over a twisting 11-turn,
1.824-mile seaside street circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan also won something else.
</P>
<P>
   Wrist watches. Lots of wrist watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like watches,'' said Kanaan, whose 1-lap burst during a
30-minute qualifying position slid provisional pole-sitter Dario
Franchitti (104.412) to an outside front-row starting position for
today's 85-lap race. ``When I woke up (Friday morning), I bet my
engineer I'd do better than (1 minute, 2.5 seconds). I did, and I
won his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a bet with all the members of the team (Saturday) that
if I make the pole, I wanted all their watches. I said, `If I
don't, I'll buy dinner.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody want to buy a Rolex?''
</P>
<P>
   Ha-ha.
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan, however, hopes he's still laughing all the way to the
bank following what promises to be a white-knuckle race of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Course officials have reconfigured a portion of the twisting
seaside layout, some of which is bordered by the Pacific Ocean, and
what emerged is road racing's version of a Rorschach test.
</P>
<P>
   Turn 1 of the 11-turn pretzel now is a sneaky left-hander
instead of a right-hander, and Turns 2 and 3 are
enter-at-your-own-risk corners, hardly wide enough to fit one of
those road-hogging Sun City golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, watching cars wiggle through the squishy turns was
like watching a bunch of shoppers jam the neighborhood supermarket
on quadruple-coupon day.
</P>
<P>
   `` ``Cleanup on aisle six.''''``''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bryan Herta, ``The track has a much different feel going
into Turn 1 as you set up for the left-hand turn rather than a
right-hand corner. It's like driving into a tight tunnel. There is
only room for one car in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha.
</P>
<P>
   There's barely room for the corner worker with the move-over
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new part of the track is really tight, just as you'd
expect on a street course,'' said Paul Tracy, a former resident of
Scottsdale and Parker. ``Everybody's going to have to be careful
through there, because if a car gets sideways in there, you're
looking at a red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   There already has been a slew of incidents during two days of
practice and qualifying, one of which was a costly crash involving
Franchitti.
</P>
<P>
   During morning practice Saturday, Franchitti smashed into the
wall in Turn 2 and sustained major, unfixable damage to the Team
Kool Green Reynard-Honda primary car.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to use a back-up machine, Franchitti still managed to
improve Friday's qualifying speed. But what he didn't do was
improve it enough to keep Kanaan from atop the qualifying ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be on the pole,'' Franchitti said. ``I'm not very
happy that I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan's happy. He also is concerned about today's start, which
also has almost everyone else concerned, too.
</P>
<P>
   Following a rolling start, the high-pitched screaming champ cars
will reach speeds upward of 160 mph before drivers have to slam on
the brakes and downshift to about 50 mph entering Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   The problem will be when more than one driver tries to enter the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go to the drivers meeting, and everybody is going to
agree not to make a big move in Turn 1 because it is so tight,''
Kanaan said. ``Then (today), everybody will forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   They better not forget about it, said Herta, who starts on the
inside of the second row next to Max Papis.
</P>
<P>
   If drivers do develop a case of amnesia, he added, motor racing
hell is going to break loose.
</P>
<P>
   But with so few places to pass, anxious drivers are likely to be
more brazen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably going to take a little cooperation or a mistake
to make a run on a guy,'' Herta answered when asked what it would
take to make a clean pass.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it might take even more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing places? I don't think there's any,'' Franchitti said.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. &QL;

   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Pressure? What pressure?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tony Kanaan, a promising second-year driver from Brazil, won a
career first pole position Saturday in the the Toyota Grand Prix of
Long Beach and now hopes a career first trip into victory lane soon
follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud, I'm happy,'' Kanaan said. ``But I know I have a lot
to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (sponsor) McDonald's came aboard, it gave me the
opportunity to do a lot more testing. Last year we only had 10 days
of testing. We've already had 20 days this year. (Team manager)
 &UR; Steve (Horne) said I asked for more testing and money, and now I'm
under a little bit of pressure to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan finished ninth last season in the final driver's
standings, scoring the most rookie points since  &UR; Nigel Mansell in
1993. Kanaan also is ninth entering today's race. &QL;

DODGERS BEAT PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Technically, one at-bat isn't enough to break out of
a slump. However, what Devon White did to the San Diego Padres
should go a long way toward pulling him out of a horrific stretch
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   White's pinch-hit three-run homer in the sixth inning broke open
a tie game and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-3 victory
Saturday over the Padres in front of 56,568 at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know it, the reason White was on the bench in
the first place was because of his struggles with the bat.
</P>
<P>
   White hit .440 during the Dodgers' season-opening homestand. But
before connecting for the three-run homer off Padres reliever
Carlos Reyes, he was 1 for 19 on the road trip that began Monday.
His only other hit was an RBI double off Arizona's Randy Johnson on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield added a pair of homers and
three RBI. It was Sheffield's 12th multi-homer game of his career
and first since July 1997. He leads the Dodgers with five home runs
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park (1-1) recorded his first win
of the season, allowing three runs on eight hits in five innings.
He walked two and struck out six. Park got help from three
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes (0-1) pitched one inning but took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   After getting shut out by Andy Ashby in the series opener, the
Dodgers wasted little time in getting to San Diego starter Sterling
Hitchcock. An RBI single by Eric Karros in the first inning gave
the Dodgers a 1-0 lead, and two innings later Sheffield homered to
center field with Mark Grudzielanek on base for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Park held the lead until the fifth, when the Padres broke
through by doubling their hit total for the game. Chris Gomez led
off with a single, moved to second on a wild pitch and advanced to
third on a groundout. He scored when Quilvio Veras lined a Park
pitch through the middle. Park got his glove on the ball but
couldn't corral it.
</P>
<P>
   Park struck out Reggie Sanders, but hitting machine Tony Gwynn
doubled to the wall in right-center field to score Veras. It
appeared Dodgers center fielder Jacob Brumfield, starting for
White, could make a play on it but he jumped too soon.
</P>
<P>
   That inning also cost the Padres Hitchcock for the rest of
night. He was lifted for pinch-hitter Eric Owens and left after
allowing two runs on four hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner then singled to right to score Gwynn and tie the
game 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Prior the game, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he was going
to rest White either Saturday or today, partly because of the day
game following a night game and in part because of White's hitting
woes.
</P>
<P>
   In White's place, Brumfield got the start and got a little
retribution when his one-out single in the sixth moved Adrian
Beltre to third. Brumfield went to second on the throw.
</P>
<P>
   It brought catcher Paul LoDuca to the plate, and for a moment
Park was in the on-deck circle. But when LoDuca, hitless in 11
at-bats this season, fell behind in the count, White appeared in
the on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca struck out, but White didn't miss Reyes' 2-1 fastball
over the plate, hitting hit it 406 feet to give the Dodgers a 6-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   With Park no longer available, Johnson went to his revamped
bullpen to chew away some innings. Antonio Osuna, activated from
the disabled list Friday, made his first appearance of the season.
He was infallible, retiring all three batters he faced with the
kind of ease Johnson was hoping he'd see.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers upped the lead 7-3 in the top of the seventh when
Sheffield greeted reliever Brian Boehringer's first pitch with the
barrel of his bat, lining a solo homer to left.

PRESEASON PREDICTION STILL HOLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA's 50-game schedule is grinding down to the last two
weeks, and the playoff picture is starting to shake out.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, there have been few surprises. In the Western
Conference, the Portland Trail Blazers have been better than most
expected. The Suns haven't been as good as many anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eastern Conference, the New Jersey Nets have been a bust,
and the Orlando Magic has soared to the top of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   But who will emerge when the top 16 teams end the madness that
has been this lockout-altered season and return to a normal NBA
playoff routine?
</P>
<P>
   Portland could wind up with the best record in the league.
Orlando may hold home court throughout the Eastern Conference
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers, with talent and the galvanizing
influence of Coach  &UR; Kurt Rambis' decision to tell  &UR; Dennis Rodman to
get lost, will be a popular pick. Houston, with three of the NBA's
all-time top 50 players on the roster, has been lying in wait. And
in the East, the Miami Heat is an experienced team with a coach,
 &UR; Pat Riley, who knows how to get to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But it says here that the two preseason favorites are headed for
the showdown, Utah from the West and Indiana in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz is easy to dismiss. The team is forgotten every year
for sexier picks. But the combination of  &UR; John Stockton and  &UR; Karl
Malone is the most difficult to defend in the West. Without Rodman,
the Lakers again will have nobody to handle Malone.
</P>
<P>
   And Portland will find that its vast advantage in depth will
have less impact in the playoffs, when teams have days off to rest
and prepare, than it did in the hectic regular season. Plus, the
Trail Blazers haven't gotten past the first round in the past six
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, Indiana has slogged along all season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Larry Bird has ripped his team on several occasions.
Guard
 &UR; Reggie Miller is having a so-so season. The players are unhappy
with their minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled. The Pacers still could wind up with the best
record in the East. They, too, have depth and talent. And they have
vast playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling everybody how good they were because I really
wanted them to play with a lot of pressure on their backs and be
the team picked to win it all,'' Bird said recently after a loss to
Charlotte. ``I thought they'd come out, work hard every day and
prove it to people. It backfired. Obviously, they can't handle the
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are equipped to handle the pressure because Bird has
been putting it on them. They've been to the conference finals in
three of the past five years. And Utah has been to the NBA Finals
the past two season and the conference finals or beyond in four of
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Barring injuries, they're the teams to beat. And it says here
that, in a seven-game series, the Jazz wins its first title. &QL; 
Bargain hunting &QL; 
Based on a list the ``Chicago Sun-Times'' published of the league's
payrolls, the Jazz is the league's best bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's payroll of $31.350 million ranks just 25th in the league,
and it's challenging for the best record. The New York Knicks, at
$69.4 million, have the highest payroll and are in danger of not
making the playoffs at all.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's No. 1 team in spending, the Chicago Bulls, ranks
last this season with a payroll of $29.45 million.  &UR; Michael Jordan
made more than that all by himself last season. Of course, Jordan
often scored more than 49 points all by himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, by the way, rank near the middle of the pack. Their
payroll is reportedly $36.96 million. They had the 16th-best record
going into Saturday's games.
</P>
<P>
   The worst deal? Take your pick between the Washington Wizards
($44.4 million) and the New Jersey Nets ($41.96 million). Neither
will make the playoffs. &QL; 
Who knew? &QL; 
It figured when the Charlotte Hornets traded  &UR; Glen Rice to the
Lakers that former Los Angeles guard  &UR; Eddie Jones would have an
impact on the Hornets. But surprisingly center  &UR; Elden Campbell, the
other player who came to Charlotte in the deal, has had made a more
substantial contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Given more and consistent minutes, Campbell has become the
team's first option offensively, and the Hornets have fought
themselves into playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he was as good as he is,'' interim head Coach
 &UR; Paul
 &UR; Silas said. ``He really makes a difference for us. The last few
games he's been our go-to guy, and he seems comfortable with it.'' &QL; 
Runnin' on empty &QL; 
Players are starting to feel the full effect of a demanding,
lockout-shortened schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been feeling like I've been in a fog for a week,'' Golden
State's  &UR; Bimbo Coles said. ``You don't know what the date is, or
what day of the week it is, or anything.'' &QL; 
Trash Talk &QL; 
Comments from Nets guard  &UR; Stephon Marbury, who long has made it
known he wants to be the Knicks' point guard, were well publicized
when Marbury ripped Knicks playmakers  &UR; Chris Childs and  &UR; Charlie
Ward _ even though his team had gotten whipped by New York and he
had eight turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still need a point guard,'' Marbury said. ``They'll never
win no championship with them two guys. They'll never, ever win.
They're just not the guys you need to win a championship. They
might not even make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs shot back later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you win a championship, and prove you're playing the
game for love and not for money, you shouldn't be making comments
like that.'' he said. ``I was cocky at that age, but I never put an
opponent down or gave him extra incentive to kick my butt. That
kind of thing carries over to next year, the year after that. We're
all professionals, some of us have better days than others, but we
all try hard. And the person who is defeated should admit it and go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs knows full well that Marbury wants his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine and dandy,'' he said, ``but he can't have it this
year.'' &QL;

JAGR SHOWS WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT NHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody wandered up to  &UR; Keith Tkachuk the other day and asked
him which player he'd pick for the Hart Trophy if he had a vote.
The Coyotes captain, without hesitation or ever looking up from
untying his skate laces, didn't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotta be  &UR; (Jaromir) Jagr, right?'' Tkachuk said. ``I
mean, who else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's the two mightiest Ducks from Anaheim,  &UR; Teemu
Selanne and
 &UR; Paul Kariya. Then there's the popular choice of Canada, Ottawa's
 &UR; Alexei Yashin. But Tkachuk's right, the choice for this year's Most
Valuable Player seems pretty cut and dried.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Jagr has run away with the NHL scoring title,
taking 41 goals and 124 points into the weekend, and he's the
reason why the financially burdened Penguins have remained above
water. It's an easy pick.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions here and there, so are the rest of the
selections for the NHL's major postseason awards, which will be
announced in Toronto on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, here's the way I see it:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hart Trophy (MVP): 1. Jagr. 2. Yashin. 3. Selanne. Coyotes'
candidate:  &UR; Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Norris Trophy (top defenseman): 1.  &UR; Al MacInnis, St. Louis. 2.
 &UR; Ray
 &UR; Bourque, Boston. 3.  &UR; Scott Stevens, New Jersey. Coyotes' candidate:
 &UR; Teppo Numminen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Selke Trophy (best defensive forward): 1.  &UR; Jere Lehtinen,
Dallas. 2.
 &UR; Craig Conroy, St. Louis. 3.  &UR; Bob Corkum, Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Calder Trophy (top rookie): 1.  &UR; Chris Drury, Colorado. 2.
 &UR; Brendan
 &UR; Morrison, New Jersey. 3.  &UR; Mark Parrish, Florida. Coyotes'
candidate:
 &UR; Daniel Briere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vezina Trophy (top goalie): 1.  &UR; Curtis Joseph, Toronto. 2.
 &UR; Dominik
 &UR; Hasek, Buffalo. 3.  &UR; Eddie Belfour, Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jack Adams Award (Coach of the Year): 1.  &UR; Jacques Martin,
Ottawa. 2.
 &UR; Robbie Ftorek, New Jersey. 3.  &UR; Pat Quinn, Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lady Byng Trophy (sportsmanship): 1.  &UR; Wayne Gretzky, Rangers.
2. Wayne Gretzky, Rangers. 3. Wayne Gretzky, Rangers. Coyotes'
candidate: Gretzky (Hey, he almost came here).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Masterton Trophy (comeback/perseverance): 1.  &UR; John Cullen,
Tampa Bay. 2. Kariya, Anaheim. 3. &UR; Steve Smith, Calgary. Coyotes'
candidate:  &UR; Greg
 &UR; Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a few more unofficial awards we'd like to submit:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Most exciting player: Selanne. He doesn't have the power or
maybe even the one-on-one capabilities of Jagr, but his speed and
knack for the puck make him the player I'd pay to watch every
night.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Up-and-coming star: Pavol Demitra, St. Louis. When the Coyotes
start the playoffs on Thursday, you'll see it for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest bust: Chris Gratton, Tampa Bay. Philadelphia finally
realized it made a mistake sinking so much money into this
overhyped, underproducing center, whom they traded back to the
Lightning. He had eight goals and 25 assists entering the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best moment: Gretzky being named MVP of the All-Star Game in
Tampa and announcing he was keeping the free truck that went along
with the award after giving away the 14 or 15 automobiles he's won
over the years. Remember, we told you there probably was a
significant reason behind that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst moment: It'll come today, when No. 99 skates around the
ice one last time and finally returns to the locker room, where
he'll unlace his boots and ship them to the Hockey Hall of Fame in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall will waive its five-year waiting period and induct
Gretzky within the next 12 months. &QL; 
Dollars and sense
</P>
<P>
   Team presidents don't usually make comments like this, but  &UR; Tim
 &UR; Leiweke of the Los Angeles Kings didn't mind sharing his feelings
as to which team he hopes wins the Stanley Cup this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Ottawa wins it all,'' Leiweke said. ``They've done it
the right way, building through the draft. Or a team like New
Jersey, building through their development system.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke said that should be the new standard operating procedure
by NHL clubs because he speculates that only three or four are
actually going to make money this season. The Kings, he said, stand
to lose $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners have only themselves to blame,'' he said. ``I'm all
for what Detroit did, but at some point, everybody has to look at
themselves in the mirror and ask whether it's all about buying a
Stanley Cup. To go out and write checks for the Stanley Cup
destroys the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke compares the Red Wings to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a crime,'' he said. ``I see no suspense in
baseball, either.'' &QL; 
Is anybody home?
</P>
<P>
   When the Carolina Hurricanes open the playoffs at home this
Thursday, there is a good chance they won't sell out either of the
first two home games at the Greensboro Coliseum, a building where
the seating capacity already has been purposely reduced to 11,059.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 6,790 showed up for a home game against Washington a
day after the 'Canes clinched the Southeast Division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have only 6,000 fans in our building for the playoffs, I
think maybe we should play all the games on the road,'' left wing
 &UR; Gary
 &UR; Roberts said. ``Obviously, it was disappointing to the players.
Nobody was happy about the crowd of 6,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you can't get excited about the Stanley Cup playoffs,
you can't get excited about anything. People experience a whole
other thing in the playoffs. They should want to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the question should be, why is the NHL there? &QL; 
A Great memory
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jacques Demers, the head coach and general manager of the Tampa
Bay Lightning, recalled a tale on the eve of Gretzky's retirement.
Ten years ago, Demers' son,  &UR; Jason, was struck by a car and
suffered a broken leg and a collapsed lung.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the accident, Gretzky sent Jason some autographed
mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ask and I don't know how he even found out about
it,'' Demers said. ``He just did it. That's the kind of guy he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my first year of coaching in Quebec (in 1979), I was
scouting and out of my (coaching) job, he sought me out after an
exhibition game in Moncton and told me to hang in there, that I'd
be back in the league again. To stay with it. He didn't have to say
that. He didn't really even know me.'' &QL;

HATCHER GONE FOR 7 GAMES  
 COYOTES WANTED LONGER SUSPENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Dallas Stars captain Derian Hatcher was handed the
longest playoff game suspension in NHL history Saturday, but it did
little to ease the Coyotes' pain of losing Jeremy Roenick for the
Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher was given a seven-game suspension, including Saturday's
game against Phoenix and today's season finale against Colorado,
plus the Stars' next five playoff games. He was charged with
leaving his feet, elbowing and boarding Roenick, whose jaw was
broken in three places and who lost eight teeth, during Wednesday's
game in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension also costs him $90,731 in lost salary. The
previous longest playoff suspension came in 1996 when Detroit's
Dino Ciccarelli was given three games for sucker-punching Enrico
Ciccone of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of factors were considered,'' said Colin Campbell,
director of hockey operations for the NHL. ``It is clear that Mr.
Hatcher intended to deliver a blow to the head by leaving his feet
prior to the hit. The severity of the injury was considered, as was
the fact Mr. Hatcher has been suspended by the league on previous
occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith wanted a stiffer penalty,
considering Roenick will be taking his meals through a straw for
the next five weeks and is out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do anything for our team,'' Smith said before the
Coyotes' 2-0 victory Saturday over the Stars. ``It's not much of a
punishment for the Dallas Stars. They will face an Edmonton team
they have a 40-point lead over going into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton is without (top two scorers) Bill Guerrin and Josef
Beranek. The net result will be a well-rested Derian Hatcher for
the playoffs, and an incident that was deliberate, premeditated and
vicious has cost our team its top scorer for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he understands Campbell faced a gut-wrenching
decision and he did what he thought best, but it wasn't enough
considering the teams could meet in the second-round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Hatcher's playoff suspension been split between the first
and second rounds, it would have been something that could have
helped us and possibly hurt Dallas' chances to win the Stanley
Cup,'' Smith said. ``It was an unprecedented event, and the league
would have been well within its jurisdiction to do something
unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said, ``I'm surprised and disappointed. They told me I
didn't lead with my elbow. My hit wasn't any worse than Eric
Lindros on Daniel Alfredsson, or Roenick's on Mike Modano.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Roenick's hit on Modano on March 23 that left Modano with
a seven-stitch cut over his eye and ill-feelings between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, looking like a chipmunk with his swollen jaw,
introduced himself as Rocky Dennis (the featured character in the
movie ``Mas''k) at news conference between the first and second
periods Saturday. He said being unable to help his teammates play
for the Cup hurts as much as his jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be five games or more,'' he said.
``It's unfortunate any of this has to happen, but in this day and
age, it's the way the game is. Everybody is going to have their own
opinion, and everybody knows my opinion, I can't play. I have to
root for Dallas to be eliminated in the first round so he can't
play, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard game, like I said. Derian is a rugged player, as
am I. It's still no reason to throw elbows into people's faces. I
don't hold grudges. I play hard, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick was asked whether Hatcher has called him to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, and I don't expect him to,'' he said. ``These things
happen in hockey all the time. I accept it. That's why I love
playing this game. It's a great game. You have to take the good
with the bad. It makes for just a little longer off-season for me,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock said if there had to be a suspension,
the one assessed was ample.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get suspended in the playoffs it's almost a
2-to-1, or 3-to-1 ratio,'' he said. ``In the regular season, this
is probably 12 to 15 games. It's severe. Both teams suffer, missing
key players going into very important playoff runs. Derian has to
accept responsibility for what he did. A lot of people have to take
responsibility.'' &QL;

`CIVIL WAR` HEATS UP WITH STARS, COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a hockey game that made the Bill Clinton-Kenneth Starr battle
look like a mere tuneup, the most combative guy on the ice in
Saturday's Coyotes-Dallas Stars war was an unlikely choice.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Dallas goalie  &UR; Eddie Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, excitable by nature, received 14 minutes of penalties,
including a 10-minute misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   He was first whistled at 9:01 of the first period when he skated
up ice during a timeout and slew-footed Phoenix captain  &UR; Keith
Tkachuk with a sweep of his right leg, drawing the misconduct and a
two-minute tripping penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 11:00 of the second period, he cross-checked Tkachuk
twice in the back, and Tkachuk wheeled and landed three quick blows
before Stars defenseman  &UR; Darryl Sydor came to Belfour's aid and was
promptly pummelled by Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that featured 31 penalties and 119 minutes in
penalties, yet Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld was critical of only
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing in the game that I thought was cheap was the
slew-foot on Keith,'' he said, referring to Belfour's trip of
Tkachuk. ``He was in uncharted waters up the ice. It's one of those
hitting-from-behind things that can be very dangerous, where you
can sprain a knee going down or, a worst-case scenario, smack the
back of your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's a member of his team, and when things get nasty and
everybody pulls together, he probably figured it was his best
chance to be physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes &UR; Rick Tocchet said, ``A guy can get hurt doing something
like that. Slew-footing a guy is something you can get suspended
for. I've never seen a goalie do that before, but he gets combative
and pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Belfour vs. Tkachuk and  &UR; Derian Hatcher vs.  &UR; Jeremy
 &UR; Roenick is likely just the tip of the iceberg, according to Stars
defenseman  &UR; Mike Keane and Coach  &UR; Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has gone above a rivalry,'' Keane said, shaking his
head. ``It's a civil war. It's good to have a rivalry in the
playoffs. It makes you play a step above normal. Today's game was
pretty much what everybody expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought Saturday's game put all the ill
feelings to rest, Hitchcock said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will go on for years. I expect it to, and I know
our players expect it to. There is a rivalry, a hate,'' Hitchcock
said. ``That's what builds a rivalry. I don't imagine it will be
anything different. I don't imagine Derian will come in and play
any less physical, and as this series moves along in years to come,
I'm sure Roenick will be a big part of it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues stay with you for a long period of time and build
the level of play, and if you want to go along for the ride, it's a
pretty good series. Unfortunately, there's a lot of responsibility
that has to be taken along the way. A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes goalie  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin, who set a franchise record
with his eighth shutout, was asked how much he wants a second-round
match-up with the Stars:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I want to play them bad,'' he said. ``That means we get
out the first round.'' &QL;

COWBOYS QUICKLY GO WITH BEST AVAILABLE ATHLETE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Invoking a tired but time-honored disclaimer,
the Cowboys surveyed the NFL's first-round offerings yesterday and
opted to draft the _ fanfare, please _ ``best available athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is a significant departure from seasons past, when
the Cowboys were prone to select the draft's best available Shante
or one of a series of Jay Novacek-alikes.
</P>
<P>
   But 6-foot-3, 281-pound Ebenezer Ekuban was different, in that
the Cowboys claimed that at the time he was selected _
midafternoon, 20 picks into the first round _ he was the ``last
first-round defensive player left on our board.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they didn't reach. Nor did they bow to the
pleadings of an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, coach Chan Gailey and Owner Jones drafted a solid
citizen with an engaging upside who, provided he can perform as
billed, will find his way onto the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Again, such a concept.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Owner Jones cannot have enough TV sound bites, the
Cowboys' defensive system cannot have too many linemen. A
procession of fresh bodies is desired, especially in the dog days
of a Texas Stadium autumn.
</P>
<P>
   From that angle, the drafting of Ebenezer Ekuban makes canny
sense. Ekuban is quick and reportedly can rush the passer. The
Cowboys covet both attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense has always been built on speed,'' coordinator Dave
Campo said. ``This young man brings a speed factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard nothing from the media but that we can't rush the
passer. Well, we're going to give ourselves a chance to rush the
passer.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is bold and intriguing. Imagine _ a Cowboys
first-round draft choice who actually plays. Contributes, even.
</P>
<P>
   We'll believe it when we see it. But until then, Owner Jones and
his war-room comrades are to be commended for doing something the
patient, old-fashioned way. Drafting the ``best available athlete''
is a ploy they can live and grow with.
</P>
<P>
   The young player may do nothing for three seasons. But at least
he'll look good doing it.
</P>
<P>
   In the seasons since Jimmy Johnson left, the Cowboys have
exhibited a fatal propensity to make draft-day mistakes and then
nurture them. It was the natural offshoot of letting assistant
coaches have too much say in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   With no Jimmy, Owner Jones turned to the whims of the assistant
coaches and their accompanying opinions. Line coach Hudson Houck
took a liking to 345-pound Shane Hannah. Oops. Former defensive
coordinator Butch Davis took his turn in the first round in 1994
and selected Shante Carver. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts are scouts. They tend to remain unbiased. But assistant
coaches are tempted to view draft picks as works in progress,
awaiting only the assistant coach's guiding hand to be transformed
into the next Montana, the next Singletary.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the assistant coach is always the last to let
go. The once-prospect lingers well past his shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys no longer draft that way, thank goodness. And thus,
it was interesting yesterday that they drafted in the first round
for shelf life and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed factor is the biggest thing,'' Campo said. ``That's
something you can't coach. Either a guy can run or he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ekuban, newly signed linebacker Quentin Coryatt and the shift
of Randall Godfrey to inside linebacker, replacing the ineffective
Fred Strickland, Campo's defense should have a sleek, new look.
</P>
<P>
   But a key part of that prognosis, however, remains Leon Lett.
The owner and the defensive coordinator both rambled on yesterday,
acting as if they expected Leon to return to the fold at some point
this season. ``I believe he'll really be here,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Campo is no trained parrot, speaking for the owner. The feeling
here is that he and other coaches have been given assurances _ from
Jones, presumably _ that Leon's alleged transgressions won't be
deemed as serious as the ones that previously rendered him a year's
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Owner Jones isn't one to spoil a good draft party.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Cowboys been able to select defensive tackle Anthony
``Booger'' McFarland, they could have achieved that rare match of
talent and need. But McFarland went early.
</P>
<P>
   It speaks volumes that the Cowboys didn't reach or try to
conjure another McFarland _ a Booger Lite, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Fanfare, please. This time, instead, they say they took the best
athlete left on the board.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cliche, but one that works. Especially when that cliche
can rush a quarterback.

RODMAN'S LATE SHOW MAY BE DONE FOR GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Great One is gone from the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The Late One is gone from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably frustrated by his consistent tardiness, the Lakers
waived Dennis Rodman on Thursday night, leaving their title run and
his basketball future in serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Rodman wasn't LA's mistake. Expecting him to act like a
normal human being was. The Lakers trusted a person with rainbow
hair, multiple body piercings, graffiti skin and a history of
chaos, and then acted aghast when he didn't conform to their rules
_ specifically showing up on time for practice and going into games
when coach Kurt Rambis asked him nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't keep making special accommodations for him,''
said Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who traded away big body Elden Campbell in part
because of Rodman's presence, are now left with only J.R. Reid and
Robert Horry to play power forward in the Western Conference
playoffs, where they could run into the likes of David Robinson,
Karl Malone and Brian Grant. As cancerous as Rodman seemed,
Shaquille O'Neal just lost his bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were 17-6 with Rodman, 8-9 without him.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Buss, it seems, was the only one in the organization
willing to put up with Rodman's antics, which included refusing to
go back into games four times in his 23-game stint and missing four
games for personal reasons. He was also late to five practices,
including Thursday, when he slowly shuffled in search of shoes and
socks until a fuming Rambis ordered him home.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't have shocked the Lakers, it came with the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the release of Rodman was a possibility, Lakers vice
president Jerry West should have covered himself by keeping
Campbell around. The Lakers' frontcourt will now be exposed as
soft, and their front office as suckers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodzilla who sits out games, head-butts referees and takes
gambling jaunts to Vegas has played his last NBA game. No longer
able physically to shut down opponents in the low post or able
mentally to keep focused on basketball for more than three days,
Dennis the Menace must revamp his approach at age 38 or _ as he did
after his release _ simply ride his Harley into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we can sign him,'' joked Jazz coach Jerry Sloan. ``And he
can coach, too. Because if he's here, I won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Added former Rodman coach and longtime admirer Chuck Daly,
``Dennis has a great act, one of the best ever. But he's got to
tone it down and do things like show up for practice if he ever
wants to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   That's doubtful at best. Because he wouldn't be eligible for a
team's playoff roster, Rodman is done this season. And in all
likelihood, the Worm has turned the last page in his peculiar book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm the fall guy for the Lakers,'' Rodman said.
``They're being cowards for not taking some of the blame. But
that's OK, I'm used to it. It's always Dennis' fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest in peace, Late One. And, by the way, enjoy sleeping in.
SPOTLIGHT ON ... Kevin Garnett
</P>
<P>
   With the departures of Tom Gugliotta and Stephon Marbury, the
Timberwolves' lone remaining star literally collapsed last week
trying to carry Minnesota on his $126 million shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett, the team's leading scorer, rebounder and
shot-blocker, spent Monday night and Tuesday in a Twin Cities
hospital being treated for dehydration and flu-like symptoms, while
the team lost in San Antonio and Dallas without him. Garnett had
been logging heavy minutes as the Wolves played five games in six
nights, winding up with an IV in his arm in the training room after
a 95-90 loss to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on trying to get some rest, but it's hard when you
have three games in a row and your team counts on you,'' Garnett
said. ``I learned a lesson. I've got to get some rest. Pushing
myself too far put me in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota is 0-7 without Garnett in the lineup the past three
seasons.
QUICK HITS AROUND THE EAST
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls are out of the playoffs for the first time in 14
years. Their scoring differential has plummeted 15.9 points this
season. ... Atlanta is on pace to be one of the worst offensive
teams to ever qualify for the postseason. Currently with the No. 4
seed, the Hawks scored 79, 71, 78 and 77 last week and average just
85 on 40-percent shooting. ... New Nets guard Stephon Marbury took
a shot at the Knicks' point guard tandem of Charlie Ward-Chris
Childs after they held him to eight points and eight turnovers in a
93-78 Knicks rout. ``They still need a point guard,'' he said.
``They'll never win no championship with them two guys. They'll
never, ever win. You can put that on your back page if you want to.
It's just not gonna happen. They're just not the guys you need to
win a championship. They might not even make the playoffs.'' ...
Michael Jordan met again with Hornets owner George Shinn last week
to discuss his possible purchase of control of the team. The lone
remaining issue appears to be final say on basketball decisions,
which Jordan is demanding.
AROUND THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   Portland, which last week became the last team to lose two
consecutive games, is giving more crunch-time minutes to Jim
Jackson over Isaiah Rider. With Rider on the court the Blazers are
plus-62; with Jackson plus-211. ... Suns center Luc Longley, who
suffered a hyperxtended knee in Utah, ripped into Karl Malone for
what he says was an intentional ploy to injure him. ``It looked
pretty bloody flagrant to me,'' Longley said. ``There's a fine line
between trying to draw a foul and going straight for someone's leg.
It looked like he went for my knee, and that's weak, as far as I'm
concerned. I don't know why he would do that, especially for a guy
who projects himself as a class act.'' ... TCU's Lee Nailon was one
of the standouts at the Nike Desert Classic predraft scouting camp
last week. Unlike last year in the camp, scouts said the 6-8,
225-pounder got to the basket with his dribble and finished drives
with an array of layups and dunks. He is considered a top-10 pick.
</P>
<P>
   NUMBERS GAME
</P>
<P>
   0: Number of NBA teams averaging 100 points per game. Ten years
ago, 24 of the 25 teams averaged at least 100.
</P>
<P>
   37: Times Michael Jordan scored 50 points or more in a game for
the Bulls, who last week set an all-time mark with 49 against the
Heat. \Nsubheds:Quote to note ``It's tax season. They're all
nervous about the IRS.'' _ Houston's Charles Barkley, explaining
the poor quality of officiating recently.
Best and Worst
</P>
<P>
   Best microcosm of ugly season: In what should be the enduring
highlight from this irregular season, the Warriors' Chris Mills
grabbed the tip off a jump ball near his defensive basket and
inexplicably went up for a dunk. Even more ridiculous, however, was
the Mavericks' Samaki Walker, who tried to block the shot and
fouled Mills, thereby preventing Mills from scoring two points for
the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Worst consistency: And Sonics fans thought George Karl's wacky
tactics were a little unstable. Under Paul Westphal the last 10
days, Seattle defeated the Rockets, Trail Blazers and Lakers and
lost to the Grizzlies. ``If you can figure this team out,''
Westphal said, ``let me know. We're a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
team.'' The Sonics grabbed an NBA-record low 19 rebounds in a home
loss to the Suns last Wednesday.

LAKERS: BEATEN BUT UPBEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Is it stubborn confidence, sunny optimism or
just plain false bravado? Or are the Los Angeles Lakers simply so
dizzy with defeats they can no longer discern between their hopeful
self-image and the painful reality?
</P>
<P>
   Another disjointed performance netted another double-digit loss
Saturday, but after being dismantled 109-93 by the Utah Jazz, the
Lakers somehow found silver linings where no one without
astigmatism could have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the guys today. They showed a lot of effort and a
lot of heart,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``Good times are ahead,
hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis' face screamed frustration, but his carefully
chosen _ albeit strained _ words indicated otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of good things out there,'' he said. ``It's not
gonna turn around overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even seven nights. The Lakers lost their third straight game,
all to playoff teams, the same ones they might see next month. A
crucial stretch run has netted them four losses in their last six
games.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for creating a viable playoff team is now nine
games away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lakers have their first three-game losing streak since
late February, and that slide got a coach fired. But as if
desperately holding onto their prized self-esteem, the Lakers
spurned any talk of frustration or low morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always dig yourself out,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``It's a
no-brainer, we're gonna get better.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first game of the post-Dennis Rodman era, the Lakers
outrebounded the Jazz by one, but their defense was spotty and the
offense inconsistent. Utah shot 50.7 percent for the game and
outscored the Lakers 57-36 in the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot a respectable 48.1 percent but scored 24 fewer
points from the foul line as the Jazz made 35 of 41 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Utah led by a dozen. By midway through the third it
was a 19-point lead, and the Lakers seemed almost uninterested in
making a run. Despite a 24-point second half from Rick Fox, a late
surge from Bryant and a 29-point night from O'Neal, the game was
over 16 minutes shy of the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 15 points with 4:17 to play in the third, the Lakers
watched the Jazz score seven straight, capped by a Greg Foster
3-pointer. Nothing like a wide-open 3 from a journeyman center to
suck the air out of a team.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the fourth that the Lakers got within 20 again.
They did outscore the Jazz reserves 33-27 in the final quarter to
make it semi-respectable, but the garbage-time effort couldn't
overshadow 36 minutes of uninspired play.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration was evident, from Fox's third-quarter flagrant foul
on Karl Malone to technical fouls on Fox and Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing irritates a losing team more than an unbalanced
final tally in the fouls column. Utah went to the free-throw line
41 times, making 35. The Lakers took only 18 foul shots, converting
11.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the stats sheet and they make almost twice as many
free throws as we attempt. That's something that's hard for me to
believe in a big ballgame like this,'' Rambis said. Added O'Neal,
``There's not much you can do when a team like that goes to the
line 41 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Or when Malone scores 27 points and Jeff Hornacek scores 20 and
Bryon Russell scores 14 in methodical fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive losses to Seattle, Portland and Utah have the Lakers
looking primed for no better than a second-round exit. But they're
clinging to a new, three-word affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   There's still time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got nine games to go, we've got plenty of time to turn
things around,'' Derek Fisher said. ``We didn't lay down today.
They beat us. And we played a lot better than we had.''
</P>
<P>
   So with optimism as their guiding force, and a winnable date
with Vancouver on Monday, the Lakers will eschew the negative as
best they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay positive,'' Fisher said. ``As soon as you
start to doubt your ability as a team and start to have negative
thoughts, there's no sense going out there.''

CHIRPING AL READY STARTING FOR ORIOLES  
 UNHAPPY WITH MANAGER, PITCHING COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most splintered club in all of baseball is at it again, and
this is a situation that has all the markings to get uglier before
it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles, the worst club money can buy, are sniping
at each other and their manager,  &UR; Ray Miller, whose time as the
head bird seems tenuous at best. And the season is just two weeks
old.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eric Davis' just released book, ``Born to Play _ The Eric Davis
Story,'' has revealed a batch of problems afflicting the Orioles,
whose $84 million payroll this season is the highest in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis suggests in the book that several Orioles question the
leadership capabilities of Miller and pointed to a closed-door
meeting last Aug. 27 in Chicago, when Miller and then-second
baseman  &UR; Roberto
 &UR; Alomar were in each other's face.
</P>
<P>
   Miller then pulled his coaching staff out of the clubhouse and
told the players to straighten out the situation any way they
wanted, even by fighting each other if they cared to, according to
Davis' book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like we're supposed to fight,'' Davis writes. ``We're looking
at each other in confusion. Even Cal Jr. is scratching his head. We
were a couple of pitches away from the World Series (in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   . . . Somebody said, `We ought to kick Ray's (butt) . . . for
not realizing his inexperience is part of the problem. . . . That
meeting killed the will of a team struggling to get back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis goes on to write about an on-field exchange between  &UR; Cal
Ripken
 &UR; Jr., and an American League umpire in which Ripken supposedly said,
``Why don't you throw this (manager) out of here, so we'll have a
chance to win this game?''
</P>
<P>
   Davis did not say who the manager was, but considering he only
played for  &UR; Davey Johnson and Miller while in Baltimore, the finger
was clearly pointing toward Miller. Should Miller be fired, the
list of candidates to replace him is headed by  &UR; Eddie Murray, a
favorite of owner  &UR; Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   Others on a potential short-list include former Milwaukee
Manager  &UR; Tom
 &UR; Trebelhorn, who currently works for the Orioles, Atlanta hitting
coach
 &UR; Don Baylor and Brewers Manager  &UR; Phil Garner, who is in the final
year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Orioles make any managerial moves, there are
still rumblings from the pitching staff over how first-year
pitching coach
 &UR; Bruce Kison used them during spring training. Starter  &UR; Scott
Erickson, who is 0-2 with a 10.13 ERA after two starts, is implying
Kison did not give the staff enough spring innings. Entering the
weekend, the club was 3-0 in games  &UR; Mike Mussina started and 0-7
with anyone else starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's still part of guys getting where they need to be
with fewer times to go out there,'' Erickson said. ``We have to get
ready to play. . . . We've got a ways to go, I guess you could
say.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if it was normal for pitchers to still be
preparing for the season once it has begun, Erickson said, ``I
don't know, but there are a lot of other teams playing pretty good
right now.'' &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta outfielder  &UR; Otis Nixon needs three stolen bases to
become the 16th player ever to reach 600 steals. From the group of
15, seven have come since the end of World War II. Who are the
seven to steal 600 bases since 1945? &QL; 
Mickey takes on Bart &QL; 
Disney Chairman  &UR; Michael Eisner, whose empire includes the Anaheim
Angels, is apparently ready to put on the boxing gloves when it
comes to taking on Southern California's other power outlet, the
Fox-owned Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner was in no mood to pull his punches or bow to the mighty
Dodgers, who have basically owned the Los Angeles area for 40 years
when it comes to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in competition with Fox everywhere,'' Eisner said in a
recent ``Los Angeles Times'' story. ``Luckily, their baseball team
doesn't compare to our baseball team. So in that area, we don't
have to worry about the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have been in nine World Series since moving from
Brooklyn in 1958. The Angels have been in none since their
inception in 1961. But this is 1999, and the Dodgers have not won a
postseason game since Game 5 of the 1988 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the quality of players, and the quality of how we're
going to win,'' Eisner said. ``They're the lesser team in the
market. They're just going to have to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels did distinguish themselves over the winter when they
guaranteed $80 million to first baseman  &UR; Mo Vaughn, easily the
largest contract this organization has ever given any player. In a
way, the Angels finally began playing big-league ball with the
Dodgers last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angels are the one thing in our series of assets that does
not turn a profit and that I don't think has the potential to turn
a profit,'' Eisner said of Disney's vast holdings. ``That's
discouraging. But that's OK.'' &QL; 
Nudging Pudge &QL; 
Texas Manager  &UR; Johnny Oates may have to implement a little-known
bit of motivation his buddy  &UR; Jim Leyland used a few years back on
 &UR; Barry &UR; Bonds while the two were in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers catcher  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez does not like to run out every
ball he hits. So Oates came to a compromise similar to the one
Leyland had with Bonds: When he hits a ground ball run it out to
first base. On fly balls, it's OK to sometimes jog since so few are
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live with that,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Rodriguez barely made it to first base when Anaheim
left fielder  &UR; Orlando Palmeiro dropped a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge will catch a lot of innings and run out a lot of balls
for us,'' said Oates, carefully choosing his words. &QL; 
The crawling stage &QL; 
St. Louis' rookie phenom,  &UR; J.D. Drew was sent to the bench to
ponder his first 10 days in the majors last week after going 2 for
18 in his first games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the starting lineup a full day later, Drew
was 1 for 5 with three strikeouts and mis-played a ball in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking baby steps,'' said Cardinals Manager  &UR; Tony La
Russa. ``This is a tough league.'' &QL; 
Helping hand &QL; 
San Francisco outfielder  &UR; Stan Javier, one of the best all-around
people in the game, is crediting new Hall of Famer  &UR; Orlando Cepeda
with helping improve his hitting from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants switch-hitter already has three home runs while
batting right-handed, amazing considering he went all of last
season without one from that side of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me I had to make some adjustments,'' Javier said.
``I'm hitting more straight up now. I used to be more bent over. I
feel better right-handed now, more free to swing.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
The group is headed by the career stolen base king,  &UR; Rickey
Henderson. Next among those who played in the Baby Boomer age with
at least 600 steals are:  &UR; Lou Brock,  &UR; Tim Raines,  &UR; Vince Coleman,
 &UR; Joe Morgan,  &UR; Willie &UR; Wilson and  &UR; Bert Campaneris.  &UR; Maury Wills fell
14 stolen bases short of reaching the 600 plateau. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandWould it be bad form to start setting the postseason
rotation?  &QL; 
2. NY Yankees &UR; Roger Clemens got rocked Thursday and still no signs
of worrying.  &QL; 
3. BostonThe Sox's 6-1 start was the best Beantown had seen in 44
years.  &QL; 
4. NY MetsHow long until Manager  &UR; Bobby Valentine needs a larger
cap?  &QL; 
5. San FranciscoUh-oh,  &UR; Barry Bonds is off to one of his best
starts ever.  &QL; 
6. AtlantaIn the midst of a 15-day trip that will crisscross the
country.  &QL; 
7. Los AngelesAs long as the Dodgers are winning, everything
remains cohesive.  &QL; 
8. St. LouisThe supposed weak link, the starters, have been
impressive so far.  &QL; 
9. HoustonAstros were 5-0 with catcher  &UR; Tony Eusebio behind the
plate, entering weekend. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. DetroitLearned last year how disheartening April losses can be.
Now repeating?  &QL; 
29. FloridaStarter  &UR; Alex Fernandez is back on the DL because of a
sore shoulder.  &QL; 
28. MontrealYou get what you pay for. In this case, it's not much.
 &QL; 
27. Kansas CityJust 29-51 at home last season and started 0-3 at
Kauffman this year.  &QL; 
26. SeattleFirst A-Rod, now  &UR; Carlos Guillen; The signs are not
good.  &QL; 
25. Chicago CubsFinally, a  &UR; Sammy Sosa sighting on Friday.  &QL; 
24. CincinnatiTogetherness? Six Reds went to a ``Jerry Springer''
``Show'' last week.  &QL; 
23. BaltimoreThe in-fighting began in earnest last week.  &QL; 
22. Tampa BayWay too many problems for this tiny of space. ON THE
RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Diamondbacks: The disastrous first week of the season is little
more than a long-ago memory these days. Arizona is benefiting from
what it paid most for during the off-season, starting pitching.
Starters  &UR; Randy Johnson,  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre and  &UR; Armando Reynoso _
all signed as free agents over the winter _ have looked impressive
most often. Take away Johnson's one bad outing last Thursday and
this trio is looking like they will make a solid return on all the
millions the club is paying them. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Colorado Rockies: Once again, it's pitching and defense that has
prevented this club from winning more games during the first two
weeks of the season. The Rockies face the very real stigma of
playing home games a mile above sea level. Whatever that means to a
baseball or a pitcher's psyche is not a figment. But playing at
Coors Field was always a plus for the Rockies. Last year it was not
and this year who knows? &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Former Chicago Bears Coach  &UR; Mike Ditka, who remains a Chicago icon,
sang the seventh-inning staple ``Take Me Out To The Ballpark,''
last week during a Cubs game. After badly butchering the song last
year when he rushed through it, this time he was far more
deliberate. ``I'm terrible. What did you expect, Pavarotti? I said
it was going to be slower, not better.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Kansas City rookie center fielder  &UR; Carlos Beltran earned all the
praise during spring training from just about every preseason
publication that exists. So far, he's showing why. Beltran, the
Royals' leadoff hitter, entered the weekend batting .314 while
playing well in center field. He had a little trouble retrieving
his first home run last weekend after White Sox center fielder
 &UR; McKay Christensen tossed the ball into the stands after a fan
threw it back from the seats. The ball was eventually tracked down
for Beltran. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Latest punch lines for a joke about a stadium: Tropicana Field,
home of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, was home to a pair of moments
that add to its laughable resume when a bank of lights refused to
go on and lingering smoke from pre-game fireworks prevented a fly
from being caught by Devil Rays center fielder  &UR; Randy Winn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Z factor hard at work: The Texas Rangers have three players
( &UR; Gregg Zaun,  &UR; Todd Zeile and  &UR; Jeff Zimmerman) whose last name
begins with the letter ``Z.'' The only other club to make such a
boast was the 1916 Chicago Cubs. They had  &UR; Rollie Zeider,  &UR; Heine
 &UR; Zimmerman (no relation to Jeff) and  &UR; Dutch Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Mike Aldrete.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One-third of Mark McGwire? I don't think so: Pitcher
 &UR; Eric Ludwick was designated for assignment by Toronto. So what?
Ludwick and pitchers  &UR; T.J. Mathews and  &UR; Blake Stein were the three
players Oakland received in exchange for baseball's one-man circus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If this is a precursor, it should be a great NL West
 &UR; race: Seven games against each other and very little separates the
Diamondbacks and Los Angeles. The Dodgers lead in games, 4-3, and
runs scored, 39-38. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jose Offerman, the subject of so much consternation during the
winter, had six straight multihit games for Boston to start the
season. In his previous stints with the Dodgers and Royals,
Offerman had never accomplished the feat. Teammate  &UR; Nomar
Garciaparra's longest such streak is four games.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Mike Morgan of the Texas Rangers earned a victory over
the Seattle Mariners last week and earned a distinction that could
remain for a long while. Morgan's last victory over the Mariners
was 20 years earlier, surpassing the 18 years  &UR; Cal McLish took
between wins over Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos actually had a larger crowd for their home
opener (43,917) than the Toronto Blue Jays (37,160). The next
night, though, it was back to the usual, when only 5,589 showed up,
the smallest Olympic Stadium crowd in nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If  &UR; Terry Mulholland, the Rock of Gibraltar for the Cubs'
pitching staff, had his way he'd start every four days and relieve
in between, just like in the old days. Because of  &UR; Kevin
 &UR; Tapani's sore shoulder, Mulholland has moved into the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City outfielder  &UR; Johnny Damon had played 169 consecutive
games entering the weekend. His streak, however, was in jeopardy of
being snapped since his wife is due to deliver twins any day.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh broadcaster  &UR; Steve Blass, poster child for what is
currently afflicting  &UR; Mark Wohlers, left the then-Braves reliever a
note last year wishing him luck. Wohlers, who is attempting to be
the first to overcome a sudden loss of the strike zone, never
returned the message. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees may have had their fill of pitcher  &UR; Hideki
 &UR; Irabu, who gave up five runs in just one-third of an inning last
week. The club was seeking either to trade him or send him to
Triple-A Columbus (Ohio), the more likely scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers General Manager  &UR; Kevin Malone and  &UR; Steve Kim, uncle and
agent for  &UR; Chan Ho Park, are scheduled to meet this week to resume
negotiations on a multiyear contract extension. Park wants a deal
between four and six years that will pay him around $10 million per
season.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's  &UR; Rich Loiselle has apparently lost his closer's
role even though he never was presented with a save opportunity. He
gave up one run in a tie score against Montreal and now is watching
 &UR; Jason Christiansen and  &UR; Mike Williams as co-closers.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is very close to finalizing a contract extension that
will keep  &UR; Jamie Moyer, whose .726 (45-17) winning percentage is
the best in the majors the past three years, with the Mariners for
at least two years and an option for a third season. If Moyer
reaches all three years, he will be paid between $14-$16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Braves second baseman  &UR; Mark Lemke, 33, has been
working out since January and feels no ill effects from the
post-concussion syndrome that sidelined him most of last season.
Lemke is working out with the hopes a club will call on him.
</P>
<P>
   Boston right-hander  &UR; Ramon Martinez, former ace of the Dodgers,
may be ready to begin his rehabilitation assignment within a month.
If all goes well, Martinez, brother of Boston ace
 &UR; Pedro Martinez, will need about six weeks before he is ready to
join the Red Sox's rotation. &QL;

BARTLETT LAKE, MARINA HIDDEN PLEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Bryan Church believes he's winning the battle but not
as quickly as he'd like.
</P>
<P>
   Church owns the marina at Bartlett Lake. Even getting it built
was a struggle. Financing was a problem, and it took him a while to
get more backers. He has built the marina into a first-class
facility, but again nature isn't serving him well.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extremely dry winter and spring, Bartlett fell
into 20s in percentage of fullness. The boat ramps were useless,
and anglers are still forced to launch from a point beside the
ramps.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame. Bartlett has been the most consistently good
bass and crappie fishing lake in the state since fall. It'd drop
off sometimes but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   But, naturally, low water hurt Church's business. Now, he
believes, that's almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ``My business was hurt, but it was more of a perception of the
lake,'' Church said. ``People believe it's in bad shape. They see a
dirt ring on the water and think it's a mudhole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 1,300 surface acres, and boating is just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the lake is rising at 32 percent of capacity and is
going to come up eight to 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's been told by Salt River Project, which controls the
lake, that it is going to buy Central Arizona Project water this
year to try to keep the lake stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public ramp is almost usable now,'' Church said.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints have reached me through readers that the marina has
built so much fence that reaching the shoreline to fish is next to
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Church said shoreline anglers are welcome to fish inside the
fence as long as they park in the upper parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with disabilities are more than welcome to fish down
there,'' said Church, who is confined to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the U.S. Forest Service has concurred that
anglers either on shoreline or in boats should fish at least 50
feet from his docks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marina members are allowed to fish by their boat,'' Church
said. ``Others need to stay 50 feet away. The most important reason
for that is that lures are stuck in a lot of boat covers. We have a
$150,000 Sea Ray (boat) here that had lures stuck all over the
cover. I can't sanction that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, the lures also break off on the cables that hold the
marina. When divers go down, they get pricked by the lures.''
</P>
<P>
   Church has been confident enough to purchase a new fleet of
rental boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've purchased a large number of 14-foot pontoon boats,'' he
said. ``They rent for $70 for half a day and are good for fishing.
A small aluminum fishing boat rents for $40 for half a day, and a
20-foot pontoon that rents for $220 for a full day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the lake low, the lake ``is plenty boatable,'' Church
said. ``The Arizona Game and Fish Department has been great at
marking hazards.'' He also believes the marina is in excellent
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem is we still don't have food service,'' Church
said. ``But we do have a store on the water now.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, when water started dropping, things were
grim in October and February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a terrible hit in those two months,'' he said. ``We
spent two to three weeks just keeping the marina wet. You have to
make decisions on the fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he regret getting into the marina business?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do it again,'' Church said. ``It's been fun. But I'm sick
of old problems. I want some new ones.'' He also said that fishing
guide Don Roughan has joined the marina staff. &QL;

STOTTLEMYRE EXPECTS NO SUS PENSION  
 SAYS HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IN HAYES INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Diamondbacks pitcher  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre said he doesn't
expect the league to suspend him for Friday's sixth-inning
altercation with San Francisco Giants third baseman  &UR; Charlie Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything _ unless you're suspended for ducking,''
the right-hander said.
</P>
<P>
   After rounding second on  &UR; Brent Maynes' single, Hayes ran toward
the mound, swung at Stottlemyre and missed. The Diamondbacks' &UR; Matt
 &UR; Williams tackled Hayes, and Stottlemyre was pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   The benches and bullpens emptied, but no other punches were
thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes and Stottlemyre were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks first baseman  &UR; Travis Lee said that Hayes had been
upset about how Stottlemyre was getting calls on outside pitches
and was ``freaking out'' when he reached first. Stottlemyre heard
Hayes' remarks and had a few of his own once Hayes reached second,
triggering Hayes' action.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes refused to talk and was greeted by a chorus of boos by
fans Saturday. He told reporters Friday night that the Diamondbacks
were going to be in a lot of fights because of Stottlemyre and that
Stottlemyre's teammates didn't like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even want to comment on that (expletive), because
it shows you how (expletive) stupid he is,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder &UR; Dante Powell, who was with the Giants last year,
said, ``It was just an angry comment by Charlie. That's the
farthest thing from the truth. Everyone in this clubhouse respects
(Stottlemyre).''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who served a suspension in 1993 for brushing an
umpire after disputing a play, was surprised he even got tossed
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he (the umpire) made the decision, I wasn't trying to
change his mind,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I was just asking, `What are
you supposed to do to try to stay in the game? What actions are you
supposed to choose?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said, `Go take a shower.' '' &QL; 
First save &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander &UR; Brian Anderson, who moved to the bullpen this year,
was the last pitcher expecting to pick up the Diamondbacks' first
save of the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who got a save in the '97 World Series for the
Cleveland Indians, worked 3 innings in Friday's 10-4 victory. He
came in with the bases loaded in the sixth and got  &UR; Ramon Martinez
to ground out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do it, but I'll never learn to like it,'' Anderson said
about being a reliever. ``I'm going to take pride in it, but it
will never overtake starting pitching.'' &QL; 
Loading up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter loaded his lineup with mostly
right-handed hitters Saturday against left-hander  &UR; Kirk Rueter, who
came in with a 14.85 earned-run average after his first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greg Colbrunn played first and batted third,  &UR; Bernard Gilkey
played left field and &UR; Dante Powell started in center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early season, we'd like to get these guys as many
opportunities as we can,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn hit his first home run as a Diamondback. Powell had a
double, and Gilkey singled in three at bats.

MILLER BECOMES EXPENDABLE  
 CARDS FIND POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT IN RUTLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -  &UR; Jamir Miller's future with the Cardinals was
placed into even greater question Saturday when they selected a
linebacker in the second round of the NFL draft and a pass-rushing
specialist in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably makes it less likely that he'll be back,''  &UR; Bill
Bidwill
 &UR; Jr., Cardinals vice president, said of Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, an unrestricted free agent who led the Cardinals in
tackles last season, rejected a two-year, $6 million offer last
month. Then, after firing agent  &UR; Steve Baker and hiring  &UR; Leigh
Steinberg, Miller expressed renewed interest in staying with the
team that drafted him in the first round in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed Miller wants a one-year offer so he can try his
luck on the open market again next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have said they want Miller back and that the door
remains open, but by drafting linebacker  &UR; Johnny Rutledge of
Florida 51st overall, and defensive end  &UR; Tom Burke of Wisconsin
83rd, the door would appear to be slamming shut.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 2, 246 pounds, Rutledge can play inside or outside, a
bigger version of his new teammate,  &UR; Ron McKinnon. Rutledge is a
run stopper, something that right outside linebackers  &UR; Tony McCombs
and
 &UR; Patrick Sapp didn't always do.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge was an All-Southeastern Conference pick and among 10
finalists for the Butkus Award after making 106 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically in tears right now because it's a dream come
true for me,'' Rutledge said. ``I'm just happy to be a Cardinal
now. Hopefully, I can come in and play. I'm a player that plays
with speed. I'm very smart, physical, and I think I can add a lot
to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes pass coverage, Rutledge said. That is the weakest
part of Miller's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coverage has always been part of my game,'' Rutledge said. ``I
always played corner in little league so I think covering is pretty
natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke (6-2, 243), a first-team All-American, played defensive
end for the Badgers but also could swing to linebacker. He
undoubtedly will be a prominent member of the special teams. He set
Big Ten records with 22 sacks for 130 lost yards and with 31 other
tackles for loss, 151 yards worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last two picks, we had them graded higher than where
they were when it came our turn to pick, so it was hard to pass
them up,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``We would have drafted a
linebacker even if we had Jamir signed. Linebacker is the core of
the team. They can do a lot of things for you, especially on
special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a strong run stopper and complained that he wasn't
used more as a pass rusher, which he considers one of his strongest
skills. &QL; 
Staying put &QL; 
The future of running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell in the desert became
more secure when Indianapolis unexpectedly selected Miami back
 &UR; Edgerrin &UR; James with the fourth pick. That set up Washington to
make a monumental trade with New Orleans that allowed the Saints to
take Heisman Trophy winner  &UR; Ricky Williams at No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat surprising that Murrell's status was ever in
question, considering that he came in last season and rushed for
more than 1,000 yards behind a mediocre line as the Cardinals
posted a winning season (9-7) and won a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   And according to the Cardinals, there never was a question about
it.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, sources close to the Cardinals and New England
Patriots, a team desperately seeking a back, said the teams had
agreed to a trade of Murrell for the Patriots' third-round pick if
the Cardinals drafted James at No. 8 after New England's attempts
to move higher and draft either Williams or James were
unsuccessful. Tobin denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never ever said that we would even consider that,'' Tobin
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stephen Hayes, Murrell's agent, said he believes Tobin, but
would have understood why the Cardinals might have done it had
Williams or James been on the board when they selected at No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian has no problem with what happened,'' Hayes said. ``He's
absolutely fine. He knows (with Cardinals first-round pick  &UR; David
 &UR; Boston, a wide receiver from Ohio State), they're looking at a lot
of three wides with one back, which could mean a lot of running
room for Adrian.'' &QL; 
And furthermore . . .  &QL; 
The selection of Boston marked the first time during the Vince
Tobin- &UR; Bob Ferguson era that the team has drafted a player it had
brought to Tempe for a pre-draft interview.
</P>
<P>
   In using both first-round picks on offensive players after
drafting defensive players first for three straight years, Ferguson
said, ``We need an explosive offense to run this engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Ferguson said the Cardinals now can ``line up as well
as Minnesota,'' which set an NFL scoring record last season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's father,  &UR; Byron, is an NFL official, prompting Ferguson
to crack, ``That's a consideration in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   By league rules, Byron Boston can officiate one preseason game
this season in which his son plays, but no regular-season games. &QL;

PEPPERDINE PICKS VAN BREDA KOLFF

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jan van Breda Kolff will be introduced as
Pepperdine's new head men's basketball coach this week, the Daily
News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff, 47, resigned at Vanderbilt on Feb. 26 after six
seasons, the day after Kentucky eliminated the Commodores in the
Southern Conference Tournament. A formal announcement could come as
early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt, 14-15 this past season, was 104-81 under van Breda
Kolff, winning 20 games twice and advancing to the NCAA Tournament
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff, who has eight years of Division I head coaching
experience, said Saturday he wasn't aware a decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything as of yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff played at Vanderbilt from 1971-74 and was the
SEC Player of the Year as a senior. He set Vanderbilt records for
assists in a game, season and career and went on to play
professional basketball for nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The son of former Lakers coach Butch van Breda Kolff, Jan van
Breda Kolff began his coaching career as a player-coach in Italy's
professional league from 1983-85. He was an assistant at Princeton
from 1987-91, during which time the Tigers won three consecutive
Ivy League titles, and went on to become the head coach at Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   After two seasons at Cornell, van Breda kolff returned to his
alma mater. The Commodores were 20-12 his first season and made
their first of three NIT appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The average SAT scores for Vanderbilt players led the nation in
1998 and van Breda Kolff helped develop eight players into All-SEC
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff was born in Pennsylvania but went to high school
in Palos Verdes. He earned degrees in history and English at
Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Other finalists for the job were Pepperdine assistant Randy
Bennett, UCLA assistant Jim Saia and Lipscomb head coach Dan Meyer.
Meyer, one of college basketball's winningest coaches with 702
victories, said Saturday he was contacted Friday night by
Pepperdine athletic director John Watson, who told Meyer the school
was ``going in another direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Saia both said Saturday they hadn't heard anything
new since their interviews.

SLAIN OFFICER CHOSE TO GO FIRST INTO APARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>

 By JIM WALSH  
 JUDI VILLA AND LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was typical that when Chandler police needed a point man in a
stand-off with a gunman, James Snedigar volunteered to be the first
one inside Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year veteran officer had volunteered for the SWAT team
and as a former Army paratrooper, was always ready to help. So it
surprised no one when the 38-year-old third-generation cop stepped
through the broken arcadia door of a Chandler apartment complex
after throwing stun grenades into the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But Snedigar apparently never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped into an ambush, police say.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Sergio Hernandez Martinez, 26 _ suspected of
robbing a jewelry store _ stood armed with an assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was ready. I think he was planning. It was very
premeditated,'' said Tempe police Sgt. Dave Lind, whose department
is taking over the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And the two men saw their worlds collide.
</P>
<P>
   Snedigar wore his protective vest. Martinez wore body armor
under his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Snedigar, police say, didn't get a chance to fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, police and Martinez fired at least 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez died there in the apartment, a gunshot wound to the
head. And Snedigar, also shot in the head, died at Chandler
Regional Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``In combat, there's always a point man who makes the first
contact with the enemy,'' Chandler Police Chief Bobby Joe Haris
said. ``As the result of that, many times, he is the first to die.
He gives his life so others can survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, police booked Martinez's friends, Leroy Campbell, 24,
and Arthur Lucero, 24, both of Phoenix, on two counts of
first-degree murder, armed robbery and burglary, according to their
booking slips. Both have previous records. They were transfered to
the Madison Street Jail Saturday afternoon and held on $4.5 million
bond.
</P>
<P>
   Police released no information about Martinez, of Phoenix, who
was indicted in 1992 for fleeing from police, according to Superior
Court records.
</P>
<P>
   Snedigar was the first Chandler officer to die in the line of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the statistics tell a story that worries Valley
police officers. He was the second Valley police officer slain the
past three weeks and the fifth officer shot in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hazards of our job that things of this sort are going
to occur,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's shooting started with a typical smash and grab robbery.
The following is the police account.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon, two men walked into Crescent Jewelers in a
strip mall near Priest and Elliot, smashing a display case with a
hammer. They grabbed handfuls of gold chains and necklaces and ran
outside, disappearing in a stolen Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   Police say a third man drove the car as police followed it on a
two-mile chase, winding through residential and busy streets.
Officers lost sight of the car, then discovered it inside the
Sierra Palms Apartments _ doors open, engine running, the suspected
robbers _ Martinez, Lucero and Campbell _ nowhere near it.
</P>
<P>
   Police simply followed a trail of gold chains and jewelry from
the car to apartment 1086. The arcadia door was broken. So was the
door of 1055. Martinez hid inside 1055.
</P>
<P>
   Lucero and Campbell busted into No. 1086 through a sliding glass
door.
</P>
<P>
   SWAT officers fanned out throughout the two-story complex,
spotting the broken door at 1055. Police tossed stun grenades into
the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   And Snedigar volunteered to lead the four men team into the
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The officers weren't carrying protective ballistic shields and
didn't have helmet shields, police said, adding that SWAT team
members don't use them in every entry.
</P>
<P>
   During the shooting, Lucero and Campbell apparently tried to
change their appearances, dressing in clothes found in the
apartment they broke into, police said.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, as police and apartment managers forced
residents to stay inside their apartments, fearful of their safety,
Lucero and Campbell simply tried to walk away, police said.
</P>
<P>
   They almost made it, but a police officer patrolling the
perimeter of the gated complex noticed the two men, thinking they
resembled the suspected robbers. Neither carried stolen jewelry or
guns.
</P>
<P>
   At first, police held the two men on unrelated traffic warrants.
</P>
<P>
   As police led Lucero from the Chandler jail Saturday afternoon,
he proclaimed: ``I'm innocent.'' Campbell didn't say anyth &UR; ing and
tried to hide his face from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Saturday, residents brought flowers to a makeshift
memorial for Snedigar that sprouted up in front of the Chandler
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Even before it was revealed that Snedigar led the charge into
the apartment, his uncle predicted it. ``He probably offered. It
wouldn't surprize me,'' said Robert Snedigar, 72, of Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   James Snedigar dreamed of becoming a cop since he was a child,
friends say. He watched his father, also James Snedigar, serve for
the Department of Public Safety. And his grandfather, Stanley
Snedigar, worked the beat as a deputy sheriff in San Bernadino,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he was all business, ``Yes sir and Ma'am,''
remembers his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   '`He worked hard, when you gave him a job, it didn't matter how
rough, how tough, he did it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snedigar worked on his uncle's farm as a child, building
corrals, driving a tractor, anything.
</P>
<P>
   Classmates remember the Marcos de Niza high school graduate as
the hard-working football player, always ready to help a friend.
He'd drive to the desert if a friend's car broke down.
</P>
<P>
   That work ethic carried him through graduation in 1978 and later
as he worked on his father's calf ranch in Chandler. Later, friends
say, he battled to get into the Army because of a hearing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He overcame that,'' said Joe Waters, 39, a friend of
Snedigar's since high school. ``If you look at Jim, he was what
America is meant to be. He looked to serve people.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got out of the Army, he applied for a job on the police
force at age 35. Snedigar obtained a waiver for his hearing
problems and wore hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired him because he was willing to deal with his
problem,'' Harris said. ``You have favorite people in the
department, people you think more highly of than others, and Jim
was one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say he also was fiercely dedicated to his family, his
wife, Dawn, 7-year-old son and daughters, ages 18 and 6, and a
year-old grandson.
</P>
<P>
   He looked after his mother, Lorna, after his father died a year
ago from a heart attack, Robert Snedigar said. ``Whatever she
needed, he was there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Robert Snedigar said, the family is trying to cope with the
loss. ``They're taking it hard,'' he said, ``it's a real shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Snedigar's son, Rupert, biked outside the family house as people
stopped by throughout the morning. Neighbors signed a sympathy card
and collected about $200 to buy dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Like many neighbors, Elaine Rackley described Snedigar as always
polite but a man of few words. She and her husband used to see
Snedigar working out in his garage early in the morning or
tinkering with the boat in his driveway. They would wave, and he
would wave back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a really nice guy,'' Rackley said. ``They
seemed like such a nice family. It's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The father of suspect Lucero said Saturday that his son tried
to keep out of trouble after getting out of jail two years ago. He
had been in jail six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Gene Lucero said Saturday from his
South Phoenix home where he raised Arthur and four other children.
</P>
<P>
   Lucero said his son and Campbell left their home around 10:30
a.m. Friday, not saying where they were headed. Lucero next saw his
son on television, being led away in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lucero worked at a warehouse, his father said. At night he was
home, to keep in terms of his probation from an assault conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's family said he had been in some trouble and been in
the juvenile detention center and jail, said his grandfather, Billy
Ortiz, 66.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend, Hubert Jones said Campbell works on and off in
construction. Campbell also has a court record.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Cruz Ortiz, could barely speak Saturday. ``I feel
awful, especially for the police,'' she said. ``My heart goes out
to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Harris said, Snedigar paid the ``ultimate
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   But he defended the police's decision to enter the apartment and
arrest the gunman, though authorities wouldn't discuss the tactics
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would have happened if we hadn't caught them? They may
have killed civilians on the streets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing session Saturday afternoon, Sgt. Jim Halstad
encouraged officers to talk to friends about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you rip your heart out of your chest,'' Halstad told
a reporter. ``That's how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   The other officers involved in the shooting will be placed on
administrative leave, a standard-procedure after a shooting. The
240 other officers will return to their beats.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republic reporters Richard Ruelas and Janelle Cowgill
contributed to this report.

MARINERS BEAT ANGELS IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ken Griffey Jr., didn't beat the Anaheim
Angels. He helped, of course, but it was the 430-foot home run by
David Segui off Angels reliever Troy Percival in the 10th inning
that gave Seattle a 4-3 victory over the Angels on Saturday in
front of 43,752 _ the largest crowd ever to watch a game at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled a fine outing from Angels starter Ken Hill, who
has had his share of problems prior to Saturday's contest. Hill
says he hasn't struggled because of his surgically repaired right
elbow. In fact, the elbow's fine.
</P>
<P>
   After walking seven in his last outing and watching his
earned-run average rise to 7.56, he acknowledged that an adjustment
to his delivery (to relieve the stress from his elbow) had caused
him comfort problems.
</P>
<P>
   After a shaky start Saturday and a pitch to Griffey he would
like to have back, Hill had an effective night.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins said Hill had been progressing steadily
since his last start and knew it would only take a short time for
him to adjust to his new delivery.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Hill allowed only three runs on five hits in seven
innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to cut his windup down so what we did is put his
hands in a different position,'' Collins said before the game.
``The thing with Kenny is that the bending of his elbows would
strain out his elbow, so we tried to stay away from that. Anytime
you change a habit it takes time to get going again.''
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied 3-3 in the ninth and Mark Petkovsek in for
Hill, Mariners left fielder Butch Husky hit a grounder to shortstop
Andy Sheets. Sheets' throw one-hopped Darin Erstad, who was unable
to gather it, allowing Husky to reach first on an error.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis followed with a single, and the Angels brought in
Percival. He was able to get Dan Wilson to ground out to third and
escaped the inning after Tim Salmon tracked down a dangerous fly to
right by Domingo Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a chance to win in the ninth. With Todd Greene on
second with one out, Sheets and Orlando Palmeiro grounded out to
take the game into extra-innings, when Percival gave up the homer
to Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle spotted Hill an early 1-0 lead in the second inning.
With one out, Angels center fielder Garret Anderson struck out, but
reached first on a passed ball. Troy Glaus continued his hot
hitting, sending a liner to left-center to move Anderson to second.
Todd Greene struck out, but Matt Walbeck singled up the middle to
score Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   That lead lasted all of one inning. With two outs in the third
and David Bell at first, Griffey strolled up, smacking a 390-foot
homer into the right-field bleachers for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Hill gave up a hard single to Butch Huskey, who
eventually scored on a triple by Dan Wilson for a 3-1 Mariners
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who had homered in his two previous games for the
Angels, continued to show his strength in the bottom half of the
fourth. He extended his hitting streak to eight games with a
two-out, two-run homer to left to tie the game 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Hill started to gather himself. He gave up a walk to Griffey in
the fifth but got out of the inning with three flyouts, then
retired the side in the sixth.

DUCKS TIE SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ It should have been a sleepy game between two teams
locked in their playoff positions and meeting as a mere formality
to complete their schedules, with a couple of Anaheim Mighty Ducks
trying to reach personal milestones.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya succeeded, reaching the 100-point mark for the
second time in his career. Teemu Selanne came up short, finishing
stuck on 47 goals, still enough to win the initial Maurice
``Rocket'' Richard Award as the NHL's goal-scoring champion.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3-3 tie Saturday between the Mighty Ducks (35-34-13) and
the San Jose Sharks (31-33-18) before a San Jose Arena sellout
crowd of 17,483 proved to be anything but mellow.
</P>
<P>
   An ugly incident in the final seconds of the second period took
care of that.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the play, Sharks defenseman Andrei Zyuzin slashed Ducks
enforcer Jim McKenzie who was headed in the other direction.
McKenzie turned, and both players slashed at each other _ each
connecting. Unfortunately for McKenzie, whereas his slash caught
Zyuzin on the leg, Zyuzin's caught him on the neck.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie dropped to the ice in pain, and referee Dan Marouelli
assessed him a two-minute minor and Zyuzin a five-minute major and
a game misconduct. McKenzie did not return for the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The third period was marked by plenty of nasty stickwork by both
teams. The Sharks also managed to tie the score with an early goal
by Owen Nolan
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Ducks _ preparing for a first-round playoff series
against the Detroit Red Wings, expected to begin Wednesday _ had
bolted to a 3-0 lead on first-period goals by McKenzie and Kariya,
and a second-period score by Tomas Sandstrom. The Sharks, who will
meet the Colorado Avalanche in the first round, rallied on goals by
Alexander Korolyuk and Joe Murphy, closing the deficit to one
entering the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry Suter: More than a year later, injured San Jose defenseman
Gary Suter said he still regrets the hit that injured Kariya last
season, and said he never intended to cause the Ducks' star such
harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question it was a bad hit,'' Suter said Saturday morning.
``I feel bad I put him out for the rest of the year. People who say
I did it intentionally are totally wrong. Take a look at my career.
I'm not some derelict who goes around cross-checking people in the
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Suter has missed all but one game this season with an elbow
injury. He said there is no chance he will return to the lineup for
the playoffs, but he expects to be ready for next season.
</P>
<P>
   It was last Feb. 1 that Suter (then a Chicago Blackhawk)
cross-checked Kariya, who was sidelined the rest of the year with
post-concussion syndrome. The play by Suter (an American) knocked
Kariya (a Canadian) out of the Winter Olympics. Suter said he
received threats from angry Canadian fans after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say that during the Olympics, I wasn't walking around
with my name on my back,'' Suter said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he is relieved Kariya has returned from the injury
to have a strong season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept hoping for him to come back last year and he never
did,'' Suter said. ``I'm glad he's back on top of his game and
maybe better than ever. The game needs players like him, especially
with (Wayne) Gretzky retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin back: Until Thursday, when he played against the Kings,
it had been expected that a groin injury would sideline center
Steve Rucchin until the playoffs. Rucchin had missed seven
consecutive games before Thursday, but he played in a 4-3 overtime
loss to the Kings and he played again against the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get a little game time in before the
playoffs,'' Rucchin said. ``Some is better than none to get back
into the flow of things.''

HOW LONG WILL GRIFFEY REMAIN WITH MARINERS?

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ken Griffey Jr. was answering questions in the
visitors' clubhouse at Edison Field on Saturday afternoon when a
small, glistening object whistled past the reporter's notebook and
struck the Seattle Mariners' center fielder in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Being a nine-time Gold Glove winner, he caught it.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emerald and gold Oakland A's World Series ring from
1989. Griffey looked up and, across the room, saw the gap-toothed
grin of the memento's owner, outfielder-turned-broadcaster Dave
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just trying to dog you, man,'' Hendu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants you to see one of those,'' one of Griffey's teammates
chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey laughed and tossed the ring back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got All-Star rings. And a wedding ring,'' Griffey
said. ``I bought a state high school football ring.''
</P>
<P>
   But a World Series ring? Dave Henderson has one. Ken Griffey Sr.
has one. Hundreds of perfectly ordinary ballplayers have one. Ken
Griffey Jr. does not have one.
</P>
<P>
   He has done almost everything in baseball except play in a World
Series. When should that injustice begin to bother him as much as
it bothers us, his fans?
</P>
<P>
   When he turns 30, as he will this fall?
</P>
<P>
   When he marks 10 years in the major leagues, as he did last
season?
</P>
<P>
   When he cracks the top 50 on the all-time home-runs list, as he
did last week when he hit his 352nd?
</P>
<P>
   The milestones pile up. Not a precious gem among 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play baseball,'' said Griffey, who hit his third
home run of the season in the Mariners' 4-3 victory over the Angels
Saturday night. ``I just haven't been one of the fortunate ones to
get to the World Series yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to make it. But I'm not complaining. I love going out
there on the grass _ and (artificial) turf _ and competing.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't often asked about it either, about the passing years
and the frustration of missing the playoffs in eight of his 10
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize how old I am,'' said the man who
goes by Junior. ``They say, `You've got, what, six years in?' ''
</P>
<P>
   People are going to start asking about it soon enough. Griffey
can become a free agent when his four-year, $34 million contract
runs out after the 2000 season. Just in case money is no object,
teams' championship potential certainly will be. Assume that
Griffey won't stay in Seattle unless he sees more from Mariners
management.
</P>
<P>
   The club ended '98 third in the American League West and needing
to improve the top of the starting rotation, the bullpen, the
defense and the leadoff hitter. It's not certain general manager
Woody Woodward improved any of those, working within the same $52
million payroll as last year.
</P>
<P>
   The opening-day starter, Jeff Fassero, was a big step down from
'98's Randy Johnson, traded away in July.
</P>
<P>
   The majors' worst bullpen added 32-year-old Jose Mesa, coming
off a one-save season, after letting Mike Timlin become a free
agent. The Mariners' relievers began Saturday's game with a 7.07
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's big reason for optimism was third baseman Russ (35
errors) Davis' offseason footwork lessons.
</P>
<P>
   And the big plans at the top of the batting order went pfffft
when rookie second baseman Carlos Guillen _ acquired in the Johnson
trade _ suffered a season-ending knee injury last week. David
(.200) Bell led off Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before his injury, Guillen had been switched to shortstop to
fill in for 40-home run, .310 hitter Alex Rodriguez, who'll miss
the first four to six weeks with his own knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't look like the Mariners' year, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all a team. We win or lose together,'' said Griffey,
who's hitting in the .370s but is behind his league-leading
56-homer pace of the past two seasons. That is to say: This is not
Griffey vs. His Teammates.
</P>
<P>
   As for Griffey vs. the Front Office: He points out that those
negotiations are more than year away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even thought about (the future),'' Griffey said,
referring to himself and his wife Melissa, who have a 5-year-old
son and a 3-year-old daughter. ``We have to take care of '99 first.
The important thing is, are you happy and comfortable in the
situation you're in? Is your family happy and comfortable?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel the team is competitive ... (the Mariners have a
chance to re-sign him).''
</P>
<P>
   He said he won't judge them by their payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no guarantee. You can have an $80 million payroll and
still lose,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have young guys on this team who need to go out and pitch.
We had a young second baseman who had an untimely injury. Some of
these guys might be making $200,000, but there can be guys making
$2 million who give us as much as they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wears optimism as well as Griffey, bearer of the most
convincing smile in baseball, the perpetual Kid in the backward
cap.
</P>
<P>
   But how long can that last? The Kid turns 30 on Nov. 21 _ a
month after he watches another World Series on TV.

DODGERS BEAT PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Devon White's road trip began with Tony Womack
robbing him of a homer in Arizona. Going hitless in seven at-bats
during a 16-inning loss one night later didn't help matters.
</P>
<P>
   It's why Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson decided to
give White the night off Saturday. It's a good thing, because it
made him available for pinch-hitting duty in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career White came off the bench and
homered. His three-run shot broke a tie game and lifted the Dodgers
to a 7-3 victory over the Padres in front of 56,568 at Qualcomm
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield homered twice and had three
RBI. He hit a two-run homer off starter Sterling Hitchcock in the
second inning and added a solo homer in the seventh. But it was
White who delivered at the most opportune time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devo's a veteran, a big RBI guy so when guys are on base, you
know he's going to come through,'' said Sheffield, who leads the
Dodgers with five homers. ``I know that in '97 (with Florida) he
did that and he's continued that here.''
</P>
<P>
   White hit .440 during the Dodgers' season-opening homestand. But
before connecting for the three-run homer off Padres reliever
Carlos Reyes, he was 1 for 19 on the trip that began Monday. His
only other base hit was an RBI double off Arizona's Randy Johnson
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little chances I've had to pinch-hit, I'm looking to get a
pitch to drive,'' White said. ``You can't think about two or three
games. You really can't harp on things, going 0 for 12 or 0 for 20,
because it's early in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park (1-1) recorded his first win
of the season. He allowed three runs on eight hits in five innings,
walking two and striking out six. Park got help from three
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes (0-1) pitched one inning but took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   In White's place, Brumfield got the start and was in the middle
of both the Padres' game-tying rally and the Dodgers' winning
rally.
</P>
<P>
   He mis-timed his jump on Tony Gwynn's double to the
right-center-field wall that was part of the Padres' three-run
fifth inning, which tied the score 3-3. In the top of the sixth,
Brumfield got some retribution when his one-out single moved Adrian
Beltre to third. Brumfield went to second on the throw.
</P>
<P>
   It brought catcher Paul LoDuca to the plate, with Park due up
next. But when LoDuca, hitless in 11 at-bats this season, fell
behind in the count, White appeared in the on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca struck out, but White didn't miss Reyes' 2-1 fastball
over the plate. He hit it 406 feet to give the Dodgers a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being honest with you, I thought it was a 50-50 chance maybe
they'd pitch to him,'' Johnson said. ``I figure if I went with my
best pinch-hitter (Dave Hansen) they probably would have put him
on, so I went with White.''
</P>
<P>
   With Park no longer available, Johnson went to his revamped
bullpen to chew away some innings. Antonio Osuna, activated from
the disabled list Friday, made his first appearance of the season,
though not without incident. Before he threw his first pitch he was
met at the mound by trainer Charlie Strasser and Johnson. Osuna had
developed a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand and
had to have it cut off.
</P>
<P>
   If affected Osuna so much he retired the Padres in order. Pedro
Borbon and Jeff Shaw also pitched scoreless relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to throw only five innings, but I wanted to
throw nine innings because that's what I always want to do,'' Park
said. ``I feel really bad. I have to follow what the manager is
thinking and doing, and today he did good.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Park's pitching problems had more to do with his
attitude than his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho was really breezing along and then I think he got
defensive,'' Johnson said. ``He quit going after them.''

GILL'S OT GOAL MOVES BRUINS UP A NOTCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins have maintained all along that they didn't
care whom they played in the first round of the playoffs. The
battle cry has been, ``Bring 'em on, whoever they are!''
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, coach Pat Burns amended that after his team's
impressive 2-1 overtime victory over the Buffalo Sabres, an
opponent they hadn't been able to take a point from in four tries.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have won three in a row and seven of their last eight
as they head into their regular-season finale Sunday against the
Flyers in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's victory means Boston can finish no worse than sixth
in the Eastern Conference and, depending on what happens in
Sunday's games, will face either third seed Carolina or fourth seed
Toronto. The Bruins are tied for fifth with the Flyers but have the
edge in the first tiebreaker (39 wins to 36), so a win or tie
Sunday would guarantee Boston fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he is thrilled to avoid New Jersey and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we were trying to do, stay away from eighth,''
said the coach. ``Jersey is a team that is going to have to be
reckoned with in the playoffs. Ottawa is still a good team.
Carolina is an excellent team, too. Toronto is a highly skilled,
offensive team, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preference is, if you could bypass the first round, that'd
be probably the best. But that's impossible. The first round is the
toughest round to get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's matinee at the FleetCenter, which was Fan
Appreciation Day, had all the drama and excitement of a playoff
game. It was the hockey equivalent of a pitchers' duel, with
Dominik Hasek and Byron Dafoe going head to head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, there was a little extra incentive for me just
because it was Dominik,'' said Dafoe, who made 22 saves on the way
to his 32d win of the season. ``I'm sure he didn't feel any
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a moral victory in itself for the whole team. Everyone
had extra motivation because we hadn't beaten them all year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was especially sweet for defenseman Hal Gill. Buffalo's tying
goal in the second period, credited to Miroslav Satan, had gone in
off the stick of Gill. He felt as if he redeemed himself when he
scored the winner from the point with 13.1 seconds left in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said he expected Ray Bourque to take the shot. Bourque's
initial shot was blocked, and when he got the puck back, he dished
it to Gill. When told that Gill said he didn't expect it, Bourque
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was yelling his head off,'' said Bourque. ``I heard him. I
was just hoping the puck wouldn't bounce over his stick or
something like that. He really took charge on that. He was yelling,
he knew he was wide open and I heard him, looked up, gave him the
puck and he made a great shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill said he thought Bourque giving him the puck completely
fooled the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me all the time in the world to let it rip,'' said
Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Gill was relieved because he would've felt badly to have the
Satan goal cost the Bruins a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's awesome,'' he said of what he felt was poetic justice.
``To have something like that happen, obviously I don't want to be
the goat. To get that back was really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Landon Wilson had given Boston the lead briefly at
13:11 of the second period. Left wing Sergei Samsonov dished a pass
to Wilson, but Wilson lost the puck to Buffalo right wing Dixon
Ward. Samsonov stole it back and fed Wilson in front. Wilson beat
Hasek with a backhand shot.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1:42 later, Satan tied it. After center Michael Peca dumped
the puck into the Boston zone in the right corner, the puck came
out. Gill tried to get control of it, but Satan poked at it, Dafoe
was caught off guard and it sailed through the goalie's legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him not to worry about it,'' joked Dafoe. ``It was both
of our faults. It was a fluky goal. I kind of assumed Hal had it,
but I should've been following it more. I learned a little lesson
going into the playoffs.''

GRIER AND COMPANY GOT THEIR MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Good business and good football business
blended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots were unable to trade up high enough in the
draft to grab either Ricky Williams or Edgerrin James, they did not
sit at Nos. 20 and 28 in the first round and hope to get what they
wanted. Instead they made a move so they could make some moves.
</P>
<P>
   Director of personnel Bobby Grier knew all along what he wanted
to do if one of the two top running backs were not available, and
when it appeared he might be stymied with his secondary plan, he
reacted quickly, swapping his 20th pick plus a third and sixth to
Seattle to move up to 17 and grab Boston College center Damien
Woody.
</P>
<P>
   Grier feared the one team that might foil his plan to draft
Woody was the Giants, who picked 19th and have 33-year-old Brian
Williams starting at center. Williams is coming off two years of
injuries and is the kind of question the Giants might well have
chosen to answer with Woody, who was not only the highest-rated
center in the draft but the first in years to be projected as a
possible immediate starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody is a unique athlete who comes along once in a while,''
Patriots coach Pete Carroll said. ``We had enough information that
something could happen with the Giants. We knew what we wanted and
went and got it. We're counting on Damien Woody at center.''
</P>
<P>
   That trade did far more than provide a likely starter. It also
allowed New England to unload two picks it didn't really need but
would have cost it money. More important, it could create a series
of offensive line shifts that could not only strengthen New England
on the field but shore up a dire salary cap situation.
</P>
<P>
   If Woody can step in and play immediately, as Carroll expects,
it would allow New England to shift Heath Irwin back to right
guard, his more natural spot, and move guard Max Lane to right
tackle. Irwin then would battle Todd Rucci and Damon Denson at
guard, while Lane would replace aging and overpaid Zefross Moss at
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, New England opens the season with Woody at
center, Irwin and the winner of Denson-Rucci at the guards, and
Bruce Armstrong and Lane at the tackles, releasing Moss to save
$200,000 on this year's cap and $1.2 million next year, when they
will need all the cap room they can muster to try and keep their
secondary in tact.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved of Moss's 2000 salary of $1.2 million and having taken
a $900,000 salary cap hit on the remaining portion of his bonus
this year, the Patriots would be roughly $1.65 million to the good
overall, a sum they could use in the next offseason when, as things
stand, their entire secondary is scheduled to become free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Woody will also be a salary cap bargain compared with the man he
replaces, Dave Wohlabaugh. Wohlabaugh signed a seven-year, $26.25
million contract with the Browns in the offseason that guarantees
his salary cap number will likely be three to four times higher
than Woody's by the end of the BC center's first contract and
likely at least $1 million higher even this season because
Cleveland front-loaded many of its free agent deals to make them
all but unmatchable by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Terry Fair of the Lions was the 20th pick in the
first round and received a five-year contract with a $2.875 million
signing bonus and base salaries of $266,000, $420,000, $511,000,
$596,000, and $682,000, giving him a salary cap figure of
$1,001,300 last year. Figuring an 8-10 percent inflation rate,
Woody is likely to end up with a cap number around $1.1 million in
1999. In the short term, that is unimportant because the rookie
pool money must all be spent by every team, but as the years move
on, Wohlabaugh's cap figure will skyrocket while Woody's, like most
rookies', will stay at around the same mark. That would make Woody
a huge bargain if he turns into a serviceable NFL center or better
as Carroll and Grier expect.
</P>
<P>
   As for the selection of Ohio State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer
with the 28th pick, he will come in and do exactly what Woody will
and what both Grier and Carroll knew their selections this year had
to do _ play immediately. He will step into Steve Sidwell's
defensive scheme as the weakside linebacker, the spot previously
manned by departed free agent Todd Collins, and thus take the
burden off undersized Tedy Bruschi.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi had been penciled into that position, but there were
serious concerns within the organization whether he could hold up
full-time. With Katzenmoyer's arrival, that is another problem
solved if he is anywhere near the player most scouts feel he can
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katzenmoyer loves to play football,'' Carroll said. ``He has
all kind of measureables and may have been the fastest linebacker
in the draft. We can put him next to Ted Johnson to give us a
couple of linebackers at the inside position who can run and hit.
We can put him at the weakside spot and that would allow us to use
Tedy in the way we have in the past, in nickel and third-down
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Grier and his scouts are right, his first-round moves
Saturday provided the Patriots with two things they desperately
needed out of this draft _ immediate starters on the field and
salary cap relief off it.

MARINERS BEAT ANGELS IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ken Griffey Jr. didn't beat the Anaheim
Angels. He helped of course, but the 430-foot home run off Angels
reliever Troy Percival in the 10th belonged to David Segui, who
gave Seattle a 4-3 victory over the Angels on Saturday in front of
43,752 _ the largest crowd ever to watch a game at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Percival (0-1), who had pitched only one inning this season (a
save April 6 against Cleveland), said he served up a fastball to
Segui _ and it ended up just the Mariners first baseman likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My breaking ball wasn't really working (tonight) so I got
reduced down to my fastball,'' said Percival. ``I threw one
low-middle and to him (Segui) that's a good spot. I was trying to
go low and away and I didn't get it there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a chance to make something happen in the bottom
of the 10th. With one out, David Erstad singled and Tim Salmon
walked to put runners on first and second with clutch hitters
Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus to follow. But Seattle closer Jose
Mesa struck out both to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels (6-6) moved into a three-way tie for first in the AL
West with Oakland and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Paniaguea (1-1) picked up the victory for Seattle (5-7)
after pitching the ninth. He followed a good start from the
Mariners Freddy Garcia, who pitched eight innings and allowed three
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled a fine outing from Angels starter Ken Hill, who
has had his share of problems prior to Saturday's contest. Hill
said he hasn't struggled because of the his surgically-repaired
right elbow. In fact, the elbow's fine.
</P>
<P>
   After walking seven his last time out and watching his
earned-run average jump to 7.56, he acknowledged that an adjustment
to his delivery (to relieve the stress from his elbow) had caused
him comfort problems.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins said before the game that Hill had
been progressing steadily since his last start and it would only
take a short time for him to adjust to his new delivery.
</P>
<P>
   After a shaky start and the pitch to Griffey he'd like to have
back, Hill had an effective night. He allowed only three runs on
five hits in seven innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really settled down and that's the Kenny Hill we know,''
said Collins. ``I was real, real happy. That's back-to-back games
by two guys (Tim Belcher on Friday) that we're counting on big
things from. That's two good performances so we're gonna be just
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle spotted Hill an early 1-0 lead in the second inning.
With one out, Anderson struck out but reached first on a passed
ball. Glaus continued his hot hitting, sending a liner to
left-center to advance Anderson to second. Todd Greene struck out,
but Matt Walbeck's single scored Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   That lead lasted all of 10 minutes. With two outs in the third
and David Bell at first for the Mariners, Griffey strolled up, then
smacked a 390-foot homer (his third of the season) into the
right-field bleachers to give Seattle a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hill struggled a bit in the fourth, giving up a hard single to
Butch Huskey, who advanced to second on a wild pitch. After Russ
Davis struck out, Dan Wilson sent a curling drive to right, eluding
Tim Salmon for a triple that scored Huskey for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who had homered in his two previous games for the
Angels, extended his hitting streak to eight games in the fourth
inning with a two-out, two-run homer to left to tie the game.

 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There should have been smiles all around. Nomar
Garciaparra was back, singling in the day's first run and scoring
the second, and so was the Red Sox' offense, which had 11 hits and
took advantage of 10 Tampa Bay walks, two wild pitches and a hit
batsman in an 8-5 win over the Devil Rays Saturday at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the expression that stuck with the Red Sox Saturday was
the pain on closer Tom Gordon's face after he hurt his right elbow,
a look that caused catcher Jason Varitek to sprint to the mound in
the ninth inning, followed almost immediately by manager Jimy
Williams, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, and trainer Jim Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just grimaced,'' Varitek said. ``It was a bad look on the
mound. I saw it happen once before in Double A, to a kid named
Geronimo Newton. He threw another pitch, and there went the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish anybody that face, especially when it's good
people like Flash.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who had struck out one batter, Bobby Smith, and was
ahead, no balls and two strikes, on Dave Martinez when the pinch
hitter fouled back a fastball, was not allowed to throw another
pitch by Williams. Jim Corsi finished, albeit clumsily, finally
retiring pinch hitter Wade Boggs on a force play with two runners
on to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of Gordon's right elbow, which troubled him in
spring training and has flared up again in the last 10 days,
according to Kerrigan, remains uncertain. At the moment, it is
still being called a strain. Gordon, who underwent X-rays in spring
training, is hurting in the same inner part of the elbow that
bothered him in camp, Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing, in the same place and the same feeling as
spring training,'' Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was examined immediately after the game by Dr. Bill
Morgan, who was on call Saturday in the absence of team physician
Arthur Pappas, and though Gordon remained in seclusion after the
game, he almost certainly will undergo tests in the next 48 hours
to determine the severity of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who hadn't pitched in a week and was bidding for his
major league record 47th consecutive save, is not likely to be
pitching soon and would appear to be a strong candidate for the
disabled list. Derek Lowe probably would serve as the interim
closer, though Williams will be forced to improvise Sunday with a
shorthanded bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe has pitched the last two days, including two innings
Saturday in relief of starter Mark Portugal, a winner in his Fenway
Park debut despite giving up a 469-foot home run to Jose Canseco,
the second in two games by the Tampa Bay DH, whose first-inning
single off the Monster would have been a home run anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Corsi has pitched in two of the last three games and labored
both times, while lefthander Mark Guthrie has worked each of the
last two games. A complete game out of No. 5 starter Pat Rapp would
be ideal, but he lasted just 3 2/3 innings last Sunday against the
Devil Rays and has gone the distance just twice in 93 starts in the
last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to wait and see what's going on with the injury,
then proceed,'' Williams said. ``Let's come back out here tomorrow
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan said Gordon first grabbed at his elbow on his third
strike to Smith, a 94-mile-an-hour fastball, then hurt himself
again on what Kerrigan said was a 93-mile-an-hour fastball to
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have had a run of elbow injuries this spring.
Catcher Scott Hatteberg went on the disabled list Thursday night
with an inflamed elbow _ he said Saturday he was awaiting results
of an MRI _ and Garciaparra had been shelved this spring by a
strained flexor muscle and tendinitis in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Garciaparra returned to the starting lineup after
being limited to just one pinch-hit appearance in seven games. Sox
killer Danny Clyburn made a diving catch in right field of
Garciaparra's bid for extra bases in the first inning and converted
it into a rally-killing double play.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Mike Stanley saw reason to be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times as a team we work on emotion,'' Stanley said.
``He gets announced to a standing ovation, the crowd's into it,
they see he's back. He hits a rocket, and they get a double play,
but the crowd's still in it. The place was upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I feed off it. I enjoyed watching it, seeing how people
reacted to his being back.''
</P>
<P>
   In comes Garciaparra. Out goes Gordon. One vigil ends, another
begins. And it's only April.

WOODY FRONT AND CENTER FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There were two interesting reactions from
the Patriots season ticket-holders who dished out $25 for the draft
party Saturday at the Foxboro Entertainment Complex.
</P>
<P>
   When ESPN announced the Patriots had made a deal, there was
applause. When it announced they had moved from their 20th spot to
Seattle's 17th to select center Damien Woody of Boston College,
there was a collective sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The fans, who had heard about possible deals for Ricky Williams
and Edgerrin James, expected a little more out of a trade that sent
the 20th, 82d, and 191st picks for a player they thought would be
available at 20 anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots didn't wow anyone with that pick, although taking
Ohio State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer 28th quickly revived fan
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Woody, a 6-foot-3-inch, 319-pounder from Beaverdam, Va., was the
highest-rated center in the draft and among the top four linemen,
but if the Patriots were going to move up to Seattle's spot, why
not go with North Carolina defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban? Why not
stay at 20 and take Wisconsin giant Aaron Gibson? In the end, the
Patriots thought the Giants would take Woody at 19, so they gave up
picks for a player they desperately wanted.
</P>
<P>
   When reached Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, sources from the Raiders (picking
18th) and Giants said they had no interest in Woody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one defensive lineman we liked all along was Anthony
McFarland, but we couldn't get to him,'' said Patriots coach Pete
Carroll of the former LSU star taken 15th by Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased,'' Carroll said. ``We love the fact we got
the center we wanted. He's a unique athlete. We knew there was
conversation about other teams taking him, so we gave up a few
picks to move up. We don't care about that because we got the guy
we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody, the first center taken in the first round since
Michigan's Steve Everitt by the Browns in 1992, will be the heir
apparent to Dave Wohlabaugh, who signed a seven-year, $26.25
million free agent deal with expansion Cleveland, the richest pact
ever for a center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little overwhelmed,'' said Woody, who was at a family
barbecue. ``I saw it on TV first and after that the Patriots called
me. I'm relieved. When I heard that it was a trade, I was a little
anxious because I figured why would they be moving up when the two
running backs were already gone?''
</P>
<P>
   When his family heard his name called, the party erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like an earthquake,'' said Woody.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College star elected not to return to The Heights for
one more year.
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Tom O'Brien said of Woody's selection, ``His potential
is unlimited, but now he has to produce. He has the ability.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brien also was forthcoming about Woody's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to improve his work ethic,'' O'Brien said. ``He's got
some growing up to do, but there's no question he can do the job if
he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody said he met with Carroll in Foxborough a few weeks ago and
convinced the coach that despite being a junior, he was mature
enough to handle being a starter in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the right decision for me,'' said Woody. ``I
think I had accomplished enough at BC.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the Heath Irwin era at center.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who tendered Irwin at the highest offer
($934,000), had told the world he was Wohlabaugh's replacement. But
now that's uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a surprise,'' said Irwin. ``I've been hearing about
it for a while now. It's been in the papers. I was looking forward
to playing center and I still may. Hopefully I can fit in, if not
at center, then someplace else. I'll play anywhere on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin said he was never told by the coaching staff he was the
new center but had read comments by Carroll indicating such.
Despite what it might mean for him, Irwin said of Woody, ``He's a
big kid who can really move. He'll have to learn the offense, and
his head will be swimming with the information he'll have to
absorb, but I'm sure he'll be quite a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Irwin was still the center but that he hoped Woody
would take the job. ``He has to earn it, though,'' said Carroll,
who indicated Irwin would eventually move to guard.
</P>
<P>
   Woody thinks he's equally effective protecting the passer and
run blocking, but he brings ``size and agility'' to the position.
Despite being in the area, he said he has never attended a Patriots
game but said of the team, ``They're a good, young team with good,
young talent. It's exciting. They have a great quarterback in Drew
Bledsoe, and he needs to be protected.''

DUCKS TIE SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ It should have been a sleepy game between two
teams locked in their playoff positions and meeting as a mere
formality to complete their schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the night ended with the most unlikely combatants, the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks' Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya, squaring off
against San Jose's Owen Nolan and Alexander Korolyuk in overtime of
a season-ending 3-3 tie Saturday before a sellout crowd of 17,483
at the San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little Muhammad Ali tape going before the game,''
joked Kariya, who received a roughing penalty and has never been in
a fight in his NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put him out there to score,'' Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg
said of Kariya, ``but he wanted to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a spirited tune-up for the playoffs, which the Ducks
(35-34-13) expect to open Wednesday in Detroit against the two-time
defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   It became ugly, too, when San Jose's Andrei Zyuzin slashed Jim
McKenzie late in the second period. Zyuzin, who recently rejoined
the Sharks (31-33-18) after a puzzling exile, received a major
penalty and game misconduct. McKenzie left the game with a swollen
jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Before his bout with Korolyuk, Kariya succeeded in reaching the
100-point mark for the second time in his career. Selanne, however,
came up short in his bid for 50 goals, but 47 will be enough for
him to win the initial Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard Award as the
NHL's goal-scoring champion.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, Kariya and Tomas Sandstrom gave the Ducks a 3-0 lead
early in the second period, but Korolyuk, Joe Murphy and Owen Nolan
evened the score for the Sharks, who face a first-round series
against the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Of the ugly nature of what might have been a quiet game,
Hartsburg said, ``There's some spark there, that's for sure. It was
like a playoff game. But it's over, and the season is over. Now,
the real fun starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry Suter: More than a year later, injured San Jose defenseman
Gary Suter said he still regrets the hit that injured Kariya last
season, and said he never intended to cause the Ducks' star such
harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question it was a bad hit,'' Suter said Saturday morning.
``I feel bad I put him out for the rest of the year. People who say
I did it intentionally are totally wrong. Take a look at my career.
I'm not some derelict who goes around cross-checking people in the
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Suter has missed all but one game this season with an elbow
injury. He said there is no chance he will return to the lineup for
the playoffs, but he expects to be ready for next season.
</P>
<P>
   It was last Feb. 1 that Suter (then a Chicago Blackhawk)
cross-checked Kariya, who was sidelined the rest of the year with
post-concussion syndrome. The play by Suter (an American) knocked
Kariya (a Canadian) out of the Winter Olympics. Suter said he
received threats from angry Canadian fans after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say that during the Olympics, I wasn't walking around
with my name on my back,'' Suter said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he is relieved Kariya has returned from the injury
to have a strong season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept hoping for him to come back last year and he never
did,'' Suter said. ``I'm glad he's back on top of his game and
maybe better than ever. The game needs players like him, especially
with (Wayne) Gretzky retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin back: Until Thursday, when he played against the Kings,
it had been expected that a groin injury would sideline center
Steve Rucchin until the playoffs. Rucchin had missed seven
consecutive games before Thursday, but he played in a 4-3 overtime
loss to the Kings and he played again against the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get a little game time in before the
playoffs,'' Rucchin said. ``Some is better than none to get back
into the flow of things.''

 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANDRADE, FAXON PAIR UP TO BRING CVS CLASSIC TO R.I.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the PGA Tour ended its long run at Pleasant Valley
last year, few took it as personally as Brad Faxon and Billy
Andrade. As native New Englanders who are always on the road, the
event in Sutton was a chance to get back home and play in front of
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon, who won at PV in 1992, and Andrade knew the Tour's
decision was beyond their control. But they also feel a
responsibility to keep as much of a PGA Tour presence in New
England as possible. There is the annual Greater Hartford Open, but
they felt there could be more, so they moved into action. To those
who know Faxon and Andrade, it's no surprise that their efforts
have met with great success: The $1 million CVS Charity Classic
will feature a field of 20 PGA Tour players and be held Aug. 1-3 at
Rhode Island Country Club in Barrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' said Faxon. ``It's a big purse, a great
title sponsor, and a great field. We want it to mirror the Fred
Meyer Challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fred Meyer is a wildly successful charity event held
annually in Portland, Ore., and the force behind it, Peter
Jacobsen, is one of those on board for the CVS Charity Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The title sponsor made sense since CVS had been out in front for
the last three PGA Tour stops at Pleasant Valley. Tom Ryan, chief
executive officer of CVS, had a desire to stay involved in golf and
went out to the Fred Meyer Challenge with Faxon and Andrade last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the site, that, too, holds a special meaning to these
Rhode Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our home course,'' said Faxon. ``We caddied there and as
kids that's where we both started playing.''
</P>
<P>
   It also happens to be one of the great courses in New England, a
Donald Ross creation that opened in 1911. It has played host to the
US Women's Amateur and will be the site of the NCAA Eastern
Regional Championship next month.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the event, which overlaps with the final round
of the Greater Hartford Open, will be a Sunday pro-am. Then, on
Monday and Tuesday, 10 two-man teams will compete in a medal play
best-ball format. While it isn't a regular Tour event, it will,
said Andrade, offer spectators a more casual look at the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy to have the opportunity to keep pro golf in
New England,'' said Andrade. ``It was unfortunate to lose PV, but
this will be great for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon and Andrade were recently honored by the Golf Writers
Association for their annual efforts on behalf of charity, and this
event is separate from a private tournament they also put on in
July. They began that one in 1992, and the Brad Faxon and Billy
Andrade Children's Charities will benefit from a portion of the
proceeds at the CVS Charity Classic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Faxon, Andrade, and Jacobsen, players committed
to the event include fellow Rhode Islanders Dana Quigley, Brett
Quigley, and P.H. Horgan. Also: Mark Calcavecchia, John Cook, Jim
Furyk, Jay Haas, Tim Herron, Lee Janzen, Tom Kite, Davis Love,
Scott McCarron, Jay Sigel, Jeff Sluman, and Curtis Strange. Ben
Crenshaw, Ernie Els, Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard, Phil Mickelson,
and Payne Stewart are among those who have been extended
invitations to round out the field.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will be $40 per day, and children under 12 will be
admitted free when accompanied by a ticketed adult. A three-day
ticket that includes clubhouse privileges will be $100. For
information, call 401-842-0138.

   Gary Player has fond memories of PGA National's Champions Course
in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., site of this week's PGA Seniors
Championship. After all, he's won this major three times. So it
sounds strange to hear him add his voice to those pushing to move
the event. For some reason, the oldest major championship in senior
golf has not drawn well, a perplexing quandary for PGA of America
officials, since six Senior PGA Tour stops in Florida annually draw
strong crowds. ``We think we need to move to different venues and
different markets to expose the tournament to a new crowd,'' said
PGA of America CEO Jim Awtrey. It has been held here for 17
straight years and 26 of the last 36. ``I think we should take golf
to the people,'' said Player . . . Doug Sanders was on the putting
green in his purple golf boots, purple pants, purple shirt, and
purple sweater to kick off the week for the PGA Seniors. The next
day on the range he had toned down a bit, just red boots and red
pants to go with a white shirt. ``Bubba,'' said Lee Trevino, ``you
look like a lollipop.'' . . . Joe Carr's anger turned into
embarrassment Thursday when he was disqualified for signing an
incorrect scorecard. ``It's the first time I've ever done that,''
said the 60-year-old who is part-owner and operator of Bedrock GC
in Rutland, Mass. After shooting 84, Carr headed to the practice
range, ``determined to shoot par'' on Friday, but he thought he
misplaced his glasses, so he went to check the scorer's trailer.
That's when he got the bad news: He had caught a scoring mistake on
his card, but had not changed the numbers on the strip he turned
in. ``Stupid. My fault,'' said Carr . . . Arnold Palmer was 1 under
through 10 holes in the Seniors, but in the next four holes he went
double-bogey, par, quadruple-bogey, bogey, a stretch that cost him
a chance at making the cut . . . Though he failed again to make the
cut at the Masters, Palmer's trip to Augusta, Ga., was a big hit.
At a local bookstore, he agreed to sign copies of his new
autobiography ``A Golfer's Life,'' for one hour. He ended up
staying a half-hour longer than that, but the line reportedly still
had 800 people when he had to leave. No word on whether
Calcavecchia was one of them. Calcavecchia, of course, expressed
his opinion that Palmer should stop playing at the Masters because
he was so noncompetitive. Hopefully Calcavecchia said this before
checking the latest balance on his bank account, which is no doubt
healthy thanks to everything Palmer has done for the game and its
players, though too many of them are too selfish to realize it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the news broke that Mark O'Meara had fired his caddie,
Jerry Higginbotham, the jokes and snide remarks flew. It was too
easy. After all, O'Meara's best friend on Tour, Tiger Woods, fired
his caddie, Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan, not too long ago. ``Must be
something in the water at Isleworth,'' Cowan reportedly said to
Higginbotham, a reference to the neighborhood in which the golfers
live. It's easy to point to Woods and O'Meara and blame them, but
talk to caddies and they tell you one thing: ``There must be a good
reason.'' Such as bad yardage, which one caddie said Cowan was
giving at last summer's British Open, which Woods had a great
chance at winning . . . Woods and Cowan still should come in
contact a lot, since Jim Furyk has hired the Maine native. Woods is
usually in contention, as is Furyk (his nickname is ``T-4''), and
both players figure to be in Brookline for September's Ryder Cup .
. . Woods's father, Earl, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer
and will start radiation treatment . . . Jack Nicklaus keeps
talking about a quicker recovery than expected, still targeting his
Memorial event June 3-6. But Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum was a bit more
cautious, leaning more toward the six-month estimate, which would
keep Nicklaus out of competition until sometime in July (the hip
replacement was in late January). ``Playing tournament golf two,
three, or four days is a different story,'' said Bierbaum, who will
get a visit from Nicklaus sometime next month . . . Christy
O'Connor, who turned 50 last August and is playing in the PGA
Seniors Championship on a special invitation, had kind words for
Nicklaus. ``He's a lovely man. He wrote some lovely letters to me
during our problem,'' said O'Connor, referring to the death of his
son last fall . . . Bernard Gallacher, the former European Ryder
Cup captain who is making his senior debut in this week's stop, was
asked about his game and cited the usual culprit: putting. ``But
you are one of the best putters,'' said a member of the British
press. ``I am a good putter,'' said Gallacher. ``Until Thursday.''

LAKERS BEHIND RAMBIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
by HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Los Angeles Lakers management backed coach Kurt
Rambis on his decision to fire Dennis Rodman, and management is
equally supportive of the job Rambis has done, despite the team's
struggles this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a wonderful job through very trying circumstances,''
general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``We're not performing as we'd
like to perform at this time, but we feel with the number of games
left in the season we can turn this around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have lost three straight, dropping Rambis' record as
coach to 18-10 since succeeding Del Harris. But Rambis has also had
to endure the whirlwind that was Rodman, a trade that debilitated
the Lakers' defense and disrupted its rhythm and seemingly a lineup
change per day.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the ideal way to start a coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortened season, the coaching change, a major trade,
major free-agent signing _ it just wasn't practical for us to
assume we could play our best basketball so quickly,'' Kupchak
said. ``It just doesn't happen that quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although speculation continues to center on former Bulls coach
Phil Jackson as the Lakers' coach of the future, Kupchak said
Rambis is ``absolutely'' a strong candidate to win the permanent
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Kurt's done a great job and we support all his moves
to the degree you can support anything,'' Kupchak said. ``We're not
sure there's anything anybody else could have done differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis offers that he's made his share of mistakes but overall
feels good about his performance in the face of endless chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been easy. It's been a daily thing,'' he said. ``All
of the changes and disruptions throughout the season, those are all
things that have been difficult to deal with. And no practices on
top of that has made it doubly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think I've done a good job in handling all this. Did I
make mistakes? Yeah. Is everything perfect? No. But I did the best
I could. I thought I made the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still mad: Shaquille O'Neal avoided reporters Friday after
Rodman was waived, and he avoided the questions Saturday once he
decided to speak at all. But there's no question he's upset with
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't got nothing to say,'' he said of Rodman's dismissal.
Because he disagreed? ``What do you think? Write what you think.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton to Malone: John Stockton, the NBA's career assists
leader, registered his 13,000th on a bucket by longtime running
mate Karl Malone in the first quarter.

REVOLUTION SHOT DOWN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution's 100th regular-season MLS
game produced highlight saves from Walter Zenga, some sideline
histrionics, but no goals Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. They tied the Columbus
Crew, 0-0, in regulation time, then lost in the post-match shootout
to remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference with 3 points
in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga made three saves within a minute to keep the Revolution in
contention in the first half, as the Crew's striking combination of
Stern John and Brian McBride took control of the penalty area. And
the Revolution rejuvenated themselves in the second half, partly
due to some creative play by Edwin Gorter, who then contentiously
confronted assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution had little midfield possession, and were
off balance in the first half, they retained some compactness in
the second half and emerged with some confidence intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game could be better or worse than another, and this was
the worst game for our forwards,'' Zenga said. ``Sometimes you can
play bad. It isn't any one reason or another.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Revolution would certainly have collapsed in a
contest like this. But the reorganized defensive scheme and Zenga's
inspiring play are keeping them in contention. They have fallen
behind in one game, for 16 minutes, a marked improvement over last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held them to zero, and with a little luck we could have
won,'' midfielder Ivan McKinley said. ``When we get Giovanni
Savarese back we will have a good goal scorer. It feels better this
year, and we have more hope. In a European system, we would be near
the top of the standings.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Revolution's sixth shutout in 10 games and their
second scoreless result in the last five games, including the
season-ender last year, under Zenga's direction. The team has great
room for tactical improvement, but at least it has defense as a
point of reference.
</P>
<P>
   Crew coach Tom Fitzgerald went to a physical lineup to combat
the Revolution's hard-charging prediliction, with Matt Kmosko
replacing Andy Williams, one of the league's most dynamic young
players, in midfield. The alignment functioned well, as Brian West
found space on the right side and nearly converted twice in the
opening three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy has been playing well, but Matt is our New Jersey street
fighter and he and Todd Yeagley allow Brian Maisonneuve to go
forward a little more,'' Fitzgerald said. ``We played a great first
half, and any kind of win is a win, especially on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's best first-half chances were a bicycle kick off
the top of the crossbar by Tony Kuhn in the 24th minute and a
Joe-Max Moore free kick that went wide three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   But more typical of the Revolution's first half was the
defensive play by Jair, who saved a certain goal by catching Kmosko
from behind near the goal area with the net open. Zenga then
kick-saved on McBride in the 36th minute, smothered John's
point-blank shot from the edge of the goal area, and blocked John's
left-footed volley from 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, Gorter soon made one of the best moves
of the match, showing the ball to Mike Clark, then pulling it away
as Clark slid past in the penalty area. Gorter penetrated along the
end line, then pulled the ball back for Johnny Torres, who wasted
the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, however, Gorter was replaced by Brian
Dunseth, as the Revolution went into even more of a defensive mode.
Yet, within minutes of the change of alignment, Moore nearly broke
the deadlock, running onto a pass from Kuhn.
</P>
<P>
   In the shootout, Zenga fouled Jason Farrell on the final shot,
surrendering a penalty kick which Farrell converted to clinch the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter kept us in it in the first half,'' defender Dan
Calichman said. ``We are still not scoring, but that's not just
because of the offense. Maybe we are not holding the ball enough.
We have to be smarter. But that will come with time.''

PITINO PUSHING IT WITH WORKOUT PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Celtics have a new workout facility and it's a
beauty. It's got every bell and whistle, and Rick Pitino has
already ironed out a summer schedule for his players to use it.
</P>
<P>
   He's blocked out two days in May and more time in June, July,
and September for what he says are ``voluntary'' sessions. Just a
couple of hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds innocuous and, in truth, it is. The players probably
are going to work out anyway _ most of them should _ and those who
stick around will likely use the facility on their own. It's all
part of Pitino's plan to have his players in top shape for the
1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a voluntary thing,'' Pitino said. ``If people want to
get better, we will work with them. Just playing basketball is a
detriment.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino went on, ``This is for people who want to work with us.''
Asked if the players would be paid, the coach said, ``No. Nor
should they.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Boston, we have a problem. The NBA Players Association
isn't thrilled with Pitino's ``voluntary'' summer plan _ without
remuneration _ and, in fact, says it's against the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have a problem with it,'' said union attorney Ron
Klempner, who plans to discuss the matter with Billy Hunter, the
union's executive director. ``We bargained for a season that ends
in the spring and begins in the fall. If a team wishes to have
skills and workout sessions in the summer, there must be
individually negotiated bonuses for those who attend.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino ran afoul of the union in his first summer because some
of Boston's contracts contained language that actually docked
players who did not attend workout sessions. He apparently has done
so again; prohibitions against such policies are spelled out in the
not-so-fine print in the just-completed Collective Bargaining
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The league, too, has kept an eye on the coach's ``voluntary''
summer sessions. Two summers ago, it warned him that it viewed such
gatherings as unfair because it gave his team a competitive
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has a history of envelope pushing, and this is just the
latest example. He's got the right idea; getting the players in
shape is important. The union just feels it might be a good idea if
he and his people checked the rules first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of familiar names on rosters at the
just-concluded Nike Desert Classic in Phoenix. One of the more
intriguing is that of Lari Ketner, the Massachusetts big man who
alternately fascinates and puzzles NBA scouts. The early returns on
Ketner, courtesy of Celtics general manager Chris Wallace, were
encouraging. ``He's looked a lot better than he did in college.
He's more alert, more active,'' Wallace said. ``He's slowly
crawling out of the hole that he dug for himself. I don't know how
far he still has to crawl or where that puts him in the draft, but
he's taken the first step at coming back from the dead.'' Ketner
measured only 6 feet 8 1/2 inches (in socks) and weighed a svelte
282 pounds at Phoenix, a predraft showcase for seniors, although
the top ones rarely participate. Ketner said he felt he had a lot
to prove. ``I have to start playing the way I played when the
scouts were first attracted to me,'' he said. ``That's what I'm
trying to do. I had a bad season, I know that. I know there are a
lot of guys who know what I can do, but question whether I can do
it on a consistent basis. I've got a lot to improve on and I'm
going to make the most of it.'' Wallace said there were seven or
eight others who showed well in the early games. James Posey of
Xavier probably made the biggest impression and now might be the
fourth senior taken after Wally Szczerbiak, Andre Miller, and Jason
Terry. Wayne Turner also is there. ``Wayne is still Wayne,''
Wallace said, referring to Turner's reputation as a point guard who
cannot shoot. ``He can defend. He can push it. The big question is
always going to be if he can develop into a shooter.'' . . . One
more interesting name at Phoenix: Menk Bateer. He's a 6-10,
270-pound Chinese version of Vitaly Potapenko. He's also a free
agent, which means he could go anywhere anytime. He has played for
both the Chinese National Team and the Beijing Ducks. He was the
second-leading rebounder in China this past season, but Wallace
says he doesn't anticipate anyone rushing to sign the kid. ``Then
again,'' Wallace said, ``he's one of the few big men who's free as
we speak.'' . . . A lot of NBA teams, mainly those in the East, are
on the losing end in revenues because of Michael Jordan's
retirement. The reason? The Bulls aren't filling up buildings
anymore. Through Thursday, the Bulls, who sold out everywhere last
season, were drawing an average of 15,191 on the road. That's the
second-lowest mark in the NBA, beating only the Golden State
Warriors (15,065). Even the Clippers (16,258) and Grizzlies
(15,584) are outdrawing the Bulls. Last year, Chicago averaged
21,970 on the road (there were a couple dome games to inflate
that), so the dropoff is slightly more than 30 percent. Leaguewide,
attendance is down about 600 fans a game, or slightly more than 3
percent. The top road draws are the Lakers, Knicks, and, amazingly,
the Cavaliers (the only three teams drawing more than 18,000),
while Chicago remains the top home draw (22,389), though we're not
sure why . . . Keep an eye on the Milwaukee Bucks. They beat Miami
and Atlanta this week and have seven of their last 10 at home.
``They hammered the hell out of us,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said.
``They shoot the ball better than anyone in the NBA. What George
(Karl) has brought to them is a sense of excitement and chance and
hope. He's been there. He's changed their style to up-tempo,
pressure, trapping, a fast-paced game that is conducive to their
talent.'' . . . Landing On Your Feet Dept.: Wayne Lebeaux, the
former director of team and travel services for the Celtics, has
lined up a nice temporary gig. He's working behind the scenes for
Bruce Springsteen, now touring Europe with the E Street Band.
Lebeaux was one of several longtime Celtics employees who were
given walking papers when Pitino came to town.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the better comeback stories of the season is taking place
in Miami with the return of Voshon Lenard. He underwent surgery
Feb. 12 to repair a stress fracture in his left tibia. He has
recovered, and rejoined the Heat this past week. Lenard was told
that it would be up to nine weeks before he could return. That
period is up. ``I never lost hope,'' he said. ``I just wanted to
get it taken care of right away so that I wouldn't have the same
problem again. I've got a rod in my leg now and all I have to do is
work on getting my rhythm back and getting into game condition.''
The Heat now have all their people in place for the stretch run.
``As much as people talk about Miami, Indiana, and Orlando, because
we have the best records, we've also shown that on any given week,
all three of us can lose four in row. So you really gotta stay on
it,'' Riley said. More of those four-hour practices, Pat? ``There's
never a four-hour practice,'' he said. ``Just a four-hour window. I
may have them for four hours, but we might meet for 3 hours and
only practice 15 minutes.'' Riley even called off Thursday's
practice in Boston in favor of a team bonding session. ``I do have
a little mercy left in me,'' Riley said. ``Not much, just a little.
There's no time. I don't complain, but there's no time to really
plan. We always plan things on a two-week basis with a time block
allotted for practice and other things. We don't have that anymore.
Basically, when there's a day off now, the guys are so mentally
drained that it's not very productive anyhow. The playoffs will be
normal. But (the league) wanted to get in 50 games and they did.
It's taken a toll.'' . . . Antoine Walker is right about one thing:
If the Celtics keep adding five and six players every year, they're
going to spin their wheels forever. Last year, Pitino's first, we
saw too many new people to track. This year, we've got Paul Pierce,
Potapenko, Tony Battie, Eric Riley, Dwayne Schintzius, Marlon
Garnett, and, for their first full years, Kenny Anderson and Popeye
Jones. Next year, there are bound to be more. The only free agent
of any note the Celtics have is Bruce Bowen, and don't be surprised
if they let him go. First, they tried to trade him to the Clippers.
Second, the play of Greg Minor is making Bowen expendable. Minor
may not be as good as Bowen on defense, but he's much better on
offense. And he's locked up for two more years, and how many teams
would want that salary even if they wanted the player? The Celtics,
by the way, have about $43 million-$44 million committed in
salaries next season, including a freshly minted $2.5 million for
Walter McCarty (why they moved so fast on him is still a mystery)
and $1.5 million for Schintzius, although less than half is
guaranteed. The salary cap is $34 million . . . The NBA and the
Players Association are waiting for the NCAA to decide how it will
handle the proposal to deter high schoolers and college freshmen
from turning pro. Union officials met Thursday with NCAA honcho
Cedric Dempsey in an informal setting. The NBA/union proposal is to
add another year to the rookie scale for players who come from high
school or leave college after just one year. (So the Duke
sophomores would not have been affected.) But the union wants to
make sure the kids are compensated in some way and the NCAA is
looking into loan programs that might make it happen. Don't hold
your breath . . . Lest we overstate the value of veteran players,
we hark to the words of P.J. Carlesimo, coach of the Golden State
Warriors. He has his heretofore hapless, hopeless team actually
thinking about making the playoffs. Reason 1: more talent. Reason
2: more veterans. ``You can't imagine how important they've been to
us,'' he said of graybeards Terry Cummings and John Starks. ``These
are guys who know what it takes. They work hard every day and the
young guys see that and say, `Oh, so that's how it's supposed to
be.' '' Carlesimo has fallen in love with Cummings, who has been
critical to the team's turnaround on and off the court. He's got 13
years of playoff experience. Starks has been in the playoffs the
last nine years, and Chris Mills has missed only one year out of
five. Carlesimo points out those three basically came for nothing
(Latrell Sprewell) because the Warriors didn't have Sprewell but
for 14 games last year. Along with the blossoming of Antawn Jamison
(``he'd be further along if we started him out of the box,'') the
Warriors are _ gasp _ within sight of the playoffs after an 0-5
start . . . News Item: The Lakers waive Dennis Rodman. This wasn't
exactly the basketball equivalent of ``Waiting for Godot.'' The
Lakers have problems that run deeper than Rodman; namely, defense.
Kobe Bryant is having trouble defending shooting guards. Glen Rice,
as we all know, doesn't defend, period. Shaquille O'Neal does if
the spirit moves him. In the six games before Saturday's contest in
Utah, the Lakers' opponents shot 48.1 percent. While that might not
sound bad, this year it's stupefying. The league average is 43.5,
and the worst team in the league in that category, the Clippers,
hold foes to 47.2 percent.

LAST ROUNDUP BEFORE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAGUE NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the regular season concluding Sunday and the
playoffs on the doorstep, it's time to check out a few matters of
minor (league) import:
</P>
<P>
   --They've clobbered just about every opponent, recorded
glittering statistics, and dominated the American Hockey League
All-Star team, so it's no wonder that the Providence Bruins are the
favorites to win the Calder Cup when the playoffs get under way
Friday. But no matter what happens in the postseason, the Bruins'
accomplishments during the regular season have been nothing short
of astonishing. Providence has registered the biggest single-season
improvements in victories (37) and points (69), and can set an AHL
record for wins (58). The Baby B's have already established 22 team
and 13 individual records, and AHL Most Valuable Player Randy
Robitaille (101 points) became Providence's first 100-point scorer.
</P>
<P>
   --The four-on-four overtime experiment seems to be achieving the
desired result _ determining a winner. Some 60 percent of overtime
games have been decided, as opposed to 33 percent prior to the
change.
</P>
<P>
   --The International Hockey League has its own version of
Providence in the Houston Aeros, who have only one fewer
regulation-time loss than the Bruins (the IHL employs a shootout to
decide ties), thanks to a dominant defense (2.56 goals-against per
game) and league-leading offense. Two former Bruins, Greg Hawgood
(17-56_73, the I's top-scoring defenseman) and Cam Stewart
(36-25_61), are among Houston's top scorers. Maine's Jeff Tory
(19-35_54) was an All-Star choice on the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   --Patrik Stefan, projected as one of the top picks in the NHL
entry draft, was sidelined for the rest of the season and playoffs
after suffering his second concussion this year on March 31. The
18-year-old center played less than half the IHL season with Long
Beach, sitting out three months earlier with postconcussion
syndrome and a bruised spine. Though still a highly touted
prospect, Stefan's future has been clouded a bit, at least
according to Jacques Demers, whose Tampa Bay team owns the No. 1
choice. ``He's maybe the one kid who could come in and play right
away,'' said Demers. ``But once you start talking about
concussions, you really got to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   --Boston College products Dave Hymovitz and David Littman are
putting the finishing touches on stellar IHL seasons. Hymovitz is
third on the league's goal list with 45, and also ranks among the
I's top 10 scorers with 75 points for Indianapolis. At the age of
31, Littman is having a career year for Orlando with 31 wins, a
2.90 GAA, and a league-best 54 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   --A 5-foot-11-inch New Hampshire star goes undrafted, puts in a
terrific senior season, and has his choice of signing with any NHL
organization. Hobey Baker winner Jason Krog is in the same
situation as Mark Mowers was last spring; now Mowers is one of the
IHL's most promising rookies and a 26-game veteran of the NHL.
Mowers, UNH's 1998 Hobey Baker finalist who signed last summer with
Nashville, spent most of the season in Milwaukee and posted totals
of 14-21_35 in 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   --Portland may not have made the AHL playoffs, but the Pirates
became a popular team for college players to break in with. With
seven players either called up to Washington or reassigned to other
teams, Portland needed bodies and found four from the collegiate
ranks. Mike Omicioli, the former Providence sparkplug, made his
presence felt quickly with two goals in his first three games,
including a game-winner. Anthony Cappelletti scored his first pro
goal against Lowell at Paul Tsongas Arena, where Cappelletti had
played his home games while with UMass-Lowell. Dean Stork
(UMass-Amherst) and Alain St. Hilaire (RPI) also propped up the
Pirates, who used an AHL record-tying 62 players this season.
</P>
<P>
   --The St. Louis Blues sent Jim Carey to Cincinnati (IHL) in the
hope that he could find his game again and work his way back to the
NHL. Instead, Carey found himself on the sideline after two games,
the victim of a concussion after he was kicked in the helmet during
a goalmouth scramble. The Cyclones are hoping he'll be back for
this week's playoff opener. Former UMass-Amherst goalie Brian Regan
is acting as Cincinnati's backup goalie on his off-days from his
job as Dayton's No. 1 goalie in the East Coast Hockey League
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   --The ECHL had its HoustonProvidence equivalent in Pee Dee. The
team with the curious name (actually a region of South Carolina
named after a river) chalked up 51 victories, impressive in any
league but especially one with a 70-game schedule. Players with
local ties played a major role in the Pride's success, which
included a league-record 29 home wins. Goalie Mark Richards, a
minor league vet who played collegiately at the University of
Lowell, was 29-4-3 with a 2.82 goals-against average. Three former
Salem State players _ Kurt Mallett, Tom Field, and Mike Payne _
along with Providence's Rick Bennett and Lowell's Brendan Flynn,
helped form the winning nucleus for coach Jack Capuano, the former
Maine defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was another record-setting year at the gate in the minors;
each of the three top leagues set records while, not
coincidentally, announcing plans to expand. The AHL, which has
broken attendance records every year since 1992, is on pace to draw
more than 4.1 million spectators. Not surprisingly, Providence is
among the leaders with an average of 7,159 per game, and Worcester
is close behind at 6,097. The Fredericton franchise, Montreal's
affiliate, is moving to Quebec City next year, and Wilkes-Barre,
Pa., will be joining, bringing the AHL to a total of 20 franchises
. . . The IHL, based almost exclusively in big cities, drew an
average crowd of almost 7,000 and will total more than 5 million
fans. But more salient is its philosophical change in trying to woo
NHL affiliations. The I has consisted almost exclusively of
independent teams, but owners began to question the wisdom of
trying to go it alone after several teams folded. Milwaukee and
Nashville were affiliated this season, and expansion Columbus has
hooked up with Orlando for next year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone think that Adirondack would miss the playoffs,
especially when it has some Majic on its side? Xavier Majic joined
the Red Wings midway through the year from the ECHL, and he
contributed to Adirondack's drive to the postseason. If the
presence of Satan (Miroslav) hasn't hurt Buffalo, a Majic touch
could only be a plus . . . It's common to see hats, caps, octupi,
and even fish tossed onto the ice in the spirit of celebration, but
a bride's bouquet? Well, a marriage was held at center ice before a
Long Beach game this season, and the bride's bouquet hit the
playing surface during the game. Obviously spoken for, the players
declined to pick it up . . . Logo of the week: It appears that a
relative of the ``Elvis'' Patriot has been located in Milwaukee.
The Admirals' logo features this fellow with a jaunty hat. But if
you compare him with the Patriots' guy, it looks as though the
Admiral could be his uncle. Maybe the teams should switch faces _
the Admiral sure looks meaner than Elvis, and isn't that what the
Patriots really need?

KANAAN IS BEST BET AT LONG BEACH
</HEADLINE>
 BEACH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ On Friday, Tony Kanaan won a couple of
wristwatches after betting his race engineers he could turn a lap
quicker than 62.500 seconds during the first qualifying run for
CART FedEx Championship cars at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long
Beach. Kanaan ended up with a best lap of 62.332 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Kanaan upped the ante.
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan turned his gambling ways toward his mechanics before
directing the No. 44 McDonald's Drive Thru Reynard-Honda onto the
streets in the final qualifying session for today's 25th running of
the Long Beach Grand Prix. And, once again, the wager included
watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I told the mechanics) I make a bet with all you guys,'' said
Kanaan, who, if you haven't figured it out, is a watch collector.
``I said if I make the pole, I want all of your watches. They said,
`OK, if you don't make the pole, what do we get?' I said `I'll buy
you dinner.'''
</P>
<P>
   So how did it go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody want to buy a Rolex '95?,'' Kanaan asked.
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan was the proud owner of a handful of watches that were
previously the property of the Drive Thru crew members. More
importantly, the personable 24-year-old Brazilian is the proud
owner of his first pole position as a CART driver.
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished the racing milestone by turning a quick lap of
61.109 seconds at an average speed of 107.454 miles per hour to
finish in front of street-course specialist and provisional pole
sitter Dario Franchitti (107.412 mph), last year's Long Beach pole
sitter Bryan Herta (107.154), Herta's Team Rahal teammate Max Papis
(107.044), Target/Chip Ganassi rookie Juan Montoya (106.966) and
Patrick Racing's Adrian Fernandez (105.173).
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan, last year's CART Rookie of the Year, turned the fast
time 20 minutes into the second of two 30-minute sessions on the
11-turn, 1.824-mile street circuit and then held his breath. No
other driver was able to better his effort before the session
ended. There was four minutes remaining on the clock when Christian
Fittipaldi's engine stopped in the middle of the hairpin turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed from the primary (car) to the spare in the morning
practice and immediately went quicker,'' said Kanaan, who had a
gearbox problem in the primary car in the morning. ``We talked
about it at length and about 10 minutes before qualifying decided
to switch to the backup.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch meant that Kanaan's Friday qualify times were
disallowed and he was starting from scratch. But that didn't
concern him; the cars running in Saturday's first session were
blazing around the track.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gil de Ferran, 15th after Friday, moved all the way to
first after the first session by turning a top-average time of
106.568 mph. De Ferran hoped the time would stand up to give him
his third Long Beach pole, but he had to settle for seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what Gil was doing and saw the times improving,'' Kanaan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan wasn't the only guy who went out in the second session
with a backup car. Franchitti did the same, but for a very
different reason. He lost his primary Team Kool Green Reynard-Honda
on the second lap of the morning practice session when he made
contact with the wall at Turn 2. The collision caused extensive
damage to the nose and left front suspension and moved Franchitti
into his backup car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brushed the wall (at turn 1) with the left side of the
car,'' Franchitti said, ``and that must've damaged the steering,
because the car wouldn't turn for the next corner and I went into
the barriers. It wasn't even a quick lap and I end up brushing the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta and Papis will follow Kanaan and Franchitti into the first
turn in today's 85-lap, 115.04-mile race. It is a good starting
position for Team Rahal, but not as good last year when Herta began
on the pole and Bobby Rahal was by his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get where we wanted with the car but we were
close,'' Herta said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, starting on the pole doesn't guarantee victory. The last
driver to win the race after beginning on the pole at Long Beach
was Al Unser Jr. in 1990, and its only happened five times in the
15 years the CART cars have run here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race isn't won on the first lap,'' Franchitti said.

 McCOY STADIUM DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORMED  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are ways not to pay the highest average prices in
baseball and still savor New England ballparks that may not have
Fenway Park's tradition but make you mighty happy that you passed
through the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball fan planning summer weekends could do worse than
trying to visit them all, especially if she's thinking of taking
the family and would rather not blow the mortgage on an excursion
to Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Cape Cod League baseball, a showcase of some of the
best college talent in the country, and the competitive New England
Collegiate League, whose president is former major league
commissioner Fay Vincent, and there are plenty of satisfying
alternatives to big-league ball.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, start with red-brick New Britain Stadium, the
three-year-old home of the Rock Cats, the Twins' Double A team. In
Norwich, there's four-year-old Senator Thomas Dodd Stadium, home of
the Navigators, the Yankees' Double A affiliate. Blue-collar
Bridgeport has the independent Bluefish, who play in The Ballpark
at Harbor Yard, its new palace.
</P>
<P>
   There is the year-old Edward LeLacheur Park in Lowell, home of
the Single A Spinners, the Red Sox' affiliate, and in Nashua, N.H.,
the independent Pride play in Holman Stadium. There are people who
swear you can't do better than Portland's Hadlock Field, where
historian Doris Kearns Goodwin threw out the first ball on Opening
Day for the Sea Dogs, Double A affiliate of the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a new contender for a midsummer night's baseball
dream: venerable McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, which turns 57 in July
but has undergone a $16 million facelift that dramatically has
transformed the home of the Triple A PawSox, with increased seating
capacity to 10,031, left-field berm, party tents down the
right-field line, new entry tower, expanded concourse, new playing
surface, and revamped outfield dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The PawSox drew an overflow crowd of 10,586 to their Wednesday
night opener, a 3-2 win over Rochester that featured a
game-deciding two-run homer by Dernell Stenson, the organization's
top hitting prospect, and 10 strikeouts from Juan Pena, the
righthander who threw a no-hitter last season and pitched to
favorable reviews in big-league camp this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The PawSox' first homestand ends Sunday afternoon, with a chance
for fans to check on the progress of Brian Rose, who is attempting
to return to the majors after being sidelined most of last season
because of a bone spur in his elbow. Rose struck out six and
allowed one run in five innings in his first start in Buffalo and
afterward said he felt as good as he did in 1997, when he went 17-5
for the PawSox and was named the International League Pitcher of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Game time Sunday is 1:05, and while ticket prices went up a
buck, the top price remains $7, with kids and senior citizens
tickets selling for just $4.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adam Everett, 1998's top draft pick who last season played for
short-season Lowell, has skipped full-season A ball and is playing
for Double A Trenton. In his first five games, Everett was batting
.273 with one error . . . Shea Hillenbrand, who led the
organization in hitting last season with a .349 average at Single A
Michigan, is off to a hot start for Trenton, batting .375 with a
home run and 9 RBIs . . . The Thunder, unbeaten in their first
seven games, have had no hitter hotter than ex-Expo farmhand Israel
Alcantara, who had five home runs and 15 RBIs . . . To make room
for Creighton Gubanich on the 40-man roster, the Red Sox placed
Pawtucket lefthander Brian Barkley on the 60-day disabled list with
what was described as inflammation of his left shoulder . . .
Justin Duchscherer, the 21-year-old righthander who last season was
7-12 for Michigan, allowed just four hits in 14 scoreless innings
in his first two starts for the Augusta Greenjackets and was named
South Atlantic League pitcher of the week. The Sox ended their
affiliation with Michigan in the Midwest League and hooked up with
Augusta . . . Outfielder Jess Graham, signed as a nondrafted free
agent out of Ohio University two years ago, had a remarkable first
week for Butch Hobson's Single A Sarasota team. In a 13-1 win over
Clearwater April 8, Graham singled in a run in the first, hit a
three-run double in the second, and followed with a three-run home
run in the third. He finished 3 for 4 with a walk and 7 RBIs. He
had three hits and an RBI in a Sarasota loss in his second game, 3
for 6 with a game-winning RBI in the 11th the next day, then 4 for
5 with a home run and two RBIs in his fourth game. It took Yankee
pitcher Andy Pettitte, working on a rehab assignment, to slow him
down, but Graham still had a double off the lefthander.

KATZENMOYER GETS THE CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots stepped out of their prim and
proper mode Saturday and drafted Ohio State linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer, an individual who may have a Dick Butkus mentality _ a
little crazy, a little reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer, who had a problem with alcohol in the past and who
needed to take seven summer courses to keep up with his slipping
academics at Ohio State, fell to the 28th pick after being
projected as high as the top 15.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-hitting linebacker, one of the most colorful players in
the draft, said he was not disappointed he slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``I came in having no clue or
premonition of where I'd end up. It doesn't matter to me. I just
want to come in and contribute the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer, who played in the middle for the Buckeyes, will
likely be plugged into the weakside linebacker position vacated by
Todd Collins. He will compete with Tedy Bruschi for playing time at
that spot and may also see time inside protecting Ted Johnson, who
has had three arm/shoulder operations the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Johnson, Bruschi, and Katzenmoyer should put
the Patriots among the hardest-hitting group of linebackers in the
league, which should also complement the pass-rushing skills of
Chris Slade.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt Katzenmoyer was Pete Carroll's choice. The
coach convinced war room head Bobby Grier as well as owner Robert
Kraft that Katzenmoyer would be an impact player. Some in the draft
room wanted the Patriots to take LSU running back Kevin Faulk, but
Carroll made a case for Katzenmoyer, who was rated 14th on the
Patriots' board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we wanted and we went ahead and did it,'' said
Carroll. ``When we started talking about someone who is a little
crazy and a little wild, Andy is someone who isn't that fired up
about school. This guy is nuts about football. He's really excited
about the fact that now he can concentrate all his efforts on
football. He did not do a great job in school. This guy is a
football player. Everybody has something they have to deal with. He
might have a few things he needs to straighten out.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer, the final Bill Parcells compensation pick, called
his poor academics ``a lack of discipline on my part. I was a
little lost and I let my classes slip. That's basically it.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning alcohol, ``That was an incident that happened a long
time ago. It's a non-issue with me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer has spent no time as an outside linebacker, but said
he will adapt. The Patriots really don't employ a true outside
linebacker on that side, so Katzenmoyer should fit the role as a
read-and-react type, more like his role as a freshman at Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ohio State) attacked so much that they had him blitzing so
much and attacking the line,'' Carroll said. ``Early in his career
he was more of a reader. We think that hurt his production but the
style they played with him grew with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer, a 6-foot-3-inch, 245-pounder, has 4.5 speed in the
40. His college coach, John Cooper, said Katzenmoyer could even
bulk up to ``280 pounds and be a down lineman.'' Cooper said
Katzenmoyer's role really didn't change much over the years but
teams later double- and triple-teamed him.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the fans' reaction at the draft party Saturday, he
will likely be a popular player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to start it off with fan support,'' said
Katzenmoyer. ``I've never been to Boston and I don't know much
about the Patriots except that Bob Kraft has built a great
organization. I'm really looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer didn't speak to the media his senior season at Ohio
State. He has admitted that probably wasn't the smartest thing to
do. He fancies himself a Mike Singletary-type linebacker but when
asked by New Orleans coach Mike Ditka which linebacker he most
enjoyed watching, he answered Brian Bosworth, the former
first-round bust.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer was also Mo Vaughn's favorite college player. So
enamored was Vaughn with Katzenmoyer that the former Red Sox star
began exchanging uniforms and other items with him over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is gone but Katzenmoyer hopes his stay in New England
lasts longer.

NO LOOKING BACK FOR GRETZKY 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Wayne Gretzky will wave goodbye to the game he loves
Sunday, uncertain of his future, but convinced that by Sunday night
he will be perfectly comfortable with his status as ex-icon, former
shaper of the game, a legend designated for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   He'll go on being the Great One, only now at his leisure and his
pace, far from the cacophony of everyday celebrity and fame. He
won't have to live anymore by an 82-game schematic. He is 38 years
old and has spent more than half his life working the boards of
fame and fortune and he is ready for a rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to take something real special three weeks ago to
start changing my mind,'' Gretzky said Friday at his farewell news
conference, dating his decision to call it quits back to about when
the Rangers were eliminated from the playoffs. ``And I never
wavered off of that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   We live in a time of wiggle room, of course. When someone stands
before us and says, ``So long,'' especially a superstar with some
legs left, we look at our watches, check the calendar, and begin to
wonder when rumors of a return will begin. But don't go making book
that Gretzky will pull a Gordie Howe or a Michael Jordan and come
clattering back down the track. Not based on how he sounded Friday.
If he were to return, he first would have to be presented an
Academy Award for his convincing performance at the Paramount Room
in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, someone may call and ask if he'd consider it,'' said
longtime agent Mike Barnett. ``But he's made it so absolutely clear
_ and his word is always his bond. There is zero likelihood of his
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Gretzky gone, what of the league?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in solid shape,'' Gretzky said Friday. ``There's not one
guy in there that's bigger than the game. Gordie Howe taught me
that when I was 18 years old. I teach that to everybody that comes
to the game. We have great players, from (Jaromir) Jagr to (Teemu)
Selanne. The game is better than it was 20 years ago, and it will
be better than it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   In two decades, the game has taken two major growth spurts: (1)
in numbers of teams; (2) in player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Growth and health, however, are separate issues.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL soon will be 30 teams wide and the average salary per
man is nosing toward $1.5 million. More people, especially
Americans, care far more about the NHL than they did in '79, and
Gretzky's skill and success are the root cause for much of that. If
not for his grace and greatness, his skill and appeal, it might
still be only Canada's game and not the growing American
Wal-Mart-like enterprise it has become. He, more than anyone,
helped it become a Big Box product.
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky bids farewell Sunday afternoon, the game itself
will not suffer in his absence. If he had pulled out, Koufax-like,
at age 28, in his prime and before mega-expansion, then the game's
direction might have been altered dramatically. But not now. His
game has been in decline for a couple of years and the latter part
of this decade has seen some brilliant, identifiable stars emerge _
including the likes of Eric Lindros and Paul Kariya, Dominik Hasek
and Peter Forsberg, Jagr and Selanne. The game is not hurting for
interest or eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Star quality aside, however, the game has a significant
financial problem that Gretzky, if he soon hitches on somewhere as
a part-owner (a point Barnett hinted at in Saturday's Globe),
quickly will understand.
</P>
<P>
   NHL superstars now are making $10 million a year at the top end
(twice what Gretzky earned this season). Average salary has
increased tenfold in his playing career and, given the recent
inflation rate, is on course to bump up another 100 percent in 4-5
years. If ticket prices move in lockstep _ and what else can they
do without huge TV revenue? _ that $70 lower-bowl seat at the Vault
will be $140 by about the 2004-05 season. The cheapest (relative
term) seat in the house will run upwards of $50. The most
blue-collar sport of them all will be watched exclusively by a
white-collar crowd. Goodbye to big hair and Neely shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what Gretzky may think, or say, that is not great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Quality of play is another dicey, discouraging issue. Atlanta
comes aboard this October, followed by Minnesota and Columbus in
the fall of 2000. There just aren't enough players to stock 30 NHL
rosters. When there were shortages in the old days, the '60s and
'70s, the league's ``have-nots'' resorted to thuggery to keep the
masses entertained. Brawling now gone by the wayside _ for good
reason _ the league's many ``have-nots'' must ply their traps and
dumbing-down defenses to compete with the ``haves.'' Result: a lot
of bad games with a lot of bad players.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday afternoon, we have one sweet glimpse remaining of the
game's greatest offensive performer. No one will touch his
almost-obscene scoring records. And if they do, the bet here is
that this scribe won't be around for you to shove this yellowed and
tattered newspaper clipping in his nose.
</P>
<P>
   When he was at his best, when he was the Great One, Gretzky used
his speed and vision in a way that magically turned him into a
computer cursor. He was that tiny arrow that, in a click, could
change the screen's dimension, make the game whatever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Click: suddenly the defenseman, closing in so fast, just
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Click: the goalie hugging the right post now was on the left
post.
</P>
<P>
   Click: Jari Kurri, not even on the screen a split-second ago,
now was stuffing the puck in an open net off a Gretzky feed out
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was not power and might. He was megabyte and RAM, and
for five or six years, in the stretch when he led the Oilers to
four Stanley Cups, he made everyone else look like Hockey for
Dummies.
</P>
<P>
   All the greats of all the sports eventually say, ``So long.''
Hockey was great before Gretzky arrived and he made it better in a
way that Bobby Orr made it better when he was here in the Hub, the
way Howe did in Detroit and Rocket Richard did in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky did it more profoundly, with all the numbers to prove
it. He stood apart. He had his own way, his own number.
</P>
<P>
   As a farewell Sunday, the league should lift high his No. 99 in
Madison Square Garden and call for it to be similarly retired in
every NHL rink for the start of next season. In that sense, the
league won't have to go forward without him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, now what for the Rangers? They've missed the playoffs for a
second year running and there's no reason to believe they'll make
it back to the dance next season _ which would be their worst
drought since the mid '60s. The one trade they might be able to
build on would mean moving goalie Mike Richter (three years, $16
million-plus remaining on his deal), but that would mean handing
the job to the still-unproven Dan Cloutier. The only other viable
scenario could be firing general manager Neil Smith and/or
jettisoning coach John Muckler (one year remaining at about $1
million). Makes one wonder whether Gretzky might have opted against
retirement if the Blueshirts had landed Theo Fleury from the Flames
or Mark Recchi from the Canadiens . . . How about Recchi's plight?
He recently suffered his second concussion in 23 days and he's
actually thinking about playing more this season. The blows must
have left him addle-brained. Remember, he is an unrestricted free
agent, and should sign for at least $7 million a year somewhere.
But if he doesn't come back for the playoffs, will a team risk
investing big money in someone whose future could be affected by
the recent blows to his head? All of which might explain why he
wants back in the lineup . . . Derian Hatcher lines up Jeremy
Roenick, sends him to Palookaville while cracking his jaw in three
places, and then offers, ``I guess it's unfortunate that his jaw
ended up being broken . . . His head was in a bad place . . . I got
pushed from behind.'' Head in a bad place? Please. Coyotes captain
Keith Tkachuk responded with a profanity-laced tirade that got a
lot of air time around the Original 27, and a challenge to league
disciplinarian Colin Campbell to suspend Hatcher for the playoffs,
given that Roenick is done for the season. Neither a bad nor novel
concept. Campbell Saturday tagged Hatcher with seven games _ the
final two in the regular season and five in the playoffs.
Typically, the league has steered clear of suspending players for
the postseason. The Stars will have to handle the Oilers in Round 1
essentially without Hatcher _ that shouldn't be a problem _ but the
Coyotes are all but finished without Roenick . . . Former Bruin Joe
Juneau appears to be done for the season in Buffalo after suffering
a concussion, compliments of a heavy hit by the Flyers' Dan
McGillis, ex- of Northeastern . . . One for Bruins fans to
fantasize over: Penguins forward Alexei Kovalev will be an
unrestricted free agent come July 1. He looked like a sure-shot
superstar in the '92 Olympics at Albertville, but never has put it
together in his time with the Rangers and Penguins. His skill level
is undeniable. ``Some guys come from Europe and have no problem
making the switch,'' said one NHL assistant coach. ``Then there are
guys like Kovalev who just don't get the idea that the ice surface
is smaller and they have to use their linemates.'' Makes you
wonder: perhaps with Pat Burns as his coach, and Dmitri Khristich
and Sergei Samsonov around for support, Kovalev could be one
outstanding acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a 4-1 victory at Nashville Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, the Devils set
the league record for road victories with 28. They won their 27th
last week, tying the mark set by Montreal in back-to-back seasons
(1976-78). Just one more reason why no one in the East wants to
face the Devils in the postseason . . . Word around Montreal is
that the Habs, out of the playoffs this season, will lose upwards
of $5 million when the accounting is finished . . . The Oilers lost
their leading scorer, ex-Boston College Eagle Bill Guerin, with a
leg injury last week and he won't suit up against the Stars. To
help fill the void, the Oilers called up Joe Hulbig, the former St.
Sebastian's star who was a first-round pick (13th overall) in '92.
He'll be an unrestricted free agent in July and rumors around
Edmonton have him signing a two-way deal with Boston in the
offseason . . . Michael Peca, the Sabres' lean-but-mean hitter, was
the No. 40 pick in that '92 draft. The Bruins owned that pick
originally, but swapped it to Vancouver, and the Canucks eventually
shoveled Peca to the Sabres in the Alexander Mogilny trade . . .
The deal Peter Forsberg signed in Colorado last week will bring him
salaries of $8 million, $9 million, and $9.5 million the next three
years and a signing bonus of $3.5 million spread over the same
stretch. Where does that put a guy like Byron Dafoe? The Bruins'
sensational netminder wouldn't be out of line asking for annual pay
in the $4 million-$6 million range for two or three years. The
Bruins would be in a far bigger pickle without Dafoe than the
Avalanche would be sans Forsberg . . . Doctors say Eric Lindros,
who lost half his blood supply a couple of weeks ago when he
suffered a collapsed lung, already has recovered nearly all of
those three liters. Lindros hasn't granted interviews since his
release from a Nashville hospital, but there is no way he'll be
back for the first round. It's highly improbable that he'd be back
for anything but a final round _ and it's even more improbable that
the Flyers still will be hanging around by then . . . The
Hurricanes aren't likely to have their top power forward, Keith
Primeau, back at full strength for the playoffs. He's been nursing
a lower back strain that had him back in Ontario late last week
consulting a specialist. They're also down defenseman Sean Hill,
who suffered multiple fractures when he was hit in the face by a
slapper in Washington Wednesday night. He won't be back this year .
. . Former Bruin Bill Ranford couldn't stop a beach ball in
Washington or Tampa, but last week he ran his record to 3-0-1 since
getting swapped to the Red Wings. Remind anyone of Larry Murphy? He
was booed unmercifully in Toronto a couple of years ago and then
came to Detroit, where he now has two Cup rings to soothe whatever
wounds those boos caused him . . . I have this image: Gretzky
loosening up for 18 holes on some exotic golf course, with Steve
Kasper bolting out from behind a palm tree and knocking the club
out of his hands on the first tee.

BC'S CLOUD, BRZEZINSKI JOIN THE FUN 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-BOSTON COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They spent the day separated by one time
zone and thousands of miles, but Mike Cloud and his Boston College
teammate Doug Brzezinski were linked by an overwhelming sense of
relief after both were finally selected in Saturday's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   After the Patriots made BC center Damien Woody their initial
first-round draft choice with the 17th pick overall, Cloud, a
5-foot-10-inch, 202-pound All-American from Portsmouth, R.I., was
the second Eagle taken when Kansas City picked him in the second
round (54th overall) after swapping picks with Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brzezinski, a 6-4, 300-pounder from Livonia, Mich., who was
rated by some as the top guard in the draft, was taken by
Philadelphia in the third round (64th overall).
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, it ended an excruciatingly long wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed home and watched the first two rounds at home until 7
o'clock,'' said Cloud Saturday &UR;  &LR; night from his home. ``When they
switched it to ESPN2, we had to go and find a place to watch it,
because we didn't have it here at my house.''
</P>
<P>
   So Cloud hopped into a car with his girlfriend Julie Van Dorn,
his brother Kevin, and their good friend Jeff Macumber and drove
across the Rhode Island border to Fall River, Mass., to find a
restaurant that was showing the draft on ESPN2. Problem was, the
cell phone Cloud was using to remain in contact with NFL teams had
gone dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the signal for about 10 minutes and I started to get
nervous, because it was the number I'd given out to all the
teams,'' Cloud said. ``But once we crossed over into Mass., I
switched on the phone and it started ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Chiefs calling. The car pulled into an Applebee's in
Fall River, where Cloud remained on hold, waiting to be patched
into the Chiefs war room for a conference call with general manager
Carl Peterson and new coach Gunther Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out in the parking lot, standing in the cold, when they
told me that they were going to draft me,'' Cloud said. ``It's a
great opportunity. As my agent told me, it's not where you get
drafted but the position you're put in as far as the depth chart is
concerned, and I think Kansas City will give me the opportunity to
get my feet wet early.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud, who ranked as the Big East's leading rusher and No. 3 in
the nation last season after carrying 308 times for 1,726 yards and
14 TDs, said he will likely face some opposition from incumbents
Bam Morris, whose career has been plagued by off-field problems;
Donnell Bennett, a fifth-year pro from Miami; Jesse Haynes, a
product of Northwest Missouri State who signed as free agent two
years ago; and Rashaan Shehee, a 1998 third-round pick from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's really happy for me,'' Cloud said, referring to his
brother, whose own dreams of a pro football career were shattered
by a serious neck injury in his junior year at Portsmouth High.
``He knew in the back of his mind that KC was where I'd wind up.
But he's really excited because KC are his initials.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another interesting twist, Brzezinski, like former BC
teammate Mike Mamula, went from being an Eagle in college to being
an Eagle in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it planned out that way,'' Brzezinski deadpanned. ``I'm
just glad that I finally got picked. I thought the Eagles was the
team I'd wind up with because they had flown me down for an
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles waited until the third round to select
Brzezinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were calling the house, but they were calling for my
brother Nick,'' said Brzezinski, whose brother will be an freshman
tight end at Duke next season. ``I was about to throw the phone
right through the wall, to tell the truth. I thought I was screwed.
I didn't think I'd get picked. It just took so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski, who will likely battle George Hegamin and Melvin
Thomas for time at right guard, speculated the reason he went from
one of the draft's top prospects at guard to a third-rounder ``was
maybe because of some perceived lack of athleticism. I think that
hurt me a little bit. But it's no big deal. I'll just try and go in
and prove myself and do the best job I can.''

PATRIOTS FIND SOLUTION IN FAULK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They waited nearly seven hours. They
attempted to make deals, hoping to move up in the draft to get a
``franchise'' running back like Texas's Ricky Williams or Miami's
Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   None of it worked. Patriots coach Pete Carroll came out of the
``war room'' after two first-round selections yielded center Damien
Woody and linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer and said they were going to
``attack it'' in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a tremendous effort (to trade up),'' said Carroll, who
was hampered by the Patriots' low standing (20th and 28th) in the
first round. ``We were in on every one of the options that were
there for us. We had been workng on it continuously. But it just
kept on coming back that the teams just didn't want to go that far
down to lose that spot that they held.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, the Patriots would get what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting Louisiana State running back Kevin Faulk in the
second round, the Patriots came up with what they hope is a
solution to a running attack crippled by the possible career-ending
injury to Robert Edwards and the lack of production from any other
back on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Along with former Indianapolis running back Lamont Warren, whom
the Patriots signed as a free agent Saturday, the team now has a
pair of third down-type backs who will battle it out for the
featured role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like competition,'' said Carroll, ``we'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As Carroll stated earlier in the day, the Patriots had to go on
the offensive to get the 5-foot-8-inch, 205-pound all-purpose back
by making a deal with Tennessee, trading their second-round (52d)
and fourth-round pick (117th) to get the 46th overall pick and
select Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case with all of the running backs in this draft
other than Williams and James, Faulk brings some questions such as
size and durability. With his dimension, Faulk is not someone who
can carry an offense. But with Drew Bledsoe around, the Patriots do
not expect Faulk to do so.
</P>
<P>
   When Faulk came to LSU out of Carenco (La.) High School as a
quarterback, he came with potential All-America and Heisman Trophy
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   His role at LSU was a little simpler. He led the Tigers in
rushing, caught a few passes, and returned a few kicks. Nothing
changed the next two years, although a series of nagging injuries
brought the question of durability into focus.
</P>
<P>
   His responsibilities increased not only as a student, but as the
father of two children, Tanasha and Kevin.
</P>
<P>
   But Faulk stayed the course. He passed up what could have been
first-round money a year ago by staying at LSU as he went after his
degree as well as a future in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the fall from the first round was hard to accept
since he left LSU as the career leader in rushing (4,557 yards) and
touchdowns (46). He ranks second in school history with 856 carries
and is the only player to rush for over 1,000 yards three times in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   He closed out his career in Baton Rouge with an All America
season, gaining 1,279 yards on 229 carries for a 5.6-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   All of which begs a question. How did a running back with
impressive stats and 4.57 speed in the 40 drop to a mid-second
rounder?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in life, you look for the little button that makes you
go that extra mile,'' Faulk said by conference call
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. ``(Not getting picked in the first round) is the
one thing that's going to make my motor go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots made it clear early they were focused on Faulk.
Along with the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Giants, the
Patriots spent the most time evaluating Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came down and spent the day with me, watching me work
out,'' said Faulk, who spent the early part of Saturday playing
basketball rather than sitting in his apartment, waiting for the
phone to ring. ``I felt I had a good relationship with the running
back coach (Kirby Wilson).''
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked this kid a lot,'' said Carroll, who said the Patriots
considered selecting Faulk with their second pick in the first
round. ``What put him over the top (against BC running back Mike
Cloud, whom they also had rated high) was his return ability.
That's an area where he can contribute immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk's role with the Patriots will be as a running back/special
teams player. But he also likes to come out of the backfield and
catch passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up I loved playing wide receiver,'' said Faulk, who
said he patterned himself after Walter Payton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots will settle for Kevin Faulk.

FLORIDA'S GEORGE SEEN AS SAFETY VALVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He played cornerback last season at the
Univeristy of Florida, but that's not his natural position. Ask
Tony George what he likes about playing defensive back and he will
look you in the eye, smile, and talk about the contact.
</P>
<P>
   Not so much knocking down passes, but knocking down people.
After a long day and part of the night waiting to see what would
happen in Saturday's NFL draft, the 5-foot-10-inch, 198-pound
George learned he will be coming to New England.
</P>
<P>
   All of that became official when the Patriots used their
third-round pick (91st overall) to select George and add depth to a
secondary that already has some guys who like to get physical.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, George was diagnosed with diabetes. He didn't miss a
step as he accepted his condition and continued playing through
high school and into college, where he was a star for the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   George played cornerback last year because of injuries. Although
his speed may be a notch below average, he did fine with the Gators
because of an instinctive ability to sense where the ball was going
and a willingness to sacrifice his body.
</P>
<P>
   George's NFL career will no doubt mirror the early stages of his
time at Florida, when he arrived from Cincinnati and established
himself as a special teams performer, playing in every game and
leading the special teams unit with 34 tackles (22 solo).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play him as a safety,'' said Patriots coach
Pete Carroll. ``And he can cover the third wide receiver at
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he liked George's competitiveness and leadership
qualities. ``He played against top level competition and he's just
a tremendous kid,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his diabetes, George shrugged it off. ``It
really hasn't affected me,'' he said. ``I just go out and perform
the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   George conceded he had some trepidation as Saturday wore on and
he had not been selected. ``I'm happy to be drafted at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for where he plays in New England, that doesn't matter to
George either. ``I look at the position as defensive back,'' he
said. ``It doesn't matter whether you play safety or cornerback.
Just as long as you do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   He also will play special teams as he did at Florida. But the
important thing for George is he will be playing football.

KONRAD REWARDED FOR BEING PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-KONRAD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bob Konrad said the wait was the worst part,
but it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Konrad likened it to giving birth all over again.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rob Konrad? By 5 p.m., when the NFL draft had lapsed into
the second round, the Syracuse fullback decided to retreat to his
bedroom upstairs, away from the party at his North Andover home.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden chill descended upon the warm celebration when the
Miami Dolphins, who made overtures about drafting Konrad, instead
traded their first-round pick (24th overall) to San Francisco and
wound up picking Mississippi State running back James Johnson with
the 39th pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a curious move,'' said Bob Konrad, disappointed the
Dolphins didn't draft his son with their first-round pick. ``Who
knows what works in minds of those mastermind football braintrusts,
but we're just happy that it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half later, Konrad's long and excruciating wait
finally came to an end when, in the solace of his bedroom, he took
a call from Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson. Downstairs, the
partygoers fell silent when Miami traded its 54th pick in the
second round for Kansas City's 43d.
</P>
<P>
   Back upstairs, Johnson was telling Konrad he was going to be
Miami's next pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it was announced on TV,'' Konrad said, ``about 70 people
here were jumping for joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Konrad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a little warmer, huh?'' Konrad said,
referring to his move from Syracuse to Miami's tropical clime. ``It
was gettting a little heated there for a while. Waiting isn't too
much fun. Patience is one virtue that I don't have very much of. I
was a little concerned when they traded down, then picked a running
back with their first pick of the draft, but then they called and
said they were going to trade up and pick me.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom and dad are excited. My mom's excited about hitting the
beach and my dad's excited about me playing for Jimmy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, after all, has had some experience coaching fullbacks
from Syracuse after working with Daryl Johnston at Dallas, where he
was a featured element in the Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   With the numerous running backs now crowding Miami's backfield,
a question did arise about how Konrad would be utilized. Asked if
he was aware of Miami plans to use him at H-back or at tight end,
Konrad said, ``Not that I know of, but I won't be surprised if I'm
asked to do a couple of different things. I'll be happy to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Leary, Konrad's coach at St. John's Prep, was one of the
celebrants at the Konrad household. ``It's the first time since
I've been coaching that we've had a kid going in the draft,'' he
said. ``When I had Rob, he was our horse and we rode his back for a
number of years. When he went to Syracuse, I thought he'd be a
better football player. The thing that people didn't understand
about Rob is that he can catch the ball, and now he's going to a
team with a Hall of Fame quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Konrad was the sixth Big East player taken in the draft (43d
overall) and third player from his school after quarterback Donovan
McNabb (Philadelphia, 2d overall) and wide receiver Kevin Johnson
(Cleveland, 32d).
</P>
<P>
   Konrad said he was surprised by the reaction Philadelphia fans
had when McNabb was selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they wouldn't want him,'' Konrad said. ``The
kid is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand where they're coming from, but I don't think
it was directed at Donovan, it was more at the team for who they
didn't pick.''

GIAFFONE EARNS POLE IN INDY LIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The past five seasons have been fruitless
for Felipe Giaffone, as far as finding pole positions. Don't be
misled. The 24-year-old Brazilian has been a solid professional
driver, but his last pole position was in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That was until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giaffone found Long Beach fruitful and took the pole position in
the Indy Lights Championship in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long
Beach. Giaffone's best lap was 1:07.668 at an average speed of
97.038.
</P>
<P>
   So Giaffone finished first for the second consecutive day in the
racing series considering the final steppingstone to the CART FedEx
Championship. This finish by Giaffone may have been more impressive
than Friday's because each of the 19 drivers in Indy Lights
improved his best-lap time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I had to improve my car because everybody was
trying to,'' Giaffone said. ``But I knew at the same time I had a
really good car, so I didn't have to make any big changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Giaffone fell out of the pole position twice, but reclaimed the
position both times. First, with about 24 minutes remaining in the
30-minute qualifying session, Guy Smith took first, but three
minutes later Giaffone reclaimed it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 18 minutes left, Jonny Kane took first, but Giaffone
reclaimed the position with 13 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Giaffone is the driver to beat in today's Indy Lights Race,
which starts at 10:20 a.m. If Giaffone wins, he would become the
third consecutive Brazilian to take the checkered flag in Indy
Lights at Long Beach. Cristiano da Matta won last year and Helio
Castro-Neves won the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's Indy Lights Race, Didier Andre claimed the pole
position. On Saturday, Andre showed the biggest improvements of any
racer and finished third with a best lap of 1:08.025 at 96.529 mph.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's practice session, Andre finished 14th. He finished
seventh in Friday's qualifier and fifth and third in Saturday's
practice round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that means I'll be first (today),'' Andre said.
</P>
<P>
   Andre had a few new strategies Saturday. His crew put on new
tires Friday, and he used only a half tank of gas to improve speed.
That tactic worked, but he ran out of gas and exited the race with
about five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my best lap, then ran out of fuel,'' Andre said. ``My
car started to go `putt, putt' at the end of the straight, and that
was it.''
</P>
<P>
   That actually was good timing for Andre as the qualifier ended
prematurely when its only incident forced the conclusion. With 3:23
left, a red flag went up when Geoff Boss hit a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Jonny Kane finished the highest of any rookie. This is in
contrast of the first Indy Lights event last month in Homestead,
Fla., in which two rookies finished first and third.

SEAT SQUIRMING AT LOUDON

 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bob Bahre, the 72-year-old owner of New Hampshire
International Speedway in Loudon, would prefer to go about his
business in a neighborly fashion. And, for the most part, he has
done just that, establishing a good rapport with community leaders
and state officials while bringing in a new source of revenue to
the Granite State with his 83,000-seat mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   In three weeks, Bahre will swing the gates open when NHIS hosts
a season-opening doubleheader, a 200-lap NASCAR Busch Series event
and a 100-lap Busch North race. But plans to expand the track's
capacity by 9,000 seats have been put on hold, as Bahre has been
hit with a lawsuit from a group of citizens in the neighboring town
of Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put up 1,200 of 9,000 and stopped when they brought the
lawsuit,'' said Bahre, who has retained the Boston firm of Hale and
Dorr to fight the suit. ``So we actually want to put up 7,800 more.
We got the permits from the state and from the town of Loudon, but
there were, oh, about 10-12 people over in Canterbury who brought
the suit. They just don't like traffic. They don't like noise.
Those kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we get along fairly well with the neighbors. We
always get somebody that complains a little bit, but these people
in Canterbury and Shakerville, they really just don't like racing
and they don't like race fans. There's been racing here since 1963
and they're complaining about the noise during the week from
practice and tryouts. We've done tests and it isn't that bad. We've
gone up to Shaker Village and you can't hardly hear it at times.
Sometimes you can when the wind blows just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just continue to go into court and, eventually, we'll
make it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since he opened the track in 1990 that
expansion has been impeded by a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while you'll get somebody on a planning board who
will go and (complain),'' said Bahre, whose track was wildly
received by fans, sanctioning officials, and competitors when he
staged a successful inaugural NASCAR Winston Cup race in 1993.
``Most of the people are for it and they know it's good for the
economy and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these people, they're all wealthy people and they don't
care about anybody else and that's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, I hate fights and that kind of stuff, but
we're going to stay right in there and fight with them. It's a lot
nicer if you can do things without having to fight and everything.
It doesn't get me down, but I sure don't like it. You would just
like to go forward and do things, and be friendly people and have
things work right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a bunch of hard feelings, I mean, who the
hell wants those? We don't need it. All this lawsuit stuff, nobody
enjoys it and it's one of those deals where nobody really wins.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;

   Asked how he felt about not having to stage an Indy Racing
League event, Bahre seemed to express immense relief when he sighed
and said, ``Thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahre was among the first track owners to defect from
Championship Auto Racing Teams and join the fledgling racing series
founded by Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, citing dwindling crowds and mounting losses,
Bahre parted ways with the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since we went with the IRL, we lost money every year,''
said Bahre, who estimated his total losses from IRL events to be
$1.6 million-$1.7 million. ``But when we went in with Tony, we told
Tony that we'd stick with him for three years, and we had to do
what we said we would do. In fact, we budgeted to lose $500,000
(last year) and we couldn't even stay in budget; we lost
$700,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahre made one startling admission: ``I'll admit that we made a
mistake when we didn't stay with CART. CART is not perfect, but I
know we would've done a little better with CART than we did with
this one. But they've got to get together someday.''

   IRL driver Greg Ray, who put an underfunded car on the front row
in last year's Indianapolis 500, looks to be a strong contender for
the pole position this year after he topped the speed chart during
an open test session last weekend at the Brickyard with a fast lap
of 227.072 miles per hour. ``We ran two different cars and three
different suspensions, and we did pretty good,'' said Ray, now a
driver for Team Menard. ``We still have not put the car anywhere
near qualifying trim. The conditions were just really good. When
you go out and scrub tires at 225, you know the conditions are
great.'' . . . Adrian Fernandez, who won last week's CART FedEx
series race at Motegi, Japan, will switch formulas when he trades
his proven Reynard for a Swift chassis in Sunday's Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach on a reconfigured 1.85-mile street circuit. ``We
don't know much about the Swift with the new configuration on road
courses, so I am going to have to get used to how this car
reacts,'' said Fernandez, who qualified among the top four drivers
in each of the season's first two races in his Tecate/Quaker
State-sponsored Reynard. ``We are on a roll right now and I am
confident that the team will make the maximum effort to make the
car as competitive as possible. I just have to go out and drive the
car to the best of my abilities. Hopefully, with the new
improvements to the car, we can produce a good result.'' . . .
Winston Cup driver Rusty Wallace debuted a new car in stunning
fashion when he dominated last weekend's Food City 500 at Bristol,
Tenn., leading 425 of 500 laps from the pole position. It was his
first victory of the season and 49th of his career and moved him
into eighth in the point standings, which Jeff Burton continues to
lead with 1,064 headed into Sunday's Goody's 500 at Martinsville,
Va. ``That was a pretty cool deal for our team at Bristol,'' said
Wallace, who'll debut another new car at Martinsville. ``When you
stop and think about it, it was pretty incredible that we were able
to take a brand new car _ a car that had never seen a lap on a
racetrack until last Friday _ win the pole, and then kick butt like
we did there on Sunday.''

AYALA STARTS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tony Ayala comes home this week.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years of incarceration, one of the most talented boxers
of the 1980s will be released from Bayside State Prison in
Leesburg, N.J., Tuesday, and two days later he will begin what may
prove to be a quixotic quest for a return to boxing glory when he
meets the media at the home of his former prison psychologist and
present fight manager, Brian Raditz.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala has served hard time for a long time on a 1983 rape
conviction, for a crime he once tried to deny he committed but now
sadly admits he did. During his long years away, Ayala searched his
soul and his psyche, became a new man after finally telling Raditz
that he had been sexually abused as a child and silently carried
the shame inside him fearing his family's reaction if they ever
learned the truth. Slowly, he turned himself not only into a model
citizen but also into a prison counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ayala was a fighter filled with so much hate and fire that
he spit on one fallen opponent and destroyed many. He was widely
expected to be a sure thing to annihilate World Boxing Association
junior middleweight champion Davey Moore, but he was arrested a
month before that scheduled fight and his life was forever altered.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ayala hopes to somehow get his boxing life back despite the
long layoff and the years of working through the internal problems
that had made him a madman in and out of the ring. Many wonder
whether Ayala will be the same destructive machine he once was.
</P>
<P>
   Among his advisers is veteran promoter Don Elbaum, who
acknowledges that no one can predict what will happen when Ayala
steps back into the ring, but he hopes to find out by July in
Ayala's native San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony would do 25,000-30,000 (people) if he fought me,'' Elbaum
said. ``In fact, the way some people talk about me, he might do
more if he fights me. The way the boxing market is today, you get
two or three wins and, like it or not, you'll be on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see him have a couple of fights off TV if that's
possible just to get his confidence back and get him comfortable,
and then maybe you put him in with a Hector Camacho or Roberto
Duran, and if he wins you go for the big payday.''
</P>
<P>
   To Elbaum, to Ayala, to everybody really, that payday is
obvious. It is a Hispanic confrontation with Oscar De La Hoya. It
is The Golden Boy against the Bull, El Muchacho de Oro vs. El
Torito. If there is a bigger fight in boxing in the next year or
two, Elbaum can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said in a Sport magazine interview this month that he
dreams of standing bloody and battered over De La Hoya after
knocking him out. Certainly the fighter he once was would have been
capable of that. But that was 16 years ago, a time when De La Hoya
was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, only makes such a confrontation all the more
theatric and all the more saleable, as Elbaum knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of some heavyweight fight, absolutely the biggest
fight in 2000 would be Tony Ayala vs. Oscar De La Hoya,'' Elbaum
said. ``When he was young he was the most exciting kid I ever saw.
It would be a huge fight. It would do awesome numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely it would if Ayala can get himself a half-dozen wins,
especially if several are of the spectacular knockout variety he
was once so famous for.
</P>
<P>
   But could he beat someone with De La Hoya's youth, speed, and
power after 16 years locked away from a ring?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's been taking care of himself,'' Elbaum said. ``He's
about 170 and says he can make 154. When he didn't get out about
eight months ago when he thought he would, he had a bout with
depression; but he's over that. He's been working out inside, and
he believes he can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Belief is half the battle in boxing, but the calendar is often
the other half and few fighters have ever beaten that for long.
Maybe a 36-year-old Tony Ayala will be one of the few.
</P>

   HBO finally got the front end of its June 19 show worked out by
cutting Michael Grant's pay by $500,000 to convince Lou Saverese to
fight him for $1.05 million while Grant gets $950,000, but then the
semi-main event fell apart when Ike Ibeabuchi decided $500,000
wasn't enough to match punches with Jeremy Williams. No wonder HBO
Sports senior vice president for sports programming Lou DiBella has
a perpetual headache . . . Speaking of Ibeabuchi, veteran trainer
Teddy Atlas wonders whether the boxing world has made too much of
the undefeated Ibeabuchi's knockout of Chris Byrd March 20. ``My
instinct says we're getting carried away with it,'' said Atlas, who
trains heavyweight prospect Kirk Johnson. ``Byrd was a small
heavyweight who couldn't punch enough to keep the guy off him.
There were always doubts about how Chris would handle a big
heavyweight that could hit him. Give Ibeabuchi credit. He caught
Byrd on the ropes, which is difficult to do, and took him out, but
we'll see what Ibeabuchi does when he gets in with some big
heavyweights. And you shouldn't forget, he's a nut outside the
ring. We'll see if the things that have been a problem before for
him'' _ manic depression, according to some _ ``become a problem
again.'' . . . Although Ibeabuchi would have been favored, he
wasn't in Williams's mind. ``I'm going to beat Ike every minute of
every round,'' Williams said before Ibeabuchi rejected the $500,000
payday. ``He can't beat me. He's a nut job. He can't adapt in the
ring. His mind is all over the place.'' . . . By the way,
Ibebuchi's promoter, Cedric Kushner, continues to insist that
Ibeabuchi will agree to the fight but has refused to pay for
insurance to cover the promoters and HBO if he doesn't show up . .
. Bob Arum plans to bring De La Hoya into the not-yet-completed
Staples Center in Los Angeles in December for a major pay-per-view
show. The building will not be ready until October, but Arum
already has a deal in place for De La Hoya to become the building's
first fight. He is hoping to put on a rematch with Ike Quartey or
Pernell Whitaker, assuming a mega-fight with International Boxing
Federation welterweight champion Felix Trinidad cannot be worked
out . . . Everyone has a point of view when it comes to World
Boxing Organization featherweight champion Naseem Hamed, but
perhaps no one has one like heavyweight champion George Foreman's.
While Foreman was watching Hamed stop Paul Ingle in 11 rounds in
Manchester, England, last week, he said, ``I like what he did right
there. He did something stupid, and that's what he does best.'' . .
. In case you missed it (and I hope you did), on the Hamed-Ingle
undercard, 40-year-old Thomas Hearns won the little-known IBO
cruiserweight title with a unanimous decision over 35-year-old Nate
Miller, who agreed to come out of retirement to be Hearns's dance
partner. Miller clearly did not come to fight and, frankly, neither
man really could anymore. But Hearns's appearance was still a treat
for British boxing fans. It was his first in England. ``I'll be
back,'' said Hearns (59-4-1). You have to hope not if you remember
him when he was still The Hit Man . . . IBF junior featherweight
champion Vuyani Bungu is ready to vacate his title because of
weight problems and move up to the 126-pound class. He, like every
featherweight, would like to pursue Hamed. It is expected that
Benedict Ledwaba and John Johnson will box off for the vacant
122-pound title.

SKATER'S CASE ISN'T ROUTINE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The sexual misconduct grievance filed last week against
skating coach Richard Callaghan is a hot potato nobody wants to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   The US Figure Skating Association, which already knew about
allegations that Callaghan had an inappropriate relationship with a
teenage male pupil two decades ago, is expected to decide that it
has no jurisdiction because Callaghan wasn't a member at the time.
The Detroit Skating Club, where Callaghan and accuser Craig Maurizi
were coaching partners, says that the incidents occurred before the
men worked there. Which leaves the Professional Skaters
Association, which could expel Callaghan if it deems him guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that it's a nasty ``he says-he says'' case with
no apparent witnesses and with Callaghan vehemently denying
everything. It's complicated by the fact that Maurizi waited more
than 20 years to come forward and did so only after he and
Callaghan had a bitter professional split over Tara Lipinski last
year.

   If there is still skepticism about how seriously the
International Olympic Committee is about reforming itself, it may
be because president Juan Antonio Samaranch is dragging his feet
naming the special commission that is supposed to recommend
dramatic across-the-board changes. A month after the special IOC
session in Lausanne and less than two months before the next
session in Seoul where the 2006 winter site will be chosen,
Samaranch has appointed only half a dozen of the 24 members and
four of them are Americans _ IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz, US
Olympic Committee president William Hybl, former Los Angeles
Olympics chief Peter Ueberroth, and former US Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger. That's why some critics believe that the Lords
will merely spin their wheels until the world loses interest. ``I
think we'll see a great flurry of activity, with some discussion of
how they may change slightly how people are chosen and maybe some
term limits,'' says John Hancock president David D'Alessandro.
``Then Samaranch will declare victory and exit. That looks like the
plan here. I don't think you're going to see a great culture
change.'' Stickiest issue among the proposed reforms is how new
members will be chosen. The Lords aren't wild about having
international federations or national Olympic committees doing the
picking and they're aghast at the idea of governments having a say.
``The independence we've had has allowed us to survive,'' insists
vice president Richard Pound of Canada. ``I voted against the
Moscow boycott in spite of the fact that my government wanted that
to happen. If I had been appointed by the Canadian government, I'd
have been toast in a nanosecond.'' . . . While camera-ready US
senators are pounding the IOC on Capitol Hill, there's a tiff
brewing at home between the USOC and the Salt Lake organizers that
could affect the athletes. With sponsors slow to sign on in the
wake of the payoff scandal and SLOC facing a $300 million budget
shortfall, new chief Mitt Romney has drawn up an $84 million chop
list that includes $5 million that was supposed to help fund
operations at the Utah Winter Sports Park where American bobbers,
lugers, and jumpers were counting on training for the 2002 Games.
The park, built with public money and run by a state authority, was
supposed to be turned over to SLOC last week but the transfer was
put on hold for 90 days while options are weighed. Meanwhile,
there's behind-the-scenes wrangling over whether SLOC, whose
original bid officials were responsible for the worst scandal in
Olympic history, should have to ante up toward the $9 million the
USOC is spending to restore its image and make structural changes.
``Everything can't be laid at Salt Lake's feet to solve,'' says
Romney.

   Don't expect to see synchronized (i.e. precision) skating in the
Olympics until the International Skating Union figures it's ready
for prime time. ``They have to improve,'' says ISU president
Ottavio Cinquanta. ``It is not a criticism, it is an assessment.
They are not at the level the ISU expects, but they will be soon.''
Nor will the ISU stage figure and synchronized skating at the same
championships, as some have suggested. ``If you sell two products
once, you get money for one product,'' Cinquanta says. ``If you
sell them twice, you get more money.'' . . . Despite their
last-place group finish last year, the US men's ice hockey team got
a decent draw for next month's world championships in Norway.
They'll face the Japanese and Austrians before meeting the Czechs,
the defending bronze medalists. If the international federation
moves future events to February, it could be the last time the
Yanks have NHLers or collegians on the team . . . Dramatically
improved showing by the US curlers at the recent world
championships in New Brunswick. The women, eighth last year, won
the silver medal and the men moved up from sixth to fourth. The
Swedes took the women's crown for the third time in five years. The
Scots, who hadn't won the men's title since 1991, knocked off the
Canadians, who'd taken five of the last six . . . Though some folks
advised her to stick to skating and delay college, Michelle Kwan
says she'll take a full course load at UCLA this fall and still
prepare for the 2002 Olympics. ``I can't put skating on hold, nor
do I want to be a 26-year-old freshman,'' says Kwan, who'll be 19
in July. ``The key part is, when I'm skating I can't think about
school and when I'm in school I can't think about skating.'' . . .
Look for Todd Eldredge to bypass the Olympic-eligible circuit again
next winter, but return in 2001 to prepare for a possible third
Winter Games. ``Maybe I'll come back full force and do the whole
deal and be re-energized to make a run at it again,'' says the
five-time US champion. The X factor will be how high the technical
bar will have been raised by then (i.e. how many quadruple jumps
will be necessary). ``I would come back if I felt I could be
competitive and be able to do what I needed to do,'' says Eldredge,
who'll be 29 in 2001. ``If I didn't feel I could do that . . .''

   No, Mark McGwire didn't get his Olympic baseball number (41)
retired for what he did at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. McGwire,
who won a silver medal along with teammates such as Will Clark,
Barry Larkin, B.J. Surhoff, and Billy Swift, batted only .190 (4
for 21 in five games) and hit no homers . . . Terrific new book
(``Awaken the Olympian Within'') by 1976 swimming gold medalist
John Naber, who collected motivational stories from more than two
dozen Olympians ranging from Dan Jansen to Valerie Brisco-Hooks and
including local athletes Mike Eruzione, Eric Flaim, and Tim
Daggett.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Was 30-1 shot Valhol hit with a ``buzzer'' on the way
to winning the $500,000 Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park April 10?
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas State Racing Commission has begun an investigation,
with the probe centering on whether Valhol's rider, Billy Patin,
used an electrical device during the race. Valhol, who is trained
by Dallas Keen, had started only twice and had not won. He captured
the Arkansas Derby with ease, dominating the stretch run to score
by 4 1/2 lengths and return $68.
</P>
<P>
   Commission chairman Cecil Alexander confirmed that an Oaklawn
employee had found a battery on the track after the race, but he
declined to explain why Patin was the focus of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a most serious offense, so I'd rather not say anything
until the inquiry goes forward,'' said Alexander, who held a
meeting on the matter Thursday. ``If we did not feel there was
evidence, we would not be having this meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   To call Patin ``obscure,'' would be a compliment. Going into the
Arkansas Derby, he had nine wins from 120 mounts this year. A
regular on the Louisiana circuit, Patin was 34-673 last year. Patin
was scheduled to ride one horse at Lone Star Park in Texas Thursday
night, but he took off the mount.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has the right to redistribute the purse. If the
$300,000 Valhol won in the Arkansas Derby is taken away, it is
possible that he would not qualify to run in the Kentucky Derby at
Churchill Downs May 1. The Kentucky Derby is limited to 20
starters, based on earnings in graded stakes races, and Valhol had
only $38,400 in graded earnings entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope to have this resolved before the Kentucky
Derby because it is so important to racing,'' said Alexander. ``We
feel we are part of the Triple Crown and we are pleased to have
Kentucky Derby nominees go through Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>

   Wondertross, second in the Florida Derby at Gulfstream March 13
but sixth in the Blue Grass at Keeneland April 10, will not run in
the Kentucky Derby. Wondertross was found to be suffering from
colic following the Blue Grass and was sent to the Hagyard Equine
Hospital to be treated. Trainer Nick Zito, who conditions the son
of Chief's Crown for co-owners William Condren and George
Steinbrenner, got Wondertross back to his Keeneland barn Thursday
but decided there was not enough time left to train him properly
for the Derby. ``Unless the colt is 100 percent, none of us want to
run him,'' said Condren. Zito indicated that the Preakness at
Pimlico May 15 remains a possibility . . . Desert Hero, winner of
the San Rafael Feb. 28 (in only the second start of his career) but
third in the Santa Anita Derby April 3, was not entered in Sunday's
Lexington Stakes at Keeneland, but instead will be trained up to
the Derby. ``I was thinking I wanted to get another prep into him,
but we decided it would be best to train up to the Derby like I was
thinking after the Santa Anita Derby,'' said Richard Mandella, who
conditions the son of Sea Hero for The Thoroughbred Corp. ``We
thought we could get him a little more experience with another prep
race, but we want him to go to the Kentucky Derby sound and
healthy.'' . . . Zito won't have Wondertross in the Derby, but he
has a decent chance with Stephen Got Even. The son of A.P. Indy is
being trained up to the Derby after winning the Gallery Furniture
at Turfway March 27, and he went 5 furlongs in 1:02 2/5 at
Churchill Thursday. ``I think he went really well,'' said assistant
trainer Frank Allen. ``The exercise rider said he did it really
easy, and that he liked the track. I know he came out of it real
good, knock on wood.'' The chances of Stephen Got Even were
enhanced considerably by the recent announcement that he will be
ridden by Chris McCarron in the Derby.

   Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky Derby last year, will make
his second start of 1999 Sunday in the Texas Mile at Lone Star.
Real Quiet was held out of the Oaklawn Handicap because his
trainer, Bob Baffert, did not like the weights. ``Every time I've
been to Lone Star, they've given me money,'' said Mike Pegram, who
owns Real Quiet. ``I've run there three times, and hit the board
every time.'' Real Quiet will go from Lone Star, near Dallas, to
Baltimore for the Pimlico Special May 8. ``The Texas Mile will set
him up perfectly for the Pimlico Special,'' said Baffert. At
Pimlico, Real Quiet will face Santa Anita Handicap winner Free
House, currently the top-ranked thoroughbred in the country. Free
House, who is training at Hollywood Park, went 5 furlongs in 1:01
last Monday . . . Pegram also owns Silverbulletday, trained by
Baffert and considered the top 3-year-old filly in the nation. It
has not yet been decided whether she will run in the Kentucky Oaks
April 30 or the Derby. On Monday, she worked a half in :48 2/5 at
Churchill under Robbie Albarado, one of the leading riders in
Kentucky. ``I thought it was an awesome work,'' said Albarado.
``They wanted to go easy with her. She gets over the track great;
she loves it here.'' . . . One filly who will definitely run in the
Derby is Three Ring, who was dominant at Gulfstream this winter and
captured the Bonnie Miss Stakes. Owner Barry Schwartz confirmed
recently that the Oaks was out and the Derby was in for Three Ring,
who will be ridden by John Velazquez. ``John rode her in her last
two starts, both impressive victories, so naturally we are excited
about the decision,'' said Schwartz. Velazquez chose Three Ring
over Lemon Drop Kid, whom he rode to a fifth-place finish in the
Blue Grass.

<P>
   NEWMARKET, N.H. _ Gazing out from her massive deck toward Great
Bay, the warm spring sun on her bare arms and a pair of snow geese
flapping over the tidal marshlands she calls her backyard, Lynn
Jennings explains why she took up duck hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole romantic thing,'' said Jennings, the Harvard,
Mass., native whose long career as a distance runner has been one
of the most successful in history. ``The boat, dawn, watching the
sun come up _ it comes up right over there, the whole sky fuses
pink every morning _ the sounds, the smells, the breezes. When it's
rainy, it's harsh; all those elemental things. I thrive on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as conversation drifts to the general joys of solitude,
she chuckles and says, ``I grew up as a teen-ager believing I was
going to be Katharine Hepburn: She wore pants when no one else did,
she was smart, she was her own woman. I absolutely thought I was
going to be Katharine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I still can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like Hepburn, that other Yankee icon, Jennings is nothing
if not her own woman: elemental, sometimes harsh as a cold rain at
daybreak, sometimes pleasant as a breeze across the bay. And
always, regardless of the consequences, true to herself.
</P>
<P>
   So Monday, Jennings will stand at the starting line of the
Boston Marathon her own woman indeed, finally making her
long-awaited official marathon debut after two decades of
brilliance at lesser distances. And woe, she warned, to anyone who
says, ``But you're 38 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the rules? Where is it written down?'' she demanded.
``It's like saying you're supposed to have a baby when you're 25,
you're supposed to get married at this time, you're supposed to
have this kind of job at this age. Those are expectations that
people somehow want to adhere to. But why? Life is out there and
you have to shape it how you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Single again after a six-year marriage, Jennings had planned to
run Boston last year. But on April 1, she pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not doing the work necessary,'' she said. ``The passion
just somehow wasn't in place. There was nothing heroic being done
with the training, and that's a far cry from this winter. My
sister, who is my touchstone in every single way, told me she was
having nightmares. She was really, really relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a mistake,'' affirmed her longtime coach,
John Babington. ``Lynn is a great runner in large part because of
her mental powers, and on occasion that eludes her. The marathon
last year just took place at a time when she needed a break from it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, said Jennings, ``I'm loving everything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few breaks of their own, Babington and Jennings have been
together since he rushed up after seeing her ``charge out of
nowhere looking sort of untrained and raw'' to take second in the
mile in 5:12 at the Massachusetts high school state track meet in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something told me that here was a precocious talent,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She started to train with Babington's all-female Liberty
Athletic Club three days later, and in less than a year became the
first high school girl in the state to break five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But when she was 17, coach and pupil had a falling out over
Jennings's determination to run, yes, the Boston Marathon. She was
a year too young to get a bib number, and Babington didn't want her
to do it, but she wanted to and so she did. Her 2:46 would have
been good enough for third place had she been an official entrant;
what it got her was a 10-year split from her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an impulsive adolescent, being told not to do it by
John,'' listed Jennings as her reasons for wanting to run. ``I'd
been accepted to Princeton; I was just stretching my wings.''
</P>
<P>
   They were soon clipped. First, there was arthroscopic surgery on
her knee to repair a meniscus damaged in the race (the only injury
she's ever had); then, she retired three times during a spotty
collegiate career that too often found her overweight and confused.
By 1988, however, she had made her first Olympic team at 10,000
meters; after finishing what to her was a disappointing sixth, she
asked Babington to coach her again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got back together in 1989,'' said Babington, a
Cambridge, Mass., attorney, ``it was with a sense of some
unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Jennings won the first of three consecutive World
Cross-Country championships, catapulting her into the upper echelon
of the sport. According to a statistical analysis by Ken Young for
Analytical Distance Runner, in Jennings's 243 lifetime races she
has 143 wins, and has placed either first, second, or third 205
times for an 84.2 percent success rate, among the best in history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 alone, Jennings won her third World Cross-Country title
at muddy Franklin Park in March, an Olympic bronze medal at 10,000
meters in Barcelona, and broke the course record in the Falmouth
Road Race, among other triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   And in what is perhaps the most remarkable statistic of her
career, Jennings has won at least one national title every year for
15 years, the most recent just last month at 15 kilometers in the
Gate River Run in Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jennings has not endeared herself to her competitors,
who often complain she is unpleasant, even ungracious. Both
Babington and Jennings are well aware of the image.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Jennings arrives in town for a race, Babington
explained, ``She's temporarily antisocial and intensely private,
not smiling and greeting people. So what her competitors see most
of is the prerace version of herself. Some of them interpret that
as Lynn being a basically cold, unfriendly person.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, if she wins _ which she usually does _ her postrace
comments tend to be blunt: If she thinks she didn't have any
competition, she'll say so, taking what Babington calls ``visible
pride'' in her accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a confident winner,'' he said. ``She's not meek enough,
humble enough, the way people expect a woman athlete to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, he said, ``does not put on insincere social airs in
any way. She's the exact opposite of a phony.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Benoit Samuelson understands the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs to do what she feels she needs to do,'' explained
Samuelson. ``If that means putting on a game face, alienating or
not warming up to her competition, that's what she needs to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To tell the truth, said Jennings, most people on the racing
circuit just don't know her.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't open the door very much, either,'' she
acknowledged. ``That's the way I like to approach the competitive
part. I go to races to do a job. I'm focused, I'm aloof, I'm
separate. That's the way it works for me. I've reaped results with
that approach and I'm not about to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   And ferocious. Jayne Winsor, a Newmarket neighbor, recalled the
first time she saw Jennings compete, at the 1992 World
Cross-Country Championships in Franklin Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was scary,'' said Winsor, an elementary school teacher.
``She's a friend, so I'm used to her friend face and there she was
at work and it didn't have the soft walking-the-dog face that I'm
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is also a huge fan favorite, especially among women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a recipient of that my entire career,'' she said.
``There must be something about seeing a woman moving, competing,
being strong, being fearless that triggers something in other
women. I think they would like a little piece of that emotional
resilience and courage, and that strength and bravery. If that's
what I give to women, what a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fans will number in the tens, perhaps hundreds, of
thousands Monday. Samuelson, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist from
Maine who won here in 1979 and 1983, said Jennings having the crowd
on her side could be worth a couple of minutes in her favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to be said for running in an environment you
feel at home in,'' said one who should know.
</P>
<P>
   There was never a question, not a doubt, that once Jennings
decided to move up to the marathon, Boston would be the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching Billy (Rodgers) stop and tie his shoes,''
she recounted. ``I remember seeing Kim Merritt win and Joan and
Rosa (Mota) and watching Grete (Waitz) drop out; I mean, every
single story on the women, I know. I was taking it all in when I
was 14. Every single time Boston happened it resonated with me.
There was no question it would be the one.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she added, ``At this juncture, the biggest stuff gets
me excited. The small stuff doesn't. I've been everywhere, I've
done everything. I need the emotional punch, and Boston provides
that for me.''

 MARATHON-MCVEIGH-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He is all New York, Joe McVeigh. Works downtown in the
financial district, has a habit of whipping out his ``good luck''
Yankees hat after every marathon he runs. His Brooklynese accent
and gift for quips could have landed him a part on ``Seinfeld,''
and every November he finds himself in a human tide 30,000 strong
that runs in the New York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   But McVeigh, who left the Big Apple only for a college stint at
Lehigh, says of the Boston Marathon: ``It is without a doubt the
most quality marathon in the US. I liken Boston to the Masters in
golf, and not just because they both happen in April. It has the
gravity of tradition and an unchanged course.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 35-year-old McVeigh finished 17th at Boston in a
personal-best 2 hours, 16 minutes, 48 seconds, the fastest US
finisher. But considering that he was more than nine minutes behind
the Kenyans who finished 1-2, McVeigh turns on the self-deprecating
quip gun:
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my office say, `Wow, you must be the best runner in
the US,' but I say, `No, not the best by a long shot, but just
happy to be sitting in the chair that got the lucky award at the
stadium that day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This year, he says, the pressure is on him to surpass last
year's time, a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh is somewhat of a throwback as far as marathoners go.
Instead of earning his living at the sport, he makes the daily
commute to the city from his Summit, N.J., home and manages to work
out a training schedule around his job as an international
researcher for a large investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   He eschews the sleek Lycra running suits for loose cotton
fabrics and wears another talisman baseball hat with the logo of
his favorite downtown bar (now closed) during marathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of old school,'' says McVeigh. ``I like the baggy
sweats. I like my `Lucy's Retired Surfers' Bar' cap for good luck.
I wore it in my first marathon and did OK, so I've worn it in every
marathon since, except one. And I bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does McVeigh shave for a few days before the race, another
superstition. ``To look meaner,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   None of his old-school ways makes him feel part of the big-time
elite runner scene, despite the fact that he has run both New York
and Boston the last four years and placed first in the LBI 18-mile
run and the Millburn 10K, both in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last decade, marathoning has been dominated by
foreign runners, mostly from Kenya. Thus, many top US runners opt
for marathons like Pittsburgh that award cash prizes only to US
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best Americans, guys who could be the headliners,
chickened out and have gone to Pittsburgh,'' says McVeigh. ``They
continually duck the two biggest races of the year _ Boston and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys trying to make a living with their legs find it
very difficult to pass up (Pittsburgh). You could run a fantastic
Boston Marathon, even set a national record, and walk away without
a check. It doesn't make sense in the short-term, economic,
rational thinking. In a way it subsidizes mediocrity and that's
tough to get by on for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that the Kenyans, Ethiopians, and Japanese
have a stronghold on most of the elite races throughout the world,
and a remedy for US runners is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're outnumbered in a fight, like an American runner
running against Kenyans and Ethiopians, who are so fantastic, you
just slug the biggest guy and try to run the best you can,'' says
McVeigh. ``You may get whupped by the world's top talent, but you
try. That's Boston for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh believes that the sport is cyclical, and that US runners
will get their chance again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say never,'' he says. ``Americans in the
marathon could take a quantum leap up in quality and depth if some
of our better distance runners who have been concentrating on 10Ks
made the attempt to run just one marathon a year. The training
doesn't have to change all that much in order to support an
excellent marathon run.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about the time when McVeigh recovers from the Boston
Marathon, it's time, he says, ``to get religion again,'' and begin
training for New York in the fall. While there is much bantering
between the cities in all sports, McVeigh says in the marathon
there's room for both, and they are as different as golf
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boston is the Masters,'' he says, ``then New York is the US
Open. It's a little more rough and tumble. The course is a tougher
one to play. It's a big up-in-your-face event. It's loud and brassy
with a huge field. But Boston has that air about it, that
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``And thank God for John Hancock. When sponsorship came in, it
could have become the Chuckie Cheese Marathon or something. But it
has retained its class. Just like the city itself.''

TANUI KING OF THE HILLS 
</HEADLINE>
 MARATHON-TANUI-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The first traces of dawn are not yet apparent out there
in Eldoret, in the Rift Valley in the west of Kenya, when Moses
Tanui sets out from his farm on his first training run of the day.
It is dark. The scene illustrates what has been termed ``the
loneliness of the long-distance runner.'' How can you see at this
time? ``You can see the ground,'' responds Tanui.
</P>
<P>
   Golfing legend Ben Hogan used to imply that you carve out your
game from the earth, the turf, the soil. You put in your hours
striking golf balls, you sacrifice. Tanui takes it to a different
level. He is a child of the Kenyan countryside, one of the world's
elite marathoners. Tanui is a father of three, a gentleman farmer,
a runner.
</P>
<P>
   When he is kidded about being called the Mayor of Eldoret, he
laughs. He is a quiet man who raises cows and sheep and grows
vegetables on his farm. Do his children work on the farm? ``They go
to school,'' Tanui says of Kiprotich, Mitiam, and Kiptoo. This is
part of the fabric of Kenya's running tradition, kids growing up on
farms, running to school, and some going on to dominate the roads
and tracks of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Tanui is one of them. He is a significant part of the Boston
Marathon's Kenyan connection and will be the defender when the 103d
rendition of the world's oldest continuing marathon begins Monday
at noon by the Village Green in Hopkinton. Tanui also won the
centennial race in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyans have been a dominant force in Boston ever since
Ibrahim Hussein won his first title in 1988 and followed it with
triumphs in 1991 and 1992. Cosmas Ndeti, who won't be present this
year because of injuries, won the next three, setting the course
record of 2:07:15 in 1994. Tanui won in 1996 but finished fifth in
1997 when he was suffering from bronchitis; countryman Lameck Aguta
won that race.
</P>
<P>
   Tanui made it two out of three a year ago when he heroically ran
down countryman Joseph Chebet to win by three seconds in 2:07:34,
the race's third-fastest time. Hussein won Boston three times,
Ndeti three, and now Tanui points for No. 3. He sat back a year
ago, allowing Chebet to seize the lead. Then the
10,000-meter-man-turned-marathoner relied on his track instincts.
</P>
<P>
   When Tanui ran in the World Track and Field Championships in
1991 in Tokyo, Kenyan Richard Chelimo was leading for most of the
10,000. Chelimo was the teenager, Tanui the wily veteran, even
eight years ago. But Tanui simply turned it on to outkick his
competitor, just as he did a year ago in Boston's 102d race as they
turned the corner on Hereford Street and headed to the finish line
by the Boston Public Library on Boylston Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure,'' says Tanui, who will be joined
by Chebet and seven other elite Kenyan runners in the race. ``They
want to get me now, because I am defending champion and everybody's
saying he wants to win Boston because it's a big marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not getting easier, it's getting difficult. They want to
get me. I'd like to win, because I've been training hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The only race in his recent buildup was the Kyoto Half-Marathon
March 4, when he won in course-record time of 1:01:06. He was fifth
in the Tokyo Half-Marathon Jan. 19 in 1:01:47.
</P>
<P>
   The memories of Boston 1998 are vivid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult race,'' says Tanui. ``When they ran
very fast, I thought they could not finish. After they passed the
half, they were running very fast. I think everything was right to
run the way I ran. I've been training very hard for this race, and
anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanui, 33, used to train in solitude but now runs with partners
in the hills where they have a camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a team now,'' he says. ``Some are running marathons,
some are racing on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was changing all the time. Raining, sometimes hot.
The weather was so bad this year. When it is raining and it is hot,
it is difficult to cope with the weather.'' He sees the current
weather in the Greater Boston area as a bonus, ``unless the wind is
coming from the east.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanui burst onto the global stage with that victory in the World
Championships in 1991, then became the first to break 60 minutes in
the half-marathon when he ran 59:47 in Milan in 1993. He made the
Kenyan team for the 1987 World Cross-Country Championships and
finished 18th as his team won the title. He finished sixth, ninth,
second, and fourth the next four years as his team won, and he was
on a sixth championship team six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He has, in a word, endured. His marathon debut was in New York
on Nov. 14, 1993, and he finished 10th. He has never been out of
the top 10 in his six marathons.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few downsides in his career, but one was in
1990, when a right knee injury sidelined him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst period of my career,'' he says. ``I felt like
I was in a tunnel without exit. Days of real disappointment. Even
if I was under treatment, the pain was still there.'' This brought
him into contact with Italian doctor Bagriele Rosa, who still works
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Tanui seems relaxed, confident, and ready to head into the
Newton hills on a high.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have been planning something for quite some time, you
know everything,'' he says, ``and the only problem is the pressure
from the other athletes. I know there are many athletes who would
like to be the champion. That is the pressure I have at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He trains on hills ranging in altitude from 2,300 to 3,800
meters. The training has gone well. The long runs have been 35 to
38 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kenyans go for training,'' says Tanui, ``and they leave
aside everything. They go for training, and only training. They
leave their farms, or their place of work. When we train, we go to
bed at 8 o'clock and we go out at 5.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no particular race strategy; he'll just let it roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will,'' says Tanui, ``do my best.''

<P>
   BOSTON -- The adage holds that there are horses for courses, and
the Boston Marathon route that stretches over 26 miles 385 yards
from the starting line at the Town Common in Hopkinton to the
finish line by Boston Public Library in the Back Bay is no
exception. From Clarence DeMar to Bill Rodgers to Cosmas Ndeti,
certain runners have excelled over the distance.
</P>
<P>
   DeMar won seven Bostons. Rodgers, who won four between 1975 and
1980 to become known as Boston Billy, will run the race again this
year at age 51. Ndeti stepped in to win three consecutive races
between 1993 and 1995 and threatened to become the first to win
four straight before falling to third in 1996, beaten by Kenyan
countryman Moses Tanui, who won again last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan preeminence on the roads is reflected in the list of
champions at Boston, the world's oldest continuing marathon.
Starting with Ibrahim Hussein's memorable one-second victory over
Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania in 1988, Kenyans have won nine of the last
11 races, including the past eight.
</P>
<P>
   There was no more total domination of the race by the visitors
from the African country than in '96, when Tanui was followed
across the finish line by an almost uninterrupted parade of
countrymen. In all, Kenyans claimed the first five spots, seven of
the first eight, and enriched their nation's economy with Boston
prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Tanui will seek to join the elite group of those who
have three or more Boston victories. He has won two of the last
three, a string broken by a fifth-place finish in 1997, when he was
ailing with bronchitis. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The odds: 2-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moses Tanui, Kenya (No. 1) _ He raced to the third-fastest time
(2:07:34) in Boston history last year, sprinting away from
countryman Joseph Chebet down Boylston Street to win by three
seconds. In the process, Tanui led the fastest top-three finish
(Chebet, 2:07:37; South African Gert Thys, 2:07:52) in the race's
history. It was reminiscent of the race Tanui ran in the World
Championships of Track &AMP; Field in Tokyo in 1991, when he shadowed
countryman Richard Chelimo in the 10,000-meter race and went by him
in the final strides to win. Tanui will be forever remembered as
Boston's centennial champion and, at age 33, is still in top form.
He was fifth in the Tokyo City Half Marathon on Jan. 15 in 1:01:47.
He'd won the race in 1998 in 1:00:24 over a different course. He
returned to the streets of Japan on March 14 and established a
course record of 1:01:06 in winning the Kyoto City Half Marathon
for the second year in a row, running 28 seconds faster than he did
in his 1998 victory. He was fifth (2:09:42) in Chicago last year,
and was runner-up to the incomparable cross-country great Paul
Tergat by five seconds at the Mattoni Grand Prix exhibition in
Prague in September. He's an accomplished cross-country runner, a
World Championships gold medalist on the track, and a two-time
Olympian, and his marathon record speaks for itself. He became the
first person to break one hour in the half marathon when he ran
59:47 in Milan on March 4, 1993. He won the World Half Marathon
Championship in 1995 and was runner-up in 1997. He trains in the
Rift Valley in the village of Eldoret. &QL; 
 &QL; 
3-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Kagwe, Kenya (No. 3) _ He was fifth in last year's Boston
(2:08:51), and the quality of his recent performances is similar to
Tanui's. He also has won the last two New Yorks, last year biding
his time until he approached the finish line by the Tavern on the
Green in Central Park before outkicking Chebet, who has the dubious
distinction of losing both Boston and New York in the final mile.
Kagwe won by three seconds in 2:08:45. He won by a more comfortable
margin of 1:15 over Chebet the previous year despite having to stop
on three occasions to tie his shoelaces. He also owns a fifth
(2:11:42) in the 1995 New York race and a fourth (2:10:59) in 1996.
He won the 1997 Prague International Marathon (2:09:07) and
followed with a personal best of 1:01:18 in the Philadelphia Half
Marathon. Two weeks prior to Boston last year, he was fifth at the
Cherry Blossom 10-miler in Washington, D.C. Kagwe is a native of
Miharati, Kenya, where he owns a farm, but he does a lot of his
training on the trails of the Valley Forge Reservation near
Norristown, Pa. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Chebet, Kenya (No. 2) _ As pointed out above, his
second-place finishes at both Boston and New York a year ago should
be a motivating factor. He was there, he was merely outkicked.
Actually, after winning his first two marathons, in Amsterdam in
1996 (2:10:58) and Turin in '97 (2:08:23), Chebet has been
runner-up in his last three (he was also second to Kagwe in the
1997 New York race). The ledger also includes a victory in
Luxembourg's Route du Vin Half Marathon in 1997 in 1:00:53. Even
though he was beaten by Tanui's kick a year ago in Boston, he still
ran a personal best of 2:07:37, which also stands as the
fourth-fastest time over the course. After losing Boston and New
York by three seconds each, how motivated is he to move up? The
reports are that he started his training for Boston two months
ahead of schedule. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Korir, Kenya (No. 5) _ He has won Amsterdam the past two
years, was third in the 1997 Rotterdam Marathon, and won his
marathon debut in Florence in 1997. He also has a win in the 1998
Route du Vin Half Marathon in 1:00:15. He recently checked in with
a 1:01:37 half marathon in Lisbon on March 21 to demonstrate his
Boston fitness. Korir won Amsterdam on Nov. 1, 1998, in 2:08:12,
edging countryman Simon Bor (2:08:47) in a race many figured would
be between Spaniards Martin Fiz and Alberto Juzdado. Fiz was on a
sub-2:08 pace through the halfway mark but missed his drink and
dropped out after 1:45. Korir pulled away from Bor and set a course
record. &QL; 
 &QL; 
8-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vanderlei Lima, Brazil (No. 6) _ He ran a personal best of
2:08:31 and finished second a year ago in the Tokyo City Marathon _
a race he'd won two years earlier in 2:08:38. He rounded off last
season with a fifth in New York (2:10:42), and he could be on
target to be the first Brazilian to win Boston. He is no novice to
the distance. He won his first significant marathon in Reims in
1994 in 2:11:06, and he was seventh at Rotterdam and ninth at
Berlin the following year and runner-up in the 1997 Dong-A Marathon
in Gyongiu, South Korea, in 2:12:41. He was on the Brazilian
Olympic team for the Atlanta Games three years ago (a disappointing
47th). There is an evident Brazilian marathon resurgence in terms
of world elites led by world record-holder Ronaldo da Costa and
former national record-holder Andre Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Masaki Oya, Japan (No. 9) _ He holds the Japanese record for the
half marathon: 1:01:40 in 1993. He ran a national record of 2:09:11
over the fast Rotterdam course two years ago, when he finished
eighth in the race that annually goes head to head with Boston.
There also was a third in Fukuoka in 1995 (2:09:33) and a 14th in
London a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Garcia, Spain (No. 8) _ This runner's personal best was a
2:08:40 in the Tokyo International Marathon a year ago. After
enjoying great success as a cross-country runner, he's moved up to
the marathon distance. He made an impressive debut last year in
London (2:09:30), finishing eighth. &QL; 
 &QL; 
12-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andres Espinosa, Mexico (No. 7) _ He considers Boston his home
turf, and his dream is to win here. Espinosa holds the
second-fastest time over the course: His 2:07:19 brought him in
just behind Cosmas Ndeti in 1994. Espinosa also took a third here
(2:10:44) behind Ibrahim Hussein in 1992. He also knows the down
side of Boston, having experienced disappointment in 1996 (13th,
2:13:03) and 1997 (15th, 2:16:19). He didn't race here a year ago.
After finishing second in the 1991 (2:10:00) and 1992 (2:10:44) New
York City Marathons, he won the 1993 race in 2:10:04. He also
finished fifth there in 1996 in 2:11:39. He owns a third in
Amsterdam in 1997 (2:10:33) and in the Dong-A Marathon in 1995, and
was ninth later that summer at the World Championships. He won a
half marathon Feb. 7 in Austin, Texas, in a course-record 1:01:16
and seems to be in form.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Tenorio, Ecuador (No. 14) _ He has stepped to the
forefront of Ecuadorian running, representing his country in the
Atlanta Olympic Games. In his marathon debut last year, he finished
third in Rome in 2:10:22. He had two impressive second-place
finishes at shorter distances in 1997, in the Colorado Run and the
Deseret News 10K. Last year, he was fifth in the Orange Classic 10K
and eighth in the San Blas Half Marathon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
20-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter Githuka, Kenya (No. 16) _ He made his true marathon debut
in New York last fall, finishing eighth in 2:11:20, after first
appearing in the race the previous year as the early pacesetter
before dropping out. His road race achievements are considerable,
including 14 finishes in the top five in 1998 and 21 top-fives in
1997. Among his 1998 wins were the Philadelphia Distance Run Half
Marathon (1:01:58), Syracuse's Festival of Races 5K (course-record
13:38), and Atlanta's Hilly US 10K Classic (29:07). He was also
second in the Bobby Crim 10-miler in 46:21. He holds the world
reccord for the 8K distance (22:03), which he set in the 1996 Crazy
Eights 8K in Kingsport, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Rod DeHaven, Madison, Wis. (No. 22) _ He's the top American
threat in a field that includes very few top US runners. He was
15th in a personal best (2:13:00) in the Chicago Marathon last
fall, won the US Half Marathon Championship in Parkersburg, W.Va.,
in 1:03:42, and was fourth in the Gate River Run US Championship
15K race in Jacksonville in 44:20. DeHaven, 32, was fifth in his
marathon debut at the Twin Cities Marathon in 1994 in 2:14:48.

THE WOMEN'S FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Thirty-three years ago, Roberta Gibb ran unofficially
to become the first woman in the Boston Marathon. A year later,
Kathrine Switzer obtained a number by signing her application ``K.
Switzer'' in an era when the race didn't welcome women. Sixteen
years ago, Joan Benoit Samuelson set a world record (2:22:43) on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, very little Boston history has been
made by American women.
</P>
<P>
   The last US woman to win the world's oldest continuous marathon
was Lisa Larsen-Weidenbach, who ran 2:34:06 on April 15, 1985. The
closest since then has been Kim Jones, who posted runner-up
finishes in 1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes it intriguing to ponder what Lynn Jennings,
who grew up in Harvard and now resides in Newmarket, N.H., might do
in her long-anticipated marathon debut at age 38.
</P>
<P>
   If Jennings performs as she did when she dominated the World
Cross-Country Championships early in this decade, she could be a
factor in a race she ran unoficially when she was just 17 (and
finished in 2:46, which would have placed her third). But Jennings
will have to put forth an outstanding effort to finish at the front
of this formidable women's field. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The odds: 2-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fatuma Roba, Ethiopa (No. F1) _ She has been the dominant figure
in the women's field since Uta Pippig's three straight wins
(1994-1996). Roba burst on the world scene by winning the Olympic
gold medal in Atlanta, then proved it was no fluke by winning the
last two Boston runs. Last year, she ran almost even 5K splits for
the entire race as she easily outdistanced the field to win by
nearly four minutes in 2:23:21 after surviving a sore leg that
nearly did her in prior to the race. She finished a disappointing
eighth in the Tokyo Women's Marathon in November in 2:36:22, after
a fourth in 2:30:39 the year before. When she won Boston for the
first time in 1997 to end Pippig's streak, she won by 46 seconds
over South Africa's Elana Meyer and became the first African woman
to win Boston. Before she won at the Atlanta Games in 2:26:05, she
had won Rome (2:29:05) and the Marrakech Marathon in Morocco
(2:30:50) and was second to Tegla Loroupe by 42 seconds at the
Lisbon Half Marathon (1:09:43) in 1997. In a Boston tuneup March
14, she won the Matuse Half Marathon in 1:10:54. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colleen De Reuck, South Africa (No. F4) _ She was co-leader with
Roba through the halfway mark last year in Boston but, after being
stricken by nausea, faded to fifth in 2:29:43. De Reuck was third
(2:28:03) the previous year after being outdueled by Meyer on
Beacon Street. She ran her first Boston in 1994, finishing ninth in
2:31:53. She ran her personal best in Berlin in 1996 and has been a
frequent contender at the marathon distance. She won the 1997
Falmouth Road Race, and was runner-up in 1996 and '98, and
established a world record for 10 miles (51:56) in the 1998 Cherry
Blossom race in Washington, D.C. De Reuck is a citizen of South
Africa but trains and lives at the altitude of Boulder, Colo. She's
always competitive, and this could be her year to win Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Franca Fiacconi, Italy (No. F5) _ She seems to perform at her
best in the major marathons. After finishing second (2:28:43) in
the New York City Marathon in 1996 and third (2:30:15) the next
year, she returned last year and shaved 2:55 off her previous best
to win in the second-fastest time (2:25:17) in the race's history.
She had already raced three marathons during the year. She won Rome
in March, Turin in May, and was fourth in Budapest in August, nine
weeks before her breakthrough victory in New York. She won
marathons at Capri and Turin in 1996, and was 13th in the warm
World Championship marathon in Athens. She is ready for this
historic stage, where in 1990 countryman Gelindo Bordin became the
first male Olympic gold medalist to win Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Anuta Catuna, Romania (No. F3) _ She was third a year ago in
2:27:34, but experienced her real breakthrough in New York in 1996
when she overhauled the touted Tegla Loroupe to win in 2:28:18.
Catuna has been a consistent performer on the global stage for the
past decade. She won the World Cup Marathon in 1995 in 2:31:10,
leading her country to a 1-2-3 sweep of the women's team title. She
followed up with a silver-medal performance in the 1995 World
Championshhips in Gothenburg, Sweden. Also on her resume: a fourth
in the 1994 New York City Marathon and an 11th in the 1997 World
Championships. &QL; 
 &QL; 
8-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renata Paradowska, Poland (No. F2) _ She staked her place on the
world stage by finishing as the runner-up to Roba a year ago in
Boston with a personal best of 2:27:17. She ran conservatively
through the first half but employed her strength over the Newton
hills, propelling her to the finish line. She was 11th in Budapest
last August in 2:32:18, as she started to approach the marathon
distance with seriousness. She previously had represented her
country in international competition in events ranging from the
10,000 to the half marathon to cross-country. She also won the San
Jose Mercury News 10K in March in 33:49.
</P>
<P>
   Yuko Arimori, Japan (No. F6) _ Her Olympic marathon success
(silver in 1992, bronze in '96) has made her a superstar in a
country that worships marathoners. Arimori became a national
heroine when she won the silver in Barcelona in 2:32:49 over a
course with a difficult final 4 miles. She won the bronze in
Atlanta in 2:28:39 after overcoming several injuries in the
intervening years. She had introduced herself with a sixth in the
1990 Osaka Ladies Marathon (2:32:51) and returned to the race the
following year to establish a national record (2:28:01) while
finishing second. She was fourth in the World Championships in
Tokyo (2:31:08) later that year. She took a respite but now resides
and trains in Boulder, Colo., with an eye toward the Olympic Games
next year in Sydney at age 32. Boston will be her first marathon in
two years. &QL; 
 &QL; 
10-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sun Yingjie, China (No. F11) _ The great unknown. She is only 20
but has impressive times in all her races to date. She won the
Tianjin Marathon a year ago in 2:25:45 and followed that with a
victory at the Dalian International Marathon in 2:26:00. Chinese
women have been a big part of recent athletic history, most notably
in the World Track &AMP; Field Championships in 1993 and 1995. They
rarely compete outside their country, and this represents a notable
breakthrough for Boston, where the Japanese and Koreans have
compiled enviable records. She and compatriot Ai Dongmei will be
runners to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Jennings, Newmarket, N.H. (No. F9) _ This is the time to
welcome a hometown favorite to the streets of Hopkinton, Ashland,
Framingham, Natick, Wellesley, Newton, Brookline, and Boston. She's
38 and has won the World Cross-Country Championships three times.
The most notable was at Franklin Park in 1992, where she had run
with the boys' cross-country team when she was growing up in
Harvard. She's a three-time Olympian who has a 10,000 bronze medal
from the Barcelona Games of 1992. She planned to make her official
Boston debut a year ago, but withdrew. She was ninth in the Atlanta
Games in the 10,000, and has won 39 national championships on the
roads, the track, and the cross-country trails. On March 7, she won
the Gate River Run 15K in Jacksonville _ a national championship
race _ by 51 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Franziska Rochat-Moser, Switzerland (No. F7) _ Besides being an
elite runner, she's a lawyer and owner of the gourmet restaurant
Girardet in her hometown of Crissier, Switzerland. She earned
notice in the United States with her win at New York in 1997
(2:28:42), but she's no stranger to Boston, either, with a fourth
in 1995 (2:29:35) and a sixth in 1996 (2:31:33). She was 18th in
the Atlanta Games in 1996 and set her personal best (and a Swiss
record) by winning at Hamburg in 1994 (2:27:44).
</P>
<P>
   Ai Dongmei, China (F12) _ Like her compatriot Yingjie, she is
unknown on American soil. She's just 21, but in her marathon debut
in Beijing in 1997, she was third in 2:27:30. This was in the
Chinese National Games, an event contested every four years. She
ran 2:34:52 in the Dalian International Marathon last October. &QL; 
 &QL; 
15-1 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Ndereba, Kenya (No. F26) _ At 26, she's a veteran of
the roads who is making her marathon debut and shouldn't be
discounted. She ran the Boston course last fall to test it out and
found it to her liking. In 1998, she was ranked as the world's No.
1 road runner by Runner's World and named Road Racer of the Year by
Running Times. She enjoys crochet and knitting . . . and winning
races.
</P>
<P>
   Ludmila Petrova, Russia (No. F15) _ She had a strong 1998,
running three marathons. She set a course record at Moscow
(2:30:54), ran her personal best (2:30:26) in the European
Championships, and came back with a fourth at New York (2:31:09).
She was a finalist in the 10,000 meters at Atlanta '96 and is
considered a strong prospect for Sydney in 2000. Look for her to be
a factor after a winter of training in Gainesville, Fla.

 &HT;    Bill and Alicia's excellent adventure
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Shannon Donnelly
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Imagine a seven-year honeymoon in an
exceedingly cramped space.
</P>
<P>
   Too much togetherness for just about anybody, you say? Not Bill
and Alicia Blodgett.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach couple spent seven years sailing around the world
on their 62-foot Pegaso, stopping at far-flung ports with names
such as Hiva Oa, Rangiroa, Vanuatu, Gove and Komodo.
</P>
<P>
   They survived storms, pirates, the temporary loss of their boat
(it drifted away while they were playing bridge aboard another
boat) and even a battering by an amorous whale.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't kill each other. They didn't get divorced. Alicia
has even written a book about their adventures, called ``Just the
Two Of Us,'' which started out as a sort of personal diary.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the trip, I'd keep notes and every six months or so
send a newsletter back to our friends,'' Alicia said. ``When we
came back, a lot of our friends said I should write a book. Finally
Bill urged me to do it, so I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Alicia's relationship has been unusual from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the day after their first date. They married just a
few weeks later in Akron, Ohio, where Bill built a trucking
business that became so successful, he was able to retire at age
48. He wanted to realize his life's dream of sailing around the
world and Alicia, an inexperienced sailor, agreed to go.
</P>
<P>
   So, after saying goodbye to her children from her first marriage
_ her youngest was by then 19 and a college student _ she set off
with Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried for months,'' Alicia said about leaving her youngest.
``I felt so guilty about leaving my baby. I'd try to hold it in,
and Bill would ask me what's wrong and I'd say 'nothing' and then
start to sob.'' But Alicia eventually got over her separation
trauma and turned her attention to the rigors of circumnavigation.
</P>
<P>
   It was, she says, the trip of a lifetime. Her favorite places
were New Zealand (where they ended up staying six months) and Fiji.
Both places have breathtaking topography, but Alicia said that
wasn't the attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people. The Fijians and the New Zealanders are the
warmest, friendliest people you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   She is less enthusiastic about Egypt, where they sailed through
the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean. ``The Egyptian men treated
me very disrespectfully,'' she said, refusing to elaborate. ``I'll
never go there again.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip was full of adventures. A glandular whale off the
Australian coast mistook the hull of the Pegaso for a female and
bumped it repeatedly, lifting it completely out of the water on his
final pass. (Alicia slept through that.) Off Sri Lanka, Pegaso was
pressed into a search-and-rescue mission for another
around-the-world sailor, a woman who'd had enough of her husband
and jumped overboard five miles off the Sri Lankan coast. (She was
later rescued by a fishing boat.) A volcano erupted as they were
sailing away from Bali, leaving Bill, Alicia and Pegaso coated in
ash. Leaving Australia, they took fourth place in the
Darwin-to-Ambon race. In Fiji, Bill shared a sacred kava ceremony
with a tribal chief. (No women allowed.)
</P>
<P>
   The trip turned Alicia into an enthusiastic and accomplished
sailor. Still, seven years at sea was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Alicia still have Pegaso. It's docked at the Rybovich
Marina, where they ended their circumnavigation on Mothers' Day,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the two years since we returned, we sailed it twice _ down
to Fort Lauderdale to get it painted blue, and then back from Fort
Lauderdale after it was painted blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's for sale. ``It'll always be a friend,'' Alicia said.
``But it's too big to take out for a day sail and too deep to take
to the Bahamas. It's a boat for someone who wants to sail around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the Two Of Us'' is available at bookstores and
amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Alicia used a philosopher's words to sum up the
adventure. ``We all die,'' she wrote. ``But only some of us live.''
</P>
<P>
   All proceeds from the sale of the book go to charity. ``I've
been so blessed,'' Alicia said. ``I couldn't possibly want another
thing. I am a walking, living Cinderella.''

 &HT;    Historic `hideaway' renovated
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Robert Janjigian
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When writer-actress T.J. Fisher bought the
little house on historic Root Trail in Palm Beach, she planned to
spruce the place up on a two-month schedule. Her intent was to
clean the cottage up for use as a pied a terre, as she and her
husband were contemplating a move from their rented quarters on the
island to a farm property a good distance away. It was to be a
place to spend the night in town when a long drive wasn't
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months later, the 600-square-foot, four-room cottage
was ready for occupancy, having undergone a complete restoration
and transformation beyond what Fisher originally expected _ or
budgeted. The couple scrapped their plans to establish a primary
residence outside Palm Beach proper. They purchased a more
substantial residence located _ conveniently _ just over the back
fence from the cottage.
</P>
<P>
   By building a simple gated walkway connecting the two
properties, the small cottage became an extraordinary guest house.
For Fisher, it's also a ``hideaway'' retreat, but one that
represents an authentic chapter in Palm Beach's architectural story
that's quite different from the usual Flagler-Mizner account.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher worked with Jane Day, the town's historical consultant,
to get the details right. Wooden sheathing replaced vinyl sliding.
Vinyl shutters were removed. A new shingled roof was put in place.
When contractors suggested she use lower-maintenance plastic and
composite elements, Fisher refused.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it was a matter of stripping down to the bare essentials
before proceeding. Linoleum covered the floors. ``I knew there was
something lurking under there,'' said Fisher, who eventually had to
put in old-style new oak flooring, as well as a new foundation,
during the renovation process. Walls throughout the four-room house
are paneled in period-style wainscoting. To finish off the
interiors, Fisher sought out historic-style fixtures, including all
lighting elements, a replica of a vintage stove, and a clawfoot tub
and 1920s-style commode she found for the bathroom. ``I've avoided
modern-looking things as much as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bedroom at the rear of the house came with 36 electrical
outlets. ``The thought is that it was a telegraph office,'' Fisher
explained. In her preliminary research into the history of the
house, she said that the structure first showed up in town records
in 1917 as a print shop, though it may have been built circa 1910.
``There's a bit of mystery about it, but it definitely was one of
the first commercial buildings in Palm Beach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In walking through the house, one cannot help but notice the
preponderance of African animal-theme works of art and
leopard-print fabrics in the decorating scheme of the cottage.
Fisher, who's made a name for herself locally by posting the reward
to find the killer of some of the island's feral feline population,
is, ironically, allergic to cats. And though she and her husband
plan to go on a tent safari someday, she's never been to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Her affinity for the jungle look, which includes a couple of
animal paintings she created as a teen-ager and whose impact is
somewhat toned down by the warm wicker furniture and interior
treatments, is innate to her personality. She said: ``I find the
leopard prints primitive, but somewhat relaxing. They give the
rooms a more casual atmosphere, as well as a kind of island
flavor.''

 &HT;    Deal with designer dashes American dream
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Michele Gelormine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hoping for better opportunities and a
brighter future, Anna and Michael Veksler and their 6-year-old son,
Robert, left the former Soviet Union in 1978 to come to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They came with $300 in their pockets and six suitcases full of
clothes. The Soviet government would allow them to take only $100
per person out of the country. All other valuables had to be left
behind. For Anna Veksler, the most painful loss was her books. The
Vekslers had a library full of classical literature.
</P>
<P>
   The family settled outside Washington, D.C., in Gaithersburg,
Md. Michael Veksler worked as a plumber and Anna Veksler worked in
accounting. Two years later _ after saving some money and borrowing
from relatives _ they bought a tiny restaurant and named it the
Village Cafe. In the early days, it was a mom-and-pop operation.
The couple worked 14-hour days to build up the business. Still
owned and run by the Vekslers, the restaurant has expanded and
serves breakfast, lunch and dinner with full bar service.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work paid off for the Ukrainian immigrants. In December
1997, the Vekslers saved enough money to buy a home in Palm Beach
that they planned to use for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Anna Veksler said her American Dream turned into a nightmare
shortly after she entered into a partnership with Worth Avenue
businessman Louis DiCarlo. The partnership has turned into a raging
dispute. Each is suing the other to dissolve the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   And Veksler filed a complaint earlier this month with the Palm
Beach Police, claiming DiCarlo threatened her by telephone.
According to the complaint, DiCarlo said to Veksler, ``This time
I'm going to strike, and if I strike, I strike hard. So watch your
back.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo said he is outraged by her claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things I want to protect,'' DiCarlo said. ``No.
1, my product, and No. 2 is the fact that I've never threatened
anyone. That is a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Veksler, 54, and her 64-year-old husband wanted ultimately
to sell the restaurant and retire to Palm Beach. Anna Veksler said
she did not see herself staying home and toyed with the plan of
opening a small business.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan accelerated after a March 1998 trip to buy jeans in
DiCarlo's store.
</P>
<P>
   Veksler said DiCarlo, claiming to be ``a world-renowned
international designer,'' started a conversation with Veksler and
her friend as they shopped. DiCarlo told them of his plan to open
stores selling couture jeans and accessories throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a nice portfolio about his big projections _ millions _
and what would be done in Palm Beach,'' Veksler said.
</P>
<P>
   Promises of profit
</P>
<P>
   With promises of huge profits within a year, DiCarlo convinced
Veksler to form a partnership and open a store in a larger
location, Louis DiCarlo Couture Jeans. What Veksler did not know
was that DiCarlo had stopped paying rent for the space, according
to property manager Santo Lumia. In addition, landlord Burton
Handelsman evicted DiCarlo from his office at nearby for nonpayment
of rent. DiCarlo said he was going through bankruptcy and could not
pay the rent at the store. DiCarlo said he stopped paying
Handelsman because the landlord refused to fix the roof and the
leaky roof damaged his merchandise. Handelsman called DiCarlo's
allegations ``baloney. It was because of returned checks and
nonpayment.''
</P>
<P>
   Veksler said she had no idea DiCarlo had more than $1 million in
debts _ including more than $300,000 in income tax and $150,000 in
credit card debts _ and she did not know of a 1992 bank fraud
indictment by the federal government. Veksler said DiCarlo told her
of the bankruptcy but led her to believe he had paid back his
debts.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo filed for bankruptcy in February 1997. Craig Kelley, his
attorney, advised DiCarlo to convert his Chapter 11 bankruptcy to a
Chapter 7, which would have liquidated his debts. But DiCarlo chose
instead to voluntarily dismiss his bankruptcy claim, leaving him
still owing 100 percent of his debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to pay my creditors,'' DiCarlo said. ``If I had gone
Chapter 7, I would have had a fresh start. I chose not to. I wanted
to pay my bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said, ``He went right back into the hornet's nest by
doing that. He may have needed a fresh start, but as long as he is
carrying around the debt, he has a lot to overcome. Most of my
clients are dodging bullets, and they've got life jackets with
holes in them.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bader, owner of B&AMP;B Graphics in West Palm Beach, is one
of the creditors listed on DiCarlo's bankruptcy filing. DiCarlo
owes him $1,000 for printing T-shirts to give away at a 1996 Dreher
Park Zoo benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not paid,'' Bader said. ``I keep getting letters from
his attorney saying he intends to pay his debts. Yeah, 'the check's
in the mail.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Halley is a Miami attorney representing the New
Jersey-based shipping company Panalpina Inc. in a lawsuit against
DiCarlo. According to court documents, DiCarlo failed to pay
$43,000 in shipping costs in 1997. The company obtained a judgment
for $35,000, and Halley said DiCarlo still owes about $25,000.
``He's making an effort to pay,'' Halley said.
</P>
<P>
   'Guilt by association'
</P>
<P>
   Another chapter in DiCarlo's past is his problems with the
federal government. In September 1992, DiCarlo pleaded guilty to
charges of bank fraud in federal court in Cleveland. He was
sentenced to three years of probation, four months of house arrest
and a $10,000 fine. The indictment came after a Cleveland-based
telemarketing scam was linked to DiCarlo's now-defunct Southcoast
Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't steal any money from anybody,'' DiCarlo said. ``I
lost $1.2 million. It was guilt by association.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of forming their business partnership, Veksler
said, she found herself in debt and questioning DiCarlo about the
purchases he was making with her money. At that point, Veksler
estimated, she had poured nearly $100,000 into the new store. She
mortgaged both houses and, eventually, maxed-out her credit cards.
Veksler said she has poured $300,000 into the business _ which
included meeting his demands for an elaborate $10,000 grand
opening, $10,000 in commercials and print advertising, and $90,000
in store remodeling. Veksler said she questioned his purchases and
would have preferred putting more money into inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `If you don't pay for this, I won't open the
store and you'll lose money,''' Veksler said. ``I couldn't get out.
That's what he does. He's like a spider. He puts you in his web and
you can't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo said he brought all his furniture and $92,800 worth of
jeans and accessories from his previous stores to the business.
Veksler just laughed. DiCarlo did contribute the furniture, she
said, but the inventory that he brought is worth closer to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo said Veksler knew of his money problems. His function
was to lend his name and fashion expertise to the business _ Louis
DiCarlo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a partner, it is to pay the bills, or else I would do
business by myself,'' he said. ``I make a wonderful product. The
fact that I have financial difficulties does not make me a bad
person.''
</P>
<P>
   A diverse reputation
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, DiCarlo has managed to drive expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bentley, Mercedes, Jaguar ... All my cars were blue,''
DiCarlo said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Bruce, owner of the Donald Bruce gift store, remembered
DiCarlo always driving around in ``very fancy'' cars, including a
royal-blue, custom Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they allow him back on Worth Avenue,'' Bruce
said. ``He's stiffed everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Schwalberg, president of the Worth Avenue Association,
said he has never met DiCarlo, who is not a member of the
association. But Schwalberg has heard about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation has spread up and down the avenue,'' Schwalberg
said. ``A lot of people are aware of his relationship with
landlords. I've read in the newspaper and I've heard his reputation
is not up to snuff. It's something that property owners should be
careful of when leasing property to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. John Baughman owns the clothing store
Dazzle, specializing in women's couture and designer clothes.
Baughman said he has been in the clothing business for 29 years and
has been at the Palm Beach location for 18 months. He has known
DiCarlo for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good product, and I know a lot of people who have his
products,'' Baughman said. ``He's a hell of a nice guy. I have not
heard complaints. I haven't had anybody say anything bad about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his business relationship with Veksler, DiCarlo went to
New York on business. Veksler said he called from New York and told
her to give her credit card number to a hotel to pay for his
lodging. He stayed three nights at $365 per night, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls me from the Essex (House) Hotel,'' Veksler said. ``I
gave my charge card number. He wanted to stay an extra week, but I
told him I couldn't pay for it. He always needs to have the best
and finds a fool to pay his expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo said he paid for his airplane ticket for the New York
trip and other business trips. Veksler still owes him more than
$5,000 in travel expenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veksler said DiCarlo went on a buying spree for store inventory
at a Las Vegas fashion show with her money. When she tried to ask
DiCarlo about the purchases, Veksler said, he told her not to
interfere and it was not her business. Now, Veksler said, she has
oversized sweaters and $17,000 worth of red-and-green jeans she
cannot sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm the one with the knowledge,'' DiCarlo said.
``She comes from the restaurant business. I'm the one to do the
ordering.''
</P>
<P>
   According to their written business agreement, Veksler owns 70
percent and DiCarlo owns 30 percent of Louis DiCarlo Inc. Anna
Veksler is the president and only officer. According to the
agreement, DiCarlo was supposed to work in the store from 2 to 6
p.m. five days a week. Veksler agreed to pay as much as $30,000 to
renovate the store, and DiCarlo agreed to pay anything in addition
to that. But the agreement was later amended: Any construction
costs in excess of $30,000 would be deducted from DiCarlo's $60,000
initial investment, which was in inventory, not in cash. Veksler
said DiCarlo has not put any money into the business and has not
worked in the store at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``She threw me out of the store and changed the locks two days
after we opened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veksler responded, ``I changed the locks because he started
giving away clothes to people he owed money to. It was impossible
to have him in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater Construction Inc., the company that performed the
renovations, is suing both of them, alleging they ordered $45,000
in extras without paying. Veksler paid $43,000 on the original
renovation contract. She said DiCarlo ordered the $45,000 in extras
without her consent, and Slater Construction did not get her
written approval for the work. The following week, DiCarlo sued
Veksler to dissolve their partnership. She countersued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we could resolve the differences,'' Veksler said.
``I was not going to sue anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Since filing bankruptcy, DiCarlo has new debtors banging on his
door. Even though DiCarlo admits ordering advertising and other
business items, he said Veksler is responsible for paying the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Kirschner owns Passport Publications &AMP; Media,
publishers of Palm Beach Polo annual magazine. DiCarlo came to
Kirschner in August about taking out a full-page advertisement for
the 1999 polo season. Because the publisher had heard about
DiCarlo's reputation for nonpayment, Kirschner requested a $1,000
deposit on a $2,500 bill. DiCarlo agreed to pay the balance by
October, but as yet, the account remains unpaid, Kirschner said.
The bill has been turned over to Dunn and Bradstreet for
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we had heard of his reputation, we don't write
people off, we treat everyone with the same amount of respect as an
individual,'' Kirschner said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Carpenter of Dixie Printing in West Palm Beach is not so
charitable. She said she plans to sue DiCarlo in small claims
court. Carpenter has never met Veksler. The only person she dealt
with was DiCarlo, and as far as she is concerned, he is the one
responsible for the debt. DiCarlo owes her $1,500 for invitations,
letterhead and business cards for his November grand opening.
Because another client referred DiCarlo, Carpenter did not require
a deposit. Carpenter said DiCarlo ordered top-of-the-line paper
with gold-embossed emblems and needed a rush order. Her March bill
statement was returned and marked ``moved, left no address.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bent over backward for him,'' she said. ``It was high-priced
items, and I had a lot of out-of-pocket costs.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo said he goes back and forth between a New York office
and an office he still occupies in Palm Beach. He also has an
apartment there, for which he owes the town $725 in unpaid alarm
system fees.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo's nonpayment came before the town's Code Enforcement
Board on Thursday. Chief Code Compliance Officer Brian House said
the town has sent numerous bills to DiCarlo since April 1998. All
have been ignored, House said. If the bill is not paid within 15
days, House said, he will begin assessing daily fines. DiCarlo said
he did not receive any notices and did not know about the fines.
House said the town sent a notice of Thursday's meeting to DiCarlo
with return receipt requested.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of everything, DiCarlo said, he will open a new store
in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Veksler wants to dissolve the partnership and get out from under
the Louis DiCarlo name. By the same token, DiCarlo said, he wants
an emergency court hearing to take his ``trademark'' away from
Veksler as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo said he has never had one complaint about his clothing
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the bankruptcy, the bad press and everything, I'm still
holding my head high,'' DiCarlo said. ``I keep fighting for what I
believe. If you have faith and a good product, you will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal has split the Veksler family geographically. Michael
Veksler must stay in Maryland and run the restaurant; while Anna
Veksler works six days a week in the store because she cannot
afford to hire help. It is not exactly what she had in mind when
she entered the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the hard work in the restaurant business, I thought
this would be a breeze,'' Anna Veksler said. ``It turned out to be
a nightmare.''

 &HT;    Psychologist chases depression into print
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Michele Gelormine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Martha Manning was a clinical psychologist,
counseling patients by day and teetering on the brink of suicide at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Her preoccupation with suicide became so intense, there was only
one recourse _ Electroconvulsive Therapy, commonly known as
electric shock treatment. Although such treatment has come a long
way from its early days, Manning knew one of the greatest risks she
would face was memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to take a major risk,'' she said. ``It was very
frightening, because I had to commit myself to living and went into
the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning, author of ``Undercurrents,'' will speak at a luncheon
for the The Mental Health Association of Palm Beach County on
Thursday, April 29. ``Undercurrents'' is Manning's daily journal,
chronicling her slide into depression, her decision to undergo ECT
and her fight to regain herself afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, of Arlington, Va., will give a psychologist's view of
depression ``from the inside out.'' Manning said her family history
of depression, two difficult miscarriages, and her drive for
perfection and overachievement combined to push her deeper into
depression in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't outrun it and you can't fake it anymore,'' she said.
``Whatever my achievements were, they were not proof I wasn't
depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, she turned to a psychotherapist for help, while still
treating her own patients and teaching college classes in
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``My psychologist said, `You're depressed.' I said, `I'm just
stressed because I'm doing this, this and this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her book documents her interaction with her husband, a
therapist, and her then-12-year-old daughter during the depths of
her disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having two therapists in the family is actually a liability,''
she said. ``You're so helpful in the office, only to come home and
be wretchedly inadequate. He thought he could pull me out of it if
he said the right things. It just shows the nature of the beast.
Depression is so insidious.''
</P>
<P>
   Medication and therapy failed to treat her depression. When
Manning thought she was literally one day away from suicide, she
opted to undergo ECT. She had six treatments over a two- to
three-week period, while under hospitalization. Manning said she
experienced ``a spotty memory'' for events that happened two to
three weeks before she went into the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Manning relapsed and had another series of ECT
treatments, this time as an outpatient. She lives on a combination
of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers and occasional psychotherapy
tune-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of being OK _ I'm OK,'' she said. ``As far as
overcoming depression, I don't feel like I've overcome it. I live
with it and have given it a room in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning kept a journal throughout her ordeal, but could not look
at her writing for a year after being discharged from the hospital.
When she picked up her journal again, Manning decided to write a
piece for The Networker, a magazine for mental health
professionals. The editor suggested that Manning write a book.
HarperCollins bought the rights and published ``Undercurrents'' in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Manning published her second book, ``Chasing Grace,''
about her experiences growing up in an Irish-Catholic family. After
her second book deal, Manning quit her psychology practice to
become a full-time writer and lecturer. She is working on a third
book, this one about mothers and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Manning said that when she looks back on her suicidal days, she
cannot conjure up those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, you are out of your mind, because it's someone
else's mind thinking those things.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Elected leaders fail to see moral dimension of
crisis
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I couldn't ignore the obscenity tattooed on his arm as
the young man behind me in the grocery line peered over my shoulder
at the newspaper I was reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a photo of the tornado damage?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answered,'' it's Kosovar Albanians _ killed, maybe, by
our own NATO bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get that guy,'' he said, shaking his head over a
small grocery basket of beer and cigarettes. ``He's just killing
people because they're not like him, ain't he?''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about like me killing you because of them shoes you're
wearing,'' he said, pointing to my black sandals.
</P>
<P>
   We exchanged a few more comments about how America can't sit it
out in the face of such awful human rights violations. It seemed
clear my grocery line acquaintance couldn't come up with Slobodan
Milosevic's name _ but that was the least important thing to me.
</P>
<P>
   I thought later about how universal were the principles we
shared _ just strangers in the grocery store with seemingly little
in common.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to the office, news releases on Kosovo from some
members of Georgia's congressional delegation were still on my
desk. How dissimilar were the pronouncements to the honest
reactions of an ordinary guy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Mack Collins said we should support Milosevic's
Serbian opposition _ a silly statement since there is no viable
opposition. Rep. Saxby Chambliss said he's worried about an exit
strategy. U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell applied the ``I told you so''
rationale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted against the resolution,'' he said in a press
statement, ``because I did not share the president's view that it
would slow Milosevic, but rather believed that Milosevic would use
the bombing to consolidate the Serbian people and accelerate the
removal of the Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Republicans in the Georgia delegation voted against
the resolution to support NATO action except U.S. Rep. John Linder,
who was justly critical of the president's lack of a long term
strategy, but still felt it necessary for the United States to
support the action.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's two House Democrats were split: U.S. Rep. John Lewis
supported the resolution; U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney opposed it.
Ironically, McKinney also showed the poor judgment to support Congo
president Laurent Kabila even after his troops carried out a
massacre and many atrocities against opponents.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Max Cleland, who lost three limbs in Vietnam,
supported the air campaign, but opposes ground troops. In a
telephone interview, Cleland said he meets regularly with fellow
veterans in the Senate in both parties. ``We test our reactions
with each other to make sure we're applying our personal
experiences constructively.'' Cleland said they were all aware
their war experiences could both cloud their judgment and give them
special insight. Cleland thinks NATO needs to establish clear
criteria for when human rights abuses, such as those in Kosovo,
demand intervention.
</P>
<P>
   What is curious is the failure of so many of our elected
representatives in Congress to see a moral dimension in the crisis.
Nobody, for example, has talked more about America's moral
responsibilities than U.S. Rep. Bob Barr. But he and others see no
connection between the moral principles this nation has always
stood for, and our role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens for average folks all over America who do.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: One candidate's plight epitomizes sacrifices of many
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ People running for city offices commonly want to
do something about crime when they come to meet with the Trib
editorial board. In recent years I've have the urge to take one or
two of them up on that and have them arrested for impersonating
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   It would have made the streets safer.
</P>
<P>
   But hope springs eternal, and I feel pretty good this spring
having talked to several local candidates and incumbents in city
and school races. As a body, they are as informed, specific and
pure-of-heart as many I've encountered.
</P>
<P>
   I really shouldn't speak ill of those who are pretenders, who
know little about the issues, who have a petty grudge to settle or
only one issue grating on them. Even they serve a purpose. They
force the legitimate candidates and incumbents to go out and
demonstrate their legitimacy by talking to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone should welcome the sight of the yard signs around town.
They are signs of life and commitment. As much as an editorial
writer might jump on elected officials _ they have their job, I
have mine _ you have to give credit to anyone who lays it on the
line, even when those making civic sacrifices end up getting
slapped in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ruben Hinguanzo Sr. He bought 60 yard signs for his run for
mayor of Lacy-Lakeview. After placing the signs on yards around
town, someone pulled 50 or so out of the yards. Even the sign on
Hinguanzo's own yard was snatched.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not versed on where Hinguanzo stands on issues. I sure don't
want to be seen as boosting his candidacy since I haven't
interviewed Dennis Cogliati and Dennis Ard, who also are running
for the office. I remark on Hinguanzo's bad break only because it
epitomizes the sacrifices local candidates make.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the Lacy-Lakeview mayor candidates have devoted a
lot of time to their community. Cogliati is seeking his second term
as mayor. Hinguanzo has been mayor pro tem. Ard came on the board
as a representative of newly annexed Northcrest, where he was on
the council.
</P>
<P>
   It's encouraging to see three candidates with experience run for
such a seat.
</P>
<P>
   In Beverly Hills, voters will be adjusting to the first mayor's
race in 12 years without incumbent Betty Gibbs on the ballot. Gibbs
has plunged a lot of her life into the little city. Grief? Oh,
yeah, and this for one who's had personal grief, the death of a
daughter, to face. But she kept breathing deep and coming back. She
even found the time to head up Compassionate Friends, an
organization for people who've lost next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Hills voters have a choice of three candidates to
succeed Gibbs: councilman James Stolsworth, former concilman David
Gonzales and Henry Wright.
</P>
<P>
   What if they gave an election and nobody came? It won't happen
this year because we can still get people to make sacrifices like
these.

 &HT;    WILL MICROSOFT MAKE WINDOWS CODE PUBLIC?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As two computer pioneers offer rival views here
Monday, users will be watching to see if they are moving toward
adopting a common strategy for developing their products.
</P>
<P>
   Windows creator Bill Gates and Linux creator Linus Torvalds will
deliver separate keynote speeches at the spring Comdex/Windows
World conference. While both Windows and Linux are operating
systems, the neural engine of personal computers, Windows holds an
overwhelming edge in market share.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, 43, chairman and co-founder of Microsoft Corp., hopes to
build on his company's vast lead. His talk will focus on Windows
2000, a next-generation industrial-strength operating system, which
Microsoft plans to ship in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish-born Torvalds, 29, wrote the basic Linux code eight
years ago while a student at Helsinki University. He is a prime
advocate of ``open source'' programming, an approach under which
tens of thousands of people around the world collaborate to improve
Linux _ itself a flavor of UNIX, an operating system widely used on
mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   At a computer conclave in Houston last week, Gates called the
impact of Linux ``fairly limited,'' playing down its commercial
potential to average consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Gates's appearance here comes at a time when Microsoft finds
itself under a strong attack in federal court by the Justice
Department and 19 states for allegedly seeking to use its Windows
muscle power to dominate cyberspace and software markets.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to settle the court case in Washington in mid-trial have
sparked an internal debate at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash.,
headquarters on whether the software giant should adopt a
Linux-style open source model for Windows. Microsoft could find
that to be a necessary price for the government to drop its illegal
monopoly charges.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Steve Ballmer, Gates's second in command,
said Microsoft ``is thinking with great interest'' about opening
Windows' source code. Ballmer, the company's president, said
Microsoft was ``trying to understand this whole notion of open
source.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Raikes, Microsoft's group vice president of sales and
support, noted that the firm already licenses its Windows source
code at no charge to some university research labs, such as the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   While Raikes suggested that the program could be expanded, he
added: ``I don't think you'd ever see us do the same thing as
Linux, but I do think you'll find us looking at some aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jim Allchin, senior vice president of Microsoft's
business and enterprise division and consumer Windows division,
said he was not all sure whether Microsoft should respond to the
growing open-source wave. While ``more eyes on the (Windows) code
is actually a good thing, fragmentation of the code is its death,''
he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Microsoft insiders believe, this is an issue that
Gates must decide.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp., Microsoft's rival in the Internet
browser wars, has struggled with its own open source project,
dubbed Mozilla. Although some 100 Netscape software engineers are
committed to the Mozilla effort, it has yet to dent usage of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, which was recently upgraded
to work more seamlessly with music, video and animation.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds, who claims he does not profit from his creation, said:
``I'd be very interested to talk to Bill Gates to see what he's
like. But we don't have that much in common. First and foremost,
he's a businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   The business aspects of the four-day Comdex meeting, which is
expected to draw a record 80,000 attendees, clearly will dominate
the scene here.
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft officials, more than 20 hardware
companies _ including Compaq, Data General, Dell, Hewlett-Packard,
IBM, Micron, and Unisys _ will soon launch programs to sell
personal computers, notebooks, and servers carrying the latest
``beta,'' or test, release of Windows 2000. Some of them will also
provide technical support services when the ``Beta 3'' version
ships at the end of April, Microsoft officials noted.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also launch a Web site devoted to information
about the new release and provide free phone support _ the first
time it has done so for a beta product, said Jonathan Perera, lead
product manager for Windows 2000 server applications.

   TOBACCO-BILLBOARDS (Undated) _ By midnight on Thursday, every
cigarette billboard in the nation must come down as part of the
$206-billion lawsuit settlement agreement reached last year between
tobacco producrs and 46 states. For anti-smoking groups, the end
of the cigarette billboard stands as a major victory, a choking-off
of an advertising medium that tobacco producers dominated for
nearly 20 years. But it also marks another change, one in this
country's visual landscape. For decades, outdoor tobacco signs were
the canvas used by some of the advertising industry's most-talented
designers and photographers. And the work they produced, ranging
from the quaint to the ingenious to the garish, have served not
only as urban meeting places and reference points for lost
motorists but also as cultural touchstones. By Barry Meier.

   PARKINSON-EXPERIMENT (Washington) _ In the 14 years since he
discovered he has Parkinson's disease, Steve Ashworth has slowly
lost control of his muscles. Two years ago, with simple tasks like
brushing his teeth becoming next to impossible, he eagerly signed
up for a chance to stave off his slide into immobility: the first
government-financed study of brain cell transplants using tissue
from aborted fetuses. But the use of fetal cells was not all that
made the experiment controversial. Like all 40 people who enrolled,
Ashworth, a 53-year-old labor negotiator for General Motors, would
have to undergo brain surgery: four tiny holes drilled into the
skull through the wrinkle lines above his eyebrows. Yet only half
the participants would get the tissue. The other half would get
nothing. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

A FAMILY FEUD OVER PUTTING THE PICASSO NAME ON WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (Eds: Citroen requires an umlaut over the e.) 
(DW) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The great artist Pablo Picasso was not, in his later
years, a great father to his four children. He routinely
ill-treated his one legitimate son, and he neglected the son and
two daughters he had outside of marriage. Still, when he died in
1973, they inherited some of the fruits of his talent and, in three
cases, his name.
</P>
<P>
   But like many an enviable legacy, it became a poisoned chalice.
Picasso's heirs, including his widow, Jacqueline Roque, squabbled
for six years over distribution of thousands of paintings,
sculptures and drawings worth hundreds of millions of dollars. They
then differed over how to exercise their communal right to exploit
the Picasso name commercially until a French court settled the
issue in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new chapter in the saga is unfolding. Last year Claude
Picasso, the artist's surviving son and the court-appointed
administrator of the Picasso estate, sold the Picasso name and
signature to PSA Peugeot-Citroen for use by the French automaker.
This fall, a family compact, the Citroen Xsara Picasso, will be put
on the European market. But Marina Picasso, the artist's
granddaughter and Claude's niece, has challenged the deal in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tolerate that the name of my grandfather and of my
father be used to sell something as banal as a car,'' she told a
French newspaper in January, although the lawsuit was only filed
last month. ``He was a genius who is now being exploited
outrageously. His name, his very soul, should not be used for any
ends other than his art.''
</P>
<P>
   Her position seems duly principled, but it is more complicated.
She has not filed to reverse the sale of the Picasso trademark to
PSA Peugeot-Citroen, but rather to challenge a hefty commission
paid to a consulting company, Welcome, which happens to be owned by
her cousin, Olivier Widmaier-Picasso, and has its offices in the
same building on the elegant Place Vendome as Claude's Picasso
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   (A quick reminder of the cast of characters may be in order.
From his marriage to Olga Koklova, Picasso had one son, Paolo, who
died in 1975 and who himself had three children from two marriages:
Pablito, who died in 1973, Marina and Bernard. With his mistress,
Marie-Therese Walter, Picasso had a daughter, Maya, whose son,
Olivier, has combined his father's and his grandfather's names.
Finally, with Francoise Gilot, Picasso had two children, Claude and
Paloma.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Picasso refused repeated requests for an interview, but
his lawyer, Jean-Jacques Neuer, said that four of the five heirs _
Claude, Paloma, Maya and Bernard _ have backed the Citroen deal and
that, in any case, as sole legal administrator of the estate,
Claude had a right to make the sale on his own, sharing the profits
with his fellow heirs.
</P>
<P>
   For Claude, Neuer said, the Citroen contract is of particular
significance, not only because it is the family's most valuable
single merchandising agreement to date, but also because it
underlines the estate's strategy of associating the Picasso name
with high-quality products. Next in line, apparently, are a Cognac
Hennessy Picasso and a ST Dupont Picasso cigarette lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Neuer said that given the widespread illegal use of the Picasso
name for everything from T-shirts, coffee mugs and scarves to
umbrellas, carpets, and even restaurants, the estate believed that
the best way of fighting piracy was for the family to make use of
the name in a range of products. ``If we don't use it, someone else
will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This, for example, is why the Picasso estate licensed Steve Wynn
to open a Picasso Restaurant in his Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.
``It is a fine restaurant which displays original works by
Picasso,'' Claudia Andrieu, the estate's in-house counsel,
explained. ``It's very different from the unauthorized Picasso
cafes and restaurants that can be found all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Andrieu said that annually the estate received thousands of
requests for authorization to use Picasso images for, say,
postcards and books, and most of these were routinely approved. It
has also signed some 20 licensing contracts for specific
exhibition-related objects, like scarves or T-shirts, although it
required several lengthy lawsuits to halt illegal manufacture and
sale of Picasso objects in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the estate goes to court some 20 times a year to
fight commercial abuses, misappropriation of the Picasso trademark
is the main headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there are at least 200 attempts by people to claim
the Picasso trademark without authorization,'' Ms. Andrieu
explained. ``Add to that, there are 42 different classes of
trademarks for names and logos. There's a Spanish company that has
filed both the name and the logo in 30 classes, so that's 60
separate disputes. I'd say that at present, around 800 of the 1,043
registered trademarks using the Picasso name are unauthorized.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when exploitation of the Picasso name is licensed
to reputable companies, not only is payment assured, the companies
also have an interest in defending the trademark in their
commercial area. The value of the deal with PSA Peugeot-Citroen is
thought to be several million dollars, but the company seems happy.
``It is a totally justified use of the name because it links the
genius of Pablo Picasso with the inventive and creative genius of
Andre Citroen,'' the founder of the automaker, a company spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while the Picasso estate fights to halt piracy, the heirs
have no objection in principle to profiting from the artist's name.
Paloma Picasso, estimated this month by The Sunday Times of London
to be worth $600 million, has long used her _ or is it her
father's? _ name to market perfume and jewelry. In 1979 Marina
Picasso also sold reproduction rights to some 1,000 works by
Picasso that she then owned. Short of selling part of their
collections, the Picasso name remains the family's most marketable
asset.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of this renown is that Picasso's heirs cannot avoid
embarrassing publicity every time they fall out with one another.
The photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, for example, was stirred by
Le Monde's report on the Citroen Xsara Picasso to write a letter of
protest to Claude Picasso, bemoaning a lack of respect for ``one of
the great painters, a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   For other Parisians, though, the surrealism is not that there
will soon be a Picasso car with a $16,000 price tag; it is that, of
all people, Picasso should be associated with a family car.

JOHN MORTIMER: HE WHO MUST BE BUSY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the creator of ``Rumpole of the Bailey,'' and as a novelist,
playwright and man of letters, John Mortimer receives many offers.
But one invitation struck a particularly responsive note. About a
year ago he was sitting quietly in his home in Henley-on-Thames
when the telephone rang. Mortimer recently recalled the
conversation: ``The man said: `This is Judge Rehnquist. We're
having a banquet for the Supreme Court, and the only person we want
to address us is you as the author of Rumpole.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer and his wife flew to Washington, where they were
greeted by the chief justice and also by a covey of female judges
wearing badges that read, ``She who must be obeyed.'' That
admonition was, of course, a reference to the titanic Hilda Rumpole
in the television series about the British barrister. Later,
Mortimer was given a tour of the senate by Senator Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, ``a good chap and a great Rumpole fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumpole, as Mortimer knows, is his mark of identity, ``my
passport.'' So much so that he, the character and Leo McKern, the
actor who plays him on television, have become almost
interchangeable in the eyes of admirers. Mortimer predicts that his
obituary will be headlined ``Death of Rumpole Man.'' But Rumpole is
only a small part of his wide literary contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer has written so many books and plays that the list fills
an entire prefatory page of his new novel, ``The Sound of
Trumpets,'' the last of his ``Rapstone Chronicles'' trilogy about
the British Conservative politician Leslie Titmuss. With the
possible exception of Ruth Rendell, who writes mysteries under two
names, he may be the most prolific contemporary British author. Age
_ he is 75 _ has not reduced his productivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since he was in New York for the publication
of his second memoir, ``Murderers and Other Friends,'' he has
published another novel, ``Felix in the Underworld,'' and a new
collection of Rumpole stories. An indefatigable adapter, he found
time to write television versions of Laurie Lee's ``Cider With
Rosie'' (recently on ``Masterpiece Theater,'' starring Juliet
Stevenson and Mortimer's daughter Emily) and ``Don Quixote'' (for
Hallmark Entertainment).
</P>
<P>
   He also collaborated with Franco Zeffirelli on the screenplay
for ``Tea With Mussolini,'' a movie starring two Dames (Maggie
Smith and Judi Dench), one Lady (Olivier) and Cher. In addition he
wrote a new play with a judicial background. On a day off, he was
knighted by Prince Charles, who stood in for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   As Sir John, he was told that he could now have a coat of arms.
It was suggested that he choose ``a nice animal'' for his crest,
and not a woman's legs as designated by a recently knighted
injudicious judge. Mortimer said that he planned to choose a
dormouse.
</P>
<P>
   He explained the choice over lunch: ``My favorite quotation is
from one of Byron's journals. He said, when you take away infancy,
which is pure unconsciousness: eating, slurping, buttoning and
unbuttoning, what is there left of life? The summer of a
dormouse.'' With characteristic ebullience he savored those words
as well as a half-dozen oysters and a bottle of white burgundy, and
said he was thinking of writing a third memoir to be called ``The
Summer of a Dormouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a lion, an animal more suited to his mien and his girth, but
a tiny dormouse? He laughed at his own modesty. If a dormouse, then
a highly visible one unafraid to speak his mind even it indicates
an occasional instance of political incorrectness, as in his
support of fox hunting. That stand enraged his fellow Champagne
Socialists, a label that he readily accepts though it is rejected
by others of the ilk.
</P>
<P>
   His streak of stubborn independence is exemplified by Leslie
Titmuss, the second-most-famous Mortimer character. An
arch-Conservative and worshiper of Margaret Thatcher, he is the
central figure in the trilogy, which began in 1986 with ``Paradise
Postponed'' and continued in ``Titmuss Regained.'' The two earlier
books were adapted for television, and the third probably will have
a similar future, perhaps with David Threlfall once again starring
as Titmuss.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difference in their politics, Mortimer likes
Titmuss, because he is ``himself,'' and he doesn't ``trim his
sails.'' In contrast to other politicians, he is neither a
hypocrite nor a moralist. As Mortimer said, ``He hasn't got that
failing.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale of Titmuss began after Mortimer adapted Evelyn Waugh's
``Brideshead Revisited'' for television and was talking with Thames
Television about future projects. It was suggested that he write a
series about England after World War II. As with ``Brideshead,'' he
thought adaptation was in order, but when he could not find a
suitable work by someone else, he decided to write his own novel,
his first in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In creating Titmuss as a child of the working class, he thought
about what he considered to be the two great political movements in
England in his time: ``Removing the Conservative party from the
upper classes and giving it to the white-collar workers who are
innately conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   If a left-wing politician says all the right-wing things, he
noted, the right wing will have nothing left to say.
</P>
<P>
   The first book dealt with the aftermath of the war and the
second focused on Titmuss' ``total misunderstanding of women,'' and
was also about environmentalism and the building of a new town. The
current novel could have been called ``Titmuss' Revenge.'' Furious
at the Conservative Party's dumping of Mrs. Thatcher in favor of
John Major, he plots to have Terry Flitton, the Labor candidate in
his district, win the election. To do this, Terry becomes the
complete compromiser.
</P>
<P>
   The real hero, or heroine, of the book is Agnes Simcox, and she
is probably the main reason why Mortimer wrote the novel. Terry,
who has a gorgeous (but dull) young wife, has an affair with
50-year-old Agnes. ``I love Agnes,'' Mortimer said. ``I'm so fed up
with stories of middle-aged men leaving their middle-aged wives for
beautiful young girls. I wanted to write a story with a man leaving
a beautiful young girl for a wonderful, hard-drinking, hard-smoking
middle-aged woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Who was the role model for Agnes? ``Oh, my wife is a little bit
like her,'' he said, as is Sinead Cusack, to whom the book is
dedicated. An actress friend, she has performed with Mortimer in a
literary collage that includes poetry and a touch of Rumpole. Ms.
Cusack, of course, would be the ideal choice to play Agnes on
television.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation shifted to Peggy Ramsay, who until her death in
1991, was the agent for Mortimer's plays as she was for many of his
celebrated colleagues. He said she always confused him with another
client, David Mercer: ``I used to ring her up and say, `Hello,
Peggy,' and she would say: `Hello, Mercer. Mortimer's not writing.
I can't get him to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while she could be disparaging about her most
profitable clients, like Robert Bolt, she would do anything to keep
a writer going if he was poor and struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he remembered bad reviews, Mortimer said: ``Absolutely.
My first novel _ I must have been 24 or 25 _ had very good reviews
and one from John Gielgud's brother, Val. It said, `This author
indulges in piddling around the skirts of sex, which passes as
sophistication in suburban life.' I can't remember any other
review.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically Mortimer has slowed down a bit. He now walks with a
cane, but he still eats and drinks heartily and avoids anything
remotely resembling exercise. As always, he arises early in the
morning and goes to work. Writing in longhand, he produces at least
a thousand words a day, and never seems to be short of ideas. He is
dramatizing Henry James' ``Spoils of Poynton.'' There may be a new
Rumpole in his future, and even Leslie Titmuss may return for
another critical look at the changing political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   As ``an antique,'' Mortimer considered writing a book about
getting old. ``I thought of this first line,'' he said. ``There's a
time of your life when the voice of God speaks out of the sky and
says, `From this day forth thou shalt not be able to put on thy
socks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't feel old. Once I'm sitting down and talking,
I feel as young as can be.''
</P>
<P>
   During his New York visit, Mortimer played the 42d Street New
York Public Library, entertaining a large audience with familiar
and fresh anecdotes about his father's life as a famous divorce
lawyer (``I was raised, housed and educated entirely on the
proceeds of adultery'') and about his own role as author, lawyer
and pre-eminent Rumpolian.

`FAMOUS AFTER DEATH': THIN, LOVED, FAMOUS: HOW NICE IT WOULD BE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his first two novels, ``The Plagiarist'' and ``The
Partisan,'' Benjamin Cheever made touching comedies out of his
struggle to escape the shadow of his famous father, the writer John
Cheever. In his funny new book, ``Famous After Death,'' his alter
ego, Noel (No) Hammersmith, seems to be mostly out from under the
weight of his father but finding the landscape of liberty
remarkably bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Far into a psychotherapy intended to cure a condition of memory
lapses Noel has been suffering, his doctor, Cleo Santarelli, learns
that his parents had been killed in a bombing incident in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you hide this?'' she asks. ``The trauma might have
led directly to your memory lapses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're wrong,'' says Noel. ``I'm very very sorry that my
parents died. But I don't actually think it's all that
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important then?'' Santarelli asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to find a girlfriend, get down to my ideal weight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to get right to the core of your despair,'' the
therapist asks, ``what would you say it was about?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about weighing too much. It's also about powerlessness.
It's catching a glimpse of this pitiful monster in the mirror.
Having that red ring around my waist when I undress at night. ...
I'm in a trap, with one way out: thinness. You know what fatness
says? It says I'm self-indulgent, it says I'm weak. It says I'm
sexually ambiguous. Make me thin, or make me famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel's solution to his fatness is to undertake the program
suggested by one of the diet books he has edited for the publisher
he works for, Acropolis Inc. This prescribes one butterscotch
sundae a day, the rationale of which Noel describes as follows:
``We eat to satisfy the inner child. The ice cream fills the mouth,
in the way a mother's breast might do. The burned or scotched
butter represents the disappointments of adult life. That's the
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   As for fame, Noel is outraged by the way Americans laud
scoundrels for achieving notoriety. ``Kids learn as much about Lee
Harvey Oswald as they do about George Washington,'' he reflects.
``All you need, all you really need for immortality nowadays is a
cold eye and a mail-order rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Or all you need is death. ``Look at Emily Dickinson,'' he writes
a friend. ``Because she wouldn't stop for death, he kindly stopped
for her. Nobody else ever did. Alive she couldn't get arrested.
Dead she's the belle of Amherst.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel appears to have arrived at fame by the route of notoriety.
At the start of ``Famous After Death,'' he is locked up in prison,
being interviewed by Barbara Walters for presumably having killed
people over the issue of ``quality control.'' As the subsequent
flashback reveals through Noel's letters and journal entries, his
life has been a series of disappointments and betrayals. Not only
do women let him down, but also manufactured products keep failing
him. In retaliation, he may possibly have become ``the Wordsworth
Bomber,'' a mysterious figure who has killed some 34 people while
blowing up commercial establishments like Crazy Eddie's and Brooks
Brothers. He is called the Wordsworth Bomber because one of his
mail bombs arrived with a fragment of a Wordsworth poem, perhaps
``Getting and spending we lay waste our powers,'' or so one guesses
from its being quoted in another context.
</P>
<P>
   Now the satirical spirit at work here is not exactly a
light-handed one. That even notoriety counts for so much in
contemporary America has been said many times before, and not
always as obviously as Cheever has done. Countless lampoons of the
publishing industry have argued that the woods are full of editors
who consider books to be only marginally less ephemeral than potato
chips, as Cheever somewhat tiresomely puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the laboriousness of the novel's ending is not really
justified by its point, which simply isn't sharp enough to do any
serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, from line to line ``Famous After Death'' offers
considerable amusement. Cheever is particularly good at detailing
the tiny inconveniences that complicate life in a ``getting and
spending'' society, like the tendency of the scissors on Swiss Army
knives not to work because ``the small band of metal used to make
the blades pop apart after you've cut something has snapped off.''
</P>
<P>
   For Noel the world just isn't what it used to be. As he writes
to a distributor of Swiss Army knives: ``When my father,'' an
Episcopalian priest, ``was a young man, and growing up outside of
Boston, he once bought a box of Cracker Jacks in which there was no
prize. He wrote a letter to the president of the Cracker Jacks
company, and got back an apology in return, a note so finely worded
that it was framed, and hung on the wall behind his desk in the
rectory. With the note the president of the company _ not a public
relations officer, but the president himself _ had enclosed an
entire box of prizes, one of every prize they made. The best of
these was a tiny pair of metal scissors so sharp that they actually
cut through paper.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the gently comic disappointment captured here
doesn't justify the bitterness of the plot's satire. The two forms
of humor don't quite blend, and this failure mars ``Famous After
Death.'' Not fatally but enough to make you flinch.

AFTER 60 YEARS, `LA JUIVE' IS PRESENTED IN NEW YORK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Texas)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A good hundred years after its premiere in 1835 at
the Paris Opera, ``La Juive'' (``The Jewess''), the five-act French
grand opera on which the reputation of Jacques-Francois Fromental
Halevy largely rests, enjoyed worldwide acclaim. It was presented
562 times at the Paris Opera alone. Caruso made a specialty of the
daunting role of Eleazar, a tormented Jewish jeweler in Constance,
Switzerland, during the early 15th century, who is deeply proud of
his religious heritage in the face of the hysterical prejudice and
fanatically consumed with revenge. Wagner admired and conducted
``La Juive,'' and Mahler thought it ``wonderful and majestic . . .
one of the greatest operas ever created.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been performed at the house of its premiere since
1936, and had not been presented on a New York stage for 60 years
until Tuesday night, when Eve Queler conducted the Opera Orchestra
of New York, a large roster of vocalists and the Dallas Symphony
Chorus in a concert performance at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course tastes change, and the fashion has waned for long
French grand operas with their requisite massed choral scenes and
formulaic ensembles in which characters stand frozen in place,
singing to themselves about their emotions. It's easy to poke fun
at the opera's convoluted plot, which asks us to believe that
Leopold, the prince of the Empire, who is smitten with Eleazar's
daughter Rachel, successfully courts her in disguise as a Jewish
painter, and that Rachel is actually the daughter, stolen as an
infant, of Eleazar's nemesis, Cardinal Brogni.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Halevy, whose centennial is this year, was the revered
teacher of Gounod and Bizet, and was in effect the composer
laureate of France. Ms. Queler's performance provided a timely
reminder of Halevy's achievement in this work.
</P>
<P>
   For all the opera's episodes of standard-issue spectacle (the
original production was an extravaganza with soldiers in real armor
and a menagerie of horses), Halevy's music has distinguished
qualities. The melodies mostly shun ornate display and are often
inspired; the scoring is imaginative, from the nuanced writing for
woodwinds, to the pealing off-stage organ during a Te Deum, to the
use of anvils that Verdi remembered when writing ``Il Trovatore.''
</P>
<P>
   The choral writing is mostly block harmony, but this keeps the
text vivid and the textures lucid. Halevy has a tendency to stick
to foursquare phrasing, though this is dictated to some extent by
Scribe's prosaic libretto. But altogether, it is an authentic and
often noble work.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it cannot be coincidental that the turn in opinion about
``La Juive'' coincided with the rise of anti-Semitism in Nazi
Germany. Audiences may have been uncomfortable with Halevy's
depiction of the Christians' unabashed hatred of the Jews and with
stereotyping in the character of Eleazar. Both aspects of the work
are still discomforting.
</P>
<P>
   Halevy, a Jew, tried to present the good and bad sides of the
hero and his persecutors, but the balance seems strained. For
example, Act II begins with an intensely moving Passover seder at
Eleazar's house. The music is consolingly lyrical and poignant,
with its touches of chromaticism and choral refrains. Halevy wisely
refrained from quoting Jewish musical sources. The scene is utterly
French, and absolutely true.
</P>
<P>
   Yet following this is a scene in which Eleazar, like some
operatic Shylock, sings gleefully about the gold coins he will soon
be counting when Leopold's wife, who knows nothing of her husband's
attachment to Rachel, comes to the jeweler's house to buy a gold
chain. The music rings false, as if Halevy felt forced to include
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Juive'' is a flawed yet beguiling work, and Ms. Queler and
her forces deserve unstinted praise for providing us with a chance
to hear it. As Eleazar, a role Richard Tucker dreamed of singing at
the Metropolitan Opera (Rudolf Bing would have none of it), the
tenor Francisco Casanova sang with robust voice and impassioned
lyricism. Rachel, a role for spinto soprano, and Princess Eudoxie,
a virtuosic coloratura role, were ably sung by Hasmik Papian and
Olga Makarina, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The bass Paul Plishka was an imposing Brogni. Grant Youngblood
as Ruggerio and Jean-Luc Viala as Leopold sang with more
tentativeness. But this opera is unfamiliar, and you could only be
grateful to singers who worked hard at music they may never sing
again.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Queler conducted the orchestra and the excellent Dallas
Symphony Chorus in a surely paced and spacious performance of this
over-three-hour score. Any unsteadiness was understandable. Once
again she has rendered opera a service by championing an overlooked
work. Her legacy will be large.

PETER ARNETT IS MISSING IN ACTION AT CNN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When bombs fell on Baghdad in 1991, he was there, live,
describing the action in what became the defining achievement for
CNN; but when the bombs began falling on Belgrade last month, Peter
Arnett, the most recognizable correspondent in the history of the
all-news network, was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he likely to be seen again on CNN. The network is
planning to exercise an exit clause in Arnett's contract in July,
Arnett said, effectively dismissing him with two years left on his
five-year agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Two CNN executives, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also
said Arnett's contract would be terminated. Other CNN executives
refused to discuss any aspect of Arnett's status. Tom Johnson, the
chairman and chief executive of CNN, did not return phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, who has hired a lawyer to try to work out a settlement,
said: ``I don't want to fight with CNN. I've worked there for 18
years. I love the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The love is apparently no longer mutual. The decision to
terminate Arnett's contract ends the CNN career of probably the
best-known foreign correspondent in recent television history. The
move comes nine months after Arnett played a prominent role in what
became an embarrassing debacle for CNN, when a much publicized
investigative report for the inaugural edition of CNN's prime-time
news magazine ``CNN Newsstand,'' blew up in the network's face.
</P>
<P>
   The report, entitled ``Tailwind,'' charged that a U.S. military
operation in the Vietnam War included the use of the lethal nerve
gas sarin.
</P>
<P>
   After an internal examination, CNN declared the conclusions of
the report to be unsupported by the evidence. The network issued a
public retraction and apology. Arnett was the correspondent for the
report. He was also listed as the co-author of an accompanying
magazine article that ran in Time.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the retraction, CNN dismissed both producers who
put the report together, Jack Smith and April Oliver. Pam Hill, the
senior executive producer in charge of ``Newsstand,'' resigned.
Even Johnson offered to resign, an offer that was refused by Gerald
M. Levin, the chairman of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, and
Ted Turner, the founder of CNN, who is now vice chairman of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 as a correspondent for
The Associated Press for his Vietnam coverage, came under the gun
for his role in the Tailwind affair. He argued with his CNN bosses
that he should not be let go because he had made minimal
contributions, conducting only three interviews and making no
decisions about the validity of the accusations. He received only a
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation left Arnett in limbo at CNN. Two CNN
co-workers said that Eason Jordan, the president of global news
gathering for CNN, was so angry with Arnett after the Tailwind
incident that he felt he could not use him any more. Jordan was one
of the CNN executives who declined to return phone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, Arnett has been seen on CNN only once. That was in
December, when he filed a report from Algeria. Even then, CNN used
only one of five reports he filed from that country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett said in a telephone interview that he had asked to cover
the war in Yugoslavia, ``but CNN has not seen fit to send me
there.''
</P>
<P>
   On at least two occasions recently, CNN executives, when asked
why Arnett was not a presence in Yugoslavia, said the reason was
that Arnett's specialty was the Mideast, and thus he was not
especially qualified to cover the war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnett pointed out that he covered the Serbian side of the
war in Bosnia in 1994, that he had been in the city of Pale when it
was bombed in 1995 and that he had covered demonstrations in
Belgrade in December 1996 and January 1997. ``I got to know many of
the players there,'' Arnett said. ``I had great access to that side
of this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN declined to explain why it had first tried to explain
Arnett's absence from Kosovo by saying his expertise was in the
Middle East. When asked for confirmation that Arnett was being let
go in July, a spokeswoman, Maggie Simpson, said, ``We have no
comment.'' When asked why Arnett had not been sent to cover the war
in Yugoslavia, she said, ``I don't know.'' When asked when Arnett
last appeared on the air, she said, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tailwind report appeared on June 7, and CNN's retraction
came on July 2. Arnett defended himself in subsequent examinations
of what happened in the Tailwind story by saying that he had been
an insignificant contributor. In one statement, he said he had
added ``not one comma'' to the report.
</P>
<P>
   That comment received widespread criticism both inside and
outside CNN, especially from other reporters who did not want to be
associated with any implication that correspondents only serve as
mouthpieces for reports controlled by news producers. Christiane
Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent _ and currently
its star reporter in its war coverage from Yugoslavia _ scathingly
criticized Arnett, saying, ``I object to the new image of
correspondent as nincompoop.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Arnett's associates at CNN said his job had been
saved only by the intervention of Turner, who asked that Arnett be
retained out of loyalty to his long service to CNN. Indeed, CNN had
found Arnett a highly useful spokesman for the network, dispatching
him to dozens of places around the world in the years after Iraq to
give speeches and lobby for the establishment of CNN bureaus.
Arnett said he had made ``thousands of appearances'' on CNN's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett first said that the word that CNN was seeking to end his
contract ``caught me completely by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I had no hint that it was coming. If they're going
to fire me, they should let me know why.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But he later acknowledged that he was virtually cut off from CNN
since July. ``They gave me a beeper, and they said, `Sit by the
beeper.' But it hasn't beeped.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated that he had specifically asked to cover the war,
``but I've been given no clear reason why I can't cover Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection to his role in Tailwind might seem to be obvious,
given how his assignments dried up. But Arnett said, ``It can't be
Tailwind.'' He cited statements made by Johnson after the
dismissals in July that CNN would take no further action as a
result of its examination of the Tailwind report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that has been written since has confirmed that my
role was minimal,'' Arnett said. ``I know they were concerned about
Tailwind. I'm embarrassed by it. But I did argue the point that I
did not feel I should be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the argument has shifted. Arnett said he wanted to know why
CNN was trying to sever his contract, and refusing to make his
status clear to those who asked about it. ``My reputation is taking
a heavy beating, because I'm not on the air at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett said he had asked his lawyer to try to find some more
amicable way to end his association with CNN. ``If they want to
make an arrangement with me, fine,'' he said. ``My five-year
contract is up in July 2001. I don't think a journalist with my
reputation should be in limbo like this. CNN is an adult company.
They're making a lot of money. They're part of Time Warner.'' &QL;

AS BARRIERS ERODE, REPORTERS CONTRIBUTE TO SEVERAL SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an earlier time of broadcast news, marked by far-flung
correspondents and high-roller budgets, individual news programs
fought for turf, for talent and for money. A correspondent for the
NBC ``Nightly News'' would not be assigned to do a report for, say,
a news magazine, nor would a CBS News domestic reporter be sent to
cover a war.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, no one would have dreamed of asking Diane
Sawyer to combine her prestigious work as a prime-time news
magazine anchor on ABC's ``20/20'' with a five-day-a-week stint in
the folksy world of breakfast-show television. But there she is
now, the co-anchor of ``Good Morning America'' with Charles Gibson
_ and, by all accounts, happy to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The hierarchies and fiefs of television news are breaking down a
bit, driven by the networks' needs to cut costs and by new
management philosophies that see a need for broadcast news reports
to distinguish themselves from the reporting found on 24-hour cable
news networks, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, correspondents are contributing reports to several
programs, not just the one to which they are assigned. Programs are
becoming less territorial about stories and staff.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Yugoslavia is providing many examples.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News assembled a team to report on the Kosovar refugees,
including a senior foreign correspondent from London (Jim Wooten),
a Los Angeles-based domestic reporter (Jane Clayson), a ``20/20''
correspondent (John Quinones) and Gibson, co-anchor of ``Good
Morning America.'' The result was an hour report for ``20/20,'' the
prime-time news magazine, and reports for the Walt Disney Co.-owned
network's other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC foreign correspondents Ron Allen and Jim Maceda, who
have been in Yugoslavia since the war began, have reported for
``Nightly News,'' the morning program ``Today,'' the prime-time
magazine ``Dateline,'' the CNBC business-news cable network and the
MSNBC all-news cable network and World Wide Web site, which are
jointly owned by NBC's parent, the General Electric Co., and the
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Thalia Assuras, a reporter for ``CBS This Morning,'' that
network's breakfast-hour news program, began reporting from Tirana,
Albania, last week on the refugee crisis, and filed a report for
the ``CBS Evening News'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dan Rather, the ``Evening News'' anchor who traveled to
Belgrade last week, has contributed reports since then to his own
6:30 ``Evening News,'' ``CBS This Morning,'' the magazine program
``48 Hours'' and the CBS News Web site as well as six to eight
reports daily for the CBS Radio network.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's economic world,'' said Andrew Heyward, president of
CBS News, ``we've made it very clear to our correspondents that,
with the possible exception of prime-time correspondents, we're
asking all our hard news correspondents to contribute to all of our
broadcasts and to radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Although economics may have kicked off this trend, other reasons
played a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not just 24-hour cable news, but Internet news, local
news, radio news, pager news and everything else,'' said David
Westin, president of ABC News. ``In that world, giving people raw
data is no longer a way of competing. We need to focus on
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   That means pooling the fact-gathering resources of ABC News with
the expertise of producers and correspondents, he said, then
directing the results to whichever programs may best serve viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Quinones of ``20/20'' and Chris Bury, one of two
``Nightline'' correspondents, are reporting separate pieces for
``World News Tonight,'' something that would have been unthinkable
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working toward a situation where ABC News reports the
news, rather than an individual program reports the news,'' Westin
said. ``Does it have cost effects? Of course. But sometimes
economic pressures cause us to do what we should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC News, for example, decided the audience for the early
morning ``Today'' show was news-savvy enough that the network's two
White House correspondents, David Bloom and Claire Shipman, were
divided equally between that program and the ``NBC Nightly News.''
They alternate weeks of reporting for each.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News paved the way in this new multitasking world three
years ago with the creation of the MSNBC cable network and Web
site. Since then, NBC News correspondents and producers have
contributed to all programs on all those outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers benefit from this in getting Tom Brokaw or Brian
Williams on the little cable network,'' said Andrew Kohut, director
of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press in Washington.
``It's good when the resources of the premier news shows can be
brought to bear on smaller shows or on cable.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kohut cautioned, ``working journalists aren't as sanguine
about this as the executives are,'' partly because some feel they
are being stretched too thin.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence K. Grossman, a former president of NBC News who is now
a media consultant and a columnist for the Columbia Journalism
Review, said there are fewer specialists in network news, which
``isn't the end of the world, but it has changed what's reported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic news gathering is farmed out to news agencies, stringers
and freelancers,'' he said, a major event like the war in
Yugoslavia being an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a major story develops, the networks will parachute in one
of their mainstream correspondents from a bureau,'' who will do a
professional but less expert job, he contended.
</P>
<P>
   But such methods do save money. Last year all three broadcast
news divisions had to shrink their costs.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS Corporation gave pink slips to about 120 people in the
fall, about 7 percent of the CBS News staff, though none of those
dismissed were correspondents. ABC News and NBC News made similar
reductions, without setting percentage quotas or publicizing
precise layoff figures.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News achieved some savings last year by not renewing
contracts of five correspondents, though it has also hired two new
correspondents this year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ABC News told George Strait, a longtime medical
correspondent for ``World News Tonight,'' that his contract would
not be renewed. In part, this was because Dr. Tim Johnson and Dr.
Nancy Snyderman were contributing reports to all programs, enough
that news executives felt that beat was adequately covered without
Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ABC News did not renew the contract of Tim O'Brien,
who has covered the Supreme Court for ``World News Tonight'' for 22
years, choosing to rely on its recently formed law and justice
unit, whose correspondents are John Miller and Terry Moran,
formerly of Court TV.

INTEL'S CHAIRMAN TELLS NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS TO SUPPLY MORE INSIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Me., Md., Okla., Wis., Colo., Ala., Wash.)  (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The gloom-and-doom predictions were nothing new
to the members of the American Society of Newspapers Editors, but
there was still something arresting about hearing the chairman of
the Intel Corp. saying that the newspaper business had three years
to live. Their eyes may have rolled in ``not-this-again'' circles
when Andrew S. Grove offered his jeremiad, but editors do know a
good sound bite when they hear one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are where Intel was three years before the roof fell in on
us,'' said Grove, referring to his company's near-death experience
in the late 1980s, when its original product, memory chips, became
unprofitable. A switch to microprocessors later propelled Intel to
the top ranks of American industry. As far as newspapers are
concerned, ``to use today's Internet terminology, you get my
eyeballs with the news coverage and you sell me commercials, sell
me advertising,'' Grove said. ``You're under attack at both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the way Grove gets his news. He told his audience on
Wednesday that he gets both breaking news from the Reuters news
service and news of the high-technology industry online. And in the
evening, he looks at the paper versions of The San Jose Mercury and
The Wall Street Journal, seeking background and interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's already stolen a third to a half of my eyeball time
away from you,'' Grove said.
</P>
<P>
   His solution: write and edit newspapers that play to the
medium's competitive advantage, its ability to bring perspective to
the tumbling cascade of news events. And convince publishers that
the end is nigh, so that they invest in expensive and unique news
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Grove knew his audience. The group might have already heard that
the Internet marauders were going to plunder newspapers'
high-margin classifieds and to carry off the audience. But telling
editors their publishers need to spend more on news gathering is
not a bad gambit.
</P>
<P>
   What Grove did not mention, however, was one particular
investment that the editors of the smallest of the country's 1,500
newspapers are pining for: an increase in reporters' salaries,
which now start at $16,000 in some small communities.
</P>
<P>
   Small newspapers are having trouble finding reporters and
editors.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the lure of online journalism, as Terri Fleming,
the editor of The Gazette of Colorado Springs (circulation 99,500)
believes, or simply the need to find a better salary to meet
college-loan payments, as Rex Rhoades, of The Sun Journal in
Lewiston, Me., believes, more editors of papers with circulations
of 50,000 or less are scrambling to find anyone to cover the school
committee and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Edward D. Casey, editor of The Capital in Annapolis, Md.,
circulation 46,750, has in the last nine months paid $1,000 signing
bonuses to two new reporters. ``With graduation coming up, we would
normally have 40 resumes in by this time,'' he said. ``We probably
have five, maybe 10.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capital's starting salary, just raised to $25,000, is $4,000
more than that of The Sun Journal in Lewiston. With a circulation
of 38,500, ``we have two openings we can't fill,'' said Rhoades,
the paper's editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time someone leaves, it's a crisis,'' said Don
Huebscher, of The Leader Telegraph of Eau Claire, Wis., circulation
29,700. ``We used to get 70 or 80 people for each job opening. Now
we get two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   Without surveys, there are only anecdotes, whose larger message
is disputed by other editors. Editors of some larger papers, like
Joe Worley of The Tulsa World, circulation about 160,000, say they
have no problem _ the journalism departments at Oklahoma State and
the University of Oklahoma fill his needs.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, H. Brandt Ayers, the publisher of The Anniston Star in
northern Alabama, circulation 27,500, said he had 100 applicants
just for summer internships.
</P>
<P>
   But if many neophytes are going directly to larger markets, the
result is having more untried journalists making their inevitable
mistakes before a larger audience. That's something that should
scare the big papers, said Rick L. Doyle, editor of The Walla Walla
Union-Bulletin, a small newspaper in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When Grove spoke, he made the crowd-pleasing exhortation that
newspapers' future required investment now. ``From a publisher's
standpoint, there's going to be a huge push and pull,'' he said,
``This requires more money at a time when margins are going to be
under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In small newspapers, with a small advertising base, there may be
very little to invest. But if something is not done to make young
people aspire to be reporters, the editors, too, will have to look
for another line of work.

tobacco producers and 46 states. For anti-smoking groups, the end
of the cigarette billboard stands as a major victory, a choking-off
of an advertising medium that tobacco producers dominated for
nearly 20 years. But it also marks another change, one in this
country's visual landscape. For decades, outdoor tobacco signs were
the canvas used by some of the advertising industry's most-talented

LIFE IN BELGRADE: STRUGGLING FOR NORMALCY AS THE BOMBS FALL

   KIJEVO, Yugoslavia _ Little Sara, nearly 5, gets to watch her
beloved ``Ninja Turtles'' on tele-vision, and ``Power Rangers,''
too. But NATO bombs and missiles keep striking targets in Rakovica
and Zarkovo, near this southern Belgrade suburb. So she has been
sleeping in the basement every night for the last 25 nights _ and
counting _ of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia's President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   She no longer huddles in a corner, hugging herself, when the
bombs go off, said her mother, Biljana, talking in the family
living room, whose walls are now cracked from the shaking of the
earth when the bombs thud home.
</P>
<P>
   Biljana and her husband, Mile, 37, described the first night of
NATO's bombing in an interview with The Times the next day, March
25, her 32nd birthday. Despite the air-raid sirens, no one believed
that bombs would actually fall, and Sara insisted that night on
watching ``Ninja Turtles'' until the sky exploded and she told her
mother that she wanted to die.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month later, Biljana says, family life under the bombs
has settled into a wrenching, nerve-racking routine, where the
coming of each day brings both surprise and a new set of anxieties
that the adults try to hide from the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make it a game for Sara and Nemanja,'' Sara's
6-year-old brother, Biljana said. ``At night, after dinner, we
watch cartoons or read tales, Disney stories, and then when the air
raid sirens go off, about 8:30, we go down to the shelter. I have
books down there for them, and I sit with them until they fall
asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulled Sara to her and plastered her perfect cheek with a
kiss. ``I try to protect them somehow,'' she said, ``so they won't
remember too much later, when it's finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   The children hear the sirens and see the air-raid warning symbol
superimposed on the television screen. ``But I don't think they
actually know much about the bombing,'' Biljana said. ``They just
know that when they hear the alert they have to go to the
shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole family _ the two children, Biljana and Mile, and his
parents, Aleksandar and Duka _ sleeps in the tiny concrete
basement, originally built for storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty crowded down there,'' said Mile. ``We all sleep
together, like pigs in a sty.'' But he can hear the booms and feel
the earth shudder, and he has trouble sleeping. ``I get up and
prowl around, and if it's peaceful, I go upstairs,'' he said. ``I
turn on the television, to see what's being bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   He normally rises about 4 a.m. and leaves for his job at an
electrical-engineering plant at 5:45. If the bombs are nearby, he
sleeps just a couple of hours, consumed with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day is shorter now,'' Biljana said. ``The night is always
early and the morning always seems to come late. You lie there,
wondering if you will survive until the morning.'' She grabbed a
racing Sara and hugged her. ``It's the end of the 20th century and
it's like living in a village,'' she said. ``When the sun goes
down, it's over, the air raid siren goes and that's it for the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mile now calls his homemade plum brandy ``Tomahawk,'' after the
American cruise missiles, because he says it's a ``precision
weapon.'' The future may be opaque and bleak, he says. ``But I've
got enough Tomahawk for one year, and that's got to be enough!''
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, has grown sadder and more angry in the last 31/2
weeks of war. He admits, shamefully, that when he goes off to work
at dawn, it's with relief. ``I'm somehow free, because I don't see
the kids and worry about them,'' he said. ``But when I come home
and see them, I feel terrible, so guilty, and I get worried sick
about them.''
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed at another cigarette. ``Why are the children
guilty?'' he demanded, angry. ``What for? What did they do? Who did
they abuse?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has noticed changes in his own personality _ if he
is more short-tempered, is smoking or drinking more _ he laughs
hugely and raises his glass. ``No,'' he said. ``I'm drinking
normally!''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed, and then he paused. ``I am smoking more, at
least when I can find cigarettes,'' he said. ``Actually, it feels
like I'm dreaming, that my life is not real.''
</P>
<P>
   Biljana said: ``It's the lack of a future. You can't plan. You
can't know about tomorrow, or next week. How long will it last? How
can it end? All you do is think about how to save the children, to
spare them.''
</P>
<P>
   Biljana also works, now on the afternoon shift. She is at her
factory from noon to 8 p.m., while her in-laws and neighbors take
care of the children. ``The whole day disappears,'' she said. ``I
come home and make a quick dinner before the alert, and then get
the kids downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mile broke in. ``I can't see the end. I watch the news, just to
look to see if there's a sign that it's ending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an optimist,'' Biljana said. ``I hope it will end soon. If
I wasn't an optimist I'd go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she misses most, Biljana gave an involuntary sob,
looking away, wiping at her eyes. ``I adore the spring,'' she said
softly. ``My parents live nearby, just two bus stops away, and I
like walking to visit them, or going to Kosutnjak,'' a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't now,'' she said. ``I can't know what will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Here Mile broke in, angry again. ``How many lives must we lose
before NATO can declare a victory?'' he demanded. ``What
satisfaction will the Americans get? How many of us must die to
keep NATO's reputation?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the fate of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Serbs
generally bluster, or repeat the themes of the state-controlled
media: that the Kosovo Liberation Army is the cause of every
difficulty; that the Serb forces cannot allow themselves to be
``shot in the back'' by civilian sympathizers of the rebel army;
that Albanians in Macedonia are pretending to be refugees from
Kosovo; and that NATO's propaganda effort is simply more effective
than Belgrade's.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the Albanians, Mile echoes each of these themes, then
cites the purging of 200,000 Serbs from the Krajina, in Croatia, in
just a few days when Croatian forces recaptured Serb-held territory
there in 1995. ``The Americans did nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So where were the Americans when the Croats were killing Serbs
in Krajina?'' Mile asked. ``Why didn't NATO bomb Zagreb? It just
looks like someone's plan to dismember a great country.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Biljana describe the fate of her uncle, Milan
Svilar. He was a Serb married to a Croat, living in Stuttgart. When
the civil wars were raging in 1992, he traveled to Croatia to
rescue her mother. ``The last time we heard from him was when he
called his wife from Croatia,'' Biljana said. ``He was crying, and
he told her he thought he would be lucky as a Serb to survive that
night. After that, we heard nothing. We still don't know what
happened to him.''

<P>
   Their friends, Aleksandar and Aleksandra, known as Sasa and
Saska, stop in. Saska, 31, a former ballet dancer, describes a
newspaper article about a Russian fortune teller who says that
President Clinton is a Satanist and who predicted that Yugoslavia
would be bombed at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says that after the first snow of spring melts, and then
after the second snow, there will be good times for Yugoslavia,''
she said. ``He says that the Yugoslav passport will become more
valuable than the French one.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband snorted. ``And then Santa Claus will come,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   They have two children, Luka, 7, and Damijan, 3, whom Saska
describes as a little devil, like his namesake (Damien) of the
American horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damijan hates the shelter,'' Saska said. ``He wants to sleep
with us, to be anywhere there are people.''
</P>
<P>
   Biljana said: ``You know, it's only when the kids are in the
shelter that I can relax at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Luka, though, gets silent, his father said. ``When there are
explosions, there is real fear in his eyes. They get oily and big,
but he doesn't cry. When there are explosions in the night, I tell
him, `We are shooting at enemy planes.' And he said: `Or are they
shooting at us?' `'
</P>
<P>
   Sasa, a sensitive man of 37 who works with computers, said: ``I
try to explain to him not to hate, not to hate Americans and
American things, that American people are not bombing us, but their
leaders. He asks, `Why do people elect these politicians?' And I
say, `I don't have influence on Milosevic, and the same is true of
Americans.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Does Luka understand what is happening? His father thought for a
long moment, then said: ``I don't really know. There are a lot of
voices in his head.'' He stopped again, then said: ``He knows more
than we expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasa watches CNN and Sky News and reads widely on the Internet,
including NATO's own web site. Yet he, too, regards a considerable
part of the story of Albanian suffering as propaganda. ``You
wouldn't know from Western channels that the K.L.A. is fighting a
war,'' he said. And he pointed to a CNN report about 40,000
Albanians suddenly appearing one night in Macedonia and said:
``Impossible. In one night? We know the Albanians in Macedonia
organized this like a show, to elicit sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every side makes propaganda,'' Sasa said, and then he cited
Churchill, saying: ``When war begins, the first victim is always
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasa, who has marched for democracy here, sees the war
foreclosing his children's opportunities. ``Like every father,'' he
said, ``I want the best in the world for my children, from anywhere
it can be found _ the best movies, the best books, the best
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I really fear is that we will end up isolated, like
Cubans,'' he said. ``We are being screwed from both ends, from
Milosevic and from NATO, which is helping Milosevic screw us even
more, and now he's dragging us closer to Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, took another precious cigarette, lit it, then said
slowly: ``NATO is pushing us under the ice.''

MEDIA TALK: AWKWARD MOMENT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE?; STATISTICS ARE
MIXED ON MINORITY HIRING; CONDE NAST `OUTSERTS' SEEK NEW
ADVERTISERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton stands on stage at the White House
Correspondents Dinner in the Washington Hilton on May 1, he is
scheduled to shake hands and stand for photographs with the three
journalists who have won awards for their coverage of the White
House this year.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do if you're the president and one of the award
winners almost cost you your job?
</P>
<P>
   This year, Clinton will find himself in the somewhat awkward
position of honoring Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek correspondent
who broke the story that led to his impeachment and who refers to
Clinton in his current best-selling book, ``Uncovering Clinton: A
Reporter's Story,'' as ``a far more psychologically disturbed
individual than the public ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   The award recipients have not yet been publicly announced, but
according to the partially updated Web site of the White House
Correspondents Association, Isikoff will receive the Edgar A. Poe
award for reporting over the last year that offered ``nuanced,
detailed and often exclusive information in a story that dominated
the year's headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The award for Isikoff comes at an interesting time. Several
years of eyebrow-raising dinner guests _ Paula Jones, Anne Heche,
Ellen DeGeneres _ have turned the once-quiet dinner into an antic
opera bouffe of media, celebrity and politics. And this year, John
F. Kennedy Jr. has invited Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, actress
Claire Danes and conservative multimillionaire Richard Mellon
Scaife to the dinner as the guests of George magazine. All have
accepted, said a George spokeswoman, Lisa Dallos.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oreskes, Washington bureau chief of The New York Times,
has expressed his concerns over the direction of the dinner and
said that the newspaper will not purchase a table at the dinner
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to restore some dignity to the proceedings,
however, the president of the White House Correspondents
Association, Stewart M. Powell, said he had made choices that
reflect the dinner's original intent, which he said was to honor
the president of the United States and to present awards and
scholarships. For one thing, Aretha Franklin will perform this
year, not one of the usual comedians, who have in the past thrown
jibes the President's way.

   Statistics Are Mixed On Minority Hiring
</P>
<P>
   One of the most contentious issues at the annual convention of
the American Society of Newspaper Editors last year _ the degree to
which the newspaper business is trying to hire journalists from
underrepresented groups, particularly members of minorities and
women _ was less of a sore point this year at the society's
convention in San Francisco. Still, amid a strong push for more
hiring of members of minorities _ including job fairs and increased
proselytizing about the newspaper business _ the percentage of
minorities remained little changed.
</P>
<P>
   The annual data the industry compiled showed a slight increase
in minority representation among the 55,100 journalists working in
the nation's newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 6,365 Asian, black, American Indian and Hispanic
journalists _ up from 6,270 _ now make up 11.6 percent of the
newsroom work force. Women, who were counted this year for the
first time after some initial resistance, make up 36.9 percent of
newspaper journalists. Of these 20,325 women, 14 percent are
members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who want to see a greater level of diversity in
newsrooms, there were unsettling trends buried in the larger
statistics. The percentage of members of minorities among
first-time hires for full-time jobs dropped to 18.7 percent from 21
percent last year. In the wake of court rulings against racial
preferences in minority hiring, the percentage of members of
minorities among interns hired in 1998 dropped to 31.3 percent from
a peak of 39.6 percent in 1991 and 33.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual newspapers, the two larger papers with the
highest percentage of minorities were The Oakland Tribune, with
47.8 percent, and The Miami Herald, with 46.8 percent. Among the
larger papers with the lowest percentages were The Minneapolis
Star-Tribune, 11.5 percent; The Boston Herald, 8.5 percent, and The
St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the paper with the greatest diversity was
The Jersey Journal in Jersey City, N.J.; more than 30 percent of
its newsroom staff are members of minorities. Newsday is next with
21.4 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported a minority staff
percentage of 17.6; The New York Times, 15.6; the Daily News, 13.9;
and the New York Post, 12.6.

   Conde Nast `Outserts' Seek New Advertisers
</P>
<P>
   In a shift aimed at bringing new advertisers to the pages of its
magazines, Conde Nast has begun churning out special issues with
targeted audiences that attract new advertisers to Conde Nast, a
unit of Advance Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the one-time supplement ``Currency'' attracted
financial advertisers who had never before advertised with the
company. This fall, ``Persona'' _ a title for women over 40, with
an array of advertisers from Prudential Securities to General
Motors _ will be produced as an ``outsert,'' an additional magazine
that is packed into a polyurethane bag with an already existing
magazine. (The practice known as ``poly-bagging.'') In the case of
Persona, the issue will be ``poly-bagged'' with 14 of the Conde
Nast titles. The frequency of Persona's publication has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Viscardi Johnston, a Conde Nast executive
vice-president said that these issues begin as ``marketing
opportunities.'' Persona appealed to her because it ``creates
opportunities for advertisers, with an attractive editorial
surround.''
</P>
<P>
   And what advertiser doesn't crave good editorial ``surround''?
Now, Mademoiselle is going after advertisers in the computer and
software market. Elizabeth Crow, the editor in chief of the Conde
Nast title Mademoiselle, said that the monthly magazine will
introduce an outsert this October, separately titled Click Here,
which will address the issues of computers and the Internet in
young women's lives.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the magazine will include ``a lot of first-person
stuff, like `I Was an On-Line Shopaholic.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, said that
Conde Nast's program of ``outserts'' like Persona and Click Here,
reflects a growing trend in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers are going after marketing programs, not just ad
pages,'' he said. ``These one-time issues bring in new advertisers,
and Conde Nast can say to those advertisers: `Buy a page here, but
you have to buy two pages in Persona.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The down side is that these are often one-time
issues, so you're not having an ongoing dialogue with readers that
we at one time paid so much attention to.''

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Each time a revolutionary new technology has
arrived, the governments of the day have been leery of its capacity
for mischief and criminality. Centuries ago, there were calls for
giving the authorities the power of prior restraint lest the
printing press become an instrument of sedition and slander. Later,
there were qualms about selling automobiles to the public because
crooks could use them to escape the police.
</P>
<P>
   As the designated representative of this rich and checkered
tradition, Philip Reitinger, a prosecutor for the Justice
Department, knew he faced a tough crowd here. He was speaking last
Wednesday at a conference to mark the 35th anniversary of the
founding of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a gathering of technology's
true believers.
</P>
<P>
   Reitinger, square-jawed and pin-striped, opened with a bit of
dry humor, laced with sarcasm. ``It may come as a shock to many of
you, but people commit crimes on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So began a spirited discussion and debate on a seemingly narrow
subject, ``Should the Laboratory for Computer Science Anonymous
Remailer Be Shut Down?'' But it was a discussion that focused on
some of the broadest social and legal issues involving the
Internet: identity, privacy, anonymity and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Reitinger's opposite number on the panel was Nadine Strossen, a
professor at the New York Law School and president of the American
Civil Liberties Union. They were joined by Frans Kaashoek, an
associate professor at MIT, who has been in charge of the anonymous
remailer since it began operating in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous remailer, a type of data-network relay, is
essentially a technological buffer. It can be used to mask the
origin of a piece of e-mail or the computer from which a person is
browsing the World Wide Web. It does this by stripping off the
identifying information on an e-mail, for example, and substituting
an anonymous code number or term. Sophisticated remailers, like the
one at MIT, also route messages through many different relay
computers around the world, leaving no record of the path an
anonymous message traveled after leaving the remailer.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 40 anonymous remail services worldwide. They are
used by, among others, dissidents and human rights representatives
living in nations with repressive governments, whistle-blowers
inside companies or government agencies, minority groups fearing
discrimination and people wishing to avoid the bulk e-mail
advertising pitches that marketers increasingly send over the Net.
In Kosovo, some people with online connections have started using
anonymous remail services to try to maintain confidential
communications and avoid detection by the Serbian military.
</P>
<P>
   But anonymous remail services, federal prosecutors say, are also
used by child pornographers, extortionists, software pirates and
drug dealers. Though not illegal, remailers are often viewed with
suspicion by law enforcement agencies. They occupy a gray area in
cyberspace, and Kaashoek of MIT good-naturedly underscored that
fact by wearing a black ski mask, showing only his eyes, for much
of the panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anonymity has a down side to it,'' Reitinger said. ``It's hard
to put a pseudonym in jail. There are not a lot of indictments that
say, United States of America vs. John Doe. If people are truly
anonymous, there can be no law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Reitinger and Ms. Strossen of the ACLU have debated these issues
in the past, so their early exchanges had the practiced rhythms of
old sparring partners. Her opening salvo: ``We've got to make sure
that freedom of speech, freedom of the press and privacy are as
protected in cyberspace as they are in the rest of life. Certain
individual rights cannot be sacrificed because of the panic and
fears of abuse of a new technology, or because it creates problems
for law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Reitinger, a senior counsel in the Justice Department's computer
crime and intellectual property division, agreed that the Internet
had made his life more difficult. Trying to trace a path of
criminal communications often involves working with law enforcement
authorities in eight to 20 nations, he observed.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous remailers can make that tracing far more difficult, if
not impossible. Kaashoek said MIT had received several subpoenas
from state and federal authorities since the university's remailer
was set up in 1996. MIT, he said, has answered the subpoenas but he
noted that typically the tracking information it can offer involves
only one leg of a many-legged path of communication. ``If a person
is using our system correctly,'' Kaashoek said, ``law enforcement
isn't going to find that information very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   As a communications medium, the Internet does seem unique in the
way that it magnifies the issues of privacy and anonymity. ``The
problem is that this technology is just so darned powerful,'' said
Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future. ``It makes
it easy to be anonymous, but it can also make it far easier to
track people down and invade their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Saffo did not attend the debate, but both Ms. Strossen and
Reitinger addressed the point that Internet technology has raised
the stakes on matters of privacy. Both agreed that the technology
poses difficult challenges, though they approached the subject from
understandably different vantage points.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strossen said she was ``very concerned'' that new software
technology allows corporations or governments to track a person's
every mouse click and to assemble vast digital dossiers on
individuals. ``It can include all your personal financial
transactions and your medical records,'' she observed. ``I don't
think our laws adequately protect individual privacy anymore. The
technologies of anonymity and cryptography may be the only way to
protect privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Reitinger responded: ``I think we are perilously close
to a lose-lose situation in which citizens have lost their privacy
to commercial interests and criminals have easy access to absolute
anonymity. That's not a world we want.''
</P>
<P>
   There was scattered clapping for various remarks made during the
debate, but that comment from Reitinger was greeted with sustained
applause. Sophisticated criminals, of course, will always have
access to the latest technology, whether cars or software. Nodding
to that reality, Reitinger told the audience of computer
scientists, ``I'm just asking that you help law enforcement to
capture the stupid criminals.''

YUGOSLAV STOCK OF URANIUM WORRIES NUCLEAR INSPECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ International nuclear inspectors are worried
that 132 pounds of highly enriched uranium at the Vinca Institute
of Nuclear Science, 10 miles from Belgrade, Yugoslavia, may be used
improperly or may be hit by an errant NATO missile.
</P>
<P>
   David Kyd, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which monitors nuclear activities around the world, said
Friday that his agency's main concerns were the ``physical security
of the material'' and the possibility of ``radiological risk''
should a bomb hit the plant.
</P>
<P>
   American political analysts also expressed a concern that the
Yugoslavs, if pushed, might embark on a nuclear weapons program or
use the material for bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and
International Security, an arms control research group in
Washington, said there was enough material at Vinca to make two
nuclear weapons of an implosion-type design, which Iraq was
pursuing, and one bomb of a ``gun type'' design, which South Africa
has made.
</P>
<P>
   Both American officials and the international inspectors
stressed that there was no evidence of Yugoslavia's abandoning its
longstanding renunciation of nuclear weapons. Nor are there signs,
they said, that elements within the military are diverting the
uranium or taking other steps that would suggest an intention to
develop a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia has a very good record,'' Kyd said. ``We have no
concerns that they would misuse or misappropriate the highly
enriched uranium.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that since late January, his agency has been
unable to visit the installation, as it usually does each month,
and that for the past two weeks it has not been able even to
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Yugoslavia's representative at the
international agency wrote to Mohamed el-Baradei of Egypt, the
director general, to express his concern about a possible allied
attack on Vinca. The letter asked the agency for its help in ending
the bombing and asked Baradei to discuss the risk of an attack with
both NATO and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In response, an international inspector said, the agency
stressed that Yugoslavia was responsible for protecting the
uranium. The agency also expressed its desire to inspect the plant
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Although they say there is no indication that Yugoslavia intends
to renege on its commitment not to develop nuclear weapons, Western
diplomats and arms control experts have expressed deep concern
about the lack of inspections because, they say, Vinca has
inadequate physical protection and a poor history of handling
radioactive material.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A few years ago, Albright said, the international agency
improved security at the plant. Vinca has also received help from
Russia and others to enable it to better handle nuclear waste
produced by its nuclear reactors, both of which have been closed
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   But, Albright added, there are still safety concerns about 5,000
spent fuel rods that are stored in some 30 aluminum casks in a pool
of water. The casks must be carefully treated to prevent an
accidental leak.
</P>
<P>
   American officials and international experts played down the
possibility that Yugoslavia could make nuclear-laced weapons. ``The
amount of material is too small and far too stale, that is, too old
to be used as a radiological weapon,'' a senior administration
official said. ``The radioactive material has been sitting in the
spent fuel ponds for years, and there's very little of it to make a
serious weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyd agreed that Yugoslavia would be hard pressed to make a
radiological bomb _ a ``dirty nuke'' _ from the material. He added
that it would be difficult for Belgrade to separate the plutonium
in the spent fuel to make a bomb or to disperse it to cause panic
and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslavs do not have the ability to remove plutonium from
the low-enriched uranium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and the international inspectors said
Vinca was not on the list of NATO targets. Even if it were hit by
accident, one official said, the damage to the people of the
surrounding area and the environment would not be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it could be messy,'' a senior administration official
said. ``But there would not be major radiological contamination.
We're not talking Chernobyl or Three Mile Island here.''

CARTOON CHARACTERS IMITATE, EVEN TRANSCEND THE LIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is really a shame that the entertainment industry continues
to believe that if a good thing works once it will work even better
twice, thrice and then as many times as ratings and profits allow
before going bad.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shame because it means that every advance contains the
seeds of its own decay. So we have every reason to fear the success
of all those smart, saucy television cartoon series made for
viewers somewhere between the legal voting age and senior
citizenship. I mean, of course, shows like ``The Simpsons,'' ``King
of the Hill,'' ``The PJs,'' ``Futurama'' and ``South Park'' that
relish satire as well as farce. They can even find room for
tenderness that is on the wry side, not in the maudlin middle.
</P>
<P>
   If greed and knockoff imitation run true to form, we will soon
be heading into a glut of highly touted second- and third-rate
shows. (``Family Guy'' suggests we're on our way.) Too bad for us.
But too bad for television also. It is the perfect medium for
innovative animation, not the lowly second choice.
</P>
<P>
   Movies don't do any of this better, and they don't do most of it
as well, when you consider content as well as form. Their animation
epics (insect epics, Bible epics, history and folklore epics) are
loaded with showoff effects or faux-human sincerity and music that
goes back and forth between treacly and perky.
</P>
<P>
   No, it is the condensed, focused television cartoons that are
advancing the form. I think this is because their creators, apart
from being clever and talented, know television history: not just
the history of cartoons like ``The Flintstones'' or Rocky and
Bullwinkle, but the history of the half-hour sitcom and melodrama.
We know what is nonnaturalistic about sitcoms, but just think about
those old thrillers. What is more cartoonish than a convention that
requires a crisis to be laid out, exploited and resolved in less
than 30 minutes, making room for the total ruptures in attention
that commercials impose?
</P>
<P>
   The classic television sitcom was and is family fare, whether
centered in the home or in the kind of workplace that creates a
facsimile family. Track the progression from the innocent emotional
pratfalls of ``I Love Lucy,'' ``Father Knows Best'' and ``Our Miss
Brooks'' to shows like ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``All in the
Family,'' ``The Jeffersons'' ``Cheers'' and ``Roseanne,'' where
hostility and confusion are right there beside the old-time laughs,
supplying the most intense comic charge.
</P>
<P>
   Then go a few steps further. Cartoon humans like Homer and Marge
Simpson and the rest of their circle are as grotesque and
ineffectual as we fear (or know) ourselves to be on occasion. The
little boys of ``South Park'' _ four white egg figures bouncing
along on flat feet _ are as belligerent and uninhibited as we would
like to have been (and were when we could get away with it) in
those precious early childhood years. And the big-eyed, big-headed
PJs, more like puppets than cartoon figures, look as ready to pop
out of the television screen as their real-life counterparts are to
bust out of their lousy neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Week after week ``The Simpsons'' manages to show that the words
``nuclear waste'' can be applied as easily to a family as to a
chemical plant. ``The PJs'' proves that the mocking humor of black
minstrelsy can extend outward to a nonblack audience, not just
inward to self-hatred. ``South Park'' shows that there is such a
thing as white minstrelsy, which can make fun of its own opinions
and conventions, not just those considered alien or politically
correct.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen only two episodes of ``Futurama,'' the new show from
Matt Groening, the creator of ``The Simpsons.'' But the year-3000
look of ``Futurama'' is great fun: all the technology we know,
hyperextended and activated; all the cultural artifacts we live
with, relocated (Earth theme parks on the Moon); and our
biochemical systems inverted (the robot that lives on alcohol and
gets the D.T.'s when dead sober).
</P>
<P>
   Every one of these shows mixes cheerfully shallow comic gags
with parody (affectionate but pointed gibes at everything from
consumer fads to psychological theories) and satire, that angrier
critic of the status quo (the greed of the rich and the powerful,
the chasms separating what children think and want from what their
parents and teachers think and want for them and the pure everyday
shallowness and selfishness that the ordinary well-meaning human
being manages to get mired in).
</P>
<P>
   It is this mixture of tone, motive and genre that makes these
cartoons so right for television. Television brings us the banal,
the arcane, the extreme, the violent and the pastoral, uplift and
degradation, all within seconds, if we wish. It supplies
entertainment that is both disposable and indispensable. It
specializes in giving us that delicious mix of the valuable and the
throwaway.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an insight side by side with the platitude, a scene that
demands all our attention, followed by a commercial that demands
none (or that demands as much as the scene did). Television gives
us quick, easy pleasures and hidden messages. (We look for them
constantly in reruns or in the tapes we play over and over.)
</P>
<P>
   Like cartoons, television sets themselves are some of the most
abnormal vehicles of entertainment ever to have entered our
ostensibly normal lives and homes.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A day after the fall of the Hindu
nationalist-led government, leaders of the opposition Congress
Party began trying to patch together a new coalition to govern this
nation of 980 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But any new alliance drawn from the diverse and contentious
collection of opposition parties is likely to be as rickety as the
one that just lost power, political analysts and some Congress
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the opposition is unable to cobble together a majority,
President K.R. Narayanan is empowered to dissolve the Parliament
and call new elections, the second round in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, now serving as a temporary
caretaker, told workers for his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party Sunday to prepare for new elections because he does not
expect any new government to last long.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever leads the next government will be faced with the crucial
questions of whether to sign the nuclear test ban treaty and how to
calibrate the country's hostile relationship with its neighbor,
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's government alarmed the world last May when it
conducted nuclear tests, which Pakistan rapidly answered with tests
of its own. Last week, each of the two nations, which have fought
three wars with each other in 51 years, tested ballistic missiles
that can carry nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   India's Parliament was split almost down the middle between
supporters and opponents of the year-old government that collapsed.
On Saturday, Vajpayee's coalition lost a confidence vote by a
single vote. Tellingly, Vajpayee, aggravated by months of very
public squabbling within his own coalition, said after he resigned,
``I feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden of coalition politics has now shifted to the Congress
Party. The opposition had just enough votes to defeat the
government, but several small parties whose members voted to oust
Vajpayee's coalition may also oppose a government led by the
Congress Party. And they have enough votes to deprive a new
coalition of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Congress leader, Madhavrao Scindia, gave this advice to
those who want to know what will happen: ``Go to the local
astrologer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Congress is in a flap about it,'' he said.
``We'll put in an effort to form a government, but it has to be
assured a minimum of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear Sunday whether the Congress president, Sonia
Gandhi, heir to the political family that has dominated Indian
politics since independence in 1947, would seek to become prime
minister. On Friday a party spokesman said she would be the
candidate, but party officials were less categorical on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's touch-and-go whether she will lead,'' one Congress leader
said. ``It is her personal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said it would have been better for the Congress
Party, which now has only 140 of the 545 votes in Parliament, if
the Vajpayee government had survived and hobbled along. The party
could have used the time to continue rebuilding its grass-roots
organization. And it could have strengthened its voting base for
parliamentary elections in five states scheduled for next March.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's fall was precipitated this week when
Jayalalitha Jayaram, a scene-stealing former actress who heads a
party from the state of Tamil Nadu, withdrew the support of her
party's 18 members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is being pitchforked into power at the whim of
Jayalalitha,'' said E. Sridharan, a political scientist who works
for the University of Pennsylvania's Institute for the Advanced
Study of India here in New Delhi. ``I don't think they're keen to
form a government. This is not their script.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   However, if Congress is to head a new coalition, it has little
choice but to turn to Ms. Jayaram, who was the most troublesome of
Vajpayee's coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, she quit the government over issues of national
security, but officials with the Bharatiya Janata Party said she
was angry because Vajpayee refused to dismiss the state government
of Tamil Nadu, which is aggressively pursuing corruption charges
against her.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Congress Party is this: Leaders of a rival
party from Tamil Nadu, which has three votes in Parliament, say
they will have no part of a coalition that includes Ms. Jayaram,
whom they contend is profoundly corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fat lady will certainly insist on being in the
government,'' said a Congress Party official, disdainfully
referring to Ms. Jayaram. Refusing to be quoted by name, he added:
``If you take one group from Tamil Nadu, the other is upset. It's a
big problem. If we lose even one party, we're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Congress did manage to form a government with Ms.
Jayaram involved, it would be dependent on her, and she is a
headline-grabbing politician who could well quit in a huff again if
she did not get what she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading newspapers said in editorials Sunday that
elections offer the best hope for a more stable government. Only
the voters can give one or the other of the nation's largest
parties _ Bharatiya Janata or Congress _ a stronger mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Parliament is genetically constructed to give us no more
than instability,'' The Indian Express said. ``It is time,
therefore, to give the voter a chance to rectify this. Now, or in
the winter, an election this year is an inevitability.''

` DREAM TRUE:' OH, TO BE BACK HOME IN WYOMING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It doesn't take a strict Freudian to figure out
what's ailing Peter Emmons, the hero of ``Dream True.'' Wrenched as
a boy from the home and the people he loves, and sent into the care
of a rich uncle of complex inner torments, Peter spends the rest of
his life trying to undo the damage of this devastatingly bad
decision and recreate the nurturing cocoon of his childhood in
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The chroniclers of Peter's tale, the composer Ricky Ian Gordon
and the director Tina Landau, don't want you to fuss too much about
the clinical details, either. What they have in mind in this
exotic, flawed and strangely moving musical is something more
daring: a melodic language for longing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream True,'' which opened Sunday night at the Vineyard
Theater, is a truly perplexing experience. The story it tells is on
the self-important side, yet the way it spins it is wholly
original: the first musical, perhaps, to make a conscious appeal to
the subconscious. Like the dream world itself, ``Dream True''
orbits in an alternate universe where rationality takes a back seat
to sensation. ``Imagine a place, but it's really more of a
feeling,'' Peter (played by Jeff McCarthy) says to his wife, Madge
(Judy Kuhn), at the start of the show. ``No walls. No separation
between you and everything. All there is is open space.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Vineyard's open space _ the set is an empty honey-colored
canvas, a blank page, if you will _ Gordon, who wrote the music,
and Ms. Landau, who contributed the book and lyrics, try to render
this landscape of pure feeling. At times, the results are striking
in their beauty, as in the gentle ballad called ``Finding Home,''
sung by Jessica Molaskey, playing the mother to the young Peter
(Alex Bowen), or in ``The Best for You,'' a stirring second-act
duet for McCarthy and Ms. Kuhn. All the while, Jan Hartley's lovely
panoramic projections of Manhattan mornings and Big Sky evenings
adorn the back wall of the stage, mural-size images out of postcard
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   These effects and moments are the sweet building blocks of an
earnest entertainment that takes itself a little too seriously.
``Dream True'' is sometimes heartbreaking, but at all times
humorless: even the darkest dreams, after all, can provide comic
relief. How forgiving you are about the show's shortcomings will
depend on how compelling you find the creators' conceits, and also
perhaps on what else you may have seen lately.
</P>
<P>
   Of the various attempts this season by New York's institutional
theaters to present a more cerebral brand of musical, ``Dream
True'' is the most intriguing. As this is the first full-fledged
musical by Gordon, a composer of art songs and operas, one hopes
the transitional work represents for him just an opening act.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Ms. Landau, who collaborated with the composer Adam
Guettel on the musically compelling ``Floyd Collins'' at
Playwrights Horizons a few years ago, have said the inspiration for
``Dream True'' is ``Peter Ibbetson,'' a novel by George du Maurier
in which two people experience the same dreams. In ``Dream True,''
this supernatural phenomenon expresses not only a metaphysical link
between characters, but also an abiding emotional conjunction, a
bond that proves both more ambiguous and meaningful than anything
conjured in dreams. (Surprisingly, though, Ms. Landau does not come
up with an interesting way of dramatizing this dual-dreaming
concept.)
</P>
<P>
   The link is forged in childhood between Peter and Vernon Dexter
(Jase Blankfort as a boy; Daniel Jenkins as a man), who both are
growing up fatherless in Wyoming. Although their love for each
other evolves on different planes _ Verne, it will be revealed, is
gay _ it is the sustaining connection of their youth. When Peter's
mother makes the confounding decision to send him East to live with
his harsh, insensitive uncle Howard (Steven Skybell) _ a
psychiatrist, no less _ the breakup is shattering (and nicely
played both by young Bowen and Blankfort).
</P>
<P>
   The musical skips rapidly to Peter's adulthood in New York,
where, working as an architect, the spillover from the traumas of
his early life collects and conspires to ruin him. (An oddly
pizazzy, and out of place, pastiche number, ``The Best Years of Our
Lives,'' provides an introduction to postwar Manhattan.) Peter's
own turmoil, his desire for some semblance of inner peace, is what
drives the narrative; in ``Space,'' a clever ensemble number led by
the spirited McCarthy, Peter reimagines the firm's plans for a new
building as his own personal vision of an ideal shelter, an image
of Wyoming where ``the world was our home/And the stone was our
floor/And the sky was our dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details in ``Dream True'' are fuzzy; it's unclear,
for instance, why Peter never returns to Wyoming until he learns
his mother is deathly ill. But this may be because Gordon and Ms.
Landau are preoccupied by the relationship between Peter and
Vernon, which is renewed when they run into each other in New York.
When the composer and the director focus their attentions on the
friends' almost mystical bond, the musical's deep reservoir of
feeling is tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Enriched by Jonathan Tunick's evocative orchestrations, Gordon's
score captures the abundant heartache of Peter's search and curious
escape from life. Jenkins' rendition of the show's penultimate
song, the poignant anthem ``We Will Always Walk Together,'' is a
fully satisfying summation of the power of their eternal
comradeship.
</P>
<P>
   Although the material sometimes fails them, Jenkins, McCarthy
and Ms. Kuhn are in fine voice and deliver sensitive portrayals. As
the parental figures in Peter's life, Ms. Molaskey is soulful and
winning, while Skybell, in the difficult role of the heavy, pushes
it way beyond the tolerable. The character is a demonstration of
one of the ways in which this promising musical veers off,
flat-footed, in some uninviting directions.

 &HT;    THOUSANDS OF EXPECTED KOSOVO REFUGEES FAIL TO APPEAR

   KUKES, Albania _ The refugee pipeline from Kosovo inexplicably
closed again Sunday after nearly 6,000 refugees passed the gnarled
wreckage of a car that hit a mine in the border no man's land,
killing five members of an escaping family.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the deepening refugee crisis, NATO officials said they had
evidence that Yugoslav Serbs were forcing ``chain gangs'' of
Kosovars to dig graves for their countrymen killed in a campaign of
ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also said the alliance's heaviest day yet of bombing
sorties caused heavy damage inside Yugoslavia on Sunday, the 25th
day of the air campaign. Officials insisted that the bombing was
weakening President Slobodan Milosevic and there were no plans to
introduce ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion that killed the five refugees in neutral territory
between the Yugoslav and Albanian borders came after the car
apparently strayed from the channel of safe passage into an area
known to be mined.
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, Nysret Gerguri, said in a hospital interview
that he had been walking about four yards behind the white car when
it veered off the road and then blew up. He said the explosion
clearly came from below the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbian border guards told us to move on quickly,'' said
Gerguri. ``They told us the Albanians did this.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not permitted to help the injured survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Gerguri identified the dead man as Ibush Barisha, and his wife
as Hajrije Barisha. He said he lived near the family in a town in
central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of three children killed in the 3 a.m. blast were
retrieved by Yugoslav authorities and remained on that side of the
border, according to Doran Vienneau, a field officer of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which
was investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Three adults and an 11-year-old son groped their way from the
conflagration and were helped to safety by medics from the Albanian
side of the border, Vienneau said. However, the grandmother of the
family, age 65, and the 35-year-old mother died after arriving in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Vienneau described the incident as probably ``a tragic
accident'' rather than an intentional assault by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the (Yugoslav) authorities want as many refugees to
leave Yugoslavia as possible,'' he said. ``They have land mines in
that area probably as a defensive position.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, the refugee flow into Albania abruptly halted.
After 1:30 p.m., only a single ailing man literally crawled from
the Yugoslav side into the border crossing area, where he was
retrieved by medics with a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   While 24,000 refugees crossed into Albania on Saturday, slightly
under 6,000 had been counted by late Sunday night. At border points
in neighboring Macedonia, fewer than 1,000 new refugees arrived
Sunday, compared to a total of 12,000 on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With reports of 40,000 to 90,000 Kosovars en route to exile in
Albania, the diminished flow troubled workers and families awaiting
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern has been that there's no pattern,'' said Owen
O'Sullivan, director of the Kukes field office of the OSCE. He said
the uneven flow of refugees apparently has been manipulated by
Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO briefers said that film taken from allied
aircraft supported refugees' accounts that Serb forces had pressed
Kosovo Albanians into ``chain gangs'' to dig graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand they are being used by President Milosevic to
dig graves for their countrymen killed by Serbian ethnic
cleansing,'' said Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani.
</P>
<P>
   Marani said the film showed ``neat rows of individual graves
pointing to the southeast, toward Mecca.'' He said that was a sign
the mostly Muslim ethnic Albanians were trying to ``bury the
victims of Milosevic with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen said NATO jets had flown more than 500 missions in the
24-hour period ending Sunday afternoon, the highest daily total
yet.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea called it ``a highly successful day of
air operations'' focusing on army and police targets.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade reported that
choking black smoke rose from an oil storage depot and nitrogen
fertilizer plant in Pancevo, six miles northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Other targets reportedly included an oil refinery in
Yugoslavia's second-largest city, Novi Sad, military jets and
vehicles on the ground, and several bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The official news agency Tanjug reported a 3-year-old girl was
killed when a bomb hit a school in Batajnica, northwest of
Belgrade, where a military airfield is located.
</P>
<P>
   Although a shipment of U.S. Army ground-to-ground missiles were
delivered to an air base in Albania, NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana insisted there were still no plans for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion was echoed by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about ground troops on ABC-TV's ``This Week,'' Albright
said, ``the president has said that he has no intention and that
the air campaign is inflicting a great deal of damage and weakening
(Yugoslavia's) military.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether U.S. ground troops were training for a Balkan
mission, Albright answered, ``I have been told that there is no
training specifically going on for this kind of operation.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Here in Albania, miserable weather and apparently tougher Serb
tactics within Kosovo were taking a toll on those who did cross.
Relief agencies reported more refugees arriving dehydrated and
suffering malnutrition, and also bearing bullet wounds and other
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our projection is that there are a large number of refugees
still to come,'' said Daniel Endres, coordinator for the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees here. ``It looks as if entire cities are
being emptied. It really is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Sunday morning that the line of refugees waiting to
cross in cars, tractor-hauled carts and on foot had been estimated
at 10 miles in length, though other estimates have been put at
double that. What happened to all those people was not known.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, authorities allowed about 500 refugees who had
been stranded for more than a day at the Jazince border crossing to
enter the country from Yugoslavia after appeals from the U.N.
refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's government has said it can host no more than 20,000
refugees because of the strain on its poor economy and delicate
ethnic balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not build new camps any more. It is possible to expand
existing camps, but new refugees definitely must go to third
countries,'' Defense Minister Nikola Kljusev said in remarks
published in Macedonian newspapers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers speculated that refugee arrivals dropped because
ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo may believe that Macedonia has
closed its borders and thus are attempting to make it to the
Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 18,000 refugees have been airlifted to European host
countries, but Macedonian officials claim that tens of thousands
more must leave.

CHILDREN'S TV BECOMES A DIVERSE, SOPHISTICATED MARKETPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Public lamentation over the dangers to American children from
too much sex, violence and repetitious fare on television has been
around almost as long as television itself. But today, alongside
the hue and cry lies a quieter appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, children's television has undergone an
explosive growth spurt, with new cable channels, new program blocks
on broadcast channels and scores of new shows, many instructive if
not downright instructional.
</P>
<P>
   From the ``Dear America'' historical dramas on HBO to ``Sports
Illustrated for Kids'' on Nickelodeon, children's shows range
across almost as wide a spectrum as adult shows do. And at a time
when adult television is spilling over with crude humor and
vulgarity, children are spending less time watching adult
television than ever before and more time watching their own shows.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs _ many of the shows for very young children are
directly linked to toys and other products_ have been generated
more by the marketplace than by government and special interest
groups pushing for better programming through regulations.
</P>
<P>
   A federal rule requiring three hours a week of educational
programs has been in effect for two years. But the key reasons
behind the upsurge lie in two principles, first proved by the cable
network Nickelodeon: that children are a diverse audience, not a
monolithic one, and that children have greater influence over
family purchasing decisions than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers took notice. For the last three years, money spent
for commercials on children's television has grown at a
double-digit rate annually, and it exceeded $1 billion for the
1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Children's television producers now tailor programs to specific
age groups _ preschool, young elementary, older elementary and
adolescent _ instead of churning out lowest-common-denominator
cartoons. Formulaic cartoons still exist, but they face more
competition from shows that are nonviolent, nonpatronizing and
convey positive messages in ways children find appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People made money doing good stuff,'' said Alice Cahn,
president of television, film and video for Children's Television
Workshop. ``It's harder to get away with doing schlock television
for kids now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of schlock still exists, but it now gets low Nielsen
ratings and, therefore, lower prices for commercials. Children have
many more choices, and children are more discerning about making
those choices.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, a typical child watching television on Saturday
morning would see three types of shows _ bland and cuddly creatures
(``The Pound Puppies'' or ``The Smurfs''), robots and superheroes
(``Transformers'' or ``Voltron''), or oldies-but-goodies animation,
like ``Bugs Bunny.'' Even five years ago, Saturday morning was
still dominated by superheroes and harebrained cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the viewing menu has diversified. Children's television
includes game shows, sketch comedy, how-to shows and sports shows;
it can be live action as well as animation, and girls can be lead
characters as easily as boys.
</P>
<P>
   Animation still dominates, but even among cartoons, the choices
are dizzying. Along with ``Batman Beyond'' and ``Spider-Man,''
channel-surfing children can find female superheroes in ``The Power
Puff Girls'' (Cartoon Network) and ``The Adventures of Shirley
Holmes, Detective'' (Family Channel), and strong-willed real-life
girls, like ``Pepper Ann'' (ABC) or ``Daria'' (MTV), and even a
female judge in a courtroom comedy about science called
``Squigglevision'' (ABC).
</P>
<P>
   On Nickelodeon, some children live without parents in a
multi-ethnic urban world (``Hey Arnold!''), some travel the world
with parents who are anthropologists (``The Wild Thornberrys''),
and some cope with divorced parents and a pal who turns out to be
an alien in human form (``The Journey of Allen Strange'').
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon, which started in 1979 and began taking commercials
in 1983, was the motor that generated this prolific marketplace.
Its very mandate as the first children's network meant providing
all kinds of shows for all kinds of children, all day long _ and
then proving that children would watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nickelodeon took kids seriously as a market and did not
underestimate the power of kids to relate to good programs,'' said
Dr. David Walsh, the president and founder of the National
Institute on Media and the Family in Minneapolis. ``They showed
that you could do a good business without just throwing up dumb
cartoons all day.''
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Nickelodeon, owned by Viacom, became one of the
three most profitable networks in television (with NBC and ESPN).
Fox Kids Network became a profitable unit of Fox Broadcasting. The
Cartoon Network, owned by Time Warner, is the fastest-growing
network in cable. Now others are clambering on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fox bought the Family Channel, converted its daytime
lineup to children's shows and announced plans for two spinoffs,
the Boyz Channel and the Girlz Channel. Discovery started a
Discovery Kids channel. The Disney Channel spun off Toon Disney a
year ago. Nickelodeon just started Noggin, an all-educational
channel, and Nickelodeon GAS, a games and sports channel.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark Entertainment and Jim Henson Co. became partners in the
Odyssey Channel, which is adding family fare to its
faith-and-values programs. HBO invested about $18 million to start
a digital channel called HBO Family, much of it original programs
for children and teen-agers. PBS plans a digital channel called PBS
Kids for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadcast world, Walt Disney Co. has plowed millions into
revitalizing ABC's Saturday-morning lineup, adding educational
shows while substantially increasing its audience. Both Fox and WB
compete for under-12 viewers on weekday afternoons, as well as with
ABC and Nickelodeon on Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Competition for that $1 billion in advertising money explains
this proliferation, but what explains the upsurge in shows of
PBS-level quality?
</P>
<P>
   First, with so many choices of channels and programs, producers
have to work harder to make programs appealing. Secondly, producers
believe that parents are more sensitive to what their children
watch, and will guide the viewing of younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   And government intervention has had some impact, if only in
stirring up public interest. Three issues attracted high-profile
attention in the last three years: a requirement that new TV sets
have a V-chip enabling parents to block programs; the development
of a movie-style labeling system to rate shows by
age-appropriateness and content (V for violence, S for sex and even
an FV for ``fantasy violence'' in children's shows); and the
Federal Communications Commission's three-hour-a-week educational
programming rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more educational programming than ever and it
absolutely would not be there if not for that rule,'' says Kathryn
Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education, a
Washington research and advocacy group that led the fight for the
rule. ``But beyond that, there is a new sensibility, too. It's in
vogue to say you're making something educational, to appeal to
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   How faithfully broadcasters (the only ones subject to the
three-hour rule) are complying with the rule is debatable. Fox and
WB each found a way to work around the rule a bit, using just one
educational program but ``stripping'' it _ scheduling it for a
half-hour each weekday, usually in early morning or early
afternoon, to add up to three hours. Fox does this with re-runs of
the PBS science program ``The Magic School Bus;'' WB does it with a
frenetically-paced song-and-dance cartoon about great events in
history called ``Histeria!''
</P>
<P>
   ABC has managed to add educational programs and still increase
its Saturday-morning audience, but the Disney-owned network is
sometimes criticized for calling shows educational if they have
``nice little feel-good messages,'' as one rival put it.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to a debate over what constitutes ``educational.''
Programs labeled educational because of ``pro-social messages'' far
outnumber those with curricular content, according to the Center
for Media Education. Pro-social programs are those whose characters
and plots teach lessons such as how to get along with others, why
you should not lie, or, for older children, how to resist peer
pressure or cope with setbacks in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's concept of educational TV has changed,'' said Rick
Siggelkow, the executive producer of ``Noddy,'' a new educational
program on PBS, and vice president of children's programming for
BBC Worldwide Americas. ``Not many producers today look to `Sesame
Street' for inspiration. There's a drift toward softer things. But
parents are just happy to get lots of shows that don't model
violence and antisocial behavior. If it's pro-social, they think
that's educational.''
</P>
<P>
   TN Media, a company that advises advertisers, in a recent survey
reported that children's television viewing overall had declined in
the past three years, from about 12.2 hours a week to 11.6, but
children's viewing of children's programs had increased over the
same time period, from 5.4 hours to 5.8 hours.
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on children's appetite for their own shows,
Nickelodeon schedules them longer into the evening. The network's
Nick-at-Nite lineup of old sitcoms like ``The Brady Bunch'' used to
start at 8 p.m. But after extending children's shows until 8:30
p.m. a year ago, Nickelodeon saw its Nielsen ratings spike so high
that six months later the network extended ``children's
prime-time'' to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we said we were a full-service network for kids, we had to
be full,'' said Herb Scannell, Nickelodeon's president. ``That's
why we did it. That's also why we do a news show. That's why we
first did shows starring girls as the main character, and variety
shows, and sketch comedy. And it's why we started Nick Jr., too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Jr. is the network's weekday morning preschool block,
praised by academic critics. ``Blue's Clues,'' one of the most
innovative shows, uses repetition and visual cues designed for a
toddler's developmental level. Nick Jr. executives just purchased
two shows, ``Maisy'' and ``Kipper,'' from British producers, who
have a long history of doing high-quality shows for preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth area is the preschool audience,'' said Amy Jordan,
senior research analyst on children's television for the Annenberg
Public Policy Center. ``That's partly because people who produce
shows realize they can tie products to preschool programs, like
computer games or book series.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, PBS was the pioneer for this age group _ even in
making money. Plenty of merchandise has been sold based on
characters from ``Sesame Street,'' ``Barney'' and, more recently,
``Arthur'' and ``Teletubbies.'' By itself, ``Teletubbies,'' a show
for children under 3, generated $800 million in product sales in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Toys, clothing and games tend to be marketed for younger
children whose parents make the purchases. But in commercial
television, older children are equally important because they
influence a wider range of products, from fast-food pizza to
sneakers to computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still certain kinds of programming this prolific
marketplace isn't producing for children, with rare exceptions,''
Ms. Charren said. ``Two that come to mind are news and drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Nickelodeon has a regular news program for children, ``Nick
News,'' anchored by Linda Ellerbee, the former NBC News anchor who
recently won a prestigious George Foster Peabody award for a ``Nick
News'' special explaining the impeachment debate _ the only prize
among 33 that was given for coverage of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the very least,'' Ms. Charren said, ``most children's
shows today are benign. And benign is a lot better than ghastly.''

KNIGHT RIDDER MAKES APPOINTMENTS IN NEWS DIVISION  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A corporate reshuffling in the top ranks of Knight Ridder's news
division is bringing an old Washington hand back to head the
newspaper chain's Washington bureau, while the executive editor of
The San Jose Mercury News in California is taking over as Knight
Ridder's vice president for news.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper chain's new Washington editor, Clark Hoyt, shared
a Pulitzer Prize for articles disclosing that Sen. Thomas Eagleton
of Missouri, the man George McGovern, the Democratic nominee for
president in 1972, initially selected as his running mate, had
received electric shock treatments for depression. The disclosure
prompted Eagleton to withdraw from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt will supervise the Washington bureau and the company's wire
service, which carries its national and international coverage.
Direct management of the bureau will be handled by Katherine
Carroll, the former deputy bureau chief, who was named Washington
bureau chief. The former bureau chief, Gary Blonston, died this
month of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington bureau's coverage is being reorganized around
thematic beats like health in the wake of a company survey that
showed that some editors of its member newspapers had less appetite
for traditional daily coverage of federal agencies like the Health
and Human Services department.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome M. Ceppos led the newsroom at The Mercury News for four
years, presiding over a broad expansion of technology coverage in
an effort to make Silicon Valley's home newspaper a leader in
explaining the industry. He also presided over a controversial
series contending that the CIA played a role in Central American
drug trafficking, a contention that the paper later reinvestigated
and recanted.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Yarnold, now managing editor at The Mercury News, will
succeed Ceppos as editor.

 &HT;    ARMY GROUND-TO-GROUND MISSILES ARRIVE IN ALBANIA
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ An Air Force transport plane on
Sunday disgorged more than 110 U.S. Army ground-to-ground missiles
as NATO continued to unfurl the first elements of a ground force
that could blast its way into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in sight were the long-awaited Apache tank-killer
helicopters. In recent days, the Apaches have assumed a mythic
importance to the nervous Albanian public, and so all day small
knots of Albanians gathered near the airfield to gawk at what many
here expect will be a weapon that will immediately turn the tide
against the hated Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, the word spread that the Apaches' arrival was put
off at least until Monday because of lightning storms over the air
field.
</P>
<P>
   With the Apaches still stuck on the ground in Italy,
correspondents waiting in sporadic rain and hail on the Rinas
flight line were allowed to see crate after crate of Army mid-range
missiles for the Multiple Rocket Launcher System (MRLS) unloaded
from a C-17 transport.
</P>
<P>
   Stenciled on the side of the olive green rocket pods were the
words ``Guided Missile and Launching Assembly'' and ``Do Not
Drop.'' The white block writing also specified that the missiles
had been
</P>
<P>
   manufactured by Loral Vaught Systems of Dallas, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Known as M-39 ATACMs or ``Attack-'ems,'' the missiles are
America's most advanced artillery weapons. They are designed to
pound hardened battlefield targets with great precision at a range
of up to 60 miles _ three times farther than Vietnam-era
artillerymen could fire with their 155-millimeter howitzers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the mobile rocket launchers that fire the rockets have
not been seen here. This suggests it will be a number of days at
least before they could be used to strike into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The MRLS launchers, which resemble heavy military
tractor-trailer trucks, will presumably be driven soon to launch
bases in northern Albania, near the Kosovo border. Deployment of
the MLRS was announced by the Pentagon more than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also flowing off the Air Force C-17 transports on Sunday were
hundreds of elite American combat troops wearing Kevlar helmets and
carrying gas masks on their belt.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Sunday arrivals were Army paratroopers from a U.S.
Airborne outfit based in Germany. They wouldn't talk about anything
but the weather. And the spokesman for the fast-growing Army
</P>
<P>
   contingent, Lt. Col. Garrie Dornan, made himself unavailable to
correspondents, as he has done since flying in from Germany two
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first mission of the paratroopers could well be to secure a
series of firing bases in the mountains of northern Albania,
between the refugee-packed towns of Kukes and Bajram Currie. The
paratroopers could well be assigned to establish a front-line
cordon to shield the mobile missile launchers.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are augmented later with more paratroopers and
Blackhawk transport helicopters, they could become the lead
elements of an airborne landing deep inside the territory of
Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Army's mobile rocket launchers will probably be
fired from within a dangerous Albanian mountain terrain that looks
like a washboard. In the last week, Serbian infiltrators have
repeatedly conducted cross-border raids into northern Albania and
lobbed artillery at irregular Kosovo guerrillas of the Kosovo
Liberation Army operating in the border area.
</P>
<P>
   If they could operate safely from sites near the border, the
Army's missiles could drill targets along the bloody refugee escape
trail through the Kosovo towns of Dakovica and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles also have sufficient range to hit Kosovo's capital
Pristina and well beyond. But before they can shoot, they have to
receive the precise map coordinates of the targets from drone
helicopters, satellites or other intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the standing doctrine of the U.S. military, the Army's
artillery forces, including MRLS missiles, are never stationed
right on the front lines. From World War I to the Persian Gulf war,
the U.S. Army positioned paratroopers or other infantrymen in front
of the leading artillery units.
</P>
<P>
   American Special Forces troops, decked out in combat gear
instead of their green berets, were also in evidence at the
airfield Sunday. At one point, a convoy of Special Forces troops in
nine armored Humvees passed down the flight line, with machine
gunners stationed on the roof of two Humvees to protect the front
and rear.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the Special Forces troops in Albania could range
from aiding refugees to training guerilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1991 Kurdish refugee crisis in northern Iraq after
the Gulf war, the Bush administration dispatched helicopter-borne
Army Special Forces units to aid refugees in the mountains and coax
them down to safer refugee camps in the plains.
</P>
<P>
   But from Vietnam through Central America, a more common mission
of the Green Berets was to work with the CIA in covertly training
and arming indigenous guerrilla units.
</P>
<P>
   When and if the Clinton administration decides to employ the
dashing but poorly trained Kosovo Liberation Army in the struggle
against Serb forces, the Green Berets would be the only logical
Army
</P>
<P>
   unit to train them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unhitched by riggers, the vinyl billboard in Times Square
advertising Kool Natural cigarettes slid down like a curtain last
week and was quickly carted away.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight Thursday, every cigarette billboard in the country
must come down as part of the $206 billion agreement reached last
year between tobacco producers and 46 states to resolve all state
claims over health costs related to smoking. Over the last month,
cigarette makers and outdoor advertising companies have been
scrambling to meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   For anti-smoking groups, the end of the cigarette billboard
stands as a major victory, a choking-off of an advertising medium
that tobacco producers have dominated for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of the billboards is also significant for the
change it will produce in this country's visual landscape. For
decades, tobacco signs were the canvas used by some of the
advertising industry's most talented designers and photographers.
And the works they produced, ranging from the quaint to the
ingenious to the garish, have served not only as urban meeting
places and reference points for lost motorists but as cultural
touchstones.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or for worse, they were an integral part of the
American landscape,'' said James Fraser, the library director at
Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, N.J., and the author of
``The American Billboard: 100 Years'' (Harry N. Abrams, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, a Camel billboard in Times Square, which may rank
as the most famous billboard ever built, sent out huge smoke rings.
Until his recent enforced retirement, a 64-foot-high cutout of the
Marlboro Man loomed for more than a decade over the Sunset Strip in
Los Angeles. There were glowing neon billboards like the Newport
brand sign not far from Yankee Stadium. Horses stampeded out from
three-dimensional billboards. And when things got psychedelic, so
did outdoor signs, splashing the tobacco products with black light.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the signs disappear, some people have rallied to defend
historic outdoor tobacco advertisements like the work of Harley
Warrick, who spent four decades painting advertisements for Mail
Pouch chewing tobacco on the sides of barns. Recently, regulators
in West Virginia had to decide whether Warrick's barn signs fell
under the settlement. The barns won a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Venturi, the postmodern architect, said that while he was
sympathetic with opposition to smoking, tobacco billboards could
also be objects of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a time when they will be hanging in craft
museums on the wall next to patchwork quilts so that we can
understand their beauty as a craft,'' said Venturi, who has
celebrated outdoor advertising in books and articles about design.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the agreement by cigarette makers to do away with
billboard promotions is a replay of a strategy that led producers
to dominate the outdoor landscape in the first place. In early
1970s, the tobacco industry voluntarily dropped television and
radio advertising in the face of a looming government ban.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those advertising dollars were soon poured into
billboards. By the 1980s, one in every three billboards carried a
tobacco ad, advertising industry executives said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco industry's dominance of the medium has declined
in recent years. According to the Outdoor Advertising Association
of America, a trade group, cigarette makers last year accounted for
only about 9 percent of the industry's revenue,
</P>
<P>
   Some of the factors behind the drop included efforts by many
municipalities to end outdoor tobacco advertisements. Before
November's $206 billion deal with 46 states, the tobacco industry
agreed to end billboard and transit promotions as part of
settlements with four other states _ Florida, Minnesota,
Mississippi and Texas _ to resolve lawsuits brought to recover
smoking-related health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some outdoor advertising companies said they had to yet to find
new advertisers for all the billboards that were becoming
available. Steve Bryant, the president of Capital Outdoor Inc. in
Raleigh, N.C., said that his company had removed 50 tobacco
advertisements from billboards it owned in the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of those billboards as well as scores of others
nationwide will carry anti-smoking messages until rents paid by
tobacco companies run out, typically by year's end. Bryant said
that of his company's 50 tobacco billboards he had found new
advertisers for 35 but hoped to pick up others soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will open up billboards to a whole new spectrum of
advertisers,'' Bryant said. ``But I doubt that we are going to see
anything that had the impact of cigarettes.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking groups have long charged that cigarette makers
carefully positioned outdoor advertisements near schools and
playgrounds and concentrated on minority neighborhoods because
those areas had high smoking rates.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pollay, a professor of marketing at the University of
British Columbia in Vancouver, said that the billboard blitz
launched by cigarette producers had a purpose: By making tobacco
images commonplace in the visual landscape, they conveyed the
impression that a deadly product was harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we see something the more we see it as benign,'' said
Pollay, who has testified as an expert witness for municipalities
seeking to ban cigarette billboards. ``It creates a familiarity
effect, and billboards are wonderful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor advertisements were a part of the tobacco industry from
its beginning. Before the turn of the century, large, colorful wall
paintings advertising Bull Durham tobacco appeared. And as
cigarette smoking grew more popular, tobacco producers quickly
began to erect dramatic signs advertising their wares throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1911, for example, R.J. Reynolds Co. erected a mammoth
blinking electric sign near the Flatiron building in Manhattan that
depicted a man with a giant glow at his feet and the words ``Prince
Albert.'' The sign read ``The Nation's Joy Smoke, R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company,'' according to a history of the tobacco producer
written by Nannie Tilley.
</P>
<P>
   As cars began to crowd the nation's highways in the 1920s,
tobacco signs bearing slogans like ``Lucky Strike Means Fine
Tobacco'' became regular roadside attractions.
</P>
<P>
   But as a crowd stopper, few billboards have rivaled the smoking
Camel sign that began a 25-year run in Times Square starting in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   The large billboard bore the brand's slogan ``I'd Walk a Mile
for a Camel'' and showed a figure like a serviceman who had a round
hole for a mouth. Behind the hole was a steel chamber with a rubber
backing that acted like a diaphragm. As steam filled the chamber,
the rubber was pulled tight by a gear. When a second gear turned,
the diaphragm relaxed, forcing the steam out of the chamber with a
whooshing sound and sending it, like a smoke ring, wafting over
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of television after World War II, tobacco
companies cut back on billboard advertisements in favor of the new
medium, Pollay, the marketing professor, said. But in the early
1970s, tobacco companies faced not only the prospect of a
legislative ban on television ads but the likelihood that
broadcasters would offer equal time to anti-smoking messages, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cigarette producers voluntarily dropped both
television and radio advertising and returned to outdoor
promotions, which did not face the same regulations. At that time,
Marlboro cigarettes, made by the Philip Morris Cos., were also
quickly becoming the country's most popular brand, and soon
billboards featuring cowboys and Western themes became imprinted on
the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   One huge Marlboro Man cowboy sign was erected in 1983 above the
Sunset Strip in Los Angeles and soon became a reference point for
tourists and lost motorists. But it was the construction of a giant
billboard in Times Square in 1989 with Joe Camel that may have
tolled the beginning of the end for tobacco billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-foot-high sign, featuring an advertising campaign based
on a cartoon-style camel, used 2,600 light bulbs and more than 1.5
miles of computer-controlled neon to create an animated display,
according to R.J. Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, anti-smoking groups were pointing to Joe
Camel as well as the Marlboro Man as major culprits behind a steady
rise in smoking by teen-agers. And soon some municipalities, like
Baltimore, moved to ban tobacco billboards. Outdoor advertisers and
tobacco companies squared off in court against such cities and
asserted First Amendment protections for billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Though the agreement by the tobacco industry ends the billboard
debate, some advertising by cigarette makers outside stores can
continue. Under the recent settlement, those signs can not exceed
two by seven feet. (The typical billboard is 48 times bigger.)
</P>
<P>
   Getting the billboards down has not always gone smoothly.
Workers removing a Marlboro sign last year outside Texas Stadium in
Irvine discovered a family of red hawks, with two chicks, nesting
there. The birds, which are protected by federal law, could not be
disturbed, so authorities waited for months until the chicks could
fly before using horns to roust them so removal work could proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Some tobacco signs will last even longer. For four decades,
Warrick, a sign painter from Belmont, Ohio, traveled through the
Midwest and Southeast painting the slogan ``Chew Mail Pouch
Tobacco'' on the sides of thousands of barns. Hundreds of the signs
still remain and have been celebrated as folk art. Some people,
including Ted Koppel, the host of the ABC television news program
``Nightline,'' have even hired Warrick to paint Mail Pouch signs on
barns they own.
</P>
<P>
   Signs painted by Warrick before 1970 are federally protected
landmarks. But because Mail Pouch chewing tobacco is still sold,
West Virginia officials, for one, recently grappled with the issue
of what to do about the barn signs painted by Warrick after that
date.
</P>
<P>
   Will Steele, a managing deputy attorney general in West
Virginia, said regulators determined that the settlement's language
on billboards did not cover Warrick's barn signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to push that issue,'' said Steele, ``While no
one has said this, we still believe they are a part of Americana.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Mann has played piano and written arrangements for Frank
Sinatra, serenaded President Truman on his yacht and written
popular music like the song ``In the Wee Small Hours of the
Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, from his home in Kinnelon, N.J., he sits at a
different keyboard, talking about classical music with the members
of a chat room on America Online. By his estimate, he puts in at
least five hours a week as a volunteer, moderating a weekly chat
session, answering e-mail and filling out an online report about
his duties.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, he and more than 10,000 other people who perform
similar tasks for the online service get a free account and the
designation ``community leader.'' What they do not get is a
paycheck, which is fine with Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not too concerned with being remunerated, since my
purpose was to fulfill an obligation to my art _ my Muse, as it
were. I merely believe that I owe it to the cause of good music to
steer less knowledgeable people in the right direction,'' said
Mann, 82, in an e-mail interview. ``I deem it not only an
obligation for me to do so, but a privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mann considers his role a privilege, some former
volunteers for America Online view it as work and have filed
complaints with the Labor Department. They say volunteers at the
company are treated like employees and perform functions that are
integral to the online service's mission and should be paid.
</P>
<P>
   In asking the Labor Department to investigate their claims, they
have raised two decidedly Internet-age questions: When does taking
part in and enjoying a community transcend hobby status and become
work? And what does an Internet company owe to the people who give
it life, not to mention high valuations on the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   While the Labor Department will not comment on the complaints
against America Online or any action it is taking, the industry and
the volunteers themselves are looking on with interest. If the
department does find America Online in violation of laws like the
Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, it could change the online
landscape, since America Online is not the only company that relies
on the passions and goodwill of people like Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other Internet businesses, including Prodigy
Communications, iVillage and Geocities, are built on the foundation
of a virtual community, where volunteer participants establish,
lead and police discussion areas. In turn, the businesses proudly
boast about the number of members who take part in their
communities, and trade on those numbers to attract advertisers and
make multimillion-dollar business deals. Without their
contributions, company executives acknowledge that their services
would be virtual ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the core foundation of our business,'' said Bruce
Zanca, a spokesman for Geocities, a Web community where he says 4
million people have built free home pages. Zanca said 1,800
volunteers contributed their time to the management of the online
community, hosting chat rooms and enforcing community standards,
among other tasks. In exchange, they get Geo-Points they can use to
buy products and services on Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monetary exchange probably wouldn't be an inducement,''
Zanca said. ``These people are the cyber equivalent of scout
leaders and PTA members and the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs. Why do
people participate in these programs? It's the same reason I coach
Little League on Saturday mornings. It's something people do for
their own personal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The local Little League is a different proposition, however,
than Geocities, a publicly traded company with 300 paid employees
that was bought in January by Yahoo in a stock deal worth about
$3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of volunteering for a for-profit corporation is an
unusual one, so there is little precedent by which to judge these
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But one question the Labor Department might be asking as it
looks into the complaints about America Online is whether the
volunteer force is providing a service that the company would have
to pay for if volunteers did not exist, said Jeffrey Chamberlain,
an employment lawyer based in Albany, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between volunteering at IBM to assemble
computers and volunteering at the IBM soup kitchen,'' Chamberlain
said. ``The difference between doing good and making computers is
relatively conceptually easy to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the digital age, the lines between volunteering and working
without pay are less clear. Many of the people who volunteer online
say they do the work for personal reasons _ not for the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Bass spends, by her estimation, 20 to 30 hours a week in
her home in Middleton, Wis., as a supervisor in the pet care forum
on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   She says she loves her virtual, unpaid job: hosting chat
sessions, checking bulletin boards for inappropriate comments,
responding to e-mail from those who visit the area. Sure, she said,
she would like to be paid. ``Who wouldn't love that?'' she said.
But even without financial compensation, she derives great
satisfaction from her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a close-knit family here,'' she said. ``Most of my best
friends are here.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem peculiar to the uninitiated that so many people
would give so much time, without financial compensation, to a
company with $2.6 billion in revenue last year and a stock market
valuation of $130 billion. Perhaps even more peculiar is the notion
that volunteers would be so personally invested in the work they
do. But it is a phenomenon that is part of an online tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like sex, it looks funny from the outside,'' said Howard
Rheingold, author of the book ``The Virtual Community''
(Addison-Wesley, 1993). ``Any virtual community that works, works
because people put in some time.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   But in exchange, he said, what the members of virtual
communities need and want is respect. Many Internet businesses, in
the frenzied rush to capitalize on industry buzzwords, have used
the word ``community'' in their marketing, but not necessarily in
deed.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold said he suspected this was the case with the
management at America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kurnit, founder of Mining Company, a guide to the
Internet, chose a different strategy to compensate the people who
manage various topics within the company's directory, like
``pregnancy'' or ``Southern food.'' Kurnit said he knew when he
started the company that he would need a large group of guides to
fulfill his promise of a ``human-powered'' search engine, but that
the economics of hiring a large staff were unrealistic for a
start-up operation. Instead, he pays the guides a combination of a
monthly stipend and a cut of the net revenues generated by
advertising on their sections. Kurnit says the guides, who now
number 692, earn between $500 and $11,000 a month, depending on the
popularity of the section.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, he issued 200,000 shares of stock to the
guides, which is now worth a total of about $10 million. (The
company went public last month, making Kurnit, on paper, worth more
than $50 million.)
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the guides sign over the rights to the sites they
create, and agree not to work for other online services in a
similar capacity.
</P>
<P>
   While for guides who have less trafficked sites, the
compensation might not equal a living wage, Kurnit feels his
program offers a fair reward, and that the company benefits more
than it would if he relied on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is entrepreneurs are the best workers _ they work
tirelessly,'' Kurnit said. ``Volunteers are unreliable, and have an
expectation that you owe them something.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Zanca of Geocities disagrees that the quality of work
he gets from his volunteers is less than if he were to pay them. He
also said he was not concerned that the Labor Department inquiry
might affect the way his company is structured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Net has a new dynamic,'' he said, ``and in new
dynamics, laws and regulations need to be re-evaluated.''

<P>
   Each month, Patricia Ruszkay, a purchasing agent for BOC Gases,
distributor of industrial gases with American headquarters in
Murray Hill, N.J., pulls a chair up to a computer, logs on to the
Internet, and looks for a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the bargain involves not only the price of the
product, but an entire cost-saving process set in motion when the
on-screen ``order'' button is clicked.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 7,000 miles away from New Jersey, in a Japanese gas
processing plant, a BOC supplier receives the million-dollar order
for tungsten hexafluoride, a highly toxic gas used in semiconductor
manufacturing, among other purposes. Within minutes, some 2,500
miles miles from Murray Hill, a BOC distribution center in San
Diego receives electronic notice from Japan that the shipment is on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   No multilingual phone calls or faxes required. No written
purchase orders, invoices or shipping notices to lose. Because the
entire process takes place on the World Wide Web, there are no
extra charges for handling the order over a special long-distance
data network _ which until a few years ago would have been the only
way to conduct business electronically.
</P>
<P>
   BOC makes some $20 million worth of purchases from the Japanese
supplier a year, and BOC officials say the Internet will save the
company several hundred thousand dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more headlines about retailers selling books and
compact disks on line, or consumers Web-auctioning the contents of
their attics to one another. But in terms of dollars and impact,
the real electronic-commerce action these days is the
business-to-business transactions quietly taking place among
companies like BOC and its suppliers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, American companies had $43 billion worth of sales to
one another over the Internet, five times the consumer retail
total, according to Forrester Research, a market research firm in
Cambridge, Mass. Within four years, Forrester says
business-to-business sales on line will reach $1.3 trillion, or 9.4
percent of corporate America's purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Another research firm, the Aberdeen Group, is even more
exuberant in its calculations of business-to-business E-commerce,
estimating that the market may now be 10 or more times larger than
the online consumer arena, and hold at that level.
</P>
<P>
   Word early this year of strong online Christmas sales ``put
visions of sugar plum fairies into people's heads,'' said David
Alschuler, a vice president at Aberdeen, which is based in Boston.
``But the fact is, business on the Internet is cutting significant
costs out of the supply chain, with better procurement and resource
planning,'' Alschuler said. In the long run, ``that will have a far
bigger impact than what you buy from Amazon.com,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While computer companies like Cisco Systems and Dell Computer
have been the notable leaders in business-to-business E-commerce
organizations in other lines of business have also joined the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Harley-Davidson, Mobil Oil and Los Angeles County are among the
disparate cases cited by Alyse Terhune, an analyst with the Gartner
Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn., as evidence that
business-to-business E-commerce ``is absolutely proliferating
beyond the high-tech companies now, into just about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobil, for instance, recently implemented an Internet ordering
system for its roughly 300 lubricant distributors, saving the
company $100,000 a year in ordering costs, and cutting the error
rate for such orders from 30 percent to virtually none, Ms. Terhune
said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, E-commerce has brought fundamental change to
businesses like BOC Gases. Its British parent, the BOC Group, has
been pushing for online supplier and customer transactions
throughout its multinational operations, which include a wide
variety of warehousing, distribution and cargo-handling services.
And the benefits transcend mere back-office efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cahill, a BOC purchasing manager in Murray Hill, cites the
example of tungsten hexafluoride. The company sells the gas in
six-foot steel cylinders that are worth $10,000 each when filled,
making for an unwieldy, expensive inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous years, our stock has been bloated to accommodate
for miscommunication, upturn in demand, returns or problems with
quality,'' Cahill said. ``So it was typical to have three months of
inventory in the system _ which could be between 50 and 60
cylinders, with a bunch en route.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for such ``blind stocking,'' as Cahill put
it, was the inefficiency of the order fulfillment process. ``We
have quite a lot of people interested in each purchase order,'' he
said. ``All that communication was handled through faxes, e-mails
or the phone, one on one _ which is great until someone goes on
vacation or sick leave, or they leave the office for a few hours,
or transcribe something incorrectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the system, which the San Diego site put in place in March
1998, BOC negotiates a bulk purchase with suppliers for a year's
worth of gas, and posts the information on a restricted-access Web
site. This site, or ``extranet,'' is accessible only to select BOC
suppliers and customers, and to BOC employees like Ms. Ruszkay who
place orders by choosing from an online catalog of gases that has
been screened for price and selection, based on the bulk purchase
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As the order progresses through delivery, both the supplier and
BOC will update the Internet order page, noting the shipping dates,
quantity, and shipping method. This gives key personnel instant
access to the order's status, which cuts down the need for
correspondence, slashes the amount of time spent processing
purchase orders and greatly reduces the opportunities for human
error.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, Cahill said the system's precision
had enabled the company to reduce substantially the number of
filled cylinders it keeps in stock, saving his division ``several
hundred thousand'' dollars in annual inventory costs.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton Wilcox, BOC's director of technical business development,
conceded that the estimated $60 million worth of business the
company transacted last year on the Internet represents but a tiny
portion of BOC's annual revenue of $1.2 billion. Because the buyers
using the system tend to be the biggest and most valued of BOC
Gases' customers, dollar volumes tell only part of the story, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we had the hard numbers of exactly how much in sales
we do on the Internet,'' Wilcox said, ``it's still chump change
compared to what it's doing to deepen the customer relationship and
reduce the overall cost of ownership.'' He was referring to the
costs a customer incurs not only in buying gas from BOC, but in
storing and tracking it.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the case with the military contractor Raytheon
Systems, one of BOC's key customers. In 1997 BOC approached what
was then the Hughes Aircraft Company (Raytheon merged with Hughes
later that year) and offered to put its catalog of gases on an
extranet and let the company order around the clock, if necessary.
The customer accepted, and now orders as many as 30 cylinders of
gases each week for its El Segundo, Calif., plant, for use in
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite such headway, there are speed limits on the growth of
corporate E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall size of the business-to-business market dwarfs
the consumer market, the rate of E-commerce adoption among
corporations has been _ and will continue to be _ much slower, says
Chris Davis, a vice president CSC Inc., an information technology
consulting concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business-to-business space is just a lot more complex,''
Davis said. ``And organizations don't always behave like
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   With layers of bureaucracy to navigate, and with procurement and
sales methods ingrained in the corporate culture, he said, those
who champion E-commerce within corporations must be prepared to
move slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun and the moon and the stars have to line up to make
this work,'' said Wilcox, of BOC. ``We're so intertwined with a
customer and their processes, we can't just do things suddenly
without re-engineering the whole process. That's why
business-to-business E-commerce will have a more organic growth
than the flash growth on the retail side.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike consumer-oriented E-commerce, there are no ready-made
software programs sophisticated enough to quickly apply to most
business situations. Analysts and industry executives note that the
requisite business-to-business software tends to be expensive _
often more than $1 million for the initial software license, from
vendors like Ariba Technologies Inc. and Spaceworks Inc. Making the
system fit the specific needs of a particular company, not to
mention keeping it in tune, typically requires an internal support
staff as well as continued consultation with the software vendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every dollar that businesses will spend on the packaged
application, they'll spend $5 to $50 on system development and
integration,'' said Ms. Terhune, the Gartner Group analyst.
</P>
<P>
   BOC was pulled into E-commerce by a longtime customer, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has been buying gases
from the company since 1989 for use in science experiments and
other purposes. Four years ago, seeing the Internet's potential for
more efficient business practices, MIT persuaded BOC and another of
the university's big vendors, Office Depot, to offer their products
for sale in virtual catalogs. Like BOC, Office Depot gave it a try,
liked what it saw and has since become an E-commerce evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   BOC hired IBM in early 1996 to custom-design its extranet. But
the system also includes a large amount of software written by
BOC's own engineers, which helped keep the initial outlay below $1
million, according to Wilcox, who said annual maintenance now ran
around $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond money, though, companies embarking on E-commerce must
also become accustomed to doling out ample portions of trust. BOC,
for example, gives its suppliers unprecedented access to its own
inventory data, in order to keep its stockpiles replenished. BOC
customers like MIT give BOC access to their cost accounting
systems, to avoid having to re-enter data as an order works its way
through the process.
</P>
<P>
   Such trust is a departure from traditional business practices,
Wilcox conceded. ``But somebody's got to be willing to do something
a little differently for this to work.''

 &HT;    YUGOSLAV SHELLING OF ALBANIA BORDER TOWNS ACCELERATES
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN.
 &HT;    With photos.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRUME, Albania _ Accelerated shellings and explosions aimed by
Yugoslavia's military at this craggy border region are raising
fears for the safety of Kosovo refugees, aid workers and local
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts have killed 17 Kosovo guerrilla fighters and forced
the evacuation of an entire village. They also are interfering with
humanitarian aid deliveries for thousands of refugees crammed into
a tent camp and the homes of local Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The series of cross-border attacks appears to be directed at
training camps of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``One shell landed right there up on the hill,'' said Avni Dita,
a plainclothes police investigator, pointing to a spot overlooking
this town.
</P>
<P>
   He said shells or mortars buffeted a village not 15 miles to the
west, and the nearly 1,000 residents all were evacuated. Local
television reported that a Yugoslav military unit then crossed over
the border and looted the village, which held a KLA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Another explosion in the Krume area, this one of unknown origin,
forced the UN World Food Programme(cq) to halt helicopter
deliveries of food and other aid, according to agency spokesperson
Angela Walker. She said food now travels here by truck from Kukes,
near the main refugee border crossing about 18 miles southeast of
Krume.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford helicopter accidents,'' Walker said in an
interview in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA set up camps throughout this border area to continue
their fight for Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia.
International negotiations failed when the Serb-led Yugoslav
government refused to agree to a settlement accepted by the KLA,
leading to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Serbs intensified their campaign to end
the independence movement and drive out most if not all of the 1.8
million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Serb aggression has not convinced Kosovar Albanian
refugees here or elsewhere along the border to move further south,
much to the consternation of relief agencies. They are trying to
relocate these concentrations of people for their own safety and to
make room for the huge new influx of refugees arriving daily at
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stay here,'' said Shahe Dallaveri, 47, who has
lived in the tent camp on Krume's outskirts for two weeks. ``I can
think only of the hospital where I have my wounded children. We
just want to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallaveri family left three children across the border in
Kosovo. They said two were wounded when Serbs opened fire on their
refugee convoy trying to exit the country. A third, who is 20 years
old, stayed behind to care for her wounded siblings in a hospital,
according to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they (Serbian Yugoslavs) are trying to get revenge
against Albanians because they are helping us,'' said Ramadan
Dallaveri, 61, the husband of Shahe.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian workers have expressed concern that the local
populace will grow impatient with this refugee presence and the
stress they are bringing to the area, including the Serbian
shelling campaign. That is another reason they are urging refugees
to disperse to southern regions where they would be less
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   At least some Albanian residents of Krume showed no qualms about
keeping the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, but we feel it's a duty because they are our
brothers,'' said Mane Musa, 36, who runs a vegetable stand at the
Krume central square. She has 20 ethnic Albanian refugees from
Kosovo staying in her three-room house, Musa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not the problem. We never think they are the cause of
the bombing,'' she said.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: INTERNET ESCROW SERVICES ARE CATCHING ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (js) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet auctions are promoted for their ability to rid the
world of middlemen and let buyers and sellers strike deals in
free-market harmony. But as auction sites look to cash in on the
trend by selling more costly goods, this Internet utopia is coming
under threat. Higher prices can mean lower levels of trust.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, in recent months, Internet escrow services have
gained a following in person-to-person selling circles. These
services, in which a third party holds the money until both buyer
and seller are satisfied with the transaction, can reduce the risk
of fraud, bounced checks or goods that fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Internet executives and analysts say a vast majority of business
is still conducted without such services, but that could change
quickly, as Beanie Babies and baseball cards are eclipsed on the
auction block by Bordeaux and BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   The services work as their offline counterparts do: The parties
strike an agreement, the buyer pays the sale price _ plus a fee,
which is typically 5 percent _ to the escrow service, and when the
buyer accepts the item, the escrow service transfers the money to
the seller. Though some online auction companies, such as Auction
Universe and Edeal, provide their own escrow services for
customers, others, like Amazon.com, Ebay and Yahoo Auctions, offer
the services of third-party escrow providers, often in exchange for
a percentage of the escrow fee.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the escrow services collect the fee even when a
transaction falls through, as was the case with Heather Krolak, a
24-year-old photographer and artist from Brooklyn, who entered into
an agreement to buy a Patrick Nagel painting on Ebay in early
February for $1,500. ``I was skeptical,'' Ms. Krolak said, noting
that works by Nagel, a nationally known artist in the 1970s and
'80s, typically command much higher prices. ``It seemed like a
little too good of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the seller was in Spring Valley, Calif., Ms. Krolak
asked him to conduct the transaction through I-Escrow, one of the
two leading online escrow providers. (Tradesafe, I-Escrow's chief
competitor, is also available on Ebay. Both sites are also
available on Amazon's auction channel.) Ms. Krolak and the seller
clicked onto I-Escrow's site and registered, creating a secure page
in which they could further negotiate the length of the inspection
period and other terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krolak argued for a one-week inspection period, while the
seller wanted to allow only one day. The seller also informed Ms.
Krolak that the artist's signature was slightly off, but that he
had a letter from the artist's brother verifying the painting's
authenticity. ``I thought that was a little odd,'' Ms. Krolak said,
``so I stuck to the one-week inspection period.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon receiving the painting, Ms. Krolak had it inspected by two
experts, who declared that it was not a Nagel. She sent it back,
forfeiting the $120 escrow fee. ``I was disappointed, and I lost
the fee,'' she said. ``But it was worth it because I would have
lost a lot more if I hadn't used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Would she bid on expensive artwork again? ``You have to be
careful _ especially with art,'' she said. ``But sure I would.''
</P>
<P>
   This is just the kind of testimonial that Internet auction sites
are hoping for, since Web auctioneers are intent on pushing the
average sale price for an item beyond the current $45 level so they
can collect fatter commissions.
</P>
<P>
   That means that consumers can expect to see more so-called
special event auctions, like a recent Ansel Adams auction on
Auction Universe, and more specialized auction sites where rare
items are offered. (Auction Universe is a division of Classified
Ventures.com, which is partly owned by The New York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With more auction sites that are specific to collectors, we
could see an enormous growth in the need for escrow services,''
said Sue Rothberg, a senior analyst with Gomez Advisers, an
electronic commerce research firm in Concord, Mass. ``When you're
talking about things like antique Shaker furniture, those people
are serious shoppers who don't want to mess around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothberg said that in a recent survey, she found that just
four of the top 15 Internet auction sites offered some form of
escrow service. ``But that will blossom, I'm certain,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to Ken Pereira, Tradesafe's chief executive, less than
1 percent of auction transactions use escrow, although he expects
such use to exceed 4 percent by year's end. In the future, Pereira
said, ``we don't see it going much beyond 10 percent,'' because he
expects that most auctioned goods will still have relatively low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But operators of escrow services see ample opportunity to
profit. Edeal, a Toronto-based auctioneer that offers customers an
escrow option, is one such example. ``If we start doing large
volumes of deals, there's constant cash in trust for us. It's not
our money, obviously, but you could have a period of a week where
there's $10 million in trust. We could invest it in an extremely
secure Treasury bill, for example, and roll it over at, say, 5
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is ``still figuring out the legalities of it,'' said
Leon Kuperman, chief technology officer for Edeal. ``But we know
there's some potential there.''
</P>
<P>
   But some other auction sites avoid this approach. ``We're
licensed in California, so we have to put the money in a
non-interest-bearing trust,'' said Sanjay Bajaj, vice president for
marketing and business development at I-Escrow. ``But we make our
money on fees. We don't want any incentive to delay payment to
sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bajaj said the number of registered I-Escrow users had grown to
50,000 from 5,000 in the last five months, but ``you'd be surprised
at how many people still don't know about these services.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, perhaps, is that escrow services generally do not
receive prominent placement on auction sites. On Ebay, for
instance, information about the service's escrow providers is
located two pages within sections titled Safe Harbor and After the
Auction.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow information may gain prominence as the value of auctioned
goods rises, though _ and in response to mounting concerns about
auction-related fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the National Consumers League had seen a 600 percent
increase in online fraud reports since 1997, Zona Research warned
in a recent report that ``if the online auction community does not
take steps to limit fraud then it could face serious problems,
including government intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between government intervention and a free-market
solution, auction providers may quickly see the virtue of promoting
escrow services front and center on the user's screen _
representing one small victory for Internet middlemen.

A NOTEBOOK CHOICE FROM IBM: SVELTE OR BULKIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity the poor notebook computer designer. Everyone complains his
notebook is too heavy. But when manufacturers try to make more
svelte machines, users say the screens are too small and the floppy
disks and CD-ROM drives are missing.
</P>
<P>
   That is why many notebooks today come with an array of flaps,
bays and compartments into which disk drives and batteries can be
added or removed. Other machines start small, but wind up looking
like snake pits as all manner of devices are plugged in from the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Corp. is trying to appease the schizophrenic notebook user
with a new model scheduled for introduction Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Thinkpad 570, the new machine is the replacement for
its 560 model, a leader in the four-pound ultraportable category.
IBM calls the machine a transformer, after the cartoon series about
robots that morph into different shapes.
</P>
<P>
   In one incarnation, the 570 appears to be a somewhat bulky
traditional notebook of the kitchen-sink variety. Two inches thick
and weighing 6.8 pounds, the machine has a floppy drive, a CD-ROM
or DVD drive and room for two batteries. But push a button on the
front and a four-pound, one-inch-thick laptop emerges, leaving all
those drives behind in a single base unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a desktop replacement, but they also want the
flexibility to take off when they need,'' said Adalio Sanchez, the
general manager of IBM Mobile Computing.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Reynolds, a research fellow at Dataquest, says that the
570 is part of a series of well-designed products that has helped
IBM regain momentum in the notebook market after losing ground
earlier this year. Still, he said, Dell Computer has burst forward
to take the lead in notebooks for the first time this year, with
Toshiba losing the greatest amount of market share.
</P>
<P>
   The transformer concept represents ``some breakthrough
thinking,'' Reynolds said. ``But I still would be inclined to bet
that it's not going to be a barn-burner. The market has not liked
ultraportable machines alone. And in its big version, it's bigger
than other full-featured notebooks.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM has set the price of the 570 higher than the smaller but
more-pared-down Sony Vaio 505 and at about the same price as the
similar Portege line from Toshiba. The cheapest of IBM's 570
configurations is $2,699, for the notebook machine only, with a
300-megahertz Pentium II processor and a 12.1-inch screen. The
high-end version has a 13.3-inch screen and a 366-megahertz
processor for $3,599.
</P>
<P>
   But to get the full transformer effect, customers will also have
to buy an ``ultrabase'' unit for $119, and a CD-ROM drive for $135.
(Watching movies on the laptop will require a DVD drive for $335
and an extra battery for $209.)

THE INCREDIBLE GREATNESS OF GRETZKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL KRUGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday, Wayne Gretzky will set up behind the opponent's net one
last time, and send one last blind pass into the slot. Network
television will show him. Fans in San Jose, Phoenix, Nashville,
Tampa and Miami will stop to watch him.
</P>
<P>
   And this chain of events will encompass the Gretzky legend, his
legacy of offensive ingenuity, his passing fancy, his spreading and
selling the game to markets that rarely have weather below
freezing. When Wayne Gretzky plays the final game of his 20-year
career today against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Madison Square
Garden, the NHL will say farewell to the man who is bigger in his
game and his world than even Michael Jordan was in his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muhammed Ali may be the closest person who sold a sport as
much as Gretzky,'' said Daryl Reaugh, the Stars' radio and
television analyst who was a teammate of Gretzky's with the
Edmonton Oilers from 1985-88. ``He sold the game in the United
States, pure and simple. And in Canada, he's bigger than Jordan or
Babe Ruth. We don't have royalty in Canada. He's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's global impact even spreads to Fort Worth. Andy Moog,
president of the Fort Worth Brahmas, was a goalie on the Edmonton
Stanley Cup champions of 1984, '85, '87 and '88. And Mike
Krushelnyski, the coach of the recently departed Fort Worth Fire,
was also an Edmonton teammate who was traded with Gretzky to the
Los Angeles Kings in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Moog contends that the trade to Los Angeles paved the way for
the NHL to expand to warm-weather climates. Since that trade, the
NHL has had teamsfind homes in Anaheim, San Jose, Phoenix, Dallas,
Nashville, Tampa and Miami. Atlanta will rejoin the NHL next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was also responsible for the escalation of salaries,''
Krushelnyski said. ``And he always had time for everybody off the
ice. He always signed autographs, visited children in hospitals,
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time we were leaving town at like six in the
morning, and there were all these people waiting for him in front
of the hotel. He signed autographs for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did on the ice, of course, created the off-the-ice
impact. Gretzky's point totals are enough for any three superstars
to accumulate in a career. His NHL-record 2,856 points (894 goals
and 1,962 assists) going into today's game is more than 1,000 ahead
of the next-highest scorer. There are NHL players who go their
career without scoring the 215 points Gretzky did in the 1985-86
season, one of his four 200-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The way Gretzky scored is also part of the legacy. He is widely
renowned as the first player ever to set up from behind the
opponent's net to initiate offense. He created passing lanes from
that vantage point, invented the wrap-around shot from behind the
net, and, as Reaugh said, ``changed the geometry of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In leading the NHL in scoring 10 times, Gretzky was the master
passer, who Krushelnyski said saw the game three or four moves
ahead. Some of the plays he made elicited the old
eyes-in-the-back-of-the head cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Reaugh thought he had them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing a game at the Montreal Forum in 1987, and they
had just installed the new Plexiglass, the kind that didn't scratch
so fans could actually see through it,'' Reaugh remembered. ``He
had the puck at the blue line and the defense was closing in on
him. He dropped a pass to Jari Kurri, and there was no way he could
have known Jari was there. He never looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jari scored, and I asked Wayne after the game how he knew Jari
was there for the pass. He said he saw his reflection in the
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog, Krushelnyski, Reaugh and many others appreciatively call
Gretzky's love of the game his greatest gift. There were times,
Reaugh remembered, when he would come off the ice, get some oxygen
they always kept behind the bench for him, and go back out on the
ice and keep going and going and going.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed the game, like Bobby Orr changed the way defensemen
played and Dominik Hasek plays goalie,'' Reaugh added. ``His
physical skills were equal to his mental skills, which were equal
to his competitive skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan was a great player. Wayne was amazing.'' nn

tobacco producers and 46 states. For anti-smoking groups, the end
of the cigarette billboard stands as a major victory, a choking-off
of an advertising medium that tobacco producers dominated for
nearly 20 years. But it also marks another change, one in this
country's visual landscape. For decades, outdoor tobacco signs were
the canvas used by some of the advertising industry's most-talented
designers and photographers. And the work they produced, ranging
from the quaint to the ingenious to the garish, have served not
only as urban meeting places and reference points for lost
motorists but also as cultural touchstones. By Barry Meier.

SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CLARIFY DISABILITIES ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Pa.)  (jw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beginning on Wednesday with a case that some
lawyers have labeled the Brown vs. Board of Education of the
disability rights movement, the Supreme Court is embarking on an
unusually extensive review of a single federal statute, the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' decision to hear four disability act cases over a
two-week period reflects the fact that the full dimensions of this
far-reaching civil rights law remain uncharted even after nearly 10
years on the books.
</P>
<P>
   The law has become broadly familiar for removing physical
barriers in public places and for opening the workplace to people
with disabilities. Indeed, three of the cases do involve employment
disputes, presenting the surprisingly unsettled issue of whether a
physical problem that is kept in check through medication or
compensated for by something as simple as corrective lenses
qualifies under the law as a disability.
</P>
<P>
   The case scheduled for Wednesday, the first of the four, is
different. There is no easy remedy at hand for the problems facing
the plaintiffs, two Georgia women whose disabilities include mental
retardation, mental illness and brain damage. In suing the state
the two women, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, sought not employment
but a life outside the Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta, a
large state institution. Both women spent many months in the
hospital waiting for placement in a home-like environment that
their doctors said would be medically and socially appropriate but
for which there were long waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   The question in the case, Olmstead vs. L.C., No. 98-536, is
whether the Americans with Disabilities Act requires a state to
offer such a setting, for example, a small, supervised group home,
for people for whom such a setting is appropriate. The federal
appeals court in Atlanta ruled last year that it does.
</P>
<P>
   In the four months since the justices agreed to hear Georgia's
appeal, the case has galvanized advocates of disability rights. It
pits Georgia and a group of other states against the Clinton
administration, which is defending a regulation issued in the
earliest days of the law, in President George Bush's
administration, that endorses the principle of ``integration'' of
people with disabilities into the wider population, to the greatest
extent possible, in the provision of public services.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Title II of the law, which applies to public
services offered by state and local governments. It provides that
``no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of
such disability, be excluded from participation in'' or ``be
subjected to discrimination'' by a government program or service.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 regulation, issued by the attorney general under a
congressional directive ``to issue regulations setting forth the
forms of discrimination prohibited,'' provides that services or
programs shall be offered ``in the most integrated setting
appropriate to the needs'' of people with disabilities. The
regulation came to be known as the ``integration mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision in the Georgia case last year, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals declared, ``By definition where, as here,
the state confines an individual with a disability in an
institutionalized setting when a community placement is
appropriate, the state has violated the core principle underlying
the Americans with Disabilities Act's integration mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   State budgetary restrictions were not a defense, the appeals
court said, unless the cost of compliance was ``so unreasonable
given the demands of the state's mental health budget that it would
fundamentally alter the service it provides.''
</P>
<P>
   In ruling against the state, the 11th Circuit agreed with the
one other federal appeals court to have addressed the question, in
a case from Philadelphia that the Supreme Court declined to review
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for the court to agree to hear a case on the
meaning of a federal law in the absence of conflicting opinions
among the lower federal courts. So disability rights' advocates
were alarmed when the Court accepted Georgia's appeal, interpreting
the action as a signal that the justices were moved by the strong
states' rights tone of Georgia's petition for review and were
leaning toward overturning the appeals court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as Adapt, a nationwide organization of people with
disabilities, lobbied and demonstrated in many of the 22 states
that had formed a coalition in support of Georgia's appeal by
signing a brief as friends of the Court. Four states later joined
the coalition. But as a result of Adapt's lobbying efforts, more
than half the states had dropped out of the coalition by the time
Georgia filed its final brief, a highly unusual turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was a public statement by Michigan Solicitor General
Thomas Casey, who said that after taking a ``fresh look'' at the
case, his state had concluded that ``Georgia's arguments are not
consistent with the state of Michigan's position as a leader in
community-based mental health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after signing the final version of the multistate brief in
support of Georgia's position, some states continued to have second
thoughts, and several disavowed their position. Massachusetts
officials, for example, explained that the state's signature on the
brief ``has been wrongly interpreted as a retreat by the
Commonwealth from its long-standing support of disability rights in
general and deinstitutionalization in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The states now in Georgia's camp are Indiana, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Hawaii, South Carolina, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming,
Washington, Texas and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Massachusetts, Minnesota and Louisiana withdrew their
support after signing the final brief. In addition to Michigan, the
states that initially supported Georgia but declined to sign the
final brief were Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah and West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 58 former state commissions and directors of
mental health from 36 states, including New York, New Jersey, and
Connecticut, filed a brief in their own names, supporting homelike
care as more appropriate and effective and asking the court not to
accept Georgia's ``alarmist claims'' about the impact of the 11th
Circuit's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's basic argument, made in its brief to the court, is
that the appeals court misapplied the integration regulation, which
itself exceeds the scope of the statute. In enacting the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the brief asserts, Congress did not make ``a
national value judgment that the `least restrictive treatment' must
be provided to psychiatric patients, to say nothing of imposing on
the states the massive and indeterminate fiscal burdens that would
follow such a decision.'' Simply ``requiring a person to wait her
turn for a community placement'' is evidence of fiscal constraint
but not of discrimination, the state says.
</P>
<P>
   Emphatic as the state is in making its argument, the other side
speaks fervently of the case as the ultimate test of the statute's
meaning and identity as a civil rights law, ``the Brown vs. Board
of Education for disability rights,'' in the words of Stephen Gold,
a lawyer representing Adapt and other disability groups.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gold, of the Public Interest Law Center of
Philadelphia, said people with disabilities had long faced
segregation reminiscent of the segregation based on race. ``If the
Americans with Disabilities Act did not mean to end unnecessary
segregation, then all the work we did in promulgating it as a civil
rights statute is a sham,'' he said. ``We're just trying to get
people out of institutions who don't have to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The two plaintiffs, having won their lawsuit, have been living
successfully in the community, Ms. Curtis in a three-person group
home and Ms. Wilson in an apartment of her own with supportive
services. Both are planning to attend the Supreme Court argument.
</P>
<P>
   Before the month ends, the Court will hear the three other
disability act cases, which all raise the question of how to define
the disabilities that bring a person within the law's protection.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff in Murphy vs. United Parcel Service, No. 967-1992,
to be argued on April 27, is a truck driver whose high blood
pressure is controlled with medication. He sued under the
disability law after his employer dismissed him, and is now
appealing a ruling by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.
The court, viewing his condition in its medicated state, concluded
that he was not a person with a disability and was not entitled to
sue.
</P>
<P>
   On April 28, the court will hear Sutton vs. United Air Lines,
No. 97-1943, a similar case in which twin sisters, both nearsighted
but with vision correctable to 20/20, were denied jobs as pilots
because they did not meet the airline's requirement for uncorrected
vision. The same appeals court in Denver held that they had no
basis for a lawsuit because their correctable vision was not a
disability. In both cases, the question is whether a disability
should be assessed in its ``mitigated'' or uncorrected state.
</P>
<P>
   The final case, Albertsons vs. Kirkingburg, No. 98-591, also
scheduled for April 28, presents the somewhat different situation
of a truck driver who sees out of only one eye but whose brain has
compensated for the deficiency. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in
San Francisco, concluding that he sees adequately but in a
``different manner'' from most other people, found him to be
disabled and therefore entitled to sue the employer that dismissed
him. The employer is appealing.

   LOS ANGELES _ If the Lakers have a tough time defending their
recent lousy play, it shouldn't be a surprise. They can't defend
much of anything lately.
</P>
<P>
   Over their last 10 games, the Lakers have given up an average of
102.9 points _ worst in the NBA during that span. In the same
10-game stretch, Lakers opponents are shooting 46.8 percent, the
26th-worst figure among the 29 teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, they went 5-5 during that run. They have lost
three straight and four of six heading into tonight's home game
against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the defense, the only element of the game a player can
control every night with simple hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, it doesn't matter how you're shooting the
basketball. Each game mentally you can come out and play defense,''
Derek Fisher said. ``Physically you can do that. We can't continue
to be at the bottom of the league defensively and expect to be at
the top of the league standings. We have to be able to stop teams
from scoring a lot of points, and right now we aren't doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. The Lakers have given up 100 points or more in five
of their last seven games and are 5-12 overall this season when
they do. Only three teams have allowed opponents to score 100-plus
more often _ the Clippers, Denver and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   No one's pointing fingers around the locker room, but maybe it's
because two of the main culprits for the defensive slide now play
in Charlotte. Eddie Jones was the Lakers' best all-around defender
and one of the best in the league among guards, and Elden Campbell
was their best power forward to defend against the league's bigger
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence both were present when the Lakers last beat
the Utah Jazz _ in Salt Lake City no less _ on March 7, just days
before they were traded for Glen Rice and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   And without Dennis Rodman, the Lakers are now weaker defensively
at three positions than they were before the trade _ shooting
guard, where Kobe Bryant replaced Jones; small forward, where Rice
replaced Bryant; and power forward, where Reid and Travis Knight
are sharing time.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the once-feeble Hornets have won seven straight
and are 14-8 since the trade. The Lakers are 10-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' season totals are reflective of a long, bad
defensive trend: 25th in the league in points allowed (95.8), worst
among playoff teams; 17th in opponents' field-goal percentage
(43.8) and 24th in opponents' turnovers (13.9 per game).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defensive slide, coach Kurt Rambis said he saw
progress in Saturday's loss at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense wasn't as good as it could be, but we did a much
better job doing the things that I was asking the team to do,'' he
said. ``I could see the effort, I could see them trying to do the
things we worked on, but we did have breakdowns which got us into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it, and we will get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: After missing nearly a week with a case of
tonsillitis, Glen Rice played 31 minutes Saturday and showed no
effects of the illness, hitting 4 of 10 shots for 11 points, with
two rebounds, three assists and a blocked shot. But he scored only
four points after a seven-point first quarter, taking only four
shots the rest of the game as the offense disintegrated.

NATO ESTIMATE OF ALBANIANS KILLED CALLED `VERY LOW' BY
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.) (rk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of ethnic Albanians killed by Serbs in
Kosovo may be far higher than the few thousand cited by NATO
officials in recent days, the Clinton administration's top official
assembling evidence of war crimes said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes,
said NATO's estimate that 3,200 civilians have been killed in the
Serbs' rampage through Kosovo was ``very low.'' He suggested that
tens of thousands more civilians were at risk or had already
perished, because _ he said _ the fate of 100,000 ethnic Albanian
men is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster his case, he cited surveillance pictures that he said
supported reports by refugees of atrocities and of men being
separated from women by armed Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman, said that the Serb
police have forced ethnic Albanian men into ``grave-digging chain
gangs'' to bury the victims of their purges in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, NATO has begun releasing surveillance
photographs showing what officials said look like mass graves.
Scheffer, speaking on the Fox television network Sunday, said one
of these photographs was ``corroborated by refugee reports and
other sources of information'' that he did not disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs came in, torched the town, and then proceeded with
massacres of individual groups of Kosovars,'' he said, without
giving further details.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that refugees reported being dressed in red jackets to
dig the graves, and that NATO had photographic evidence to support
their stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites are neat rows of individual graves, pointing to
the southeast, toward Mecca,'' he said. The Albanians are typically
Muslim, who unlike the Serbs would bury their dead in this fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The new details appeared to be intended to bolster the so far
unproven claims by American and European politicians about how
widespread the killing has been in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco on Thursday, President Clinton said that the
Serbs had displaced ``over a million Kosovars'' and had killed and
raped ``thousands upon thousands of them.''
</P>
<P>
   From the interviews that journalists and relief workers have
conducted with scores of refugees from Kosovo, there is no reason
to doubt him.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point it is also impossible to prove that he is
correct.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. government and its NATO allies have systematically
compiled records of the atrocities, they are not disclosing the
information. Nor is there a clearinghouse or database for the
material gathered by the journalists and representatives of private
organizations who are talking to the refugees at the borders.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, all there has been _ at least until now _ is a
compelling repetition of anecdotal information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting little flash bulb pictures, and that's all,''
said Fred Abrahams, the Kosovo researcher for Human Rights Watch, a
private group investigating potential war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Fox, Washington director of Open Society, the foundation
created by financier George Soros to promote democracy in former
communist countries, had a different image.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no supermarket for this information in the government
or elsewhere,'' he said. ``It's like a county fair where you've got
to go stall to stall.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, State Department Spokesman James P. Rubin said
Friday that more than 400 cities, towns and villages in Kosovo had
been destroyed by Serb forces. In recent days, the State Department
released a list of more than 100 places, ranging alphabetically
from Acareva to Zym, where ``war crimes or violations of
international humanitarian law'' had been reported.
</P>
<P>
   And Shea reported Sunday that ``numerous refugee reports have
reached us'' of ethnic Albanian men and boys being forced to dig
coal from local mines to feed the power plant in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials concede that in most of these cases the
evidence of specific crimes is inconclusive and that in many of
them it is quite sketchy _ a report from one newspaper, for
example, or the word of one refugee. Concrete evidence is hard to
come by without investigators on the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable statistics on the number of refugees come from
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which publishes a daily
count. Through Sunday, the organization reported, 564,700 refugees
had registered at border crossings, 359,000 of them in Albania and
the rest in Montenegro, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the United States have estimated that 700,000 or
more ethnic Albanians have been routed from their homes but have
not left Kosovo. That figure is less reliable than the U.N. count
of refugees who have crossed into another country.
</P>
<P>
   Professional human rights advocates have been struck by the
extent to which the government is making accusations of war crimes
in Kosovo without offering firm evidence to back them up. The
advocates contrast this with the early days of the war in Bosnia in
1992 and 1993, when the government discounted authoritative reports
of atrocities from Western correspondents and aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Bush and Clinton administrations feared that public
outrage in the United States might require a stronger response than
the government wanted to make. Now, the crimes committed against
the Albanian Kosovars are the main rationale for bombing Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates of expanding the war believe the
administration is withholding from the pubic gruesome evidence that
might increase the demand for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the individual accounts of atrocities reported by
refugees who have left Kosovo, the allies are relying on what
government spokesmen refer to as ``national technical means,'' a
euphemism for spy satellites and other photographic and electronic
intelligence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cameras on satellites are photographing acres and acres of
Kosovo several times a day. Low-flying pilotless Predators, one of
which was shot down in the early days of the war, are also taking
photos.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures are interpreted by a team of analysts working round
the clock for the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, an obscure
branch of the Defense Department with headquarters in Bethesda, Md.
The agency's budget is classified, and the number of its employees
is secret.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the new evidence Rubin cited on Friday was from
aerial photographs, although he would not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Such photos, which give the impression of authenticity, have
become staples of the press briefings on the war here and at the
NATO headquarters in Brussels. But technological experts question
how useful they really are in uncovering evidence of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many frames to be reviewed and so many images that
are inconclusive that solid evidence is rarely developed, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schmitt, a technology specialist at the U.S. Institute of
Peace, a federally funded research center here, conducted a
conference last week on the technical means of investigating human
rights violations. In an interview afterward, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagery appears to offer the the promise of a safe, disengaged
way to monitor very dangerous situations. In fact, it doesn't
really tell you much. The process is deadly boring, time consuming,
tedious and expensive. It's not glamorous or rewarding.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will approach or exceed 100 degrees on Monday
across parts of the deserts of southern California and southern
Arizona as a very warm ridge of high pressure holds steady over the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, showers will dampen parts of western Washington
and Oregon as a modest disturbance moves inland from the Pacific.
Showers will taper off later in the day as a pocket of dry Pacific
air arrives.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, showers will develop over parts of the northern
Rockies while isolated thunderstorms, triggered by a jet stream
disturbance, will flare over southeast Montana and eastern Wyoming.
A few storms may reach South Dakota and Nebraska by Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, a broad area of clouds dappled by a few
enclaves of sun will cover the region from the Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley to the northern and central Appalachians. As the day
progresses, the entire area will tend to fill with clouds. Showers
will develop, particularly in parts of the Ohio Valley and the
mountains in the northern Middle Atlantic and southern New England
states, as disturbances lift moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Northeast seaboard will start with some sunshine,
but clouds will increase by late morning or early afternoon.
Showers may survive the trip over the central Appalachians,
eventually dampening parts of the northern Middle Atlantic seaboard
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms will affect parts of the Tennessee and
lower Mississippi Valleys as cold air arrives aloft while mild,
modestly moist air amasses near the ground.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Boston Marathon
</P>
<P>
   The weather will be favorable for runners competing in Monday's
Boston Marathon. Temperatures will range from the 50s at the start
of the race in Hopkinton to the upper 50s or low 60s at the finish
line in Boston. Humidity will be low and breezes from the northwest
averaging 7 to 15 m.p.h. will provide a tail wind.
</P>
<P>
   Dry breezes will accelerate the evaporation of perspiration,
helping to keep runners cool under a sky of variable sun and
clouds. Nonetheless, runners will need to drink fluids regularly,
given that a quart of water an hour can be lost through sweat
during strenuous exercise. &QL;

AT AGE 51, RODGERS HAS ANOTHER BOSTON MARATHON MILESTONE IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bill Rodgers always loved running a marathon. He did
not mind the routine aches. He dismissed the late-race pain that
wracked his glucose-starved body. But in 1992, tired of a new
injury every other day, he ran (he said then) his last marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. When the 103rd annual Boston Marathon is held Monday,
the hometown icon known as Boston Billy, now 51 years old, will run
again. He is not the all-conquering hero who won four Boston and
four New York City marathons between 1975 and 1980. Still, when he
talks about his return, he sounds as impassioned as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do a lot of marathons and it's tough,'' he said in an
interview. ``I've done 57, including 16 in Boston, and I'm not beat
up for all that. They can tear you down. Nothing major happened to
me, but I was having trouble getting to the starting line
injury-free. That's one reason I quit marathons, and by quitting
them, I'm still able to run now.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of marathons, he has been running shorter road races.
Last year, he ran 29 races from 5,000 meters to a half-marathon and
never lost in the veterans' class for men 50 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he ran one marathon in the last seven years _ the
centennial Boston Marathon in 1996. But he made that a fun race,
and his time of 2 hours 53 minutes 23 seconds was far from his
career best of 2:09:27 here in 1979. His goal Monday is 2:31, which
would make him the fastest American veteran in Boston history
(50-year-old Norm Green set the record of 2:31:34 in 1983).
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who makes a good living from the sport with a running
shop in Boston, appearance fees and endorsements, shows few signs
of advancing years. His hair is still thick and blond. His
freshness, his charm and his boyish innocence have survived. He
even makes aging sound like fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``My training has been going well,'' he said. ``My legs are fine
and my head is OK. Mentally, I'm there, but physically, that's the
hard part after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age 51 is tricky for everyone. Sports like this _ running and
walking _ are the best way to get older. It's a blast. You just
have to back off a bit. You can't be so enthusiastic about training
because you've done this so many years. You've put in your time on
the roads. You've paid your dues big time, so in that sense this is
a hard sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard or not, it is his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love to run,'' he said. ``It's harder now, but in one
sense it's easier because I've got a lot of friends who run with
me. I train with some younger guys. We did 21 miles over the Boston
course and they dropped me after a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sport is so different. It can beat you up. I'm not going
to run three or four marathons a year ever again. The marathon's
not my main race anymore. My main thing now is a road race, maybe a
10-kilometer. Now I want to do what old John Kelley did, run for
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Kelley won the Boston Marathon in 1935 and 1945. He ran
the race into his 80s, always waving to the crowds and soaking up
adoration. He is Icon No. 1 of the Boston Marathon. Rodgers is Icon
No. 2, and like Kelley he is happy with life past and present. But
what if Rodgers were young again?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were younger,'' he said, ``I would have to run against
all those great Kenyans. I ran against Henry Rono of Kenya and I
ran against a lot of Ethiopians and they burned me. Now, there are
so many top competitors. But I love the competition. I would like
to see if I could run faster against these guys now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers smiled. His eyes wandered. The young middle-aged man
wouldn't mind at all.

SOPHOMORE JINX GIVES DAVID GUTERSON NO PAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ David Guterson Country beckons once more.
</P>
<P>
   Here again is the Northwest rendered with a painterly attention
to landscape detail. Here again is deep personal crisis isolated
for dramatic effect. And here again is a moral novel for a
semi-moral world, one that examines questions of life and death and
personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Guterson's ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' one of the publishing
phenomenons of this decade with 3 million copies sold around the
world, finally has its long-awaited follow _ ``East of the
Mountains.'' (Harcourt Brace, 277 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   But avid Guterson readers expecting the new novel to be some
version of ``Snow II: The Story Continues'' do not know the
42-year-old Bainbridge Island, Wash., author, his full-speed-ahead
personality, his relentless commitment to developing his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a fresh start in all ways,'' Guterson stressed recently
in Seattle. ``I need a new landscape, a new sense of structure, a
new point-of-view. Otherwise, I won't be able to sustain the effort
needed to finish the book. If I'm repeating myself, then I'm not
interested. After `Snow,' I couldn't imagine myself writing any
more sentences about rain and forests and saltwater. I was
exhausted by that.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``East of the Mountains'' not only forsakes rain-laden Puget
Sound, it crosses the Cascades for a setting amid the bright skies,
the burnished hills and nurtured orchards in Central Washington
around Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   Banished from this new Guterson novel are the sort of proven
plot devices that hooked readers into ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' _
the whodunit, the courtroom drama, the forbidden romance. ``East of
the Mountains'' instead features a 73-year-old protagonist with
terminal colon cancer, a retired and widowed Seattle heart surgeon
who travels east to commit suicide where he grew up, and with plans
to make his death look like a bird-hunting accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this book could seem morbid; it's morbid from page
one,'' Guterson conceded. ``So I had to quickly dispense with that.
I had to make it what I wanted it to be _ a contemporary adventure
story, this unfolding picaresque. I knew that was the challenge of
this book.''
</P>
<P>
   That challenge did not daunt Guterson, a supremely
self-confident writer who firmly believes the mythic journey of Dr.
Ben Givens and its many detours will ensnare readers.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does that challenge daunt Harcourt Brace, his publisher,
which is rushing a huge first printing of 475,000 copies into
bookstores on Tuesday. This is ``the biggest book in Harcourt's
history,'' emphasized Dan Farley, president and publisher. ``East
of the Mountains'' is being backed with a $500,000 promotional
budget that will send Guterson on a two-month book tour throughout
the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But Harcourt's great expectations for ``East of the Mountains''
also represent a huge gamble for both publisher and its star
writer, as Farley acknowledged last week. Printing almost a half
million copies of Guterson's novel puts this literary writer in the
big leagues with such best-selling authors as Anne Rice, Richard
Paul Evans and Richard North Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   And it also means that if Guterson sells less than his hefty
first printing _ 200,000 copies, for example, usually a significant
success for a literary writer _ then his second novel could be seen
as a failure in the marketplace and imperil his growing reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a risk if this book doesn't take off,'' conceded
Farley, ``a real high risk that people may not think of this book
as a success.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher's gamble could have been lessened by doing a
smaller first printing and then going back to press for additional
printings, which could have created much-desired ``velocity'' of
demand behind the book. But Harcourt rejected that approach, a
decision which is looking even more risky now that initial reviews
of ``East of the Mountains'' by major publications have been
decidedly mixed, or downright brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew some people would take shots at this novel based on
the success enjoyed by `Snow Falling on Cedars,''' Farley said.
``But we believe readers still like the way David Guterson looks at
the world and are waiting for what he wants to tell next, even if
it's a novel with different pacing. The number of copies in the
first printing is a number we expect to increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Guterson pronounces himself resolutely above the sales fray,
concerned only with his work. He is still willing to help with
interviews and readings and photographs, the stuff of book
marketing, but firmly believes whatever happens happens.
</P>
<P>
   So the sophomore jinx for writers with huge first books gives
Guterson no pause (although some friends and family wonder how it
could not). Nor is Guterson given pause by the 475,000-book first
printing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to write the book, and what happens after that, I
can't control,'' Guterson emphasized. ``I'm sure there are writers
out there who get excited about what happens after, but what is
exciting to me is writing the book. There's really nothing I can do
after that. My publisher can print as many copies as they want,
they can do whatever they want to do, it's out of my hands. If it
turns out to be a failure, what can I do? I wrote the best book I
could. I don't worry about things outside my control.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the hard-won lessons of someone who went almost
overnight from being a high school English teacher and aspiring
writer to a People magazine celebrity, with every aspect of his
private life suddenly exposed to public view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' consumed eight years of the writer's
life to complete and another two years to promote, as it went from
a surprise near-best seller in hardback for Harcourt in 1994 to a
No. 1 in paperback for Vintage Books in 1996; the book is now a
movie that will be released in October.
</P>
<P>
   Guterson spent so long on the road for ``Snow,'' both in this
country and abroad, that he could not stand to read it anymore. He
instead read from drafts of ``East of the Mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered that `Snow' could have become my full-time job,''
Guterson recalled. ``If I didn't manage it, I would be an author,
not a writer. I gradually realized it was up to me. If I didn't
learn to say, `No' to people, I'd never write anything again.''
</P>
<P>
   These hard-won lessons were not just born with ``Snow.''
Guterson has been unusually focused on writing ever since he was at
the University of Washington, where the Seattle native received a
bachelor's and a master's. Guterson's graduate school mentor was
Charles Johnson, the National Book Award-winning writer, who
recalls him as ``one of the most committed young writers I've ever
worked with.''
</P>
<P>
   Guterson has a similar recollection of his college days: ``When
I set out in the writing life at 21, I felt confident from the
beginning about how things would go. I knew that, if I worked hard,
things would go well. I never doubted myself, never. I never had
some dark hour or crisis when I thought of turning it over and
doing something else, no matter how many rejection slips I
received. I knew I was a writer. Call that confidence, if you want,
but I just knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing a novel to follow ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' might seem
a daunting challenge to even a writer with the deepest reservoir of
self-confidence. But Guterson had begun ``East of the Mountains''
before ``Snow'' turned phenomenon, and its success did not derail
him, as he built the new novel ``in the abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   Themes to explore came to him first, then the landscape. As
Guterson related, ``I have a very powerful, poetic impulse about
landscape, which I have to rein in. The beauty of the world
inspires me with an ache.''
</P>
<P>
   Last came the characters for ``East of the Mountains,''
including Givens, inspired by Guterson's late uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The thread linking the novel's elements is the quest, a staple
of literature in classics such as ``The Odyssey'' and ``Don
Quixote,'' as well as the recent best seller, ``Cold Mountain.'' In
the quest, the traveler is focused on a destination, but is
diverted by crises that lead to greater self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   So Ben Givens, this healer of hearts now intent on suicide, must
confront a car crash, forced marches in the wilds, the kindness and
derision of strangers, an attack by wild dogs, his first
hitchhiking in decades, a night in a migrant camp, the cancer in
his gut. He also must confront dreams of his past, youth amid the
orchards, courtship of his wife, combat service in World War II,
all these present and past dramas leading up to what used to be
called The Moment of Truth.
</P>
<P>
   As Guterson said, ``This book asks basic philosophical questions
_ What reasons do we have for going on living? For Givens, that is
a literal question, since he is dying. But we all have to discover
reasons to go on. We're all in his shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Givens' journey and where it is heading is often underscored in
``East of the Mountains'' with religious and spiritual signposts,
references to ``better alive than dead'' or ``kind of a miracle''
or ``back from the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the writer as moral teacher. This notion of a novel with
a higher purpose was part of the considerable appeal of ``Snow
Falling on Cedars.'' But it is conveyed with less subtlety in the
``compressed and spare'' world of ``East of the Mountains,'' where
Guterson's intent seems more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my two novels end with something uplifting, that's because
that's the kind of writer I am,'' Guterson emphasized. ``I believe
in that. I don't want people to stare into the deep abyss and come
away despondent.''
</P>
<P>
   Life has changed for Guterson and his family in the wake of
``Snow Falling on Cedars.'' The parade of journalists through their
lives was interesting for a while, but now seems intrusive, even
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Although Guterson is a rare writer who often takes his wife or
children along on his book tours, the family is now bracing for
more than the publicity glare accompanying ``East of the
Mountains.'' The movie version of ``Snow,'' reportedly brought
Guterson $1 million in film rights.
</P>
<P>
   Guterson worked closely with director Scott Hicks on the script
for the film and considers the finished movie to be ``a work of
genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Family continues to matter deeply to Guterson, as his family and
friends attest. Ralph Cheadle is a longtime friend and a former
teaching compatriot who observed, ``David's got his priorities and
his No. 1 priority is his family. He's not changed about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guterson takes great pride in his children, but wishes ``I had
done a better job in raising them; I have not been as good a father
as mine was.''
</P>
<P>
   The view of his father, Murray Guterson, a noted Seattle
attorney, is: ``David has made such a wonderful thing with his
life, with his wife and children. I just couldn't be more proud of
him as a father or a husband. And the nicest thing about David is
that he is just as nice as he was when he was broke. ... But if he
did start to change, you can bet he would hear about it in a New
York second from me.''
</P>
<P>
   The trademark Guterson earnestness and purposefulness remains
steadfastly in place. The writer considers himself to be ``very,
very lucky'' to have attained such success, but he is wary of fame
and its distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to get too wound up about a good or bad review _ I
do not want anything extreme, so I ignore most of it,'' Guterson
said. ``I have tried, even with the success of `Snow' to stay on
the same road. I've been happy on that road. Why fly off on a
tangent, move to Paris, buy a Mercedes? I wouldn't be happy then.''

 COLUMN-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   If I'd misquoted Shakespeare, it's questionable whether any
readers of this column would have noticed or cared. But I
inadvertently rearranged ``The Greatest Poem Ever Written,'' and
79-year-old Billie McKenna isn't going to allow me to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The least you can do is quote it correctly,'' McKenna wrote.
``I learned this poem as a child.'' And she quotes it ...
correctly, we can hope.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to Carnation
</P>
<P>
   The best in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Here I stand
</P>
<P>
   With a can in my hand
</P>
<P>
   No teats to pull
</P>
<P>
   No dung to pitch
</P>
<P>
   Just poke a hole
</P>
<P>
   In the son of a ...
</P>
<P>
   B. Hammer, another reader blessed with an excellent memory and
great poetic tastes, writes: ``Love your food quotes. My favorite
is from Richard Armour.''
</P>
<P>
   Shake, shake
</P>
<P>
   The ketchup bottle,
</P>
<P>
   None will come
</P>
<P>
   And then a'lot'll.
</P>
<P>
   To further define the great poetry of the 20th century, we place
the following in nomination:
</P>
<P>
   An epicure dining at Crewe
</P>
<P>
   Found a large mouse in his stew.
</P>
<P>
   Said the waiter, ``Don't shout
</P>
<P>
   Or wave it about,
</P>
<P>
   Or the rest will be wanting one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That recalls this ``Epitaph on a Waiter.''
</P>
<P>
   By and by
</P>
<P>
   God caught his eye
</P>
<P>
   And there was this instructional poem for cooks.
</P>
<P>
   When in danger
</P>
<P>
   Or in doubt,
</P>
<P>
   Run in circles,
</P>
<P>
   Scream and shout
</P>
<P>
   Eaters residing south of the Mason-Dixon Line might nominate the
following for a Nobel prize in poetry.
</P>
<P>
   True grits
</P>
<P>
   More grits
</P>
<P>
   Fish, grits and collards.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good where grits are swallered.
</P>
<P>
   Like all great poets, Ogden Nash and Dorothy Parker were eager
eaters. Lamented Nash in his, ``Reflections on Hospital
Hospitality'':
</P>
<P>
   One eats no meats,
</P>
<P>
   Just Jello and beets,
</P>
<P>
   And soups,
</P>
<P>
   And schloops of Cream of Wheat
</P>
<P>
   A product of the Roaring '20s, Parker wrote:
</P>
<P>
   Eat and drink and laugh and lie,
</P>
<P>
   Love the reeling midnight through.
</P>
<P>
   For tomorrow we shall die
</P>
<P>
   (But, alas, we never do.)
</P>
<P>
   These authors desperately needed a healthy restorative, and
these recipes fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Morning-After Oysters
</P>
<P>
   1 pint medium oysters
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon celery salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   Splat of Tabasco Sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sherry
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan cook the oysters in their liquor just until they
begin to firm up. Transfer to a cutting board, cut the little
buggers in half.
</P>
<P>
   In the oyster liquor that remains in the pan, saute the paprika,
celery salt and pepper for 30 seconds. Return the oysters to the
pan.
</P>
<P>
   Combine in a bowl the ketchup, lemon juice, Worcestershire and
Tabasco and stir this mess into the pan with the oysters. Stir in
the sour cream and sherry and when hot serve the oysters over
toast. Serves two.
</P>
<P>
   Poetic Potato Soup
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups minced onion
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced carrots

   Three-quarters pound low-fat kielbasa or your favorite sausage
</P>
<P>
   8 cups shredded kale leaves (about 2 bunches, discarding stems)
</P>
<P>
   Salt, black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a kettle saute the garlic, onion and carrots in the olive
oil. Add the baking potatoes, the broth and four 4 cups water.
Bring to a boil and simmer until the potatoes are tender.
</P>
<P>
   In a blender or food processor, dump the potato hunks and 1 and
one half cups of the broth. Lean on the button until you have a
puree. (If you didn't put the top on the blender, what you have is
a big mess.)
</P>
<P>
   Pour the puree back into the soup pot. Add the kielbasa, cut up.
Dump in the kale and the red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Add salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper to taste. Cook the
soup covered until the potatoes are tender. Makes six to eight
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   This potato soup doth beat
</P>

FANS PICK BEST AND WORST OF ALL TIME
</HEADLINE>

By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most overrated fighter of all time? Muhammad
Ali?
</P>
<P>
   The Ring magazine published its extensive reader's poll in its
latest issue. Some of the results were ridiculous, such as the
notion that Ali wasn't as good as we've believed all these years.
Some were right on, that Ray Robinson was the greatest fighter of
all time, for example. All are great fodder for argument.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the results of the poll (begin ital)and(end ital) the
Daily News' take on each question:
</P>
<P>
   Best fighter pound-for-pound today: Readers _ Roy Jones Jr.
(52.5 percent of readers believe Jones is No.1). Daily News _
Jones. Just because there's no one for him to fight doesn't mean
he's not the best.
</P>
<P>
   Greatest fighter pound-for-pound of all time: Readers _ Robinson
(62.4 percent). DN _ Robinson. It should've been 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greatest heavyweight of all time: Readers _ Ali (51.9 percent).
DN _ Joe Louis. He had (begin ital)25(end ital) title defenses from
1937 to 1948, an unparalleled championship reign, and suffered two
of his three losses only after coming out of retirement because he
needed money.
</P>
<P>
   Most entertaining fighter today: Readers _ Arturo Gatti. DN _
Gatti. The problem is he won't last long fighting with such
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Least entertaining fighter today: Readers _ Chris Byrd (15.6
percent). DN _ Pernell Whitaker. He should be bottled as a cure for
insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Most entertaining fighter of all time: Readers _ Ali. DN _ Ali.
It was more his personality than what he brought into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Least entertaining fighter of all time: Readers _ Whitaker (10.7
percent). Daily News _ Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   Most underrated fighter today: Readers _ Chris Byrd (7.2
percent). DN _ Johnny Tapia. The WBA bantamweight champion is
undefeated in 47 fights for a reason: He's a great boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Most overrated fighter today: Readers _ Naseem Hamed (25.4
percent). DN _ Hamed. He should be commended for creating the
illusion that he's a great fighter. That's where his genius lies.
</P>
<P>
   Most overrated fighter of all time: Readers _ Ali (17 percent).
DN _ Mike Tyson. Those who weren't afraid of him gave him trouble.
He was a good, not great, heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   Most underrated fighter of all time: Readers _ Ezzard Charles
(8.2 percent). DN _ Larry Holmes. He had a Louis-like lock on the
division but had the misfortune of succeeding Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest puncher today: Readers _ Tyson. DN _ Tyson. Even now, no
one can end a fight more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Best jab today: Readers _ Ike Quartey (30.2 percent). Daily News
_ Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Best left hook today: Readers _ Oscar De La Hoya (21.2 percent).
DN _ De La Hoya. He doesn't have one-punch knockout power in it,
but it destroys opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Most courageous fighter today: Readers _ Gatti (48.4 percent).
Daily News _ Gatti. He has (begin ital)too much(end ital) courage
for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   Best right hand today: Readers _ Lennox Lewis. DN _ Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Best infighter today: Readers _ Evander Holyfield (20.3
percent). DN _ Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Best defense today: Readers _ Whitaker. DN _ Jones. Whitaker
didn't display such great defense against Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Best body puncher today: Readers _ Jones (16.3 percent). DN _
Shane Mosley. The runner-up to Jones in best pound-for-pound
fighter category has a great body of work.
</P>
<P>
   Fastest hands today: Readers _ Jones (48.9 percent). DN _ Floyd
Mayweather. If there were a way to measure it, it'd be no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Best footwork today: Readers _ Roy Jones (23.2 percent). DN _
Mosley. He's always balanced, always in position to throw power
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Best chin today: Readers _ Holyfield (14.5 percent). Daily News
_ Julio Cesar Chavez. He's not the fighter, he was but he still
can't be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest underachiever today: Readers _ Michael Moorer (9.8
percent). DN _ Jose Luis Lopez. His reported lack of discipline
could deprive the world of a great fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest overachiever today: Holyfield (36.6 percent). DN _
Holyfield. He turned himself into one of the better heavyweights of
all time through remarkable dedication and determination.
</P>
<P>
   Best trainer today: Readers _ Emanual Steward (32.2 percent). DN
_ Steward. No one is more coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Worst trainer today: Readers _ Teddy Atlas (13.3 percent). DN _
Who trains Hamed?
</P>
<P>
   Best promoter today: Readers _ Don King (38.9 percent). DN _
King. In terms of the actual promotion, no one does it better.
</P>
<P>
   Worst promoter today: Readers _ King (66.8 percent). DN _ King.
In terms of the disastrous impact he has on the integrity of the
sport, this is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Best referee today: Readers _ Mills Lane (63.4 percent). DN _
Mitch Halpern. Lane is retired.
</P>
<P>
   Worst referee today: Readers _ Richard Steele (40.9 percent). DN
_ Steele. The memories of past debacles linger.
</P>
<P>
   Best blow-by-blow commentator today: Readers _ Jim Lampley (52.9
percent). DN _ Lampley. No contest.
</P>
<P>
   Best color commentator today: Readers _ Larry Merchant (21
percent). DN_ Merchant. Former fighters know more about the game,
but no one can provide the perspective Merchant does.
</P>
<P>
   Worst color commentator today: Readers _ Merchant (21.8
percent). DN _ George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Best ring announcer today: Readers _ Michael Buffer (63.5
percent). DN _ Jimmy Lennon Jr. He relies on a wonderful voice and
class rather than a gimmick, Buffer's ready-to-rumble signature
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Most enticing possible matchup: Readers _ De La Hoya-Trinidad
(41.2 percent). DN _ De La Hoya-Trinidad. Runners-up:
Mayweather-Mosley and Mayweather-Hamed (just to see Hamed lose).
</P>
<P>
   Most competitive division today: Readers _ welterweight (76.8
percent). DN _ welterweight. De La Hoya, Trinidad, Quartey, Page,
Whitaker, Lopez, Forrest. It's hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Fighter who should retire: Readers _ Roberto Duran (24.4
percent). DN _ Duran. Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the top pound-for-pound fighter in five years?
Readers _ Mosley (27.1 percent). DN _ Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Other poll results: Best venue today, Blue Horizon in
Philadelphia (34.2 percent); worst blow-by-blow commentator today,
Steve Albert and Jim Lampley (tie, 23.8 percent); worst ring
announcer today, Buffer (31.5 percent); best boxing television
today, HBO (72.6 percent); worst boxing television today, Showtime
(32.9 percent); are you in favor of women's boxing? yes (57
percent); is Butterbean good or bad for boxing? neither, 40.3
percent; are you favor of headgear for professionals? no (93.6
percent); should pros be allowed to fight in the Olympics? no (85.5
percent); are you in favor of the standing eight count? yes (67.8
percent); are you in favor of a federal boxing commission? yes
(77.3 percent); what rule changes would you most like to see?
return to 15-round title fights (21.9 percent). &QL;

<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates _ It was a hazy early morning in
this glitzy desert kingdom, and Simon Crisford and Saeed Bin Doroor
were staring silently at the last turn of their mile-and-an-eighth
training track.
</P>
<P>
   The object of their attention soon came into view, his pulsing
chest dark with sweat: Worldly Manner, the bay brown colt by
Riverman that they hope will make racing history as the first horse
representing the Arab East to win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Should Worldly Manner falter, they will have another runner in
the pack: Aljabr, by Storm Cat, a taut 3-year-old with even better
blood lines, who charged past next.
</P>
<P>
   Crisford, the English manager of the Dubai-based Godolphin
stables, and Bin Doroor, the Dubain trainer, said they saw what
they wanted to see: Nothing. No worrisome changes in gait, no
sudden signs of stress. The horses were ready.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the most audacious and unorthodox Derby bid ever.
The Godolphin horses have been prepared for Churchill Downs in the
strictest privacy, half a world away in the Persian Gulf, far from
the prying eyes of rivals, breeders, handicappers and racing
writers.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 a.m. Monday, Worldly Manner, Aljabr and 10 stablemates will
be led aboard a chartered plane here and flown directly to
Kentucky. After a mandatory 48 hours in quarantine, the two Derby
contenders will be seen for the first time this season just 10 days
before they run, defying the traditional route to the Derby that
includes months of punishing and revealing prep races and public
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this secretive assault on the grandest of American racing
titles is the man Crisford calls the Boss _ Gen. Sheik Mohammed bin
Rashid al-Maktoum, defense minister of the United Arab Emirates,
crown prince of Dubai and the single most powerful global force in
horse racing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every big race is a challenge, but the Kentucky Derby is a
special challenge,'' Mohammed said later in the day, his bare feet
propped on the passenger-side dashboard as his white Mercedes jeep
sped toward a lavish all-male wedding banquet for a falconer
friend. ``A year ago I decided that we should be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to win it in four years,'' he added. ``Four years. If
we fail this time, we'll try again. That's a promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing professionals have learned to take such promises
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed's investment in breeding and racing is measured in the
hundreds of millions of dollars. His Dubai-based horses routinely
compete in _ and often win _ most major races in Europe and Asia.
Godolphin, a five-year-old company owned jointly with his three
brothers, including the Dubai ruler, Sheik Maktoum al-Maktoum, has
by most accounts more competitive thoroughbreds than any other
racing consortium ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unusual thing they are trying,'' said D.Wayne Lukas,
the American trainer who has started 32 horses in the Derby and won
3 times. ``But you've got to respect them because of the
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin has never been a dominant presence in American racing,
and the Churchill Downs classic is one of the great remaining
prizes in the sheik's quest to turn this small Persian Gulf
city-state into an equine superpower. His one previous try at the
Derby came in 1992 when the highly regarded Arazi, a horse that
trained lightly in France, finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning scale of the Godolphin operation offers a glimpse
into the Maktoums' ambitions, and pocketbook. There are now more
than a hundred thoroughbreds at their Al Quoz Racing Stable here,
most said by industry experts to be worth a million dollars or
more. They are ridden daily on their full-scale private track by a
handsomely salaried staff of 40 current and former jockeys from
Ireland, England and the United States. Tending the horses and
their stalls are some 70 grooms recruited from Pakistan _ ``the
best,'' Crisford says.
</P>
<P>
   At a once-abandoned race track outside Paris, Godolphin
maintains a kind of farm team of 120 2-year-olds. In the fall, the
most promising 50 or so will be brought south to Dubai for winter
training, and some later go north to Newmarket, the hub of the
British racing universe, to compete in the coming season. Supplying
and benefiting from this racing conglomerate is well-stocked
Maktoum family network of British, Irish and American stud farms,
the ultimate source for their thoroughbred enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The professional talent at the top is also among the best money
can buy. Frankie Dettori, the Italian chief house jockey, has
amassed millions in lifetime earnings. The respected assistant
trainer, Tom Albertrani, a taciturn Bensonhurst native who came of
age professionally at Belmont Park, was an assistant trainer for
the legendary Cigar before joining Godolphin three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Crisford himself is one of the most driven and successful
managers in the sport. Given to Lombardi-like pronouncements about
the transcendent importance of victory _ ``failure is a word not in
the Godolphin vocabulary,'' he says _ Crisford is known for his
encyclopedic knowledge of the competition and a proven instinct for
knowing which horse to race when, and where.
</P>
<P>
   He is working with legitimate colts. Worldly Manner, for
instance, was one of the most successful 2-year-olds in America
last year before the sheik bought him from his American owners for
$5 million and brought him here.
</P>
<P>
   But from Muhammed's perspective, there is another powerful
argument for a Derby bid. The Maktoums preside over a mostly empty
expanse of seafront desert with diminishing oil reserves. The crown
prince is the driving force behind the transformation of Dubai from
an oil-rich backwater to a thriving commercial and industrial
center dependent more on trade and tourism than petroleum sales.
Getting Dubai on internationally televised sports broadcasts _ golf
and tennis, too _ is part of a public relations strategy. European
travelers are already beginning to discover Dubai's warm winter
beaches, crime-free streets, and gargantuan duty-free shopping
malls.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrolling the $4 million Dubai World Cup, the Maktoums have
put their desert kingdom on the global racing map. They are now
upping the ante, offering $15 million over three years for a new
annual ``World Series'' of nine thoroughbred competitions in eight
countries, from Ascot to Hallandale to Hong Kong, culminating in
the Dubai Cup in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transportation is getting much better, and the world is
getting much smaller,'' said Muhammed. ``I know some people in
America think it is strange, these horses coming out of nowhere,
running in our best race. They can't understand that we are
thinking globally.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sandy wastelands of Dubai's industrial outskirts can
seem a peculiar place to train Derby contenders. As the morning
heat builds and a gritty breeze blows off the low dunes surrounding
the private Godolphin track, the environs can seem better suited to
the camel races held weekly just down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the walls, however, the Godolphin compound is an oasis of
manicured green, the irrigated lawns separating impeccably
maintained walking tracks, tile-shaded paddocks, 10 airy screened
barns, and the blue streak of a 250-foot single-lane thoroughbred
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is a sober professional enterprise, without a whiff
of aristocratic gentility, and with little idle banter. Crisford
and Bin Soroor work in immaculate white T-shirts, clutching
ever-ringing mobile phones. The almost obsessive emphasis on
security, schedules and orderliness smacks of a military software
development lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to limit visitors, because everyone here has a job to
do,'' Crisford said, sitting in his trophy-stocked office, one eye
on a satellite feed of the live racing broadcasts seen in betting
shops across the British Isles. ``And I think people should respect
the fact that Muhammed wants to keep his business private.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where Maktoum horses have competed since the 1970s,
some track professionals derided the family decision five years ago
to move its horses to Dubai for the winter. They were convinced the
thoroughbreds would wilt in the desert sun.
</P>
<P>
   But the Godolphin operation silenced critics with a swift string
of victories in some of the sport's most prestigious races,
including the Irish Derby in 1994 and the English Derby in 1995. In
1996 and again in 1998, Godolphin's soaring earnings made Bin
Soroor the champion trainer in the United Kingdom, and secured
Mohammad's standing as the dominant owner in British racing.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in what they saw as their sweetest victory yet,
Godolphin's Almutawakel triumphed at home in the Dubai World Cup.
Judged a long shot by American oddsmakers, Almutawakel beat a
dream-team field of thoroughbreds lured to Dubai by the $4 million
purse, including Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   In its five years, Godolphin has picked up more than $22 million
in prize money. More to the point, though, Muhammed said, is the
story of Lammtarra, winner of the 1995 English Derby, who was bred
in Maktoum family stables and sold for $30 million after
consecutive victories in major European races. If either Godolphin
horse were to win the Derby, its value as a stallion would be
tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win, yes, but there is also a commercial logic to
everything we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While other horses headed for Churchill Downs were making their
very public way through prep races in Florida, Kentucky and
California, Worldly Manner and Aljabr were working out behind the
barbed-wire walls of the Al Quoz Racing Stable.
</P>
<P>
   Even the two trial races won by the two Derby contenders here
this month _ run counter-clockwise unlike American races _ were
private events, albeit on a royal scale. Top jockeys were flown in
from Britain and the United States. Every mount was Maktoum family
property. There were no cheering spectators in the stands, and no
outside media coverage. Even afterward, the videotape of the race
was not publicly shown, Crisford said, because the performance of
some novice horses ``might be misinterpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisford insists his goal is not to be secretive for its own
sake, but to minimize the stress on horses being readied for
world-class competition. The traditional pre-Derby prep circuit
``is a punishing campaign, and it can take a toll,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some racing professionals question the wisdom of this strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the knowledge, they have the surface, and they have
the expertise to prepare a horse for the Kentucky Derby,'' said
W.Elliott Walden, a sixth-generation horseman from Kentucky who
trains Menifee, one of the favorites for the Derby. ``But the
hurdles of transportation and how it affects the horses are what
they have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bloom came off the Godolphin rose last Saturday,
when Prado's Landing, another of their Derby prospects who came
over early, finished last in the Blue Grass Stakes in Lexington.
Crisford acknowledges that the race was something of an
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing,'' he said. ``I'm sure Prado's Landing
might have others thinking, who are these idiots? But we don't
think like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they think big _ always.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like climbing Mount Everest,'' Crisford said of the
Derby. ``We're not breezing in there, saying hey guys, look at us.
We know this is a grueling race. There is no margin for error. But
we think we have as good a chance to win as anyone.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Down a narrow back street, inside a safe
house somewhere in Macedonia, six men in their late 20s and early
30s are sitting on mattresses on the floor. They are dressed in
jeans and rough shirts, thin and fit. They are self-described
officers of the Kosovo Liberation Army, just out of Kosovo and on
their way to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Their commander, who goes by the name of Axhaika, 31, is wounded
and lies on the only bed. He has come to Macedonia for treatment.
``Just two or three days, and then I must go back to fight,'' he
said, making light of his wound. He refused to give details of when
and where he received treatment, fearing that this might enable the
Macedonian authorities, from whom he is hiding en route to Albania,
to track his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had traveled some 100 miles on foot in five days
through southern Kosovo to reach Macedonia, over rugged mountain
terrain that is mostly controlled by the separatist rebels. As
commander of a battalion in the Pashtrik region of central Kosovo
he is firmly optimistic, cracking jokes with his men, even while he
describes the situation in Kosovo as ``hell.''
</P>
<P>
   A builder by trade, he said he joined the rebels early, on June
20, 1991. The group was organized, he and the others suggested, in
the early 1990s mostly by Albanian men, also in their 20s or early
30s, who were frustrated by the nonviolent tactics adopted by
mainstream ethnic Albanian politicians and chose instead to fight
Serbia's revocation of Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Axhaika said he was made a commander in 1992. He said he had
served eight jail sentences for what he called ``political
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was in 1982 that he received his first jail sentence,
for three months, at the age of 14 for wearing an Albanian badge on
his jacket and refusing to remove it when ordered. He said he faced
another sentence of five years for terrorism after being tried in
absentia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Axhaika said he came from an educated family. One elder brother
is a pilot, Axhaika said, who in the 1980s flew both Yugoslav
commercial and military planes. Another is a pharmacist, and his
sister is an agronomist. He said he joined the rebels so that
Kosovo could be free of Yugoslav control. ``I want to be free, in
my land, in my house, in my home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian attacks on civilians, such as the shelling of refugee
convoys that he said he watched from the top of a hillside above
the Pagarusa valley in southwestern Kosovo, and the mass expulsion
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo have stiffened his resolve to
fight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must win,'' he said. ``We are in our own homes. We cannot
go to the United States or England. We are strangers there. Every
man should be in his own home.''
</P>
<P>
   Many American and European officials remain suspicious of the
leadership of the rebel army, which they characterize as
ideologically rigid, even Communist, with a questionable commitment
to democracy. Albanian officials have told the Clinton
administration that Iran was sending weapons to the Kosovo rebels,
and European officials as well as experts on international arms
have said some of the rebels' money comes from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Axhaika bridled at such charges. ``Of our whole brigade, that is
2,000 men, only two men are supporters of Enver Hoxha,'' he said,
referring to the former Albanian Communist dictator.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rebels wanted a ``democratic, Western state'' after
the war, with NATO troops present to enforce any peace agreement
made with Yugoslavia. He said he wanted to see President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia stand trial before the United Nations' war
crimes tribunal in The Hague. ``Milosevic must go to The Hague,''
he said. ``And he knows it. It is what he fears, it is why he is
holding out.''
</P>
<P>
   Axhaika's men, all ethnic Albanian villagers from his region,
say they agree. Five of them were officers in the rebel army. All
said their desire to fight had crystallized when they were in their
late teens or early 20s _ roughly around the time that Milosevic
stripped away Kosovo's broad autonomy and began an era of
oppressive rule with Serbian control maintained by a strong police
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 3 my parents told me who the Serbs were, and I
understood when I was 17,'' said one of them, who gave his name as
Kujtim, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Nejmeddin, 29, said the protests by ethnic Albanian students in
1981 _ who sought outright independence from Yugoslavia even when
Kosovo had broad autonomy _ had inspired his struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said: ``I did not have a chance to go to
university. I was an excellent student but my family was not
Serb.'' In 1990, ethnic Albanian professors, teachers, doctors and
other state personnel either lost or quit their jobs, setting up a
parallel education and health network, largely in private homes.
</P>
<P>
   None of the men said he wanted Kosovo to become part of Albania.
``It is not important,'' said another fighter, Kujtim. ``What is
important now is to free Kosovo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fears that an independent Kosovo would unite with Albania and
the ethnic Albanians of western Macedonia into a ``Greater
Albania'' are one reason that the outside world _ which fears
border shifts in the Balkans would set off a wider war _ has not,
until now anyway, supported independence for Kosovo. Milosevic's
media use the vision to stoke Serbian fears of the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Axhaika expressed support for Kosovo to become some kind of
internationally protected territory, saying that Kosovo's
Albanians, an estimated 1.8 million people, did not really have the
kind of experienced leaders or established institutions necessary
for immediate independence.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest concern is how to secure more ammunition for his
battalion. At one point, he said, he had only 10 rounds in his
rifle, and his men only 60 rounds each.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such shortages, he said, rebels are still moving freely
across sizable areas of Kosovo. They cross the main roads, which
are under nominal Serbian control, at night. ``They are scared of
the night'' and do not patrol then, Axhaika said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, he suggested, display similar reluctance to fight the
rebels head on, shelling villages rather than deploying infantry to
take on the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only fight with artillery, and they do not know how to
stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of civilians remained trapped deep inside the Pashtrik
region, he said. He said that in Guncar, his uncle's village,
southwest of Pristina, every house was bursting with refugees and
people were camping in gardens, courtyards and barns.

NETWORKS SET AN UNCIVIL COURSE WITH BLUE STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: This column discusses the use of coarse language
in television. It contains words that will be deemed offensive by
some readers.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much a part of the vernacular they become, the
words ``bitch'' and ``ass'' still strike my ear as coarse and
uncivil. Dog breeders and farmers might think differently, but I
don't like to use them in normal conversation, which probably makes
me unsuitable for employment on morning radio. And I don't like to
hear others use them, which probably makes me a prig.
</P>
<P>
   They're not likely to show up in this newspaper, either, unless
used in conjunction with something about animal husbandry or in a
quotation purposely inserted for dramatic effect and importance to
the subject at hand. Just getting them into this column required
the journalistic equivalent of papal dispensation, which begs the
obvious question: What's the big !$?% &LR; &AMP;! deal? They're perfectly
good words with perfectly good dictionary definitions.
</P>
<P>
   True enough. And if someone like Drew Carey had his way, they'd
be sprinkled liberally throughout the scripts of every television
show in the land. OK, maybe not ``7th Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey can't understand TV's long-held fear of dirty words. In
his book ``Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined,'' he
writes: ``I don't know about you, but if I ever heard the f-word on
free broadcast television, I just might lose my will to live. ...
Of course, I can hear it on cable and in real life, and even read
it in a book. But on regular TV? Anarchy!''
</P>
<P>
   He's got a point. To a point.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the government (in the case of broadcast TV and
radio) or a publisher (in the case of newspapers, magazines and the
Internet) get so exercised about blue language? Isn't censorship _
self-imposed or legislated _ a snooty attempt to foist unnatural,
and perhaps unwelcome, standards on the masses?
</P>
<P>
   Sure it is. Which is why newspapers have editors and TV networks
have standards-and-practices departments. It's part of their
traditions of trying to make us better people than we're inclined
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Is that elitism? Or just good sense?
</P>
<P>
   A little of both, I suppose. One dictionary definition describes
``anarchy'' as a ``utopian society of individuals who enjoy
complete freedom without government.'' Sounds nice, but the
coarseness and incivility sweeping into broadcast television
reminds me more of the anarchy Drew Carey sarcastically alludes to,
that is, a state of unprincipled disorder.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting that just because Andy Sipowicz gets to say
``asshole'' on ``NYPD Blue'' that we're all going to hell in a
paddy wagon. ``NYPD Blue'' has established itself as a gritty,
realistic depiction of police work in New York City. I have
absolutely no problem with the blue on ``Blue.'' It is situation
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But I have all kinds of problems with the language on shows that
seem to think coarseness is inherently funny, poignant or
appropriate to every circumstance. ``Bitch'' and ``ass'' are
suddenly all over ``The X-Files.'' I swear (not really) sitcoms use
the terms more often than ``the'' or ``and.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby once said that, on ``The Cosby Show,'' he would
demand a rewrite whenever a script showed up with the word ``butt''
in it. Today, ``butt'' is almost never used, but not because of
Cosby's vigilance. ``Butt'' has no shock value anymore and has been
relegated to the mothball fleet of archaic terms. ``Ass'' has the
preferred currency now, and the standards-and-practices people at
the networks, whose numbers are dwindling every year, allow a few
references to slip in so as not to appear too puritanical.
</P>
<P>
   For some TV-script writers, it has become a childish game to see
how many naughty words they can get away with. By my count, two of
comedian George Carlin's ``seven dirty words'' _ the words that he
said could not be uttered over the airwaves _ have now been used on
``mainstream'' TV. One is ``piss,'' the other is ``tits.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be long before some of the other five creep
in. Two of Carlin's forbidden words refer to the penis. A tamer
euphemism not on his list (the one that's a nickname for Richard)
is already de rigueur on ``NYPD Blue.'' Recently, it showed up on
an episode of ``Felicity.'' It's only a matter of time before the
sitcoms start using it.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Steve Allen recently told Entertainment Weekly
that he doesn't want his 7-year-old grandchild ``watching shows in
which people say, `She's got a nice ass.' It's a matter of taste
and decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen has lent his voice and celebrity to the Parents Television
Council, an advocacy group that would just as soon eliminate all
questionable language from our TV sets. Full-page newspaper ads, in
which Allen criticizes the networks, are badly produced and they
tend to make Allen come across as a crank. But I gotta go with
Steverino, at least as far as suggesting that TV needs to find some
balance.
</P>
<P>
   There are few prime-time shows on the networks today that I
would consider appropriate for a child under 12. ``Cosby,'' maybe.
And ``Kids Say the Darndest Things.'' Some of the others I would
dismiss because of violence and inappropriate sexual situations.
I'd even avoid the family values shows _ ``Touched by an Angel,''
etc. _ because they're so smarmy and poorly written. But most of my
avoidance would be tied to coarse language and behavior, and it
would continue as long as lazy networks pay lazy writers who find
incivility appealing.

<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ At the end of April, on the 27th anniversary of
her son's death on the battlefield at Dak To, a tired-looking woman
named Pham Kim Hy will kneel before a glass bottle filled with dirt
and pebbles, light sticks of incense and pray for his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam War ended in 1975, Mrs. Hy, who is now 70, has
devoted her life to a search for her son's remains, writing
letters, distributing his portrait, talking to his fellow soldiers,
studying maps and hiking into the jungle, over and over again, to
dig for his bones.
</P>
<P>
   She says she will know when she finds him because of the fine
shape of his jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I climb into every hole and feel around with my hands,'' she
said, describing her excavations. ``All I ever find is dirt and
pebbles, so I've begun to take a little bit from each place. I
thought, `This is the soil where my son fought and died. His blood
is on this soil.' So I keep it, if I may say, as the soul of my
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Ho Viet Dung, was 20 when he died. He is one of an
estimated 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers who are still missing in
action, and who will probably never be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Vietnamese government has set up a well-equipped,
well-run office to assist the United States in the search for about
1,500 American soldiers who are still missing, it has no organized
program to search for its own missing soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   So parents like Mrs. Hy are left to search on their own,
enlisting the help of military units and local officials and
organizing small expeditions into the mountains and jungles.
</P>
<P>
   A government-run search like the American one would simply be
too vast, too expensive and too unproductive in this poor and
backward nation, said Gen. Vu Xuan Vinh, a leading official of the
Veterans Association of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Even if bodies were found _ as they sometimes are _ there are no
dog tags or dental records or DNA tests available, as they are to
the Americans, to try to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   The North Vietnamese Army and the southern Communist Vietcong
lost nearly 1.5 million soldiers in the war. About 185,000 soldiers
died fighting for the South Vietnamese government in Saigon. About
58,000 Americans died.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Le Cao Dai, who ran a mobile field hospital during the war,
described the disappearance of fellow soldiers during heavy bombing
raids virtually before his eyes. Nothing but bits of clothing were
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the time has already passed to search for the missing,''
he said. ``In my opinion, it's a waste of money, a waste of time,
to keep looking for them. Best to just build a memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a memorial, though, would only honor the dead who fought
for the victors. Wartime animosities linger among the Vietnamese
and the soldiers who fought for South Vietnam are considered
traitors by the government in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hy said she pities the mothers of those soldiers, bereaved
women who cannot share with her the consolation of being honored as
the mother of a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Saigon's missing soldiers are posthumous exiles from their
country's history, uncelebrated and even uncounted: They are not
included in the estimate of 300,000 missing in action, Vinh said.
Heroes' cemeteries around Vietnam do not contain their bodies; a
major cemetery in the south that holds some of Saigon's war dead is
abandoned and overgrown with weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you expect us to help these people, who fought against
us hand to hand and then fled to other countries after the war?''
the general said with sudden bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, in terms of dignity, the positions of soldiers
from the north and the south are not comparable,'' he said. ``Those
from the north fought to liberate and unify the country. Those in
the south fought against the Vietnamese nation. Some were bad
soldiers who even carried out massacres. The past is the past. It
cannot be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed no such rancor toward the Americans who were
the allies of these southern soldiers and whose remains the
government is seeking as part of a diplomatic effort to gain access
to American markets. ``We'd like to have a brighter future and
forget the past,'' he said, offering the official government line.
</P>
<P>
   The search for missing Americans, with full Vietnamese
participation, remains in high gear, and the American ambassador,
Douglas Petersen, said in an interview that it continues to produce
``some pretty fantastic successes.''
</P>
<P>
   A full-time search command operates out of Hawaii, with a
detachment of six officers stationed in Hanoi and periodic search
operations that the ambassador said can deploy well over 100
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the U.S. government and some American veterans had
passed on information and material recovered from battlefields to
help the Vietnamese find their own missing. Vinh said this
information had helped locate the remains of 400 Vietnamese
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, himself a former Navy pilot who was shot down near
Hanoi, put the search for missing Americans at the top of his list
of priorities in U. S.-Vietnamese relations, above trade and
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``The commitment the United States has made to the MIA
recovery effort is not just for families suffering from loss of
closure but to acknowledge the commitment that the United States
government has given to each person wearing a uniform today that,
should there be a loss, they can rest assured that we are committed
to make a determination and return them to their families to the
best of our ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Vietnamese expressed weariness at this continued insistence
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy for the Americans to keep asking us to find their
men,'' Dai said. ``We lost several times more than the Americans
did. In any war there are many people who disappear. They just
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Khuyen, editor in chief of the English-language daily
Viet Nam News, said, ``The MIA issue is an overblown one on your
side. You are still looking for MIA's in Korea, even Normandy. And
now you want every case cleared up in Vietnam. It's nearly
impossible.''

</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hy said she knows this applies to missing Vietnamese
soldiers as well, and to her own long search.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the war ended,'' she said, ``everyone rushed to
look for their missing sons. We went to their army units, we went
to the areas where they served. Now people have become more
careful. They only go if they have some new information. Otherwise
they know it's probably useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, following information from her son's military
unit and from local villagers, Mrs. Hy said, she has visited 14
locations in the mountains at Dak To and has made 45 separate
excavations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went deep into the jungles, crossing streams and climbing
steep mountains,'' she said. ``Whenever I went, soldiers came with
me to help cut through the bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Failing to find her son's remains, she said, she lights incense
sticks deep in the jungle and prays to the four points of the
compass.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I consider that area to be his cemetery now,'' Mrs.
Hy said. ``It's a beautiful area, you know, Dak To. I sometimes
feel that it has become my home because I know that is where my son
is.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Seven years ago, Melvin Oliver had one of those
middle-of-the-night ``aha!'' inspirations that normally occur only
in researchers' fantasies and campy movies. Suddenly, he could
visualize how to grow generation after generation of plants and
then, whenever he desired, insure that the next generation would be
the last _ because all its seed would be sterile.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, a 48-year-old government scientist at the Department of
Agriculture's research station here whose main focus is drought
resistance, never dreamed he would change the course of the
increasingly bitter debate over biotechnology's role in the food
chain.
</P>
<P>
   That is what has happened, though, since a joint patent covering
his inspiration was issued just over a year ago to the federal
government and Delta and Pine Land Co., a cotton seed producer that
co-sponsored the research. They saw it as a potentially useful tool
for preventing farmers from growing valuable genetically engineered
crops without paying annually for the seed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, led by Hope Shand, director of research for the Rural
Advancement Foundation International, a farm advocacy organization
in Canada, saw it as a threat to farmers' security, especially in
developing nations, and immediately dubbed it ``Terminator'' after
the robotic killer of movie fame. The protests have ranged from
angry letters to torched research crops. The fact that Oliver and
his research team have yet to prove the concept works in field
crops has become an almost irrelevant footnote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seed sterility has become a surrogate for the entire debate on
biotech,'' said Philip S. Angell, a spokesman for Monsanto Co., the
pioneering agricultural biotech giant.
</P>
<P>
   Angell said that Monsanto, which has a pending agreement to buy
Delta, has become so alarmed by the anti-biotech feelings stirred
by the sterility technology that it wants a thorough, clearly
independent international review of the costs and benefits of the
technology and related inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto wants the review open to a wide range of public
interest groups and is preparing a pledge not to try to
commercialize any such technology until such a review is completed
and the company has responded to all the concerns raised, Angell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say seed sterility is a particular threat to farmers in
the developing world, where nearly all subsistence farmers are too
poor to buy new seed and thus dependent on saving seed or trading
with neighbors. Those unlucky enough to live near a farmer using
the new technology could have part of their crop sterilized by
drifting pollen and never know it until the next year's planting,
they add.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new technology is switched on by spraying with
chemicals just before the seed is planted, biotech critics also
warn that it is confirmation of their charges that multinational
chemical companies, which have been buying up seed companies, are
moving rapidly toward dominance over agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, farmers buy new seed for hybrid crops,
especially corn, each year because the next generation of such
plants does not resemble the parent. But for most self-pollinating
plants, including soy beans, rice, wheat and cotton, farmers can
save seeds to replant confident that the offspring will resemble
the parent. In the developed world, especially in the United
States, farmers often buy seed each year as well to take advantage
of the latest genetic improvements and to avoid the cost of
cleaning and storage.
</P>
<P>
   Seed companies say the higher profits they might gain from
engineering sterility would spur even more investment in improved
crops. Sterile seed could also reduce fears that new traits
engineered into crops, like the ability to tolerate herbicides,
might jump to weeds. In theory, the jumping traits would also carry
the genetic instructions to prevent the weeds from reproducing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are recognizing now though that there is something
psychologically offensive about sterile seed in every culture,''
Angell said.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech critics had not thought much about seed sterility until
Delta and the Agriculture Department announced their patent.
Delta's acquisition by Monsanto, a deal held up by a Justice
Department antitrust review, fueled their alarm because Monsanto,
the St. Louis agrichemicals and drugmaker, has been by far the most
successful company in genetically engineering new crops. The
critics were even more concerned when they discovered that a number
of large agribusinesses _ including Monsanto _ had already obtained
patents for sterility processes other than Oliver's.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, several months after the patent became public, critics
began to see that all the sterility work relied on a powerful new
wave of biotech research that had gone largely unnoticed: the use
of chemicals as switches to turn specific genes in plants on or off
at a particular time. The new engineering, they concluded, would
inevitably make farmers ever more reliant on chemical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the potential applications are more alluring for farmers
than seed sterility. Some researchers see gene controls as a way
farmers could raise the level of a nutrient in a growing crop _
say, a specific oil _ if that output becomes more valuable after
the crop has been planted.
</P>
<P>
   Others see the new technology being used to control exactly when
a plant generates defenses against insects or viruses. They
envision, for example, spraying an innocuous chemical that would
signal engineered genes to quickly activate a crop's normal
defenses at the first sign of fungal invasion, reducing reliance on
the harsh pesticides normally used to stop the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, instead of engineering plants to produce a toxin that
kills specific insects throughout the crop's growth cycle as the
already widely used genetically modified corn and cotton do, the
new technology could keep plants from making the toxin unless the
crop actually was threatened with serious damage. Less exposure
should make it much harder for insects to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the next big breakthrough after discovering how to
move genes into plants,'' said Roger N. Beachy, director of the
Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis. ``You're talking
about exquisite control of how plants respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Beachy and other biotech backers say the new wave of
biotechnology is vital to feeding the growing world population and
preserving the environment. It may actually reduce reliance on the
most dangerous agrichemicals. If farmers do not see it as
beneficial, they will not use it, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the problem is that market forces make it inevitable
that a handful of large businesses will use such breakthroughs in
ways that maximize their profits, leaving farmers totally dependent
on chemicals they manufacture. With more and more farmers planting
fewer varieties of high-performance crops, the risks increase that
disease or insect infestations could severely damage food
production and suddenly produce widespread crop failure, they
argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the technology itself, it's who will control it and
benefit from it that matters,'' said Ms. Shand, of the Rural
Advancement Foundation.

</P>
<P>
   The global protest campaign has already led to incidents in
which experimental plots of the kind of genetically engineered
crops Monsanto has sold widely in the United States were burned in
India under the mistaken belief they contained the new sterile seed
technology. A number of companies with patents that cover sterility
applications have rushed to say that they have no intention of
developing and marketing such crops.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Consultative Group for International
Agricultural Research, a Washington consortium of research and
international development bodies, voted to oppose any use of the
sterility technology in the developing world. The Department of
Agriculture attracted withering criticism and thousands of angry
letters for its role as a co-sponsor with Delta of the research led
by Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public won't pay for a USDA that is just a farm team for
industry,'' said Margaret Mellon, a biotechnology expert at the
Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials say the criticism has led it to revise its
review policy on research financing to allow more input from
biotechnology critics. But they are also anxious that leading-edge
biotechnology work not be left solely to the private sector, not
least because that makes it harder for policymakers to anticipate
where agriculture may be headed.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Geoffrey Hawtin, director general of the
International Plant Genetics Resources Institute in Rome, add that
work with the private sector may be necessary because
multinationals control crucial patents. Genetic engineering, they
say, may be the only hope for rapidly improving crops, like
bananas, that are vital to subsistence farmers and are being
ravaged by disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a technology that can be used safely,'' said Gary
Toenniessen, deputy director for agricultural sciences at the
Rockefeller Foundation. ``If the targets are right it could benefit
poor as well as rich farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy debate has raced ahead of the science. Oliver's team
is hoping results due this week from tissue samples taken from a
batch of tobacco plants will finally confirm that their theory
works in a real plant. Tobacco is widely used in research because
it is easy to manipulate genetically, but a success with it does
not guarantee that the same methods would work on important food
and fiber crops. Each crop could require its own specific cocktail
of genetic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, biotech critics and supporters alike are convinced that
``chemical gene switch'' projects will abound _ and some succeed _
even if Oliver's sterility project runs into a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   The novelty is not in the genetic engineering techniques _
Oliver, for instance, uses standard methods to get foreign genes
into plant tissue cultures and, eventually, to grow whole plants
from them. But chemical switch systems involve uniquely complicated
relationships among the genes being inserted.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's first building block is a gene and control system, or
promoter, that is capable of generating a toxin that cripples the
seed's germination apparatus but leaves the seed and the rest of
the plant normal in every other respect.
</P>
<P>
   As a safeguard, however, the gene cannot make this toxin until
an enzyme breaks down a DNA wall the research team puts between the
toxin code and the promoter. As a further safeguard, this enzyme
comes from a second foreign gene that Oliver has inserted. Finally,
there is a third inserted gene that serves as the on-off switch for
the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   The third gene makes proteins that block production of the
second gene's enzyme. But those so-called repressor proteins are
designed to have an affinity for a specific chemical, in this case
the antibiotic tetracycline. When Oliver _ or whoever produces the
seeds _ sprays them, the proteins bind to the tetracycline instead
of the enzyme production sites. When these seeds are planted,
unlike their unsprayed predecessors, the DNA-cutting enzymes are
made and the gene that makes the sterilizing toxins is primed to
kick in months later when the plant matures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an elegant solution,'' said David Culley, a
molecular biologist at Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver figures it could have been done much better _ and done
more quickly _ if he and his colleagues had the kind of budget and
access to crucial patents available to many corporate biotech
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Monsanto had done this, they would be in the field by
now,'' he said. Perhaps. But even though researchers have been
looking at a wide variety of chemical-gene switch combinations,
industry sources say no one is close to field tests on switches in
crops for anything other than internal breeding programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always something wrong,'' said Stephen Evola,
co-president of the biotech research arm of Novartis, the Swiss
agribusiness and pharmaceutical company, noting that the chemical
switch had to be safe and inexpensive and its interaction with the
plant very specific. Achieving reliable control is especially
challenging because the behavior of gene promoters, which control
the timing, level and location of gene activity, is far from being
fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the very beginning of a long learning curve,'' said
David Lawrence, a scientist at Zeneca Group PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Some chemicals that are extremely useful in the current research
phase, like steroids, are seen as obvious nonstarters for
commercial applications because they have strong impacts on
animals. Systems based on lactose solutions, which are already used
as switches for turning on genetic activity in bacteria, have also
been tested in plants. So have copper and ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are also exploring gene switches tailored to chemicals
farmers use anyway, like fertilizer. Other researchers are studying
nonchemical switches like light, moisture and viruses. They suspect
though that plants encounter such things so frequently and in so
many ways that it may be impossible to use them outside of a
carefully controlled laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, for his part, is fatalistic about where his contribution
will end up. His office is, with impish defiance, decorated by a
large poster of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the original Terminator. But
he repeatedly describes seed sterility as an underfinanced
diversion from his studies of drought-resistant moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident the science will pan out,'' he said. ``But
this technology will flourish or die for reasons I have no control
over.''

COMMENTARY: BUSH'S FOREIGN POLICY: SOFT ON CHINA, TOUGH ON RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In our last episode, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas reluctantly began to expound on his foreign-policy mindset.
To continue:
</P>
<P>
   On our involvement in Kosovo: ``NATO has to be confident in its
capacity to help preserve the peace in Europe. So I think it is in
America's strategic interest in this case, that once we are in the
position we got into, that Mr. Milosevic be taught a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   On refusing to use trade as a lever to influence China on human
rights or global behavior: ``I think it is to the advantage of U.S.
producers and to the country to have admitted China to the World
Trade Organization ... Unilateral sanctions often don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   (Some of us in what Bill Clinton derides as ``the anti-China
crowd'' think Bush may be Peking too soon.) But now to Russia:
</P>
<P>
   Should the International Monetary Fund lend more money to
Moscow? ``No.'' Why not? ``Because I don't think we ought to be
throwing good money after bad. Russia needs to convince lenders,
both private and public,'' says Bush, ``that money is secure within
Russia, that the rule of law matters, that corruption has been held
in check. I think we should have learned our lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Should we get tougher with Russia on its aid to Iran on nuclear
development? ``Yes. I think that we ought to be firmer about the
distribution of weaponry around the globe, whether they come from
China or Russia. This ought to be a high priority for a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of talk about moderation in Tehran, do you favor a
rapprochement with Iran? ``I am not prepared to talk about that. I
will at some point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   What about missile defense? ``I think that we ought to move
aggressively forward with the development of the capacity to deploy
an intermediate- and long-range anti-ballistic-missile system. You
bet.''
</P>
<P>
   And with China positioning missile batteries across the Taiwan
Strait, would you make a missile defense available to our ally?
``Well, I have not made up my mind yet. I think it is hard to make
it available to Taiwan until it is available to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   How would you handle the Russian claim that our 1972 ABM treaty
precludes a missile defense? ``I think we need to move aggressively
forward, and if that means eventually renegotiating the treaty with
the Russians, we ought to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But when they don't want to renegotiate it? ``I know they don't.
We ought to give them first the opportunity to renegotiate and if
they don't, then move forward with abrogation.'' (Score one for
hawkish adviser Richard Perle.)
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, do you think President Clinton is doing enough to stop
Saddam Hussein from developing weapons of mass destruction? ``My
gut tells me no, but I do not have enough facts to be able to back
that up with a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   On North Korea, would you continue to supply Pyongyang with oil,
food and nuclear power plants while it refuses inspection? ``Now we
are going to inspect them after we have given them six months'
warning. I am worried about that. So should our friends in the Far
East be worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign-policy split in the GOP? ``There are some very
powerful constituencies in both parties that advocate isolationism
and protectionism. It may surface to the point it becomes a
wildfire or it may not. I believe that rhetoric and policies that
would isolate us would be a mistake for our country ... America is
too great to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why hasn't he been speaking out on foreign affairs at such
a crucial moment? ``I am thinking about it, but if and when I
criticize this administration, I intend to do so when people are
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But many already are. Nettled by the suggestion in that last
question that he is manipulatively sitting on his lead, he leaned
forward and volunteered:

   Top Executives at Compaq Quit Amid Financial Turmoil
</P>
<P>
   In a fallout from its recent financial turmoil, Compaq Computer
said that its chief executive, Eckhard Pfeiffer, and its chief
financial officer, Earl L. Mason, had resigned. The company's
chairman and two vice chairmen were named to an office of the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said earlier this month that its first-quarter profits
would be less than half of what analysts had expected, dragged down
by declining sales and a shift into lower-margin products.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia Talks Are Approved
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Germany gave their approval for Telecom Italia to
continue merger discussions with Deutsche Telekom. The decision is
expected to complicate the struggle for control of Telecom Italia,
which faces a $65 billion hostile bid from its major Italian rival,
Olivetti.

<P>
   Exploring Anonymity on the Web
</P>
<P>
   At a conference last week to mark the 35th anniversary of the
founding of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, participants took part in a
spirited discussion on a seemingly narrow subject, an anonymous
remailer, which can be used to mask the origin of a piece of e-mail
or the computer from which a person is browsing the Web. But it was
a discussion that focused on some of the broadest social and legal
issues involving the Internet: free speech, identity, privacy and
anonymity, good-naturedly underscored by one panel member who wore
a black ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   Holding Money at Online Auctions
</P>
<P>
   As auction sites on the World Wide Web have soared in
popularity, Internet escrow services have also gained a following.
These services, in which a third party holds the money until both
buyer and seller are satisfied with the transaction, can reduce the
risk of fraud, bounced checks or goods that fall short of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates Set for Registry Work
</P>
<P>
   The first five companies to compete with Network Solutions in
the business of registering Internet addresses will be selected
this week, even though the government has not yet made final the
terms under which the company will open its data base.
</P>
<P>
   Barriers Erode for TV News Shows
</P>
<P>
   The hierarchies and fiefs of television news are breaking down a
bit, driven by the networks' needs to cut costs and by new
management philosophies that see a need for broadcast news reports
to distinguish themselves from the reporting found on 24-hour cable
news networks, radio and the Internet. Increasingly, correspondents
are contributing reports to several programs, not just the one to
which they are assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Capital One Picks Outside Agency
</P>
<P>
   Capital One Financial, which is helping to rewrite the rules of
consumer marketing with intensive data mining _ using information
to sell in unconventional ways _ is hiring its first outside
agency. The company, one of the nation's largest issuers of credit
cards, will work with D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications.

   Intel Chief Predicts Papers' Demise
</P>
<P>
   Andrew S. Grove, the chairman of Intel, told members of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors that the newspaper business
had three years to live. ``You are where Intel was three years
before the roof fell in on us,'' said Grove, referring to his
company's near-death experience in the late 1980s, when its
original product, memory chips, became unprofitable. His suggested
solution was to write and edit newspapers that play to the medium's
competitive advantage, its ability to bring perspective to the
tumbling cascade of news events.

POLITICS DELAYING EXPANSION OF REFUGEE CAMPS IN MACEDONIA,
OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ The majority of refugee camps in Macedonia
are filled to capacity, and delays in getting approval for camp
expansions are resulting in severe overcrowding, aid workers said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies not in a lack of supplies or personnel, but in
getting approval from the Macedonian government to expand the
camps, the aid workers and Western diplomats said. They said they
saw the delays as a means of using refugees as political tool.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia is widely seen here
as using the more than 125,000 refugees his forces have expelled
into Macedonia to destabilize this country and punish his political
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And Macedonia, aid workers contend, is using the situation to
press Western countries and aid agencies to keep their promise of
airlifting the majority of refugees out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian officials have vehemently denied that they are
mistreating or manipulating the refugees. In an interview last
week, Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said his government had
welcomed the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But aid workers say the government, while publicly professing
cooperation, is slow to show results. Western diplomats, who are
less critical of the government, say Georgievski is under intense
pressure to keep the refugee influx under control. Ethnic
Macedonians, who make up two-thirds of this country's population
and are Georgievski's political base, fear that if the influx of
refugees continues, ethnic Albanians could become the majority
here.
</P>
<P>
   A long planned expansion of the labyrinthine refugee camp here
in Brazda was delayed on Saturday after a group of local farmers
tore down two hundred refugee tents erected just outside the camp.
The protesting farmers, who said they owned the land, complained
that they were not informed of the expansion and that they oppose
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want compensation, we want our land,'' said one
farmer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Let them go to
Albania or Kosovo or wherever they want.'
</P>
<P>
   The resulting overcrowding raises tensions and could cause
health problems among the refugees. Fadil Berisha, a 36-year-old
farmer, said Sunday he has spent the last three nights sleeping
outside because there were no tents left when he and his family
arrived. After spending a night outside in the rain, his wife and
four children, including his five month old daughter, were taken
into a tent by another family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 20 people staying in that tent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Sedad Hoxha and his family live in a 10-foot-by-10-foot
tent that holds 16 adults and five children. He said camp officials
did nothing to help him after he arrived three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day we arrived we slept, when we could, in the open in the
rain,'' he said. ``We made an agreement with some people and were
able to move in here''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Young, a coordinator for Catholic Relief Services, the aid
agency running the camp, said aid workers were trying to find space
for new arrivals in empty tents.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian police held 700 refugees in a no man's land between
Kosovo and Macedonia for 24 hours, ending Sunday, without food,
water or medical care, aid workers said. One woman collapsed and
was taken away in an ambulance after the group was finally allowed
to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Macedonians said there was no space for them in the
camps,'' said one frustrated aid worker. ``But the reasons there is
no place to put them, is that we can't get the authorization from
them to expand the camps.''

AD COLUMN: CAPITAL ONE PICKS ITS FIRST OUTSIDE AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Conn., Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A financial-services giant that is helping to rewrite the rules
of consumer marketing with intensive data mining _ using
information to sell in unconventional ways _ is hiring its first
outside agency.
</P>
<P>
   The company is Capital One Financial Corp. in Falls Church, Va.,
one of the nation's 10-largest issuers of credit cards, with 16.7
million customers and total balances of $17.4 billion. The agency
is D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications in New York, a unit
of MacManus Group best known for campaigns for longtime clients
like General Motors, M&AMP;M/Mars and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Capital One, which has expanded into sales of services as
disparate as cellular telecommunications, insurance and membership
in buying clubs, is hiring DMB&AMP; B and MacManus sibling shops in the
United States, Britain and France to handle so-called integrated
communications assignments: work that will include conventional
advertising, media planning and buying, interactive marketing,
sales promotion and direct marketing. Capital One estimates that
spending could total $80 million to $100 million over the next
12-18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of DMB&AMP; B by Capital One, which began in 1994 as a
spinoff of operations of Signet Banking Corp., reflects the
continuing search by large marketers for large agencies that offer
lengthy lists of services in many countries. The marketers are
seeking shops that can develop ideas to infuse all aspects of the
communications between brands and their potential and current
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to put your company in the position of never having
to guess about the marketplace,'' said William J. McDonald, the
senior vice president for brand marketing at Capital One, who
recently joined the company after stints with consumer marketers
like Boston Chicken Inc. and Pepsico Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing `trusted brand status' is a long journey,'' he
added, ``that requires great creative strategy from a global
partner to get you there.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital One has generated its rapid revenue and profit growth by
assiduously cultivating consumers, using what McDonald described as
an ``information-based strategy'' to analyze demographic and
behavioral data bases on tens of millions of potential and current
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of companies claim that they compete on knowledge,'' the
magazine Fast Company wrote in a glowing article about Capital One
in its May issue. ``Capital One has enough information on consumers
to fill the hard drives of more than 200,000 personal computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the products Capital One sells through its sophisticated
information technology are so-called affinity credit cards, bearing
logos of animals, automobiles or countries; cellular calls, under
the name America One Communications; merchandise catalogs; credit
reports; insurance, and automotive loans.
</P>
<P>
   One unconventional way the company peddles its wares turns the
practice of telemarketing inside out: Rather than have employees
call consumers at home, employees try selling goods and services to
customers who call Capital One when they have questions about their
accounts or credit limits.
</P>
<P>
   Capital One's top executives ``see themselves as
`infomediaries,' '' said John Farrell, president of DMB&AMP; B North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scale of what they do is fantastic,'' he added. ``We have
to connect with consumers in as innovative a way as they operate as
a business, bringing together all our resources and presenting them
as seamless.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the agencies Capital One will use are the London, New
York, Paris and St. Louis offices of DMB&AMP; B, for advertising;
Televest in New York, media; Blue Marble in New York, interactive;
Clarion Marketing and Communications in Greenwich, Conn., sales
promotion and direct marketing, and Highway One in San Francisco,
affinity marketing. Capital One will continue working with a unit
of Omnicom Group, Interbrand in New York, for corporate identity
and design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agencies have always been known for adding value by looking at
clients' businesses from a customer perspective,'' said Susan
Gianinno, executive vice president and chief branding and marketing
officer at DMB&AMP; B. ``Now you have a company that's so data-rich,
whose core competency is knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital One began searching for an agency in December. Morgan
Anderson Consulting in New York managed the review, McDonald said,
and ``helped us steer through a minefield of competitive
conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most big agencies have accounts in categories like credit cards,
telecommunications or insurance. Capital One's activity in those
fields and others was a complication.
</P>
<P>
   DMB&AMP; B, however, did not have conflicts; its last
telecommunications client, for instance, was SBC Communications,
which consolidated accounts at other agencies in July by
eliminating DMB&AMP; B in St. Louis from its roster.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald declined to identify the other agencies taking part in
the review. DMB&AMP; B ``was the best solution,'' he said, ``not just
because of conflict but because of the breadth of resources.'' He
also praised DMB&AMP; B campaigns for P&AMP; G and a new client, Ernst &AMP;
Young.
</P>
<P>
   And surely it could not have hurt that McDonald had worked
before with Ms. Gianinno, when he was at the KFC unit of Pepsico
and she was at Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising and when he was at
Boston Chicken and she was at the J. Walter Thompson unit of WPP
Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's following me,'' Ms. Gianinno said, laughing.

GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ If you're interviewing the state's
best speller, you might as well ask him to perform for you. Some
might think the request a bit rude, putting him on the spot like
that. But to his credit, Abdul Kahsai showed none of the reluctance
of a doctor at a cocktail party who balks at listening to someone
drone on about an ingrown toenail. The 12-year-old seventh grader
at Taylor Junior High School, in Mesa, jumped right in and clicked
off pestiferous and diagensesis without a hitch. By BILL
GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
JEROMEHOTEL (Jerome, AZ) Like a fortress atop Cleopatra Hill, this
relic mining-company hospital sat empty for 45 years before it was
brought back to life in 1996 as the Jerome Grand Hotel. But the
hotel's owners pulled the plug in January and the 1926 landmark is
back on life support, awaiting an April 30 auction that could lure
a new owner and another revival. Potential buyers will have to
consider the viability of the hotel, which was in business just 18
months. By Peter Corbett. Story will move in the A category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MAKINGLAWS (undated) Second installment in a series. The jokes have
been making the rounds all morning in the state House of
Representatives. They involve Rep. Kathleen Dunbar, R-Tucson, who
moderate legislators believe agreed to cave in to conservative
leaders on a crucial vote on the state budget. Dunbar, an animal
rights activist, has been pushing her own legislation against
animal cruelty and domestic violence. Rep. Susan Gerard, leader of
the moderate ``Mushroom Coalition,'' repeats one of the jokes to a
group of fellow legislators: ``Did you hear that leadership is
threatening Dunbar? They say they've gone to the animal shelters
and they'll be killing one animal every hour until she gives in.''

WORKWEEK (undated) Let's proclaim today
Try-to-Get-Some-Real-Work-Done Day. First of all, it needs to be
adopted, proclaimed or otherwise sponsored to fit in with the rest
of the week. From bringing daughters to work to honoring
secretaries, almost every day this week has been monikered for some
cause. And Thursday has two. Tuesday is Telework Greater Phoenix
Day, which means we all should be home wearing bathrobes as we type
and handle the phones. Razor stubble is mandatory for men. Makeup
is banned for women. By JONATHAN SIDENER. Story will move in the A
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOKS (Gila River Indian Community) One January day, journalist
Claude Jackson was in the Gila River Indian Community's only public
library and decided to look for his favorite author. A 26-year-old
Pima Indian, reporter for the Gila River Indian Newspaper and
English literature graduate from Arizona State University, Jackson
likes to read a few passages in his spare time from the Bard of
Avon. To his dismay, the Sacaton library's only William Shakespeare
offering was a copy of King Lear. Shakespeare isn't the only thing
the Ira Hayes Memorial Library is missing. It's missing most of the
1990s. That's about to change. By BETTY BEARD. Story will move in

 &QL; 
REMAINS (WINDOW ROCK) For almost 50 years in the late 1800s and
early 1900s, museums from across the country paid archaeologists to
excavate Southwestern Indian burial sites, collecting tens of
thousands of human remains and a huge assortment of pottery, crafts
and sacred items buried with the bodies. But while most tribes in
recent years have been working with museums to get these items
returned to their homelands, officials for the Navajo Nation have
been taking a very cautious position. They're saying that _ at
least for now _ they would just as soon allow these items to remain
in the museums. By BILL DONOVAN. Story will move in the A
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COYOTES (PHOENIX) When Daryl Abbott got the call that a coyote was
lying near death in the shade of a paloverde, he was almost sure
what had happened. Arriving on the scene near the border of
Carefree and Cave Creek, he watched the coyote's svelte body move
slightly with each shallow breath before scooping her up. Clinging
to life, her listless body hung from Abbott's arms as he took her
to an emergency animal clinic. With veins pulsing with poison, the
coyote died just moments later. The death was one of about
seven &UR; the rehabilitation center has responded to this year in the
far north Valley to be blamed on Warfarin, a powerful rodenticide
passed to animals that consume poisoned rodents like mice and rats.
Pet also are in danger. By BRIAN ANDERSON. Story will move in the A

IN NEW YORK SURVIVAL IS STILL HINDERED BY SLOW EMS RESPONSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ohio)   By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years after the Fire Department took over New
York City's Emergency Medical Service, fire officials have begun to
make good on some of the bold promises made during their aggressive
campaign to seize control of the beleaguered public ambulance
system.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no hard evidence to show that more New Yorkers who
suffer cardiac arrest _ the most dire and the most easily measured
medical emergency _ are being saved.
</P>
<P>
   When lobbying in 1995 to take the Emergency Medical Service from
the city's Health and Hospitals Corp., fire officials had said they
would apply their management know-how and expertise in maintaining
vehicles to make the emergency service better, faster and more
efficient. They suggested that many more lives would be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Once they took control in March 1996, fire officials bought new
ambulances, moved dozens of paramedics and emergency medical
technicians out of administrative jobs and back into ambulances,
and trained thousands of firefighters to respond to medical
emergencies. The result: the average response time for
life-threatening situations has been cut by more than two minutes,
from eight minutes 58 seconds in 1996 to six minutes 43 seconds
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is uncertain whether this swifter response has produced
clear-cut medical benefits. By one measure, it has not. In 1996,
13.4 percent of people whose hearts stopped beating reached an
emergency room alive, EMS officials said. In 1997, the rate was
13.6 percent and last year it was 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fire and EMS officials contend, though, that earlier responses
to life-threatening emergencies may be helping cardiac patients.
They noted that the annual number of cardiac arrests in New York
has declined, to 6,030 in 1998 from 6,969 in 1996. They theorize
that emergency crews now arrive so quickly that they prevent some
patients from ever going into cardiac arrest, when the heart stops
beating properly, usually due to an abnormal rhythm, which can be
caused by a heart attack or underlying heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering their theory, EMS officials said, is a sharp increase
in the number of respiratory arrests they treat each year; by
arriving quickly, emergency crews may be preventing some
respiratory arrests from developing into more serious cardiac
arrests, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're doing very, very well and we're going to
continue to improve,'' Thomas Von Essen, the fire commissioner,
told a City Council committee last month.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent medical experts said, though, that more must be
done to produce a significant increase in the number of New Yorkers
who survive cardiac arrest _ and that some important factors may be
beyond the control of city government.
</P>
<P>
   Response times might have to be pushed much lower before medical
benefits become obvious, many doctors said. People who go into
cardiac arrest must receive medical care within four to six minutes
to have a good chance of surviving, emergency physicians said. That
usually involves cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and, most
importantly, an electric shock from a machine called a
defibrillator to jolt the heart back into a normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alexander E. Kuehl, who was medical director of EMS in the
1980s and is a proponent of the Fire Department's takeover, said
that average response times would have to go below five minutes for
many cardiac patients to be resuscitated successfully. ``By the
time you get out to six minutes, you're not saving any lives,''
said Kuehl, who is now director of emergency care at the Champlain
Valley Physicians and Hospital Medical Center in Plattsburgh, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last few years have defibrillators become portable
and easy to use, and their use has become the key element to
survival. ``If somebody is standing by with a defibrillator when
someone goes into cardiac arrest and the patient is instantly
defibrillated, you can have a survival rate of as much as 70
percent,'' said Dr. Lynne D. Richardson, vice chair of emergency
medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. ``But it drops off
quickly. Once you get over five minutes, it is in single digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Many factors can prevent emergency workers from reaching
life-and-death emergencies quickly enough to apply defibrillation
in time. New York's persistent traffic and its high-rise buildings
add critical minutes to the race to reach people in cardiac arrest.
It is not surprising, medical researchers say, that medium-size
cities and suburban areas produce the best emergency response
times.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs of Seattle, a region noted for advanced emergency
care, firefighters and ambulances get to life-threatening
emergencies within four to six minutes, on average, said Thomas R.
Hearne, director of the King County Emergency Medical Services
Division. A decade ago, the average response time in Columbus,
Ohio, was three minutes, according to a study in the medical
journal, Annals of Emergency Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle and King County, a vast suburb of 1.7 million people,
about one-third of the population has been trained in
cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, Hearne said. Through CPR,
bystanders can buy precious time for cardiac patients by
artificially propelling blood to vital organs until a normal heart
rhythm is restored by a defibrillator.
</P>
<P>
   Survival rates from cardiac arrest vary widely, with different
standards and competing claims. Even so, survival rates in King
County are impressive: More than 30 percent of patients in cardiac
arrest are resuscitated and ultimately go home from the hospital,
Hearne said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a 1994 study by three emergency doctors from
hospitals in the Bronx found the rate in New York is only 1.4
percent. The doctors used the same rigorous standard now used by
most medical researchers: A survivor is defined as someone who,
after undergoing cardiac arrest, eventually is discharged, healthy,
from a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that may be inhibiting survival rates in New
York, according to many paramedics, is that they are still not
getting to cardiac arrests quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   In taking over EMS, fire officials promised, in writing, to
achieve a number of statistical goals. Among them was that
paramedics _ the most highly trained emergency workers _ would
arrive at life-threatening emergencies within eight to 10 minutes
90 percent of the time. Last year, they reached such scenes within
10 minutes only 45 percent of the time, according to the Mayor's
Management Report.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters or emergency medical technicians can reach a
cardiac patient quickly and use a defibrillator, but that only
stabilizes a patient temporarily, many paramedics said. Because
paramedics can administer medicines that stabilize the heart more
permanently, they must also arrive promptly, paramedics said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Essen, the fire commissioner, conceded at a City Council
hearing last month that many of the goals set by the Fire
Department for EMS three years ago had not yet been achieved. ``We
won't make it in three years,'' he said, `` but we hope to get
there in four years.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems has been high turnover among paramedics, many
of whom have left EMS for higher paying jobs with private
hospitals. ``We want to continue to work on that,'' said Von Essen,
who was not yet commissioner when the department lobbied to get EMS
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, fire officials brimmed with confidence that they
could remake the EMS, which had long languished as an arm of the
Health and Hospitals Corporation. In the late 1980s, the agency was
short of ambulances and unable to repair the ones it had quickly
enough. Average response times to life-threatening emergencies
climbed to more than 11 minutes in 1987, which virtually guaranteed
that anyone suffering cardiac arrest would not survive.
</P>
<P>
   Things improved during the first half of the 1990s, with average
response times hovering between eight and nine minutes for the most
serious emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In convincing the City Council to approve the takeover, fire
officials said they would reconfigure the agency, in part by
building as many as 60 ambulance battalion stations around the
city. That plan, and others, have been either scaled back or
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials promised the Council that ambulances or
fire-engine companies would reach patients in life-threatening
situations within six minutes 90 percent of the time. They have
come close.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance crews with emergency medical technicians _ who operate
basic life support units but who cannot administer most medicines _
reached patients in life-threatening situations within six minutes
59 percent of the time last year, according to the mayor's
Management Report. When trained firefighters were included,
emergency crews reached critical cases within six minutes 80
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not met the goals that we reached together in our
memorandum of understanding,'' said Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler,
a Queens Democrat who is chairman of the Public Safety Committee.
``Response time has improved significantly, and that's important
and that's good. But in terms of achieving the other goals _ to
provide basic life support 90 percent of the time under six minutes
and advanced life support 90 percent of the time under 10 minutes _
that they have not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Leffler said he was disappointed that neither EMS nor
independent researchers had rigorously studied whether the Fire
Department's management had caused more lives to be saved. ``That
was their main selling point when they sought to get the merger
through, that there would be a major reduction in the number of
people who died,'' he said.

PATENTS: NEW THRILLS FROM NEW ZEALAND WITH THE `FLY BY WIRE';
INSURANCE FOR TRADE SECRETS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Texas., Calif.)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strung across a valley in Queenstown, New Zealand, is an
amusement park ride that makes bungee-jumping look tame. It
combines bungee features with elements of trapeze and aircraft
flight, allowing thrill-seekers to swing through the air at the end
of a tethered cable at speeds up to 120 miles an hour, piloting a
one-man craft shaped like a B-movie rocket ship in any direction
they want.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Harrap invented and built the ride he calls Fly by Wire.
Now he has won a U.S. patent for his daring toy and is scouting
locations in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Stringing it across the Las Vegas Strip, he says, would be a
good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Harrap, a property developer in Wellington, New Zealand, got the
idea for his ride in the middle of the night a few years ago. ``I
woke up at four in the morning with the idea for a swing that would
move in figure-eights,'' he said while in New York last week. ``It
was a swing that could change directions in the air, and out of
that came the seed of an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   That seed grew into a design for a narrow, missile-shaped plane
with a cutout for a pilot and powered by a 60-horsepower aircraft
engine. A single pilot, lying on his stomach, is strapped into the
craft with a five-point harness and ankle clips. His arms extended
in front of him, and he controls steering and acceleration with his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In New Zealand, the aircraft is suspended above ground from a
cable tethered to a line strung across a canyon. In the United
States, Harrap plans to anchor that line from towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1,400 feet across and 340 feet from the ground,'' he
said. ``A single wire, three-eighths of an inch in diameter, comes
down from that, and it carries the weight of the plane and pilot
and takes care of the additional G-forces generated, because it can
pull up to three times gravity during the middle of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sufficient strength in the steel cable to accommodate
that,'' he continued. ``We're running the cable at 10 percent of
its load capacity. There's no single load path so there's no single
path to break and be catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   The craft has a conventional-shaped tail for stabilization, a
five-bladed rear-mounted propeller inside a circular drum that
looks like a giant fan, and a four-stroke aircraft engine. At the
beginning of the ride, a winch lifts the plane seven or eight feet
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pulls the plane backward the same way you'd pull a child
back on a swing, up to the desired height for launch,'' Harrap
said. ``At any point on the way up, the pilot can release. He can
get a little way up and think it's scary and release from there,
giving it as much acceleration as he wants. The steering is
controlled with both hands, pretty much the way you steer a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   The winch can lift a the craft clear of its launch deck and a
cautious pilot can simply ``give it a bit of gas and fly in a
circle, backward, forward or wherever he wants to go,'' Harrap
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Away he goes, all downhill and up the other side,'' said
Harrap, who has ridden his own ride. ``Lots of people go slowly at
the start, but within a minute or two they're flying as fast as
they can as they gain confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilots can then swish through the air in figure-eights, loops,
arcs or wild swings. Harrap is careful to point out that his ride
``doesn't fly; it's a powered swinging device.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the design, the worst that can happen if you don't
pilot it well is it will go slow,'' Harrap said. ``We believe it is
completely idiot-proof. No matter what you do, you can't hit
yourself, anyone else or any object. It's not powerful enough to go
up and strike the support cables.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrap says none of his passengers in New Zealand have ``gotten
sick, taken a fit, or passed out'' on the six-minute ride, which
costs about $70.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the United States to scout locations in Las Vegas,
Texas and California and to talk to tower construction companies.
``The first in the U.S. will be in year-round locations,'' he said.
He has a Web site at www.flybywire.co.nz featuring a short snippet
of video of the New Zealand ride. He also holds patent 5,782,699.

<P>
   Insurance For Trade Secrets
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the growing value of intellectual property as a
business asset, the CNA Financial Corp. of Chicago has announced
that it is offering what it says is the first insurance policy to
cover financial losses from the theft of trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secrets must be owned by the company and be in a recorded
form, either formulas, patterns, compilations, programs, devices,
methods, techniques or processes,'' CNA said. ``The policy includes
coverage for ideas designed for commercial use, which have economic
value because they are not being generally known.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan could pay benefits up to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

NO KISSES FOR THIS CLUELESS FROG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I'd call Reggie White a fat toad, except knowing
the way he looks at things he'd probably take that to mean I want
to kiss him so I can find my prince and live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, it must be nice to live in White's fairy-tale
world, where no stereotype is too gauche to mention and men of the
cloth don't have to be broad-minded as long as they're
broad-shouldered.
</P>
<P>
   White, an ordained minister who recently retired from the NFL,
ought to know he isn't the only one who talks to heaven. I rang God
just the other day and, boy, was She mad!
</P>
<P>
   I can't say I was surprised. I was feeling a little out of sorts
myself after I saw what White had to say about female
sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   My initial reaction was that White must be talking about women
in another profession. My husband has no misgivings about me
entering the war zone known as the men's locker room, so why should
White?
</P>
<P>
   Before reading published excerpts from White's book, ``Fighting
the Good Fight,'' I had no idea anybody was ``forcing male athletes
to walk around naked in front of women who aren't their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   I've seen plenty of towels and bathrobes in locker rooms before,
but never anybody holding a gun to the head of an athlete as he
walked, dripping wet, from the showers to his dressing cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   White sees no reason why any athlete, male or female, should be
put in such a compromising position. On this White and I are of one
mind. That's why I have no problem standing outside a closed locker
room immediately after a college or pro game for a mandatory
cooling-off period that can last 20 minutes or more.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough time for the athletes inside to shower and
dress, well, that's what the towels and bathrobes are for.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'd notice either way. When White says ``I've seen a
lot of female reporters and camerawomen ogling guys in the locker
room,'' I have no earthly idea who he is talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Methinks he flatters himself. Because all the female
sportswriters I know would sooner pose in a bikini next to a
``Sports Illustrated'' swimsuit model than step inside a men's
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Not since junior-high dances have I been exposed (pardon the
pun) to anything so excruciatingly awkward. When female sports
journalists aren't talking to athletes, you'll find most of us
staring intently at some water spot on the ceiling or studying the
nameplates above the individual locker stalls.
</P>
<P>
   The bare truth is, the locker room is no place for journalists
of any gender. But until somebody comes up with a more practical
way for us to conduct interviews under tight time constraints,
it'll have to do.
</P>
<P>
   When White maligned Asians and Hispanics and Caucasians and
Native Americans under the guise of praising them last year, people
were swift to react in the sports sections and on the Op-Ed pages.
Strangely, his latest incendiary remarks have drawn a big yawn from
almost everyone save the surfer on the Internet who offered his
support of White and said, ``The next thing you know women
reporters will be allowed in men's bathrooms, too.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess the guy never has seen ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested to me that if White is being roundly ignored,
it's only because that's how villages treat their idiots.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to believe that. I'd like to think silence, in this
case, isn't a nod of approval. But how do I explain the strains of
intolerance that play over and over on my office voice mail? The
lyrics go like this:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)``You should stick to female basketball, female
badminton. Why don't you go away from real sports that men
play?''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   And this:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)``You should stick to knitting. That's where you
belong. I think you can get a job on the Home Shopping
Network.''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   And this: (begin ital)``What the &AMP; do you know about sports,
$$?(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   As for White and all the anonymous men in his chorus, I can't
speak for their anatomies. But I can say they have awfully small
minds. &QL;

 &HT;    Compaq chief executive resigns
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In its second industry-shaking announcement in less
than two weeks, Compaq Computer Corp. said Sunday that Chief
Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer and the company's chief financial
officer resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, the world's biggest personal computer maker and the No.
2 company behind IBM in overall computer revenue, said in a
statement Sunday that the board of directors formed a three-member
office of the executive to run the company until a replacement for
the 57-year-old Pfeiffer is named.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation came 10 days after Compaq shocked Wall Street
with the warning, in a statement issued after market closed on
April 9, that first-quarter earnings will be about half of the $530
million that investors had expected. Pressure from analysts, whose
companies advise millions of stockholders, and from pension funds,
which own millions of Compaq shares, forced the company to hold two
conference calls April 12 to shed light on the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Compaq shares plunged about 23 percent last Monday. They
closed Friday at $23.60 on Friday, less than half their high in
January of $51.25.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer blamed Compaq's problems, in part, on industrywide
pressures. But analysts refuted that, saying Dell Computer Corp.
and other computer makers appeared to be having good quarters.
Then, on Tuesday, Intel Corp. reported healthy profit of $2 billion
for its first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Because Intel supplies the chips that run most of the world's
computers, that strongly suggested other PC companies such as Dell
Computer Corp. and Gateway Inc. were not plagued by Compaq's woes.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trying period for Compaq, its credibility became
an issue. On one front, analysts openly questioned whether it could
forecast demand for its products. At the same time, they wondered
why it took so long for the company to identify the size of the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got no indication from the company up till the last week of
the quarter,'' Cody Acree of Southwest Securities in Dallas said
Sunday. ``We kept hearing that February was better and March was
better than that. They probably had better indications (of
weakness) than they were letting on.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dube of Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York likened
Compaq's performance _ meeting Wall Streets expectations one
quarter and missing it the next _ to a bumper-car ride at a
carnival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this careening ... from one wall to another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Acree was surprised by the resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very drastic step taken in response to something
that maybe was not that serious,'' he said, adding that a rebound
by Compaq in the second quarter would have redeemed Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar of Piper Jaffray, a securities company in
Minneapolis, called the move ``a step in the positive direction.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Compaq's credibility on Wall Street had been hurt too
badly for Pfeiffer to continue effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much bad blood spilled between management and
the street,'' Kumar said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the resignations and Chief Financial Officer Earl Mason
are sure to further rattle the company as it heads into an
important week. Compaq reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday
and holds its annual shareholders meeting at its Houston
headquarters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq has come a long way since I joined the company in
1983,'' Pfeiffer said in a statement Sunday. ``We are a world
leader in personal computing, enterprise computing and Internet
applications. ''
</P>
<P>
   The company formed a committee of three board members to take on
chief executive duties while the executive-search firm Heidrick &AMP;
Struggles, which a spokesman said Compaq retained over the weekend,
sounds out possible successors to Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have re-energized this company before, and working
together, we will do it again,'' Compaq Chairman Ben Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will prove to every customer that this is the best company
to serve their information technology needs. And we will confirm to
our investors that Compaq remains a core holding in any
portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   The German-born Pfeiffer joined Compaq in 1983, one year after
it was founded.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming CEO in 1991, Pfeiffer guided Compaq to a position
of leadership in the PC industry. The company is still trying to
digest his most ambitious move, the 1998 acquisition of Digital
Computer Corp. That and the 1997 acquisition of Tandem Computers
Inc. were designed to lift Compaq to a higher level than a PC
maker.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some investors, Compaq has not assimilated
Digital's divisions quickly enough.

 &HT;    Rocker says inactivity hurt rhythm
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A day after blowing his first save opportunity as the
Braves closer, John Rocker was still seething a bit. Part of that
is his personality. Part is the fact that he hadn't given up a run
since last Sept. 9, and there he was giving up three in one inning
to lose Saturday's game against the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had pitched 27 consecutive scoreless outings dating to
last September against the Expos. The streak extended through six
regular-season outings, eight in the postseason, 10 in spring
training and three to start the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   With another day's perspective, Rocker conceded that having
eight days since his previous outing did come into play in the
ninth inning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After some consistent work, I'll get my rhythm back,'' Rocker
said. ``I'd thrown two innings in the last week and a half. When I
get back pitching every day, every two or three days, I'll be a lot
more comfortable with what I'm doing and my sharpness will come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker also figures he was over-compensating in his first
appearance in Coors Field. Hearing that breaking balls don't bite
as much in the thin air, he was trying to put a little more break
into his slider and the results weren't good. Remlinger ready
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mike Remlinger came off the disabled list and pitched a
scoreless inning in Sunday's game, striking out two. To make room
on the roster for the veteran left-hander, the Braves optioned
lefty Derrin Ebert to Class AAA Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   For Remlinger, it's been a tough way to start his career with
the Braves, waiting through 10 games before he'd get a chance to
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in a situation where you want to go out and prove you
can help this team win and you can't do anything,'' he said.
Remlinger also reported that the muscle in his back is healed.
</P>
<P>
   He gives the Braves another experienced arm in a relatively
young bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Patience pays off
</P>
<P>
   At one time one of the most impatient bats in the lineup, Andruw
Jones is showing patience. He drew three walks in Saturday's game
against the Rockies to bring his season total to eight in 10 games,
which leads the Braves. He's not far off Rickey Henderson's
National league-leading 13 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had 40 walks all last year _ in 159 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning to be patient,'' Jones said. ``They're going to
have to throw three good pitches to strike me out, and that's hard
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He had five hits and six RBIs on Sunday, raising his batting
average from .156 to .263.
</P>
<P>
   But he's more interested in just being patient, learning a
lesson from a recent game in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get a hit bad. I swung at a bad pitch and got a
ground ball,'' Jones said. ``You're stupid if you keep swinging at
bad pitches. Go ahead and take your walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko setback
</P>
<P>
   After taking his first swings in batting practice Saturday since
pulling his hamstring Wednesday, Ryan Klesko took a step back on
Sunday, feeling soreness in his leg. He's still not sure when he'll
be able to return.

 &HT;    Atlanta bid considered for Women's Final Four
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the place where the Women's Final Four emerged as a
major national sporting event six years ago, Atlanta also could
play a key role in pushing its popularity into the dome era.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the NCAA Women's Basketball Committee are in town
today and Tuesday to consider a bid by the Atlanta Sports Council
and Georgia Tech that features two possible venues for the 2003
Final Four: the Georgia Dome or the new Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Omni played host to a pre-sellout Women's Final Four in
1993, when Sheryl Swoopes led Texas Tech to the title by scoring an
NCAA championship game record 47 points before a crowd of 16,141.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the event has blossomed, with a record 23,291 in
Charlotte in 1996 watching Tennessee defeat Georgia for the
championship. Last month's title game victory by Purdue over Duke
drew a 4.3 television rating, the second-highest ever for a college
basketball game on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 applications for next year's Women's Final Four
at Philadelphia's First Union Center have been accepted for a
ticket lottery. In 2002, a women's national champion will be
crowned for the first time in a dome in San Antonio's Alamodome,
which will have projected minimum seating of 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other venues competing against Atlanta are the Charlotte
Coliseum, the Pyramid in Memphis and the Palace of Auburn Hills
near Detroit, with a decision expected in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the committee decides to go big, then they've got to go
with us,'' Atlanta Sports Council President Gary Stokan said. ``If
they go small, then we've got a brand new attractive arena to play
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time women have competed in the Georgia Dome was during
the 1996 Olympics, when nearly 35,000 witnessed the gold medal game
won by the United States over Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Stokan said a projected Georgia Dome configuration similar to
the Alamodome is part of the bid, while the Philips Arena will hold
around 20,000 for basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bid meets two criteria that we have,'' Stokan said.
``It's a major college sporting event, and it's a mega-sporting
event in general. Women's basketball is one of the big growth
sports out there, and we want to continue to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the estimated economic impact of hosting the Women's
Final Four would be around $15 million.

 &HT;    Redskins clearing a spot for Bailey
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It should not take long for former Georgia star Champ
Bailey to earn the starting job at left cornerback with the
Washington Redskins. Barring an unexpected change of heart, the
Skins will release incumbent starter Cris Dishman today, clearing
the way for Bailey to line up opposite Darrell Green as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey still will have to compete for the job with four-year pro
Darryl Pounds, who also has played free safety. But the Skins
triumvirate of general manager Charley Casserly, coach Norv Turner
and defensive coordinator Mike Nolan reiterated Sunday that they
expect Bailey to make an immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best athletes to come into the league in a few
years,'' Casserly said. ``It would be a surprise to all of us if he
didn't help us right away.''
</P>
<P>
   What genius?
</P>
<P>
   The true gauge will come a few years down the road, but the
early read on Bill Walsh's first draft back with the 49ers is that
``The Genius'' had a dubious return. In the first round, Walsh
filled a huge need, trading up to snatch Florida defensive tackle
Reggie McGrew. But some scouts question how effective McGrew will
be, pointing out that his arms were amont the shortest ever
measured at the combine. In the third round, the pick was Purdue
defensive end Chike Okeafor, who tested positive for marijuana in
college. With the second choice in Round 6, San Francisco took
Michigan wide receiver Tai Streets, who could miss the entire
season because of an Achilles' injury sustained in a pickup
basketball game a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Poindexter finally taken
</P>
<P>
   Had he left school after his junior season, Virginia safety
Anthony Poindexter likely would have been a first-round pick. But
he stayed with the Cavaliers and seriously injured a knee last
October. The injury caused him to drop to the seventh round, where
he was selected by Baltimore, and might keep him out his entire
rookie season. ``Everybody plays the `what if' game,'' Poindexter
said. ``I'll just have to make up on my second contract all the
money this cost me on my first one.''
</P>
<P>
   The big reach
</P>
<P>
   San Diego general manager Bobby Beathard continued his penchant
for selecting players from small schools. Among the Chargers'
choices were tight end Steve Heiden (South Dakota State), guard
Reggie Nelson (McNeese State) and defensive back Tyrone Bell
(Northern Alabama). Beathard is fond of trading the next year's
first-round choice for a pick in the current draft. He couldn't do
that this year, because he already dealt his top pick in the 2000
draft to Tampa Bay last spring. Beathard twice refused during the
draft to deal his first pick in the 2001 draft to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-out
</P>
<P>
   When the '98 college season began, Cuncho Brown of Penn State
and Georgia's Larry Brown were the top-rated tight ends in the
country. This weekend, they weren't even selected in the draft.
Other notables who went unselected: running back Devin West
(Missouri), tight end Rufus French (Mississippi), safety Gana
Joseph (Oklahoma), safety Marcus Ray (Michigan) and cornerback
Chris Cummings (LSU).
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Louisiana isn't a powerhouse, but the school had
defensive ends selected on back-to-back picks in the sixth round,
Robert Daniel to Carolina and Lionel Barnes to St. Louis. ... The
Colts took Notre Dame punter Hunter Smith in the seventh round. The
team's trainer also is named Hunter Smith, but the two are not
related. . . . Baltimore bolstered its shaky offensive line by
trading for veteran guard Everett Lindsay of Minnesota. ... Among
the players not selected was Weber State wideout John Fassell. He
is the son of New York Giants coach Jim Fassell. ... There were 26
trades during the draft

 &HT;    `Mayor of Eldoret' favored to continue reign
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Back home in Eldoret, in the Rift Valley of western
Kenya, Moses Tanui runs freely through the countryside. He prefers
to train solo in this land of world-class runners. They call him
the Mayor of Eldoret, and he laughs when it's mentioned,
emphasizing that it is an honorary, not elective, title.
</P>
<P>
   That he is the point man of the Kenyan contingent in town for
the 103rd running of the Boston Marathon is no laughing matter.
Tanui, one of the world's best distance runners, is a major part of
Boston history. He won the centennial celebration three years ago
and eked out another win last April. This afternoon, the favorite's
role is his again.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet of the day is that a Kenyan will be wearing the
laurel wreath at race's end. It's been that way the past eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   The dominance began in 1988, when Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya
became the first African to win Boston. Hussein wore the laurel
wreath twice more, in 1991 and 1992. Fellow Kenyan Cosmas Ndeti won
the next three. Tanui took the titles in '96 and last year.
</P>
<P>
   Until Hussein broke through, first winning the New York Marathon
in 1987, Kenyans were relative foreigners to the marathon. They won
medals for shorter races on the track, but they feared that the
marathon distance was beyond their range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were cautious about the marathon,'' said Tanui, who smiles
frequently and speaks in a soft voice. ``People would say, `You ran
a marathon? Did you finish?' They thought the marathon was a very
difficult race.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanui's breakthrough came on the track, in the 1991 World
Championships in Tokyo, where he won the 10,000 meters ahead of
countryman Richard Chelimo and the great Moroccan, Kahlid Skah. He
later moved up to the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the 100th edition of Boston in 1996, Tanui decided
to bypass the Atlanta Olympic marathon in favor of the 10,000, but
he was slowed by an Achilles injury and failed to make the Kenyan
team.
</P>
<P>
   While Tanui races his countrymen today for a third title in four
years, Fatuma Roba _ best remembered for her unexpected victory at
the Atlanta Olympics _ will take on an even stronger field in her
bid to join Uta Pippig as winner of three Boston women's titles in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a knee injury that worsened during the race last year,
Roba persevered to finish in 2 hours, 23 minutes, 21 seconds, the
third-fastest woman in Boston history behind only Pippig (2:21:45)
and Joan Benoit Samuelson (2:22:43). Look for Roba to be challenged
by last year's runner-up, Renata Paradowska of Poland, along with
road-racing champion Colleen De Reuck of South Africa, reigning New
York City Marathon champ Franca Fiacconi of Italy and 1997 New York
winner Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A popular wild card in these parts is Lynn Jennings, 38, who
lives in neighboring Maine and is making her official marathon
debut. Jennings is a three-time World Cross-Country champion and
the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist in the 10,000 meters, for which
she still holds the American record.
</P>
<P>
   As a 17-year-old, Jennings ran Boston without an official
number, finishing in 2:46 _ which would have been good enough for
third place. The mystery is why she never tried again. She claims
it was her versatility and success on the track that kept her away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had done one earlier,'' Jennings said, ``perhaps I
wouldn't have accomplished all that I have.

PAGING ALLIES FOCUS STRATEGY ON THE INTERNET

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Threatened by the specter of irrelevance in an era of
near-ubiquitous cellular phones and e-mail, most of the nation's
largest paging companies have formed an alliance to deploy
inexpensive hand-held computers that use a new two-way wireless
technology developed by Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The companies intend to announce the alliance Monday at the
Comdex technology conference in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion in use of wireless telephones, the paging
business has come under intense pressure in recent years. Some 73
million people in the United States now use wireless phones,
compared with only about 56 million who use pagers.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the increasing use of wireless phones has forced
paging companies to slash prices. It is big news in the paging
industry these days when a paging carrier makes any money.
</P>
<P>
   And as communications equipment makers begin incorporating
e-mail and in some cases rudimentary World Wide Web browsers into
wireless phones, paging companies face an even greater threat.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance may be the paging industry's best-coordinated
and most comprehensive response. The group is in discussions with
Microsoft Corp. and 3Com Corp. about incorporating the new Motorola
technology into hand-held computers that use Microsoft's Windows CE
and 3Com's Palm operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The paging alliance is based on a simple concept: Wireless
phones that include Web services generally do not allow people to
talk and surf at the same time. When the user is talking, the
screen is generally pressed against the person's cheek, making it
impossible to, say, negotiate a meeting time while actually looking
at one's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The paging companies want to sell small units that are separate
from a phone but that could include a small keyboard, e-mail
access, a datebook and address book and that would have a battery
life measured in weeks instead of days or hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision of the future is that most people will carry two
wireless devices,'' said John D. Beletic, chairman of the new
alliance and chairman of Pagemart Wireless Inc., one of the largest
paging companies. ``One is going to be a telephone, and the
characteristics of the telephone are that they are going to get
smaller and smaller and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But when you use this phone maybe you wanted to set
up a lunch with me, and while you're talking to me you may be
wanting to look at your calendar. Or I'm giving you important
information and you want to enter that into a data device. And
these devices won't be optimized for voice. They will have
calendar, memos, directory, text messaging, and from a wireless
standpoint it will be optimized to penetrate into buildings and
will be optimized to work for weeks on a couple of double-A
batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, such devices already exist. American Mobile Satellite
Corp. and BellSouth Corp.'s wireless data unit, which used to be
known as Ram Mobile Data, offer advanced two-way paging services
using small units made by Research in Motion Ltd. of Canada, based
partly on technology from Ericsson of Sweden. Skytel Communications
Inc., one of the paging carriers in the new alliance, already
offers two-way service using units from Motorola and Glenayre
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have the best performance from a network
standpoint,'' John Kampfe, a spokesman for the BellSouth wireless
data operation, said. ``The latency of messages is in seconds
rather than minutes, which allows people to chat from their
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   But the current generation of two-way pagers generally does not
offer true nationwide coverage, since most reach only big cities.
Nor do they use popular operating systems, though that will soon
change because the upcoming Palm VII organizer will use the
BellSouth network. The new paging alliance wants to offer service
everywhere in the nation and to incorporate the new Motorola
technology, known as Reflex, not only in the Windows CE and Palm
operating systems but also into devices that use Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paging has really had to in many ways redefine itself as an
extension of the desktop computer as opposed to a cheaper method of
staying in touch,'' said Jeanine M. Oburchay, a wireless analyst
for Bear, Stearns. ``The advanced networks we're seeing built out
now are the paging industry's way of redefining itself into a
remote messaging industry or remote e-mail industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beletic said Pagemart, which is based in Dallas, spent about
$310 million to upgrade its network for the new devices, which
could also subscribe to data services like weather information,
sports scores or stock quotations. He wants to begin offering
advanced two-way services later this year and wants to persuade
makers of standard hand-held computers to incorporate the new
wireless technology by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under license from Motorola, Glenayre, of Charlotte, N.C., is
also developing chips for the new technology, which is a wireless
system based loosely on the programming language of the Internet.
The availability of Glenayre's products could help draw in
developers wary of relying on a single technology vendor, in this
case Motorola, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The paging carriers participating in the alliance are Airtouch,
Arch Communications, Conxus, Metrocall, Mobilecomm, Pagemart,
Pagenet, Skytel and TSR Wireless. The only major paging carrier
that had not yet signed on as of Friday was Ameritech Corp.'s
paging unit.

   &UR; Lou Sheldon &LR; , chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, has
written to  &UR; Bob Dole &LR;  complaining about the former presidential
candidate's Viagra ads. What's bothering Sheldon is that Dole said
the drug could be beneficial to ``millions of men and their
partners,'' rather than ``millions of men and their spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the word `partner' is problematic,'' Sheldon wrote

</P>
<P>
   rt,10p10 A 20-foot statue of  &UR; Vladimir Lenin &LR;  that was installed
at the Mandalay Bay resort near the Red Square vodka bar,
overlooking the slot machines, has been modified. Lenin's head has
been sawed off _ to be turned into a table base in the bar _ and
his body has been splattered with white paint that looks like bird
droppings.
</P>
<P>
   The beheading of the statue, installed as a piece of kitsch
comparable to miniature versions of the Eiffel Tower and that sort
of thing at other Las Vegas resorts, is in response to complaints
from servicemen and -women and patrons who likened it to a statue
of Hitler or Mussolini.

a ``charity scam,'' a term that was not employed by the original

   - When 12 children born blind were videotaped answering spoken
questions, the gestures they made with their hands proved that
gesturing is an innate human instinct.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Indiana University and the University of Chicago,
whose work is reported in Health magazine, found that blind
children moved their hands as sighted children do. When they talked
about pouring from a glass, for example, they cupped one hand and
tilted it. The blind children gestured as often as children who
could see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think gesturing is part of the thinking process,'' said
 &UR; Jana Iverson &LR;  of Indiana University, explaining that somehow the
motion helps the brain define what in a thought needs emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   - Walking near a construction worker's pick- &LR; up at a building
site at Geary and Leavenworth,  &UR; Ken Maley &LR;  was astounded at the
sound of the truck's alarm, a voice that kept repeating, ``I've
been tampered with, I've been tampered ...''
</P>
<P>
   _Amorous young Middle Easterners, forbidden to directly approach
members of the opposite sex in public, are driving around with
pairs of cell phones in their cars, reports the Economist. If a

ECEVIT, LEFT-LEANING PREMIER, TAKES STRONG LEAD IN TURKISH VOTING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit appeared to run
well ahead of all challengers in Sunday's national election,
according to returns tabulated early Monday morning. The result
suggested that he would be in a strong position to form Turkey's
next government.
</P>
<P>
   Projections indicated that Ecevit would receive 24 percent of
the vote. They were made after only about one-fourth of the ballots
had been counted, however, and were not considered wholly reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's elections were held more than a year ahead of schedule.
Turkey has been without a stable government since the last
election, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly weak second place appeared to be going to the
Islamic-oriented Virtue party, with 16 percent. Virtue is anathema
to the ruling establishment and to powerful military commanders.
Its leaders had hoped for a first-place finish, which might have
allowed them to try forming a government.
</P>
<P>
   Television pictures from Virtue headquarters showed many
evidently disappointed faces. The party was apparently unable to
overcome strong attacks from the secularist press and a perception
that it was in disarray from internal conflict between young
insurgents who want to jettison its religious orientation and an
old guard determined to cling to it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its slippage in parliamentary voting, however, Virtue
seemed likely to hold the mayors' posts in the country's two
largest cities, Istanbul and Ankara. Ecevit's Democratic Left party
was leading in the race to control Izmir, the third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders and other secularists, reportedly including the
military, have been hoping for a coalition between Ecevit, who
portrays himself as left-leaning, and former Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, a center-rightist. That coalition may now be possible,
although at least one other party would probably have to join to
give such a coalition enough support to win a parliamentary vote of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The far-right Nationalist Action party, which was not
represented in the last Parliament, appeared to be making a
remarkable comeback and could join the next government. In the
past, Nationalist Action has supported militant and even violent
Turkish chauvinism, but a new leadership team sought to provide a
more moderate image in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter battle between the two parties portraying themselves
as center-right, Yilmaz's Motherland party appeared to be running
ahead of the True Path party led by former Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller. During the campaign, Mrs. Ciller suggested that the
center-right should unify under whichever of the two leaders
finished ahead in the election.
</P>
<P>
   The religious-oriented Welfare party, which has since been
banned and replaced by Virtue, finished first in the 1995 voting.
Its leader, Necmettin Erbakan, formed a coalition government that
appeared sympathetic to Islamic fundamentalism and to militant
governments like those in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercely secular military strongly disapproved of Erbakan's
government, and exerted such intense pressure that the government
collapsed after one year.
</P>
<P>
   The secular government that took over in its place, headed by
Yilmaz, failed to consolidate itself and collapsed last November.
Ecevit was named as a caretaker to take the country to elections.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Ecevit took office, Turkish commandos captured the
country's most hated man and most wanted fugitive, the Kurdish
guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan. With his capture Ecevit got an
enormous boost, and he suddenly emerged as a triumphant figure who
might stabilize the country's turbulent political scene.
</P>
<P>
   His strong showings and those of Nationalist Action suggest a
surge of nationalist feeling after Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties take a hard line against the Kurdish movement,
which they say threatens national unity. Both also oppose
compromise with Greece over Cyprus or other issues.

 &HT;    Freaknik falls flat
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The women wised up, the cops cracked down and the
result was a relatively lame Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   Word that Atlanta police were cracking down on the slightest
infractions apparently rippled to surrounding campuses, causing
attendance to drop and limiting trouble that was widespread in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no action here,'' Police Chief Beverly Harvard said
Sunday as she toured a remarkably calm downtown. ``There were
hardly any women this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday we drove around and we saw a lot of young men
between the ages of 16 and maybe in their middle 20s and they were
actually looking for the women. You could see it on their faces
that they weren't having much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed party-goers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year will be my last,'' said T-shirt vendor Marla O'Hara,
who had a shop on Ashby Street near Morehouse College and is
concluding her sixth Freaknik. ``You can't expect people to come
back when they're treated like this by the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Morehouse University student Felicia Pow, 23, attending her
third Black College Spring Break, saying the police crackdown ``was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaknik needed to stay like it was,'' she said. ``The mayor
needs to be more like the governor of Florida who said we were
welcome there if we behaved properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The definition of ``proper'' behavior varied.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, Freaknik was a ticket to whoop it up on clogged
streets and ogle members of the opposite sex. This year, riding on
cars, leaning on horns and blocking intersections routinely brought
tickets. And sometimes arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Many who stopped for just seconds to swap phone numbers found
their wheels being dragged off by one of the five towing firms that
service the city.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday afternoon, police arrested 320 revelers (30 for
felonies) and ticketed more than 800 _ 185 of them for city codes
violations. Around 400 cars were towed.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County police, who enacted a similar no-nonsense
approach, reported that crowds and incidents have been light.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Atlanta police diverted traffic to DeKalb,
causing tie-ups on Memorial Drive and Candler Road. This year,
police there started cracking down Thursday night and an officer
Sunday evening said ``it's dead out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said arrests and tickets were equally divided among
residents of Atlanta, Georgia and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Officer John Quigley said this year's thin crowds made
the zero-tolerance approach easier to administer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, zero-tolerance doesn't work when you're
overwhelmed,'' he said, referring to the free-wheeling days of
yore. City officials would not estimate this year's crowd but it
was almost certainly less than the 50,000 who came last year.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, Harvard has warned Freaknikers that lewd behavior
would not be tolerated by police. Rapes and other sexual assaults
were frequent, with scantily clad women attacked on sidewalks and
on top of cars stalled on streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women have been victims, they've been groped and
attacked,'' Harvard said. ``This year we didn't see any of that
groping. The word has gotten around that if you come to Atlanta's
college spring break celebration, you could have some trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Impromptu photo opportunities with women flashing were
discouraged by officers who quickly moved in and broke up the
activities before they got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes a matter of seconds before a woman's clothes are
torn off and she's completely naked and then you have a situation
on your hands,' said Officer M.A. Sharpe, who on Saturday told at
least eight women to go home and put more clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Markel Hutchins, a 21-year-old Morehouse College
student and a member of the mayor's Freaknik advisory committee,
said local police were creating a ``police state'' in Atlanta,
harassing party-goers with no good reason.
</P>
<P>
   He said officers twice yelled at him and and threatened to
ticket him until they spotted his credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was necessary to walk around with my badge
around my neck to be treated with respect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morehouse student Pow said the more stringent police enforcement
won't kill the annual party. ``You can't stop it,'' she said.
``It's gonna be here every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked her prognosis for Freaknik 2000, Harvard smiled again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate the kids will come here,'' Harvard said.
``They`ll want to spend it somewhere where they can have some fun.
We welcome you here, but don't violate the laws.''

   &UR; Lou Sheldon &LR; , chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, has
written to  &UR; Bob Dole &LR;  complaining about the former presidential
candidate's Viagra ads. What's bothering Sheldon is that Dole said
the drug could be beneficial to ``millions of men and their
partners,'' rather than ``millions of men and their spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the word `partner' is problematic,'' Sheldon wrote
to Dole. ``It is inconsistent with the common sense, traditional
values of Bob and  &UR; Elizabeth Dole &LR;  that Americans know.''

<P>
   rt,10p10 A 20-foot statue of  &UR; Vladimir Lenin &LR;  that was installed
at the Mandalay Bay resort near the Red Square vodka bar,
overlooking the slot machines, has been modified. Lenin's head has
been sawed off _ to be turned into a table base in the bar _ and
his body has been splattered with white paint that looks like bird
droppings.
</P>
<P>
   The beheading of the statue, installed as a piece of kitsch
comparable to miniature versions of the Eiffel Tower and that sort
of thing at other Las Vegas resorts, is in response to complaints
from servicemen and -women and patrons who likened it to a statue
of Hitler or Mussolini.

children moved their hands as sighted children do. When they talked
about pouring from a glass, for example, they cupped one hand and
tilted it. The blind children gestured as often as children who
could see.

EDITORIAL: CAMPAIGN, REFORM, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 19:
</P>
<P>
   The fight over campaign finance reform has now begun in earnest.
By the close of business Friday, 189 Democrats in the House of
Representatives had signed a petition to force a floor vote on
legislation that would outlaw the unlimited, unregulated donations
to political parties that are known as soft money. The petition
strategy has been forced by the resolute refusal of the House
speaker, Dennis Hastert, to move quickly on the bill and thus leave
enough time to rally support in the Senate before the campaign
season begins next year _ and hundreds of millions of dollars from
special interests start polluting the system all over again.
Because the petition needs 218 signatures to succeed, and there are
only 211 Democrats, the Republicans will have to help.
</P>
<P>
   Where are those Republicans? For the most part, they are
cowering in silent obedience to Hastert's plea for party loyalty,
which in this case means acquiescing in his strategy for delay. The
speaker argues that discharge petitions are inherently disloyal,
and says prompt consideration of campaign finance reform would
disrupt his carefully calibrated timetable that calls for orderly
consideration of big-ticket items like the minimum wage, patients'
rights and the annual appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   There are two answers to the speaker's logic, which is
essentially a cover for his distaste for reform. First, the
legislation banning soft money, sponsored by Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass., was debated at length last
year. The same bill can thus be considered expeditiously this year,
without threatening measured discussion on other important matters.
Indeed, the petition expressly limits debate on this bill or any
reform alternative to 17 hours. Second, Hastert is demanding not
just ``loyalty,'' but a suspension of principle. When the speaker's
predecessor, Newt Gingrich, finally ran out of stalling tactics
last year, the House approved Shays-Meehan by a resounding
252-to-179 vote _ with plenty of Republican help. Many Republicans
still support reform. In effect, Hastert is asking them to abandon
their better judgment in the name of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   That is manipulation of the most obvious sort, and somebody has
to call him on it. The most likely candidate is Shays, who has
worked too long and too hard for reform to see it defeated by the
speaker's transparent mind games. But other Republicans can help as
well. Last year, 12 Republicans signed a similar discharge
petition, including three regional representatives besides Shays _
Amo Houghton of New York, Marge Roukema of New Jersey and Nancy
Johnson of Connecticut. This page applauded their support then and
would obviously welcome it this time around.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner they speak out, the better. Last year's victory for
Shays-Meehan came too late in the session for reformers to muster
sufficient support in the Senate, which killed a companion measure
in a filibuster organized by the the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who heads his party's Senatorial
Campaign Committee. Although a majority of senators would vote
tomorrow for reform, there are not yet the 60 votes necessary to
block another filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Quick action by the House could give reformers time to organize
a pressure campaign in the Senate. It could also greatly enhance
the prospects for fundamental reforms that the public has been
demanding for years.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHO'S AFRAID OF THE BIG BAD BALKAN QUAGMIRE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The birth announcements for the new, isolationist Republican
Party seem to be somewhat premature. True, there has been a lot of
dark muttering about morasses and quagmires _ Yugoslavia has been
compared to every kind of bad-driving terrain known to mankind,
except perhaps really deep potholes. But this is a congressional
sentiment from the rapidly aging partisans of the Gingrich
revolution, most perfectly articulated by the House majority
leader, Dick Armey, the guy who declared that having been abroad
once, he saw no reason to ever go back. The Republican candidates
for president are a different matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the field is split on what to do about Kosovo,
but the avowed opponents of American involvement are all long,
long, long shots like Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer and Sen. Bob Smith,
R-N.H. Saying that the Republican presidential candidates lean
toward isolation is like examining school spirit among teen-agers
and interviewing only those who did not get invited to the prom.
</P>
<P>
   The isolationists get more than their share of attention because
their leading light is so eminently loud and quotable. Buchanan,
who advocates less foreign intervention and more defense buildup,
keeps seconding Otto von Bismarck's remark on how the Balkans are
``not worth the healthy bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.''
Talk-radio aficionados may be familiar with this reference, but the
rest of the nation has got to be thinking about an army of small
fluffy dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the real Republican field seems to be getting more
hawkish by the day, possibly because the Kosovo crisis has worked
so well for Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate
who has been the most outspoken voice for engagement. McCain has
been winning the talk-show war. A Vietnam war hero, he is perhaps
best positioned to get away with expressing confidence about how
quickly American troops and equipment could beat a small country
with a second-rate military. His reputation as the one
(non-Buchananite) Republican who is not afraid to say what he
thinks seems to be impressing the public, although to Washington
insiders, demonstrations of McCain's propensity for
straight-talking are superfluous. This is the man who is planning
to run in the Iowa primary as the Republican who led the battle
against federal subsidies for ethanol, a highly uneconomic but very
deeply corn-based fuel.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the man with all the money and all the
endorsements and all of just about everything except positions,
clocked in late on Kosovo, with the air of someone who had just
finished an all-nighter, poring over lists of major exports,
historical highlights and regional cooking tips. Bush's latest
pronouncements can be read in William Safire's column on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session with Texas journalists earlier
this month, Bush disassociated himself from the Armey school of
you've-seen-one-continent-you've-seen-them-all. Slobodan Milosevic,
he said, needs to be taught a ``lesson'' and NATO forces should be
satisfied with nothing less than ``an unconditional surrender.''
His only reservation, Bush added, was whether the bombing campaign
was being done with enough ``ferocity.'' He seemed to have been
breathing deeply from that Alamo-enhanced air.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole has called on President Clinton to build up and
deploy ``the forces necessary to win the war.'' Steve Forbes wants
to expand the bombing and arm the Kosovars. Dan Quayle is dead set
against ground troops, except that they might be inevitable. For
terseness, vagueness and grumpiness, none of them can hold a candle
to Al Gore's only Democratic competition, former Sen. Bill Bradley.
Bradley, you will be happy to know, has ``serious questions about
our policy'' and is worried about ``becoming bogged down in a
quagmire.''
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that all this effort at being forceful on foreign
policy is now being directed at a military engagement engineered by
Bill Clinton. As a candidate, after all, the president's most
memorable statement on foreign affairs may have been his
explanation of how he would have voted in the Senate when George
Bush needed support for the Gulf War: ``I guess I would have voted
with the majority if it was a close vote. But I agree with the
arguments the minority made.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leading Republican candidates have histories that
made it inevitable that they would land somewhere in the
internationalist camp. But polls showing increasing American
support for the effort in Kosovo may also have had an effect. Bill
Clinton has flummoxed the Republicans so often they may now suspect
that the man who got the public to overlook adultery may be able to
get the public enthusiastic about international quagmires, too.

<P>
   MORINI, Albania _ The hordes of people with frightened faces
crossing into Albania from Kosovo stopped temporarily early Sunday
after five refugees, including three children, died when their
small car was blown to bits by a powerful antitank mine placed at
the border as a defense against a possible NATO assault.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Yugoslav authorities reopened the border, however,
the flow resumed at the rate of about 1,000 refugees an hour. They
came on tractors with shot-out tires, in carts drawn by desperately
tired horses draped with incongruously decorative red tassels, and
thousands were said to be heading for the border on foot.
</P>
<P>
   With 30,000 refugees arriving in Albania and Macedonia on
Saturday, and another 40,000 either leaving Kosovo or massing at
its borders on Sunday, international monitors here believe this
could mark the beginning of another major effort by Serb forces to
purge Kosovo of its Albanian majority under cover of the NATO air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   With many villages already cleared, refugees report that Serb
forces are combing the hillsides for Albanians hiding there.
Refugee accounts also indicate that the central areas of cities
like Mitrovica are being cleared _ a description underscored by the
arrival of larger, more expensive automobiles that hurry past
tractors and horse-drawn wagons as soon as they arrive in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently reflecting tensions over the stepped-up NATO
military activity in Albania, Yugoslavia severed diplomatic
relations with Albania Sunday, the Albanian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   While Serb forces are pushing Albanians across the border,
authorities have repeatedly and arbitrarily clamped the borders
shut. International monitors are not certain what this is intended
to accomplish, nor can they at times be certain what the lack of
refugees at certain crossings means. That was the case on April 7,
when thousands of refugees who were turned back at the border
seemed to vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities clamped the border shut again after Sunday
morning's explosion, chasing away other refugees who were
attempting to help the survivors. The bodies of three children in
the car were brought back to Yugoslavia, monitors said.
</P>
<P>
   The border crossing then was quiet through the early morning, as
a heavy rain again pounded this area of eastern Albania, turning
camps and fields housing more than 75,000 refugees into seas of
slimy mud and wet clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the border reopened just after 9 a.m., the stream
of refugees resumed, with monitors reporting about 6,000 by
mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There may be as many as 60,000 refugees on their way to the
border crossing here, many of them moving on foot, said Owen
O'Sullivan, chief of the observer team from the Organization for
Cooperation and Security in Europe, which has been monitoring the
border.
</P>
<P>
   He said the presence of the mines on the Yugoslav side of the
border has been known since they were placed there about two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The mines are set on the asphalt just behind a series of squat
concrete pyramids that are lined up across the entrance to the
narrow bridge that joins the border crossing in Yugoslavia with
Albania.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sunday morning's deadly mine blast killed five of seven refugees
squeezed into a small white sedan. They were all members of a
family rousted from their home in the village of Belacevac, near
Pristina, by Serbian troops Friday afternoon. Witnesses said that a
tractor-pulled cart went off the asphalt roadway early Sunday
morning. Since the concrete barricades block most of the roadway,
there is only a narrow slot left through which refugees can pass.
</P>
<P>
   To get the wagon back on the road, the refugees tried to clear
some space by getting a few vehicles to back up. Ibush Berisha, 44,
of Belacevac, tried moving slowly in reverse to a position near the
concrete barricades
</P>
<P>
   ``The road was blocked so he pulled back and tried to park the
car right next to the barricades,'' said Saim Cucalli, 60, a
retired professor, also from Belacevac, whose cart had gone off the
road and caused the congestion. ``When Ibush backed up the car, it
exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   The rear half and roof of the small sedan were blown off.
Cucalli said several of the victims were thrown from the car by the
power of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran to try to help them but the Serbian police told us to
get lost because the area was filled with mines,'' he said. ``So we
had to leave them.'' Bjork Therkildsen, a monitor with the European
group, said the bodies of the three children who died were taken
from the border by Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car was treated at a local hospital in Kukes
and released. His wife and mother both died, while another son was
rushed to a hospital in Tirana, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   When Yugoslav guards reopened the border at 9:20, refugees
immediately began to cross, staring at the wreckage. Like most
other refugees, they carried stories of beatings and robbery by
Serbian police, and of a strong push by Serb authorities to expel
them.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from around Belacevac, said that a few days ago there
was a skirmish between Serb troops and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the separatist rebels. They also said that Serbs burned the house
of an Albanian family in Belacevac and wounded two women who tried
to run away.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NATO bombings began more than three weeks ago, more
than 600,000 Albanians have been forced out of Kosovo, according to
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Well over half have come
to Albania, placing an enormous burden on aid groups and on
Europe's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   The border crossing at Morini, as well as the city of Kukes,
about 10 miles away, have become increasingly dangerous. In the
past week, five cross-border rocket bombs presumably aimed at a
nearby rebel encampment fell just outside the city. And observers
have reported mortar fire across the border.

BLISTER BLIGHT HITS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes held out the palm
of his right hand and pointed to his middle finger and the redness
from the blister. It's the reason Valdes was taken out after 61/3
innings Sunday against the San Diego Padres instead of finishing
the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Antonio Osuna has the same thing, a blister on the
middle finger of his pitching hand. Manager Davey Johnson hopes
Osuna will be fine by today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's (going on) with blisters,'' Johnson said.
``Everybody's got a blister.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who allowed three earned runs on six hits, threw 102
pitches, but he said the blister affected him most on breaking
pitches. Valdes usually develops a blister on the side of his
middle finger, but never in the middle, where it bothers his
gripping of the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me more than I thought he could,'' Johnson said. ``I
didn't want to give him a chance to lose the ballgame and
exacerbate the blister.''
</P>
<P>
   Charting the rotation: Johnson said he would talk with pitching
coach Charlie Hough today about whether to skip a pitcher in the
rotation or push everyone back a day because of Thursday's off day.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that discussion may be framed around Valdes' blister. It
could mean skipping either Darren Dreifort, Valdes or lefty Carlos
Perez in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also have next Monday off before beginning a
nine-game road trip, and Johnson has said in the past that seven
days off for a starter is too long.
</P>
<P>
   Prince of thieves: Any time Dodgers second baseman Eric Young
wants to run he can. Those are the directions given by Johnson, and
so far Young has taken off 13 times and been caught just twice.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Young have more than twice as many steals as
anyone else, only six major-league teams entered Sunday with more
stolen bases than Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technique-wise, (Young) is right in there with (Barry)
Larkin,'' Johnson said. ``A quick start, smart baserunner. He's got
that instinct to know when to go. That can be contagious. If I have
guys that are smart baserunners, I'll give them the green light to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is setting the trend for the Dodgers, who lead baseball
with 22 stolen bases. Even Valdes got into the action Sunday,
stealing second in the sixth inning. It was Valdes' second career
stolen base and first since Aug. 24, 1997, at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley threw out Damian
Jackson on an attempted stolen base in the fifth inning. It was the
first time in 13 attempts Hundley threw a runner out.... The
Dodgers and Padres drew 156,852 to Qualcomm Stadium, a three-game
record for San Diego.

abyss,'' he said, telling the 24 other leaders of the Association
of Caribbean States meeting here on Saturday that they shared the
``same drama of terrible underdevelopment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the central core of all these summits?'' he asked.
``What is the nucleus? I think we are a little disorganized. I
think we should review all these summits to be more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-day session here was called to come up with a plan of
action for the next century. Leaders of countries with a Caribbean
coastline, including Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Fidel Castro of
Cuba and Andres Pastrana of Colombia, signed a declaration
declaring tourism the industry that can best increase employment
and income in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration also condemned the transport of nuclear waste
shipments through the Caribbean and committed the members to pursue
bilateral pacts and tariff concessions for regional trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   But even though these countries have been striving for unity to
cope with economic globalization, the gathering failed to reach
consensus on some issues, underscoring the diversity of the
countries involved.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most divisive issues was the recent World Trade
Organization ruling allowing the United States to impose sanctions
against European-made goods in retaliation for the European Union's
trade preferences for bananas grown in its former colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The banana dispute pits small eastern Caribbean islands like St.
Vincent and the Grenadines against Central American countries,
where Chiquita Brands and other American companies are major banana
growers that contend they will be hurt by the European Union's
quota system.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was a hot topic in a closed-door session here in which
Cuba's Fidel Castro railed against the trade group, which regulates
international trade, as ``a fearful instrument of re-colonization
and exploitation of the world,'' the Cuban government news media
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Association of Caribbean States represents countries
on both sides of the banana dispute, it was up to the eastern
Caribbean islands that oppose the ruling to issue their first
formal statement on the decision. They did today, under the aegis
of another regional group, the Caribbean Community.
</P>
<P>
   Their statement called the ruling ``the single most dangerous
threat to the economies of the Caribbean banana exporting
countries'' and warned that putting it into effect ``without
consideration of the vulnerability of the Caribbean banana industry
would lead to severe social and economic dislocations.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the opening of the meeting in the National Theater
here Friday night, President Jules A. Wijdenbosch of Suriname used
the banana dispute to call for increased concerted action by
Caribbean states. He said that the battle was being fought by two
major economic powers, the European Union and the United States,
without direct involvement by the smaller countries most affected.
</P>
<P>
   One of the association's goals is for members, who represent 200
million people and a gross domestic product of $500 billion, to
coalesce in a trading bloc that would be one of the largest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever it's our responsibility to demonstrate our
presence in international and regional organizations and demand
that our concerns are an integral part of the agenda, the debate
and the general solutions,'' Wijdenbosch said.
</P>
<P>
   But presidents also used the summit meeting, the second held by
the 5-year-old group, to seek cooperation on more individual
matters. President Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador petitioned
Castro ``for clemency in the name of the families and all
Salvadorans'' for two Salvadorans who face the death penalty in
terrorist bombings in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Pastrana and Chavez, who have had differences over
Chavez's sympathy for Colombian guerrillas, also held a private
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican President, Leonel Fernandez, has solidified the
Dominican Republic's new stature as an international player after
years of isolation under a strongman, Joaquin Balaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the presence of so many world leaders, parts of the
city were turned into maximum security areas, with armed military
police along many streets and with metal detectors at hotel
entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, as usual, drew special attention without making public
speeches. He signed the meeting's joint declaration even though a
provision to ``reaffirm our commitment to preserve, consolidate and
strengthen democracy, political pluralism and a state of law as the
privileged backdrop that allows respect, defense and promotion of
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But the declaration also urged the United States to end the
Helms-Burton law, which toughened the America trade embargo against
Cuba, and it endorsed the principles of sovereignty and
nonintervention ``and the right of each country to build its own
political system in peace, stability and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry here restricted a news conference after the
signing of the ``Declaration of Santo Domingo'' Saturday night to
allow not more than two questions of any leader, apparently to keep
someone like Castro from monopolizing the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Castro bowed out of the news conference, the
only leader to do so. He cited ``unavoidable commitments,''
standing up two reporters _ one of them from the exile press in
Miami _ who were assigned the two questions for him.

 These Bunnies Just Keep Goin'  
 By Dan Fost  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Roseville, Placer County
</P>
<P>
   It looks like an astronaut's convention.
</P>
<P>
   A phalanx of white-suited workers, with no skin visible except
their eyes, begins to file off of the NEC Electronics computer-chip
factory floor just before 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   They enter a crammed locker room, where workers on the next
shift are already donning their bunny suits, getting ready for 12
hours in the fab (short for ``fabrication'').
</P>
<P>
   Bunny suits _ so dubbed because of a wearer's resemblance to the
Easter bunny, sans ears and tail _ are a peculiarity of the
semiconductor industry. Microchips must be manufactured in ``clean
rooms'' devoid of any microscopic particles that could wreck them.
Workers wear the encompassing suits to ensure that nothing _ not
the thread from their clothes, not little flakes from their skin,
not a speck of dust _ gets on the delicate chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at a chip under a microscope, it's like a
city,'' said Hank Halverson, a line maintenance technician. ``A
particle on that chip is about as big as an asteroid landing in the
middle of that city.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending a day surrounded by humming equipment and white-suited
workers, is like science fiction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine being in a sauna for 12 hours,'' said another worker.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 74,000 people across the country work in clean rooms
building semiconductors, according to Robert McIlvaine, an Illinois
consultant who serves the industry. That accounts for nearly
one-third of all employees in the $67 billion U.S. chip industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay area,  &LR; Area, workers don bunny suits in sophisticated
development fabs run by companies such as Intel, Advanced Micro
Devices, National Semiconductor and LSI Logic. Most local fabs are
in Silicon Valley, near their companies' corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   While many workers in the industry are scientists and Ph.D.s
trying to make chips get faster, smaller and cheaper _ and put them
to use in everything from computers to clocks _ many other workers
are the average folks who don bunny suits and actually build the
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is where the rubber meets the road,'' said Halverson, who
has worked at the fab since it opened 15 years ago. ``This is where
we make the product that the company makes money on.''
</P>
<P>
   NEC Electronics is the U.S. chip-making arm of a giant Japanese
conglomerate. The $40 billion parent company is the second-largest
maker of computer chips in the world after Intel Corp. NEC
Electronics employs 1,600 people in Roseville. Of those, 800 work
in the fab.
</P>
<P>
   NEC is also building a new  &LR; $1.4 billion fab across the street
from the plant where Halverson works. The chips made in Roseville
go into every type of electronic product on the market today. NEC
uses them in computers, cell phones and hundreds of other products,
and it also sells them to other manufacturers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The plant produces more than 30,000 six-inch wafers per month,
and each wafer can contain hundreds of chips.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their importance to the industry, bunny suits were
largely unknown to the average person until Intel's blitz of TV
advertisements that featured break dancers in pastel space-age
bunny suits. But the ads didn't explain what they did, or why
they're in the suits.
</P>
<P>
   Clean rooms have been around since the 1940s and the early
nuclear labs, according to George Miller, editor of CleanRooms
magazine. When engineers found their gyroscopes were inaccurate,
the culprit ``was basically dust,'' he said. ``It just wasn't a
clean environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the chip industry's bunny-suited workers may be an
endangered species. McIlvaine, the industry consultant, said
automation will render the bunny suit obsolete in several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wafer fab of the future won't have people in bunny suits,
but robots handling wafers and moving from station to station,''
McIlvaine said.
</P>
<P>
   NEC's Roseville fab is already moving in that direction. ``You
want to remove the human factor,'' said Enrico Cano, a manager in
the process engineering department. Any time a person handles a
wafer, it could get contaminated or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Robots are already hard at work at NEC, only they're not the
sort of humanoid robots envisioned in ``Lost in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are simple small boxes, moving about on overhead tracks
like the trolley in ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,'' delivering wafers
to and from the fab. The wafers are shiny silicon disks, six inches
in diameter, on which the microchips are built.
</P>
<P>
   Other robots, bigger and boxier, glide along tracks on the
floor, moving blue boxes of wafers around the fab. One of these
robots chimes ``Mary Had A Little Lamb'' to keep people from
bumping into it as it goes about its business. It deposits the box
at a mechanized station, where another robot uses a suction cup arm
to open the box. Another arm then plucks out a wafer, looking like
an old-fashioned turntable arm ready to put its stylus to an album,
and sets it into some machinery.
</P>
<P>
   And what machinery: Each of those square machines may look like
a common dishwasher, but they can cost millions of dollars, and
they perform tasks of mind-boggling complexity.
</P>
<P>
   A single wafer goes through as many as 600 process steps,
involving more than 100 machines. It can take weeks before a wafer
is ready to be cut into chips and sent to market.
</P>
<P>
   The robots enable NEC's workers to wear a different breed of
bunny suits.
</P>
<P>
   The NEC bunny suits are not what Halverson called ``The Empire
Strikes Back'' variety. In those suits, which remain de rigeur in
90 percent of the country's 1,500 semiconductor clean rooms,
workers wear helmets and special apparatus filtering their every
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Such suits can take an hour to put on. But at NEC, workers wear
a polyester-type material (made by a North Carolina company called
Techstyles) that slips over their street clothes in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A room full of indistinguishable workers may look like the
ultimate totalitarian nightmare, but workers say it's actually very
democratic. ``You can wear a comic book T-shirt and be viewed as
totally professional if you act that way,'' Halverson said. ``You
are judged by how you perform and how you communicate, because
everybody's dressed the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The fab occupies most of the middle floor of the building; the
first and third floors are all part of an elaborate ventilation
system. Once inside the fab, it's not hard to see why: Signs
everywhere warn of toxic gases. Some particularly ominous pipes are
labeled ``Acid Exhaust.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no ``Dilbert'' cartoons tacked up in the fab _ only
signs warning of danger everywhere. Dangerous gases. Dangerous
voltages.
</P>
<P>
   But the workers, while keeping conscious of safety, don't show
signs of alarm. Even people in bunny suits like to have some fun.
Halverson describes people break dancing, and he said one criteria
for new employees is how well they sing. He describes one colleague
as ``the guy who can hit all the high notes in `Bennie and the
Jets.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such cheer belies the more difficult aspects of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tedious,'' said Steven McComb, who operates machines
known as steppers that expose the wafers to ultraviolet light.
``Sometimes you get little sores on your hands from the gloves.
Your boots get stinky. You can't chew gum in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Itches are difficult &UR;  &LR; to cope with, bathroom breaks are rare,
and, in Halverson's words, ``sneezing into your own face mask is
unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianna Petifer, a production operator, said the constant hum of
machinery and background music wears on her nerves. ``When I get
home, I can't stand any noise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Petifer, 51, doesn't complain. She has only a high school
degree and left a 10-year career in retail for the fab nine years
ago. ``I couldn't go anywhere else with the education I have and
make the money I do,'' she said. Workers in the fab make anywhere
from $13 to $35 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-hour shifts are a holdover from when it took an hour to
suit up. Many workers now prefer the long days, because it gives
them three days off. Every other week, they're paid overtime for
the long hours.
</P>
<P>
   As the day winds down, Petifer, McComb, Halverson and their
colleagues go to the locker room, slip out of their bunny suits and
head for home.
</P>
<P>
   While they rush for the door, the next shift arrives, having run
errands and slept during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your evenings are precious, and you've got to be a miser with
your time,'' Halverson said. ``When you get unsmocked, you've got
two or three hours, and then you need to get to sleep and get ready
for the next day.''

 Under a Bunny Suit, Hard-Working Dad

<P>
   &UR; By Dan Fost &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
A job inside a $1 billion chip fab involves complicated equipment
and knowledge of physics, chemistry and electronics. But it's also
a job that doesn't require any advanced degree.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it requires someone like Hank Halverson: hard-working,
dedicated, safety-conscious and eager to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Halverson is the sort of guy who's excited because he gets to
work with plasma _ a glowing material somewhere between a gas and a
liquid that's used in etching semiconductors. ``How many people can
say they've seen plasma?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Halverson, 37, lives two doors down from the house in which he
grew up, in nearby Carmichael. He earned his associate's degree
from American River College. He's worked at NEC Electronics'
Roseville plant since it opened 15 years ago in the bucolic town
 &LR; rapidly growing suburb 16 miles from Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   His ex-wife also works at the plant; together, he said, they
make ``the perfect tag-team parents'' for their 9-year-old son.
Hank works the 12-hour shift every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
every other Sunday, and his ex-wife works every Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and the Sundays that Hank doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Halverson makes in the neighborhood of $30 an hour, working
alternating weeks of 36 and 48 hours. Technicians start between
$12.67 and $19.32 an hour, according to a job posting on a bulletin
board.
</P>
<P>
   Halverson is so devoted to NEC that he's learned Japanese and
became a devotee of Japanese food. He dashes out for lunch at least
once a week to a local strip mall's Teriyaki to Go.
</P>
<P>
   Halverson can ramble on for 15 minutes describing the processes
of etching, doping and ion implantation. But his real gift is in
coining expressions to describe facets of his job. When he gets to
work, he takes off his street shoes and puts on ``shoes that have
never left the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the fab, people step on a sticky mat to remove any trace
materials their boots might have picked up in the locker room. He
calls this mat a ``roach motel.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first started work as a line maintenance technician, he
worried that the job title ``sounded awfully close to a janitor.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Halverson heads home and works out,
punching a speed bag and a heavy bag. It's important to stay in
shape for a job that has him on his feet 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter, he can go an entire day without seeing the sun.
</P>
<P>
   But in spring, when he steps outside, his allergies _ dormant
days while he's been working in one of the world's ultimate
allergen-free zones _ alert him to the change in environment.
</P>
<P>
   As he starts to sneeze, he said, ``I realize I've been in a
blessed place.''

 Protecting Credit Against Perils of Y2K
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Financial regulators remained confident last week that the vast
majority of the nation's banks will be prepared for the Year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as with everything surrounding Y2K, no one is willing to
bet the mortgage on it.
</P>
<P>
   So a nonprofit Internet debt counseling service offered a
checklist for consumers who are worried about protecting their
credit. Tips include getting backup credit cards and keeping paper
records of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fairly commonsense things that people should do even
though everyone says it will be all right,'' said Steve Rhode,
president and co-founder of the Debt Counselors of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would hurt just throwing your statements in a
box, saving them up so you have proof just in case there is a
problem. Consider it cheap insurance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K pundits say financial institutions recognized the problem
much sooner and have made more progress containing the Y2K problem
than government agencies or small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the biggest federal financial industry regulators,
including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Reserve
System and the National Credit Union Administration, agree
consumers should take some steps to protect themselves just in case
the Y2K problem causes glitches in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, those regulators issued a six-point ``Y2K Checklist
for Consumers.'' Every bank in the country is supposed to have free
copies available.
</P>
<P>
   The Debt Counselors of America, an online counseling agency in
Rockville, Md., covered the same ground, but with a more
comprehensive checklist. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _Starting in mid-1999, keep all paper records of bank
transactions, including ATM receipts, canceled checks and bank
statements. Rhode said he has encountered a surprising number of
bank customers who don't keep records or bother to balance their
checking accounts. But as the new year approaches, consumers
shouldn't rely solely on their bank to keep proper books, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _If you have a card that expires on or after Jan. 1, 2000,
consider getting a second card that expires in 2001 or later.
Merchants who aren't Y2K ready should be able to handle a card that
expires in a later year. Rhode cautions, however, that this no
excuse for consumers to max out another credit card and slip into
more debt.
</P>
<P>
   _Mail credit card bills due in the first weeks of January early,
in case there are problems with crediting payments or clearing
checks.
</P>
<P>
   _Ask your mortgage lender for a loan amortization schedule
several months before the end of the year, and keep track to see if
the payments are handled on schedule. The DCA notes the Federal
Trade Commission has suggested sending mortgage and loan payments
by certified mail for the months before and after Jan. 1, 2000, as
proof of the date the lender received payments.
</P>
<P>
   _Check your credit report before Sept. 9, 1999. Y2K watchers say
the date 9/9/99 could trigger older computer programs that used the
code ``99'' to signal ``end program'' or ``dump data.'' And check
again after New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   _Direct deposits and automatic transfers to pay bills should be
OK. The National Automated Clearing House Association, which
represents the four national operators that process automatic bank
transactions, reported last week that their systems have been
tested and are ready for Y2K. But Rhode said consumers should still
pay closer attention to automatic transactions before and after
January 1.
</P>
<P>
   The DCA's list is available for $2.50 online at
 &LR; www.getoutofdebt. &LR;   &LR; org &LR;  or for $5 by mail by writing to Debt
Counselors of America, Y2K Guide, P.O. Box 8587, Gaithersburg, Md.
20898-8587.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sth  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Y2K SCAMS: Several e-mail warnings making the rounds on the
Internet tell people to watch out for Y2K scams from con artists
posing as bank representatives.
</P>
<P>
   One warns of a phone caller who says he represents a bank that
is having Y2K problems, and gets the customer's account and Social
Security number to transfer money into a special account.
</P>
<P>
   Another warns of a caller from a securities company offering to
automatically transfer money from a checking or savings account
into a safe Y2K bond fund, then return the money on April 1, 2000.
Yet another warns of a man who obtains credit card numbers by
saying he needs to send out a new magnetic strip that is Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
   But John Stafford, a spokesman for the California Bankers
Association, said these e-mail warnings appear to be urban legends
since there have been no documented reports of customers losing
money after falling for the purported trickers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, whether real or not, Stafford said consumers
should heed the association's basic warning: Never give out bank
account or personal identification numbers to someone you don't
know.

CUT OIL DELIVERIES BY SEA TO YUGOSLAVIA, U.S. URGES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The United States wants NATO to plan ways of
blocking deliveries of oil to Yugoslavia by sea, allied officials
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Such deliveries have continued as allied warplanes have bombed
refineries and oil storage installations on land.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kosovo campaign is a war fought by committee, in this
case the 19-nation alliance, and NATO procedures first require a
plan acceptable to all. When the Americans requested a plan at a
closed-door meeting of allied delegates last week, they ran up
against objections from France.
</P>
<P>
   French officials questioned whether there was a legal basis to
stop and search ships without a new resolution from the U.N.
Security Council and expressed fears that such actions would widen
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes dispute illustrates the difficulties that
NATO military commanders have encountered trying to wage a military
campaign in which every new tactic must be approved by 19
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the
United States, wants to see the shipments stopped, Western
officials say. But NATO's military cannot do so unless the North
Atlantic Council, the political arm of the alliance, gives him the
authority first to plan and then to carry out an interdiction
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous to risk the lives of allied pilots by bombing
oil refineries and supplies in Yugoslavia when they are getting the
oil some other way,'' an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the allied bombing, the elimination of
Yugoslavia's oil supplies has been a major concern for the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the allies are not planning to use ground troops, they are
relying on air strikes to force Serbian forces out of Kosovo. A
major aim of the air campaign has been to destroy Yugoslavia's
ability to refine, store and transport fuel for its military.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said on Sunday, for instance, that allied planes had struck
the oil refinery at Novi Sad and that Yugoslavia no longer had the
ability to refine oil. Clark has also said 70 percent of
Yugoslavia's fuel-storage ability has been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have been taking other steps to cut off Yugoslavia's
fuel. A pipeline from Croatia has been cut. Hungary went so far as
to limit fuel supplies accompanying a Russian relief convoy.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslavia has been trying to compensate for the allied
attack by importing refined oil by sea. The ships delivering the
fuel are generally registered in countries like Panama, making it
difficult to determine where their shipments originated.
</P>
<P>
   A Western official who has access to classified intelligence
reports said about half a dozen tankers had docked at the port of
Bar in Montenegro since the conflict began. He said they carried
tens of thousands of metric tons of refined fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Clark alluded to the problem of the oil tankers in a news
conference on Tuesday, referring to President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia and using the military acronym for petroleum: ``We know
that there are other sources of supply that he's doing. He's
scrambling very hard to try to receive additional POL.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the allies would soon take steps to cut off the supply
from the tankers. ``I think that in coming days we'll see
additional measures, diplomatic and otherwise, taken to further
constrain his POL resources,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic efforts to cut off the supply, however, have not
gone smoothly at NATO, reflecting difference in the alliance about
the scope of the war.
</P>
<P>
   The United States asked the North Atlantic Council late last
week to authorize NATO military planners to develop plans to cut
off the supply. A separate decision by the council would be needed
to start the interdiction campaign after the plans were developed
and debated.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the French objections, however, the council
limited itself to asking the NATO military for a report on the
military implications of a maritime effort to step the flow of oil.
</P>
<P>
   In advancing their proposal, American officials argued that an
arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council should be
interpreted broadly to include a ban on fuel for the Yugoslav
military machine, according to allied officials. Further, American
officials noted, NATO began its air strikes against Yugoslavia
without seeking a U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also say stopping the shipments would be
militarily significant, because the Serbian military is now
hunkered down and not using much. That means a relatively small
amount of fuel can go a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the fuel that is now being delivered is already
refined, which makes it especially useful given the destruction of
Yugoslavia's oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
   France, however, has questioned whether NATO has the legal
authority to stop and search the ships. During the Bosnia conflict
in the mid-1990s, NATO stopped oil tankers from reaching
Yugoslavia, but it did so under the terms of a resolution
restricting trade with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   France also argued that to stop and search Panamanian and other
foreign ships at sea would broaden the military campaign, according
to allied diplomats familiar with the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, some French officials have questioned the military
utility of an oil embargo. They say that according to NATO
estimates, Yugoslav's military has anywhere from 30 to 90 days of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping shipments by oil tankers, the French say, might hurt
only civilians. In any case, they say, supplies of fuel are being
smuggled in from Romania and the Bosnian Serb Republic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reflecting the importance of the issue, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has pressed the request with allied officials,
according to her spokesman, James Rubin. One of the approaches
being discussed, Rubin said, ``includes visits and searches of
ships.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also raised the matter when he spoke recently
with President Jacques Chirac of France, according to a senior
Clinton administration official.
</P>
<P>
   A senior French official in Paris confirmed that the presidents
had spoken, but declined to say whether the conversation included
the subject of fuel shipments to Yugoslavia. ``This is not the time
for a public debate about war aims,'' the French official said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the alliance knows how to interdict oil supplies,
since it did so together with the Western European Union during the
Bosnia operation.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warships set up two pickets, supported by aircraft
patrols. The first, in the Adriatic, checked passing ships. If the
ships seemed suspicious, they were boarded in the Adriatic or
diverted to ports in Italy. Another line of warships took up
positions 12 miles off the coast of Yugoslavia, as a final line of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   One allied officer who took part in that operation said it had
required about 15 ships and was generally effective.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Protecting Credit Against Perils of Y2K
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Financial regulators remained confident last week that the vast
majority of the nation's banks will be prepared for the Year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as with everything surrounding Y2K, no one is willing to
bet the mortgage on it.
</P>
<P>
   So a nonprofit Internet debt counseling service offered a
checklist for consumers who are worried about protecting their
credit. Tips include getting backup credit cards and keeping paper
records of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fairly commonsense things that people should do even
though everyone says it will be all right,'' said Steve Rhode,
president and co-founder of the Debt Counselors of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would hurt just throwing your statements in a
box, saving them up so you have proof just in case there is a
problem. Consider it cheap insurance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K pundits say financial institutions recognized the problem
much sooner and have made more progress containing the Y2K problem
than government agencies or small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the biggest federal financial industry regulators,
including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Reserve
System and the National Credit Union Administration, agree
consumers should take some steps to protect themselves just in case
the Y2K problem causes glitches in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, those regulators issued a six-point ``Y2K Checklist
for Consumers.'' Every bank in the country is supposed to have free
copies available.
</P>
<P>
   The Debt Counselors of America, an online counseling agency in
Rockville, Md., covered the same ground, but with a more
comprehensive checklist. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _Starting in mid-1999, keep all paper records of bank
transactions, including ATM receipts, canceled checks and bank
statements. Rhode said he has encountered a surprising number of
bank customers who don't keep records or bother to balance their
checking accounts. But as the new year approaches, consumers
shouldn't rely solely on their bank to keep proper books, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _If you have a card that expires on or after Jan. 1, 2000,
consider getting a second card that expires in 2001 or later.
Merchants who aren't Y2K ready should be able to handle a card that
expires in a later year. Rhode cautions, however, that this no
excuse for consumers to max out another credit card and slip into
more debt.
</P>
<P>
   _Mail credit card bills due in the first weeks of January early,
in case there are problems with crediting payments or clearing
checks.
</P>
<P>
   _Ask your mortgage lender for a loan amortization schedule
several months before the end of the year, and keep track to see if
the payments are handled on schedule. The DCA notes the Federal
Trade Commission has suggested sending mortgage and loan payments
by certified mail for the months before and after Jan. 1, 2000, as
proof of the date the lender received payments.
</P>
<P>
   _Check your credit report before Sept. 9, 1999. Y2K watchers say
the date 9/9/99 could trigger older computer programs that used the
code ``99'' to signal ``end program'' or ``dump data.'' And check
again after New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   _Direct deposits and automatic transfers to pay bills should be
OK. The National Automated Clearing House Association, which
represents the four national operators that process automatic bank
transactions, reported last week that their systems have been
tested and are ready for Y2K. But Rhode said consumers should still
pay closer attention to automatic transactions before and after
January 1.
</P>
<P>
   The DCA's list is available for $2.50 online at
 &LR; www.getoutofdebt. &LR;   &LR; org &LR;  or for $5 by mail by writing to Debt
Counselors of America, Y2K Guide, P.O. Box 8587, Gaithersburg, Md.
20898-8587.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sth  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Y2K SCAMS: Several e-mail warnings making the rounds on the
Internet tell people to watch out for Y2K scams from con artists
posing as bank representatives.
</P>
<P>
   One warns of a phone caller who says he represents a bank that
is having Y2K problems, and gets the customer's account and Social
Security number to transfer money into a special account.
</P>
<P>
   Another warns of a caller from a securities company offering to
automatically transfer money from a checking or savings account
into a safe Y2K bond fund, then return the money on April 1, 2000.
Yet another warns of a man who obtains credit card numbers by
saying he needs to send out a new magnetic strip that is Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
   But John Stafford, a spokesman for the California Bankers
Association, said these e-mail warnings appear to be urban legends
since there have been no documented reports of customers losing
money after falling for the purported trickers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, whether real or not, Stafford said consumers
should heed the association's basic warning: Never give out bank
account or personal identification numbers to someone you don't
know.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Bits, bytes and buzz from the Spring Internet World show in Los
Angeles last week:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Video portal.  &LR; Consumers itching for an online glimpse of
Michael Jordan in his 1984 rookie year, or for a mid-1970s segment
of ``Meet the Press,'' may not have to wait long. AT&AMP;T Labs is
developing video technology that will let cybersurfers search
thousands of Web sites for video clips. (Virage, a San Mateo
startup, has already developed the first video search engine that,
like AT&AMP;T's solution, lets online users type in a phrase or keyword
and then view only the video segments associated with those words.)
</P>
<P>
   Expect AT&AMP;T in the next few months to sell the software to
commercial Web sites, which would use it to archive their video and
make it available to consumers. NBC, for example, might list every
episode of ``Meet the Press'' on its site for free or a nominal
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Digital video libraries are part of a movement to
video-on-demand as faster online services become available,
according to industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from text-based portals to multimedia portals,''
said Alan Schwartz, new market development director for AT&AMP;T in
Florham Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _E-commerce, e-commerce, e-commerce &LR; . Did anyone mention that
e-commerce was the talk of the show?
</P>
<P>
   The E-word was prominently displayed in most of the show's 600
booths, on plenty of the goofy promotional giveaways that
exhibitors pass out to consumers (get your e-commerce cap, here)
and on the minds of every executive in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than three years, the network has changed
everything,'' Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers proclaimed in a
keynote speech on Thursday. ``The business and government can't
overlook that.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, evidently, will consumers.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2003, Chambers predicted e-commerce sales worldwide
will top a whopping $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Colorizing the Web.  &LR; Sonnetech ( &LR; www.sonnetech.com &LR; ) isn't
colorblind to the importance of online catalog sales. The San
Francisco company _ noting that nearly a third of cybershoppers
renege on a purchase because the shade or hue of a product is in
doubt _ has concocted software technology for delivering ``true
Internet color.'' J.Crew ( &LR; www.jcrew.com &LR; ) is the first e-tailer to
make use of the new ChromaServe software.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Departures.  &LR; Industry insiders were whispering in the hallways
of the Los Angeles Convention Center about the exits of two major
figures in the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Homer, the fiery Netscape executive who ramrodded its
Netcenter portal site to success, told co-workers on Wednesday that
he is leaving on a six-week sabbatical, and at least one Netcenter
executive doubts he'll return. Homer's move isn't all that
surprising. Many expected him and others to move on following the
completion of America Online's $10.2 billion acquisition of
Netscape.

NEW UNIV. OF WASHINGTON RESEARCH INSTITUTE MELDS BIOLOGY,
MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The University of Washington and high-profile gene
hunter Dr. Leroy Hood have launched an ambitious new public-private
research institute aimed at capitalizing on the international
effort to decipher the entire human genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   Hood, a world-renowned player in the race to unravel the details
of human DNA, isn't shy about his latest exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the institute) will be a world leader in this new
kind of biology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Institute for Quantitative Systems Biology, the new
facility will operate as part of the University of Washington
School of Medicine but will be located off the Seattle campus, in
Seattle's South Lake Union area. Aiming for an annual budget of
$100 million, the institute will seek funding independently from
government, industry and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Hood, along with institute co-founders Dr. Reudi Aebersold, an
expert in protein chemistry, and Dr. Robert Franza, who specializes
in computational biology, are among those who see the future of
biology and medicine as going beyond identifying specific genes
related to disorders or disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project is a federally funded effort to
decipher and describe the entire human genetic code (i.e., the
``genome''). The federal project, started in 1990, together with
private gene-hunting companies and other international scientific
groups, seeks to identify the 60,000 to 100,000 genes in the human
body within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The UW's new genomics institute, like others recently launched
at Harvard and Princeton, is aimed at making use of the genetic
information as it is discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Few processes or disorders in the body are the result of a
single gene malfunctioning, Hood said. The key to making use of all
this new knowledge in human genetics, he explained, is to
understand how genes and their protein products all work together
as a network in the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity is becoming mind numbing,'' Dr. Shirley
Tilghman, Princeton molecular biologist, said in a recent Science
magazine article describing her university's new Institute for
Genomic Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed to handle this complexity, Hood and others say, is
a systems approach that marries biology, computer science,
mathematics and other disciplines. That's the approach embraced by
the UW's new institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institute researchers and collaborators will be at the
forefront in pioneering the emergence of the new discipline of
systems biology,'' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents the future of biomedical research,'' said Dr.
Paul Ramsey, dean of the University of Washington School of
Medicine. ``Ensuring the success of the institute is, and will
remain, among the School of Medicine's top priorities well into the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the lack of the kind of endowment funding that other
research universities such as Harvard have at their disposal, the
UW isn't putting a lot of its own money into this top priority.
Instead, the UW is depending upon Hood's ability to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I'm good at raising money,'' Hood said. ``We already
have a large partner in Monsanto,'' he noted, based on the
agrichemical company's interest in plant genomics.
</P>
<P>
   Given the institute's plan to further consummate the marriage of
computers and biology, Hood said maybe Microsoft would be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectually, this is incredibly exciting,'' he said. ``We'd
like to talk to Microsoft about becoming an industrial partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Hood, as the UW's William Gates III Professor of Biomedical
Sciences, may have an edge on others who seek Microsoft's money.
</P>
<P>
   He was lured to the UW in 1992, away from the California
Institute of Technology, because of a $12 million donation to the
UW from Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. The Gates donation created
the UW Department of Molecular Biotechnology for Hood.
</P>
<P>
   The task of rapidly sequencing DNA _ identifying it unit by unit
_ is an essential task of the Human Genome Project. The human
genome has perhaps as many as 100,000 genes, but each gene is
constructed of many units called ``base pairs'' and much of the
genome contains stretches of base pairs without genes. In total,
the entire human genome is believed to contain about 3 billion base
pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Hood, who with his colleagues at Caltech developed the
fundamental technologies allowing rapid automated sequencing of DNA
(the molecule that carries the hereditary information of living
cells), said he hopes the new UW institute will serve as a catalyst
for change in biology _ encouraging the kind of multidisciplinary
and scientific cross-fertilization that spawns innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision of what's fun in science is very global,'' Hood
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey acknowledged that the new institute involves not just a
new scientific vision but also a complicated inter-relationship
between the UW and its industrial partners. Protecting academic
integrity and resolving issues of intellectual property will be of
major importance, he said.

 _ SF CHRON   The Cyber-Sleuth Investigates Mysteries of Biology and Genetics 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Reader Geoff Noakes e-mailed me recently to ask that I suggest some
books or Web sites to help him explore the mysteries of
chromosomes, DNA and the other buzzwords of biology and genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff must've been reading my mind, because I've been struggling
myself lately, trying to recall long-buried high school and college
lessons as I pound out biotech stories on deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring there might be others besides Geoff and me who might be
classified as biologically challenged, I asked some of my more
erudite sources to help devise a study list.
</P>
<P>
   My good friend and personal scientific trainer, Dr. Bob Whitmore
of Martinez, turned me on to the aptly titled book ``The Science
Class You Wish You Had.'' This $14 trade paperback, written by
David and Arnold Brody, covers key concepts in chemistry and
astronomy as well as biology and genetics _ all in a simple, lucid
style that won't insult the learned or overawe the novice.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Mascarenhas, president of the biotech startup Protigen
Inc. and teacher of adult education classes in bioscience,
recommended several Web sites that cover the fundamentals of
biology and genetics. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _A Primer on Molecular Genetics, published by the Department of
Energy. Don't be frightened by the name. The site clearly and
simply defines terms like genome, ``The complete set of
instructions for making an organism.'' You can download the primer
at &LR;  www.bis.med.jhmi.edu/Dan/DOE/intro.html. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _If you're more a picture person, point your browser at Cells
Alive  &LR; (www.cellsalive.com) &LR;  for color images of microscopic
objects like swimming sperm cells and dividing bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   _Biology teachers (not to mention students) can find news and
activities at the Academic Excellence site  &LR; (www.gene.com/ae) &LR; 
maintained by Genentech, the South San Francisco biotech giant.
</P>
<P>
   _And if you come across a puzzling term, the University of
Texas's BioTech site  &LR; (biotech.icmb. &LR;   &LR; utexas.edu &LR;  contains a
useful dictionary and other resources.
</P>
<P>
   Last, but certainly not least, for employment or investment
information, longtime industry analyst Cynthia Robbins-Roth
recommends BioSpace  &LR; (www.biospace.com) &LR;  ``It's the best biotech
site around,'' she said. Based in San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch,
BioSpace offers a menu of breaking news, job listings and biotech
company profiles.
</P>
<P>
   THE PAYOFF:Lest you think all this scientific training might go
for naught, consider this: Of 100 biotech executives who made this
year's ``Molecular Millionaires'' list put out by Genetic
Engineering News, 89 held Ph.D.s or medical degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 15 years of publishing the list, we've never had more than
72 scientists on the list,'' said John Sterling, editor of the New
Yorktrade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine surveyed executives at several hundred U.S. biotech
firms, and based their net worth on SEC documents showing their
stock holdings. Academic credits came off their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, the list of Ph.D. Molecular Millionaires
includes: Chiron Corp. Chairman William Rutter ($62 million);
Alejandro Zaffaroni, founder of Alza Corp. ($51 million); and David
Schwartz, founder and president of Bio-Rad Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   California dominated the list, with 24 biotech millionaires,
followed by Massachusetts with 10. Maryland, New York and New
Jersey each put seven names on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling said the dominance of scientists in this year's ranking
_ in some years, as few as 35 Ph.D.s have made the grade _ showed
that a science education isn't incompatible with riches.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, maybe. But I wonder how the Molecular Millionaires
would stack up to the ever-growing list of Internet whiz kids. I
used to cover them, and there were plenty who earned their riches
with little more than a working knowledge of how to make PowerPoint
presentations.

ROUGH HOMETOWN DEBUT FOR METS' WATSON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was as if Manager Bobby Valentine could see it
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game against the Montreal Expos, Valentine was
asked what he was looking for from Allen Watson, his Queens-born
left-hander, who would be making his first start for the Mets a few
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping he can get over the initial period that he will
probably be experiencing,'' Valentine said. ``He's starting his
first game of the season here at Shea Stadium. He's from the area.
So, I'm sure there's going to be some excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   By time Watson had thrown eight pitches, appearing in front of
his father and three dozen family members and friends, there was
excitement indeed, but it was generated by the Expos' batters. Two
pitches in, Montreal had a 2-0 lead. And after eight pitches, the
Mets were down, 3-0. The Expos coasted to a 4-2 victory as the Mets
closed out their homestand.
</P>
<P>
   On Watson's first pitch of the game, Orlando Cabrera grounded a
single. On his second pitch, Watson (1-1) went to a slide-step
delivery to keep Cabrera close at first. But Watson left a fastball
up and Jose Vidro slammed it some 418 feet to dead center field for
a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Six pitches later, on a 2-2 count, the next batter, Rondell
White, drilled a changeup inside the left-field foul pole for a
home run. The Expos added another run in the second on a one-out,
bad-hop single by pitcher Javier Vazquez, an opposite-field double
flared to right by Cabrera and a line-drive sacrifice fly by Vidro.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two home runs from John Olerud _ one in the first inning
and one in the fourth _ the Mets couldn't recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so quick,'' said Watson, who finally gathered enough
composure to last seven innings. ``Maybe I was a little jumpy, a
little anxious, and that's why I left that ball to Vidro up. But I
was getting better and better as the game went along.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his last five innings, Watson scattered three singles. But
by that time, it was too late. Later, Watson _ who allowed nine
hits and four runs with one walk and two strikeouts over his seven
innings _ said he did not want to offer any excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't like to get beat with something you're working
on,'' Watson said, referring to the slide-step delivery he has
added this year. ``That was my mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said his mother, Dorothea, was at his parents' home in
the Middle Village section of Queens because she becomes too
nervous when he pitches. Watson's father, Allen, was behind home
plate. Watson was asked if he looked over at his father after
allowing the consecutive home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Watson said. ``He probably left.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury-depleted Mets did not have a lineup that could come
back for Watson. Mike Piazza was on the disabled list, Rickey
Henderson was still unavailable because of a tight right hamstring
and Brian McRae was undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging test in
Manhattan that determined he had a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez (1-1) came into the game with a 7.00 ERA, but
surrendered just five hits, including both of Olerud's homers, in
seven innings. And after Ugueth Urbina pitched the final one and a
third innings for his third save, the Expos had taken two of three
from the Mets this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mets had opened the season by going 8-5 against two
teams that found success against them last year, the Expos and the
Florida Marlins. And by going 4-3 against Montreal the first two
weeks, the Mets equaled the number of victories they had against
the Expos all last year, when Montreal took the season series, 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' next six games are at Cincinnati and Chicago. Not
until June will they have to face the Marlins, and not until July
will they see the Expos (6-7) again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm glad I'm through with those two teams,'' Valentine
said, factoring in the eight games the Mets and Expos also played
during spring training and the four exhibitions the Mets and
Marlins played before the season began. ``I think they were sick of
seeing us and we were sick of seeing them.''
</P>
<P>
   As John Franco put it, ``Now it will feel like spring training's
finally over.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most overrated fighter of all time? Muhammad
Ali?
</P>
<P>
   The Ring magazine published its extensive reader's poll in its
latest issue. Some of the results were ridiculous, such as the
notion that Ali wasn't as good as we've believed all these years.
Some were right on, that Ray Robinson was the greatest fighter of
all time, for example. All are great fodder for argument.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the results of the poll (begin ital)and(end ital) the
Daily News' take on each question:
</P>
<P>
   Best fighter pound-for-pound today: Readers _ Roy Jones Jr.
(52.5 percent of readers believe Jones is No.1). Daily News _
Jones. Just because there's no one for him to fight doesn't mean
he's not the best.
</P>
<P>
   Greatest fighter pound-for-pound of all time: Readers _ Robinson
(62.4 percent). DN _ Robinson. It should've been 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greatest heavyweight of all time: Readers _ Ali (51.9 percent).
DN _ Joe Louis. He had (begin ital)25(end ital) title defenses from
1937 to 1948, an unparalleled championship reign, and suffered two
of his three losses only after coming out of retirement because he
needed money.
</P>
<P>
   Most entertaining fighter today: Readers _ Arturo Gatti. DN _
Gatti. The problem is he won't last long fighting with such
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Least entertaining fighter today: Readers _ Chris Byrd (15.6
percent). DN _ Pernell Whitaker. He should be bottled as a cure for
insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Most entertaining fighter of all time: Readers _ Ali. DN _ Ali.
It was more his personality than what he brought into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Least entertaining fighter of all time: Readers _ Whitaker (10.7
percent). Daily News _ Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   Most underrated fighter today: Readers _ Chris Byrd (7.2
percent). DN _ Johnny Tapia. The WBA bantamweight champion is
undefeated in 47 fights for a reason: He's a great boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Most overrated fighter today: Readers _ Naseem Hamed (25.4
percent). DN _ Hamed. He should be commended for creating the
illusion that he's a great fighter. That's where his genius lies.
</P>
<P>
   Most overrated fighter of all time: Readers _ Ali (17 percent).
DN _ Mike Tyson. Those who weren't afraid of him gave him trouble.
He was a good, not great, heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   Most underrated fighter of all time: Readers _ Ezzard Charles
(8.2 percent). DN _ Larry Holmes. He had a Louis-like lock on the
division but had the misfortune of succeeding Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest puncher today: Readers _ Tyson. DN _ Tyson. Even now, no
one can end a fight more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Best jab today: Readers _ Ike Quartey (30.2 percent). Daily News
_ Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Best left hook today: Readers _ Oscar De La Hoya (21.2 percent).
DN _ De La Hoya. He doesn't have one-punch knockout power in it,
but it destroys opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Most courageous fighter today: Readers _ Gatti (48.4 percent).
Daily News _ Gatti. He has (begin ital)too much(end ital) courage
for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   Best right hand today: Readers _ Lennox Lewis. DN _ Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Best infighter today: Readers _ Evander Holyfield (20.3
percent). DN _ Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Best defense today: Readers _ Whitaker. DN _ Jones. Whitaker
didn't display such great defense against Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Best body puncher today: Readers _ Jones (16.3 percent). DN _
Shane Mosley. The runner-up to Jones in best pound-for-pound
fighter category has a great body of work.
</P>
<P>
   Fastest hands today: Readers _ Jones (48.9 percent). DN _ Floyd
Mayweather. If there were a way to measure it, it'd be no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Best footwork today: Readers _ Roy Jones (23.2 percent). DN _
Mosley. He's always balanced, always in position to throw power
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Best chin today: Readers _ Holyfield (14.5 percent). Daily News
_ Julio Cesar Chavez. He's not the fighter, he was but he still
can't be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest underachiever today: Readers _ Michael Moorer (9.8
percent). DN _ Jose Luis Lopez. His reported lack of discipline
could deprive the world of a great fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest overachiever today: Holyfield (36.6 percent). DN _
Holyfield. He turned himself into one of the better heavyweights of
all time through remarkable dedication and determination.
</P>
<P>
   Best trainer today: Readers _ Emanual Steward (32.2 percent). DN
_ Steward. No one is more coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Worst trainer today: Readers _ Teddy Atlas (13.3 percent). DN _
Who trains Hamed?
</P>
<P>
   Best promoter today: Readers _ Don King (38.9 percent). DN _
King. In terms of the actual promotion, no one does it better.
</P>
<P>
   Worst promoter today: Readers _ King (66.8 percent). DN _ King.
In terms of the disastrous impact he has on the integrity of the
sport, this is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Best referee today: Readers _ Mills Lane (63.4 percent). DN _
Mitch Halpern. Lane is retired.
</P>
<P>
   Worst referee today: Readers _ Richard Steele (40.9 percent). DN
_ Steele. The memories of past debacles linger.
</P>
<P>
   Best blow-by-blow commentator today: Readers _ Jim Lampley (52.9
percent). DN _ Lampley. No contest.
</P>
<P>
   Best color commentator today: Readers _ Larry Merchant (21
percent). DN_ Merchant. Former fighters know more about the game,
but no one can provide the perspective Merchant does.
</P>
<P>
   Worst color commentator today: Readers _ Merchant (21.8
percent). DN _ George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Best ring announcer today: Readers _ Michael Buffer (63.5
percent). DN _ Jimmy Lennon Jr. He relies on a wonderful voice and
class rather than a gimmick, Buffer's ready-to-rumble signature
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Most enticing possible matchup: Readers _ De La Hoya-Trinidad
(41.2 percent). DN _ De La Hoya-Trinidad. Runners-up:
Mayweather-Mosley and Mayweather-Hamed (just to see Hamed lose).
</P>
<P>
   Most competitive division today: Readers _ welterweight (76.8
percent). DN _ welterweight. De La Hoya, Trinidad, Quartey, Page,
Whitaker, Lopez, Forrest. It's hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Fighter who should retire: Readers _ Roberto Duran (24.4
percent). DN _ Duran. Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the top pound-for-pound fighter in five years?

NATO SAID TO HIT PLANTS OWNED BY MILOSEVIC ASSOCIATES
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive) 
(rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT AND STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In listing its bombing targets in Yugoslavia, NATO
has generally described them as facilities that feed Slobodan
Milosevic's war machine. What the Pentagon does not usually say is
that some of the refineries and factories have also been chosen as
targets because they are run by cronies of the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, according to senior NATO and Pentagon officials, is to
undermine Milosevic's control by chipping away at his system of
political and economic patronage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't care if his soldiers die in Kosovo, as long as he
stays in power,'' one senior military officer said of Milosevic.
``But if you blow up some things near and dear to him _ or to
somebody close to him _ then that could have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   While NATO's bombing seems to have solidified popular support
for Milosevic, the officials said they hope the attacks against
some of the targets will turn loyal supporters against him by
destroying their own sources of wealth and power.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's oil and gas industry, for example, has suffered
enormously under NATO's strikes. While the stated aim of those
attacks has been to choke off fuel to the armed forces operating in
Kosovo, the strikes must also be a blow to Dragan Tomic, the
director of Yugo Petrol, who as speaker of the federal Parliament
in Belgrade, is a close ally of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, a missile strike destroyed the Zastava automotive
plant in Kragujevac. Its director, Milan Beko, has served under
Milosevic as minister of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Four days earlier, NATO struck a tobacco factory and warehouse
in Nis, and damage to tobacco factories has been reported in other
cities. According to American intelligence reports, a major player
in Yugoslavia's tobacco distribution is Milosevic's son, Marko.
</P>
<P>
   So far, economic and industrial targets have made up only a
small portion of NATO's targets. Of the roughly 200 targets
attacked since the air war began on March 24, only a dozen have
been strictly industrial sites, like factories. That percentage
grows when those targets are combined with fuel storage and
ammunition factories.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO presses on with bombing that has done little to stop the
purging of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, some NATO and Pentagon
military leaders have advocated striking still more economic and
industrial targets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   These commanders, including the alliance's supreme commander,
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, believe that NATO has to escalate its efforts
to undermine Milosevic's 11 1/2-year grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue sustaining this air campaign and intensifying
it in a way that he sees he is slowly but surely starting to lose
those instruments of power that keep him in power, then he's going
to have to make a decision,'' Secretary of Defense William Cohen
testified on Capitol Hill last week.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, disclosed that NATO's political leaders had not yet
approved a small group of targets that he grouped together under
the objective ``decimate.'' He said NATO warplanes could begin
striking such targets ``in a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton declined to identify those targets, but the highly
classified list includes additional industrial and economic sites,
according to a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking those targets would carry a much higher risk of
civilian casualties and would cause the kind of profound disruption
of day-to-day life for ordinary Yugoslavs that NATO has so far
sought to avoid, that official said.
</P>
<P>
   Such strikes could also undercut NATO's stated rationale for its
bombing: to degrade the military and police forces involved in the
killings in Kosovo rather than wage war on the people of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Pentagon and NATO are looking for ways to
intensify pressure on Milosevic's government. ``We're trying to
make the price higher and higher,'' a senior defense official said.
``And there are lots of ways to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While not aiming directly for Milosevic, American and NATO
officials say they are targeting what they describe as his four
pillars of power: the political machine, the media, military and
security forces, and the economic system.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American military officer said the targets on NATO's
list included strikes at ``the things that keep him afloat.'' The
idea, the officer said, is to instill fear in those whose economic
standing depends on Milosevic, to make them think ``we didn't
bargain for this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can achieve that mindset, then who knows what will
happen?'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes and cruise missiles have struck half a dozen
targets considered to be part of the ``national command
authority,'' several of them in and around Belgrade. These include
headquarters and bunkers believed to be used by political and
military leaders _ although it is not clear whether anybody was
killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia's state-run economy, virtually any industrial or
economic activity can be linked to Milosevic's government. Ever
since the former Yugoslavia collapsed into its rump state today,
and the economy was hit from 1992 to 1995 by comprehensive
sanctions, Milosevic, a former banker and Communist bureaucrat, has
been able to tighten his control of the little business left.
</P>
<P>
   The core elements of the economy _ including agriculture, fuel,
manufacturing and exports and imports _ are operated by Milosevic's
cronies virtually as fiefs, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has used funds gained from industry and his cronies
mostly to finance an effective security apparatus to maintain
political control, according to experts and intelligence estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But his family and associates also have benefited, living far
more lavishly than most Yugoslavs, whose standard of living has
declined markedly since the country began its bloody breakup in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook last week challenged
Milosevic to admit to his people that he has bought three villas in
Greece. European media reports also have spoken of the family
funneling money to Swiss banks through French accounts held by
Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's son, Marko, is also said to profit from his
position; his holdings are believed to include a discotheque and a
tobacco distribution network. Before the war, Yugoslav media
reported that he had announced plans to open a Disney-style theme
park, called Bambiland.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials have estimated damage from the bombing as
high as $100 billion, including damage to roads, destroyed bridges
and railways which has the ripple effect of disrupting commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no signs that Milosevic has lost the backing of
his key supporters.
</P>
<P>
   One American government official familiar with the Yugoslav
economy said the prospects were slim that Milosevic's cronies,
however battered, would turn on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scenario that would involve these guys acting as a group
seems fairly unlikely,'' the official said. ``They don't have
anywhere to turn besides Milosevic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic appoints the executives of each of the country's
monopolies, many of whom also serve as government ministers. Dejan
Kovacevic, the minister of construction, also heads Mastrogradnje,
one of the country's largest construction firms. Zivota Kosic, the
minister of energy and mining, also heads a natural resources
concern called Duvanksa Industrija Nis. Nis is southern Serbia's
largest city, and has been a repeated target of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Another state-run industry that has been severely disrupted is
ammunition production, which is overseen by an umbrella
organization headed by Maj. Gen. Jovan Cekovic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the industry has a clear military function, it has also
historically provided Yugoslavia with hard currency, and the
destruction of the plants has crippled another source of profits
for people close to Milosevic, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and NATO officials declined to provide a list of
economic or industrial targets that have been struck. But
Yugoslavia's official news agencies have reported strikes against
several, in addition to oil depots and refineries. They include a
small-plane manufacturer in Pancevo, a construction-equipment plant
in Krusevac and a plastics factory in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   NATO maintains that each of its targets has military value, even
if some have a benign civilian use, too. For example, NATO has
repeatedly struck a plant in Cacak that Yugoslav officials
portrayed as an appliance factory. Reporters allowed to tour the
scene described vacuum cleaners in various states of destruction.
Western officials say the plant also included a subterranean
ammunition section.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's targets are chosen by military aides to Clark in
Brussels, Germany and Italy. These targeting officials work closely
with a little known cell within the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the
Pentagon, called J-2T, where officers consider a range of technical
aspects, including which weapon is the most effective for a
particular mission and where exactly it should be aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The planners weigh the military value of a target against the
drawbacks, namely the risk to pilots if the target is in a heavily
defended area and the risk to civilians if it is in a heavily
populated area.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the Pentagon and at NATO's headquarters in Belgium
review each target carefully to justify striking it. Hitting
industrial and economic sites requires walking a fine line, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Planners have been restricted by NATO's political process..
Cohen said President Clinton, like leaders of other major NATO
countries, reviews the target list, considering ``the political
consequence of hitting a particular target.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insist the bombing, which continued for a 26th
day Sunday, is taking a toll, wearing down Yugoslav materiel,
supplies and resolve. But the political process has kept some
targets off the list.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has sought approval _ so far unsuccessfully _ to attack
another of the pillars of Milosevic's support: the communications
industry. Control of radio and television has been a mainstay of
the Yugoslav leader's 11 1/2 years in power. One radio station is
even owned by his daughter, Marija.

FLORIDA RAIN FAILS TO REMOVE THREAT OF FIRES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (jw)

<P>
   MIAMI _ A hard but all too brief rain helped bring a major brush
fire in the Everglades under control Sunday, as firefighters
steeled themselves for what forecasters have predicted to be
another hot, dry week in Florida's wildfire season.
</P>
<P>
   Though the wildfire still burned alongside Alligator Alley, the
interstate highway that links Miami and Fort Lauderdale with the
western coast of Florida, firefighters said that it was under
control and posed no threat to residents.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which had consumed about 50,000 acres and was expected
to consume thousands more before burning itself out, shut down the
east-west highway, Interstate 75, for much of Saturday and Sunday
and caused traffic snarls on both coasts before the midday rain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most eerie effect of the wildfire was felt in Miami,
where the smoke, combined with a Saturday storm that brought wind
but little rain, sent a dark cloud rolling across the city and
surrounding communities. People walked the street with scarves,
rags and their shirts tied over their mouths, and police
switchboards were flooded with calls from people who were afraid
their neighborhoods were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   But in just over an hour the dark cloud had moved out of Miami
and other cities here in the southern tip of the peninsula, blown
out to sea by winds. Residents were comparing the cloud to Los
Angeles smog.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wasilewski, a 46-year-old biologist, was driving home to
Miami from Palm Beach when the cloud rolled across the Florida
Turnpike near the border between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.
``It was as thick as I've ever seen it,'' Wasilewski said.
``Traffic slowed down pretty much to a crawl. Visibility was only
50 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief rain that fell Sunday on South Florida _ some areas,
including Coral Gables, had rain and drizzle for more than an hour
_ were not expected to save the state from more fires in the coming
week. But firefighters around the state appreciated the break,
however brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quiet right now,'' said Jim Karels, assistant chief of
the Florida Fire Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,500 fires _ many believed the work of arsonists _ have
consumed about 109,000 acres this year, state officials said. The
hardest-hit area has been Port St. Lucie, north of Palm Beach,
where 43 homes have been destroyed. Fires last year burned about
500,000 acres, and caused $400 million in damage.

YANKEES' POOR PLAY RESULTS IN SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The cold and cracked steel and cement of Tiger Stadium
are 88 years old, and echoes rattle here, like lockers in a high
school hallway. ``Sweep,'' somebody in the small crowd yelled in
the bottom of the eighth inning Sunday, a concept that sounded so
hollow and outdated that a minute or two passed before others
joined in the chant. And then they were all yelling.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1988, the Tigers completed a three-game
sweep of the New York Yankees here, winning Sunday's game by 5-1.
And it is true that Detroit outperformed the Yankees all weekend,
pitching well and getting hits in crucial moments. Dave Mlicki
(1-0) threw five strong innings Sunday afternoon, Mel Rojas pitched
out of a jam in the seventh, and Tony Clark bashed a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that the Yankees (7-5) played poorly again in
their fourth consecutive defeat, the conclusion to a week's worth
of bad baseball. They were one for 20 with runners in scoring
position in three games against Detroit (5-7), and committed five
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, whose third-inning throwing error led to two
runs, said ``it's not really fair'' to compare and contrast the
Yankees of '99 with the extraordinary Yankees of '98. Fair or not,
the comparisons are inevitable:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have made seven errors during the four-game losing
streak; they did not commit seven errors over any four-game span
last year. The fewest runs they scored in any three-game span last
year was six; they scored three in the last three games. The bottom
third of their order, so instrumental to their success in 1998, has
been an offensive abyss this season. Scott Brosius batted .125
before spraining his ankle, Jorge Posada is hitting .105 and Ricky
Ledee .091. Collectively, the Nos. 7, 8 and 9 hitters in their
lineup are batting .163.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez has two runs batted in. The bullpen has an ERA of
5.27. The Yankees have stolen five bases; they swiped 24 in the
first 12 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, shortstop Derek Jeter said, do not care that the
Yankees won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come out to play,'' he said. ``We expect to win, expect
to win every day we come out. We just haven't scored any runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Paul O'Neill said: ``It's not a lack of effort.
When things aren't going well, they always say, `Well, they're
letting down.' We're not letting down. We got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   But they have beat themselves, over and over. After playing
errorless baseball in the first week of the season, they did not
play well in the first two games against Baltimore last week and
won anyway. Then their mistakes began strangling them. Jeter
dropped a pop-up Friday, and on Saturday Knoblauch was thrown out
at third with nobody out and Jeff Nelson made a pivotal two-base
throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied, 1-1, in the third inning Sunday. Detroit's
Deivi Cruz hustled to beat out an infield single leading off, Brian
Hunter bunted him to second, and then Ramiro Mendoza (1-1) walked
Gregg Jefferies and gave up a single to Bobby Higginson. Bases
loaded, one out.
</P>
<P>
   With Clark, a slow-footed slugger, at the plate, Mendoza, a
sinkerball pitcher, wanted to get a ground ball and a double play.
Clark hit into 16 double plays last year. Sure enough, Clark hit
the ball on the ground, up the middle; Mendoza managed to tip the
ball with his glove, and Jeter fielded it and flipped to Knoblauch,
who stepped on second and turned and fired toward first. A double
play would have ended the inning; the rally would have been over.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch's throw sailed high, tailing to the left and away
from Martinez, who reached and tried to maintain contact on the
first-base bag with a pointed toe.
</P>
<P>
   He could either catch the ball or keep his foot on the base: The
ball glanced off the webbing of his glove, rolling away, and Cruz
and Jefferies scored. ``I turned it the best I could,'' said
Knoblauch, charged with his third error in six games, ``and the
throw wasn't perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said: ``I should've just come off and tagged him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Stadium is a hitter's paradise. Left-handed batters easily
and often hit balls that span the short distance to the right-field
stands, and yet the Yankees were almost completely stifled. Bernie
Williams was one for 12 in the series, and in three days, the
Yankees did not get an RBI from the Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 spots in
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Angry with the losing, O'Neill nearly snapped in his final
at-bat of the series, arguing briefly when Joe Brinkman, the plate
umpire, called strikes on him and, when he grounded out, screaming
at Brinkman all the way to first base.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was 0 for 11 in the series, stranding seven runners in
scoring position and prompting Don Zimmer, the interim manager, to
employ an old trick he sometimes uses with his fellow Cincinnatian.
When O'Neill complains how badly he is swinging, how he should just
quit and go home, Zimmer looks at him with the straightest of faces
and says, ``If you really feel that way, I've got a friend who owns
a cement-block company back in Cincinnati, and he could set you up
with a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees continue playing this badly and the frustration
keeps mounting, the employee rolls of a certain cement-block
company could swell.

 &HT;    Braves air out 20-5 win
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Braves had one last day to put the thin air of
Coors Field to good use. They took advantage of it, embarrassing
the Colorado Rockies 20-5 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored the most runs in 42 years of franchise history
and acted like they didn't want to leave. Ten of those runs came in
the ninth, Atlanta's biggest inning of this decade. The Braves took
out any leftover frustration of two postponements and a
ninth-inning loss, and leave here for Los Angeles in an awfully
good mood.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hitting coach Don Baylor got a little sweet revenge on
the team that fired him as manager as the Braves lineup put on a
hitting clinic and Greg Maddux got plenty of run support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremendous,'' said Maddux of the most productive day by a
Braves offense since they were playing in Milwaukee and scoring 23
runs on the Cubs in 1957. ``That's a good month right there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves put a five-homer hurting on the Rockies and finished
with 24 hits. Eleven different Braves had hits, led by Andruw Jones
and Eddie Perez, who each had a career-high five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not played particularly well the first 10 games of the
year,'' said Chipper Jones, one of five Atlanta players to go deep
and the one to go deepest with a 431-foot shot. ``We needed a game
like this where everybody contributes. You know the next series we
have is going to be a pretty tough-pitched series. We've got some
guys going in with some confidence offensively.'' Brian Jordan
started the outburst in the first inning with an opposite-field
ride to right. The two-run shot was his third of the season. Two
innings later, Andruw Jones hit his first home run of the season,
for three runs and a 6-0 lead on Pedro Astacio.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Chipper Jones smashed a 1-0 offering from
left-hander Bobby Jones into the last row of seats in the
left-field stands. In only 14 at-bats against left-handers this
year, the switch-hitter has matched his home run total from the
right side last season with two and has three overall.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Randall Simon, starting in place of an
injured Ryan Klesko for the second consecutive game, came through
with the first home run of his major-league career.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter capped it off with a pinch-hit two-run homer in the
ninth, starting the 10-run inning, the biggest ever in this
ballpark by a Rockies opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a veteran ball club,'' Colorado center fielder Darryl
Hamilton said. ``If the veterans aren't embarrassed by this, then
something's wrong with them. I know I'm embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Jim Leyland was just glad it ended.

 &HT;    Tire-less drive gets Andretti win
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Petty Enterprises kicked off its 50th
anniversary season on April 7 with a gala at its racing shop in
Level Cross, N.C., but stock-car racing's first family saved the
fireworks for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti, winless in his first 40 starts with the Richard
Petty-owned No. 43 Pontiac, stunned the field Sunday in the Goody's
Body Pain 500 at Martinsville Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, who started 21st, spun out only 49 laps into the race
after getting tapped from behind by Ward Burton, causing Andretti
to lose a lap when a caution flag was not thrown.
</P>
<P>
   But Andretti, a former open-wheel racer, later regained the lap,
then threw himself into contention with a gutsy call during the
final pit stop. He passed Burton with only three laps left and beat
him to the finish by 1.066 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so mad it was too hard for me to deal with to even think
about winning,'' Andretti said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was only the second of Andretti's seven-year Winston
Cup career and snapped a 57-race winless streak. It was Petty
Enterprises' first trip to victory lane since Bobby Hamilton won at
North Carolina Speedway in October 1997, snapping a string of 42
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good weekend,'' said Petty, NASCAR's career
winningest driver with 200 career victories. ``We got behind, got a
lap down and were able to make that back up. That was a heck of a
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, who jumped six spots to 14th in the points standings,
regained his lap when he passed Jeff Gordon on lap 135. Andretti
stayed in front of the two-time defending Winston Cup champion
until a caution flag was thrown on lap 184.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti still faced huge odds, as he was 11th with only 120
laps remaining. But he joined the leaders four laps later, when his
crew gambled and changed only two tires during a yellow-flag pit
stop. The move allowed Andretti to take fourth place, behind
Gordon, Mark Martin and Burton, who all took four tires during the
stop.
</P>
<P>
   None of the drivers anticipated running the final 116 laps on
those tires, but that's what happened as the rest of the race was
finished without a caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do that because I kept getting caught up in the
back,'' Andretti said. ``I kept using my car up so much and having
to miss crashes. The car has a lot of damage on it, but the nose is
clean and that's all that is important.''
</P>
<P>
   After the final pit stop, Andretti lost fourth place to Rusty
Wallace. But Andretti started his move with about 50 laps
remaining, passing Martin and Wallace for third.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti eventually caught Gordon with only 12 laps left, and
then closed on Burton, moving door-to-door with the No. 99 Ford
with only six laps remaining. After the pair circled the half-mile
oval side-by-side for three laps, Andretti pushed his Pontiac ahead
in turn 4 of lap 297.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't much of a battle,'' Burton said. ``He was that much
better than we were. They came from the back and had the best car
and they deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton finished second, and his points lead over Dale Jarrett
increased to 85. Gordon was third, followed by Mike Skinner and
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and that Petty team have run well here many times,''
Gordon said. ``He was tough early on, but he got a lap down.
Somebody needed to keep him a lap down because I knew he was going
to be a threat at the end, and he certainly showed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart were
early factors in the race, but hard luck caught up with both of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a rookie who earned his first pole in Friday's
qualifying, had problems from the start. Immediately after the
green flag fell, Stewart's No. 20 Pontiac wasn't up to speed and
quickly fell to sixth. After two laps, Stewart dropped to 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setup errors, Stewart was able to stay on the lead
lap through the first half of the race, although he never
challenged the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's real troubles came on lap 267, when Jimmy Spencer
bumped the rear of Kenny Irwin's No. 28 Ford on the back
straightaway. The tap set Irwin's car on top of the inside wall,
and the pileup also collected the No. 7 Chevy of Michael Waltrip
and the No. 45 Pontiac of Rich Bickle. Stewart couldn't clear the
accident, as he rear-ended Andretti, who slammed on his brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's car sustained significant damage, but he was able to
return to the track without a hood and remained on the lead lap
until lap 379. Stewart, who had a strong outing negated by a wreck
for the second race in a row, finished 20th, but jumped two spots
to 10th in points.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who was running seventh with 260 laps completed, was
able to avoid the wreck that caused Stewart's demise, but
mechanical problems in his No. 18 Pontiac creeped up about the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte pitted during the 12-lap caution caused by Irwin's
wreck. But Labonte's failed power steering couldn't be fixed, so
the Pontiac was nearly impossible to turn for Labonte, who's
recovering from a broken right shoulder suffered at Darlington a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte finished two laps down and finished 24th. He now trails
Burton by 184 points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jeremy Mayfield, who came into Martinsville ninth in
points and 212 behind Burton, took the biggest hit of any driver.
Only eighth laps into the race, Mayfield's No. 12 Ford spun out
between turns 1 and 2 and he fell one lap down. On lap 80, Mayfield
and Rick Mast spun out in turn 4. By lap 200, Mayfield already
trailed the leaders by 29 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield finished 41st, falling three spots in points and 347
behind Burton.

 &HT;    McDonald's still Elliott's car sponsor
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Winston Cup veteran Bill Elliott seems to
have McDonald's secured as a sponsor through at least next season,
but the Dawsonville native is hinting at changes for his No. 94
Ford team.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Observer, citing unnamed sources, reported
Saturday that McDonald's was considering pulling its sponsorship
from Elliott's car. The newspaper said the fast-food chain might
move its sponsor dollars to the No. 25 Chevy of Wally Dallenbach or
the No. 28 Ford of Kenny Irwin next year, or pull out of NASCAR
racing altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Korbus, McDonald's motorsports manager, disputed the
report on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to unfounded reports, McDonald's is committed to Bill
Elliott Racing with its current sponsorship agreement through the
year 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who hasn't climbed higher than 18th in points in his
24th season on the circuit, says he isn't concerned about
speculation surrounding his team. But Elliott, one of only five
owner-drivers left in Winston Cup, agrees that his teams needs a
facelift.
</P>
<P>
   Like veteran Ricky Rudd, Elliott wants to get away from the
growing business aspects of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that multi-cars are the way to go,'' Elliott
said. ``I've been there, and that didn't work, for whatever reason.
We've got to take this a step at a time, and right now I'm just
concentrating on this team and making it run better, and getting my
organization working better. Yes, I need to restructure. I don't
argue that point. You just have to keep changing things until it
all comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott finished 30th on Sunday, after falling two laps down
before 100 were completed at Martinsville Speedway. He slipped to
21st in points, trailing leader Jeff Burton by 482.
</P>
<P>
   Rebound for Petree
</P>
<P>
   Elliott wasn't the only owner disheartened by his early-season
effort before Sunday's race.Andy Petree, in his fourth year as a
Winston Cup owner, said he was displeased with the performance of
his Nos. 33 and 55 Chevy teams, driven by Ken Schrader and Kenny
Wallace, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Before Martinsville, the pair had only one top-10 performance _
Schrader's sixth-place effort at Daytona _ in 14 combined starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't performed with (Wallace) like we needed to and
(Schrader) is not up to snuff either,'' Petree said, before
Sunday's race. ``I'm a little disappointed at this point, but we're
working on it. We've got a lot going on. We're working on a program
to try to get better aerodynamics and that's working. We're trying
to get caught up.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes must have worked because Wallace and Schrader
finished sixth and ninth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Pit stops
</P>
<P>
   Driver Geoffrey Bodine turned 50 years old on Sunday....Georgia
tight ends coach Greg Adkins was a guest of Ernie Irvan's three
owners, all UGA graduates.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two coaches regarded as short-timers by their peers,
Jimmy Johnson of Miami and Mike Ditka of New Orleans, rolled the
dice in the NFL draft. The results of the crap-shoots likely will
determine if either returns for the 2000 season.

   In a Saturday gambit praised by few and panned by most, Ditka
traded away his entire draft to move up in the first round for
Heisman Trophy running back Ricky Williams. The move resulted in
the lone one-player draft in league history and left other coaches
questioning the Saints' wisdom. San Francisco 49ers president Bill
Walsh likened Ditka's flight of fancy to the risks associated with
a flight into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``One rocket to the moon is all you get,'' Walsh said. ``You've
got 50 people on it. It better get up there, circle and land, or
else.'' Added Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin: ``I really don't
know if it's a sound philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the era of the salary cap, it may not be. Every team needs
its draft choices to make the roster in order to have some players
with minimum salaries. The Saints now have no such pool because of
the trade. Ditka, who appeared at a press conference in a
dreadlocks wig to mimic the coif of his new star, and who promised
to get his tongue pierced like Williams, defended his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered an invitation to all undrafted players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on and sign with us,'' Ditka said. ``The opportunity is
terrific. You won't have any other rookies to beat out.'' Told that
his trade raised eyebrows, Ditka responded: ``Geez, who cares what
we do?''
</P>
<P>
   Expected to step aside after this season, Johnson gambled on
some players. First-round tailback James Johnson of Mississippi
State was drummed out of the Navy four years ago. In the fifth
round, Miami picked running back Cecil Collins, who came under
scrutiny when he was tossed out of LSU and McNeese State.
</P>
<P>
   Collins struck a plea bargain last week on two felony counts of
unlawful entry and was sentenced to four years probation. He tested
positive for marijuana three times at LSU and faces weekly
drug-testing by Louisiana authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team in the league wanted to take Cecil, but nobody else
had the guts,'' Johnson said.

COMPAQ COMPUTER OUSTS CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Texas)  By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Compaq Computer Corp., the world's largest personal computer
maker, ousted its president and chief executive, Eckhard Pfeiffer,
Sunday in a dramatic boardroom coup that reflects just how much the
Internet is shaking up the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The forced resignation of the 57-year-old Pfeiffer, a leading
figure in the personal computer industry, came as a surprise,
especially the timing of the move. Compaq had just hosted hundreds
of its leading corporate customers at a conference, where Pfeiffer
confidently detailed the company's plans for the future. On
Thursday, Compaq will hold its yearly shareholders meeting on its
corporate campus in Houston, where the featured speaker was to have
been Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   But with increasing urgency in recent days _ as Compaq warned
that its first-quarter profits would be half of Wall Street's
expectations and the company's stock price kept falling _ the
longtime Compaq chairman, Benjamin M. Rosen, led the call for
Pfeiffer's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with the other Compaq directors, Rosen met with
Pfeiffer over the weekend and told him the board agreed that he
should resign, according to a person close to the board. ``It
wasn't a request on Ben's part,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said Sunday that Compaq's problems were not fundamental
strategic errors, but mainly that ``we're not executing as well as
we should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about specific areas for improvement, Rosen replied, ``The
Internet opportunity for Compaq is incredible.'' He noted that
Compaq, especially after its $8.7 billion purchase of the Digital
Equipment Corp. last year, had everything from its own Internet
search engine, Alta Vista, to large server computers for hosting
Internet services and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have it all, but some of our competitors have done a better
job of positioning themselves and exploiting that opportunity,''
Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Sun Microsystems have succeeded in casting themselves as
suppliers of Internet hardware and services, for example, while
Dell Computer has positioned itself as the personal computer maker
whose direct sales model lends itself most naturally to marketing
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement announcing Pfeiffer's resignation, Rosen
suggested that the accelerating change brought about by the
Internet had overtaken Compaq's management, led by Pfeiffer. ``As a
company engaged in transforming its industry for the Internet
era,'' Rosen said, ``we must have the organizational flexibility
necessary to move at Internet speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, also submitted his
resignation Sunday. He had previously been offered the job of chief
executive of a company outside the personal computer industry, an
offer Mason informed the Compaq board he planned to accept.
</P>
<P>
   His departure, Compaq said, was not related to Pfeiffer's
resignation. ``It was just an unfortunate coincidence of timing,''
Rosen explained.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer could not be reached for comment. But in a brief
statement, he said, ``Compaq has come a long way since I joined the
company in 1983,'' adding that ``under Ben's guidance, I know this
company will realize its potential.''
</P>
<P>
   A search will begin immediately, Rosen said, for Pfeiffer's
replacement. But in the meantime, Compaq will be headed by Rosen
and two other directors, who will form a three-person office of the
chief executive. The two are Frank P. Doyle, 67, a retired
executive vice president of the General Electric Co.; and Robert
Ted Enloe III, 60, a private investor. All three men will move to
Houston to oversee the company, until a successor to Pfieffer is in
place.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Rosen, 65, has engineered the ouster of
a Compaq chief executive. In 1991, he saw off Joseph R. Canion, an
engineer who had helped design Compaq's first machine, sketching on
a restaurant place mat. Canion had led the rise of Compaq, founded
in 1983 and backed by Rosen's venture capital fund, Sevin Rosen. It
thrived in the early years mainly by offering customers more
powerful computers than its main rival, IBM, for about the same
price.
</P>
<P>
   But Compaq proved ill-suited for responding to the severe
price-cutting that developed in the early 1990s. So Rosen led the
boardroom revolt that pushed Canion out in October 1991. In his
place, the board installed Pfeiffer, a German native who rose
through the company's international operations and was a fierce
advocate of low-cost, efficient production.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, we were just a PC company,'' Rosen said. ``Now we're
a broad information technology company.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly to replace a chief executive is made easier at
Compaq by the board structure that Rosen insisted on when the
company was founded. The chairman and chief executive roles are
split, with Rosen serving as a chairman who is not part of the
management staff. In addition, the board is nearly all outside
directors. Pfeiffer was the only member of Compaq's day-to-day
management team on the board. The remaining 11 are Rosen and 10
outside directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Ben's board, and the man really behind Compaq has always
been Ben Rosen,'' Richard Shaffer, a principal at the research firm
Technologic Partners, said. ``With this move, it certainly seems
that Ben Rosen is rethinking the Compaq business model once
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq profits have been squeezed recently by a combination of
forces, including an eroding share of the fast-growing and
lucrative business of PC servers, the large computers that serve as
hubs of corporate networks and World Wide Web sites, analysts say.
Other near-term problems, they say, are accelerated price-cutting
on desktop PC's and the difficulty integrating Digital Equipment
into Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, Compaq warned that its profits for the first
quarter would be about $250 million instead of the Wall Street
consensus estimate of $540 million.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's stock price closed on Friday at $23.625, representing a
44 percent decline so far this year.

 &HT;    Protesters riled by Bush mansion arrests
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, trying to burnish his
national image, is squelching political criticism around the
historic Governor's Mansion by having his security detail move more
quickly to arrest protesters, said several activists who have been
arrested or witnessed arrests in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   So convinced are protesters that Bush is trying to keep critics
away from the mansion that one environmental group, Texans United
Education Fund, plans today to test the resolve of the Department
of Public Safety, which protects the governor, the mansion and the
nearby Capitol, by returning to the scene where one of their
members was arrested earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``News Conference and Possible Arrests at Governor's Mansion,''
the group said in a press release issued last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a new game in play there,'' said Rick Abraham, the
environmental activist who was handcuffed on March 29 while on the
sidewalk in front of the mansion at 11th and Colorado streets and
jailed for 12 hours for blocking an entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking an entrance is a Class B misdemeanor under Texas law.
The punishment can be up to 180 days in jail or a fine of up to
$2,000, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ` `I've been at and seen no telling how many demonstrations at
the Governor's Mansion over the years'' and never witnessed such a
willingness by DPS to make arrests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said DPS officials in charge of protecting the mansion,
which has gained increased national visibility this year as
out-of-state dignitaries make almost weekly pilgrimages to pay
homage to the governor-who-would-be-president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules haven't changed,'' said R.K. Elliston, the
Department of Public Safety major in charge of Capitol police.
</P>
<P>
   DPS says what has changed is an increased concern for the safety
of protesters and others walking near the mansion as the historic
building undergoes a renovation that has temporarily dislocated
Bush and his family, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A protest area was designated in a parking lot across Colorado
Street from the front of the mansion as a safety measure for
passersby and protesters who might be crowded off the sidewalk and
into the street, said DPS Lt. Mike Escalante, head of the
governor's protection unit.
</P>
<P>
   This impromptu Lafayette Park _ a famous protest area across the
street from the White House _ allows renovation workers to get in
and out of the mansion with construction materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not ask for it, said his spokesman, Scott McClellan.
``This was a decision by the DPS,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the stricter mansion perimeter policy say that at
least 18 demonstrators have been arrested for exercising their
First Amendment rights on public sidewalks at the official
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cox, a DPS spokesman, said his agency does not keep arrest
statistics for the mansion or the perimeter, so it is impossible to
compare arrests this year with past years.
</P>
<P>
   But Elliston points out that the 18 arrests were made on only
two occasions, when the protesters refused to comply with orders.
``They can't say we're arresting them every time they come up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   They were protesting Attorney General John Cornyn's decision to
participate in a lawsuit on a disability claim involving Georgia.

MURDER CASE TESTS LEGAL LIMITS OF WHAT MAN TOLD PASTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Everyone agrees what happened to little Devyn
Martin was tragic. The 3-month-old boy was shaken so violently one
day two years ago that his brain slammed repeatedly against his
skull, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   How to best seek justice for his death, though, has pitted
prosecutors against a pastor and ignited a national debate over
society's secular courts vs. religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It's also landed the case before the Washington state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierce County Prosecutor's Office wants to try Devyn's
father, Scott Anthony Martin, in the baby's death, alleging he
committed second-degree murder when he shook his son to death in a
fit of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they say they need to call as a witness a Tacoma
pastor to whom they believe Martin confessed the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But the pastor refuses to take the stand despite the trial
judge's threat to jail him because he asserts anything confided to
him in his capacity as a clergyman must remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor, 36-year-old Rich Hamlin, has the looks of the
boy-next-door: lanky, friendly, open. He once aspired to
professional basketball, and graduated from Pacific Lutheran
University, just down the road from his South Tacoma church.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin taught high school for four years before becoming a
pastor. Today, he's the ordained minister of the 75-member,
independent Evangelical Reformed Church.
</P>
<P>
   He's mystified as to why the state would try to force him to
divulge something as sacrosanct as what a penitent told him in
confidence, a privilege he and his attorney claim is protected by
centuries of law and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you approach clergy, you do so with confidence that it
will remain private,'' Hamlin said. ``It's really a part of Western
civilization. ... What they're trying to do here is fundamentally
change the relationship between clergy and parishioners. That
relationship is based on candor, trust and confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin wants one thing known: Although he is bound by his faith
to remain silent, he, too wants whoever killed little Devyn Martin
to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want justice,'' Hamlin said. ``My God is a just God. Let's
let the state do what they're ordained to do. And let me do what
I'm ordained to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the state is doing, said Pierce County
Prosecutor Kit Proctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastor Hamlin maybe feels we're pursuing him,'' Proctor said,
``but what we're really trying to do is get this before the
jury.... We believe the pastor does have relevant information about
how this baby was injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin was a pastor with the national organization of Youth for
Christ _ for which he still works part time _ when the organization
got a phone call in July 1997 saying a suicidal man in Lakewood,
north of Everett, Wash., needed to ``see a preacher.'' He responded
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The man was Scott Martin, now 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   During that meeting at Martin's apartment, Hamlin will say only
that he offered spiritual guidance, prayer and counseling. He would
meet with Martin two more times in the next few days, at the
medical center where the baby died and the night before Martin
turned himself into police after he was charged in his son's death.
</P>
<P>
   What came next was something Hamlin never imagined could happen
when he was ordained: Prosecutors took him to court in January
1998, demanding he repeat what Martin had revealed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surreal, the questions they were asking me,'' he said,
staring off in the distance. ``The church and the civil magistrate,
if you will, were crossing paths.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Steve O'Ban, told the court that Hamlin had a
constitutional right not to testify. His silence also was protected
under the Washington state law known as the priest-penitent
privilege, O'Ban said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pierce County Superior Court Judge Brian Tollefson didn't
see it that way. He ruled Hamlin was in contempt of court and
ordered him to testify or go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor, who never dreamed he'd become a poster boy for the
priest-penitent privilege, made his stand. Despite having a wife
and three young children, he said he was prepared to go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recessed for lunch,'' Hamlin said. ``There were some
supporters with us in court. We prayed, and I kissed my wife
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   But his attorney, O'Ban, received a week's extension from
Tollefson to make an emergency appeal to the state Court of
Appeals. That court accepted the issue on an expedited basis,
keeping Hamlin out of jail while the judges considered the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then in July, the Appeals Court voted 3-0 in Hamlin's favor.
Pierce County prosecutors appealed to the state Supreme Court,
which heard arguments in the case last month. It's not known when
the high court will rule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Martin remains in the Pierce County jail on $250,000
bail. His attorney, Gary Hood of Tacoma, said he is outraged that
Martin's trial has to be delayed again because of the Supreme Court
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Scott Martin's attorney, I'm very concerned about it, and
we're intending on challenging it on a speedy trial basis,'' Hood
said. ``Mr. Martin has been in jail almost two years now, and he's
not very happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hood said prosecutors should either reduce Martin's bail so he
can get out while the appeal is pending or dismiss the charges
without prejudice, meaning they could be refiled at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hamlin has grown a little weary of the media
attention and feels burned by what he considers to be the
one-sideness of some of the coverage, especially on some radio talk
shows. ``Pastor protects possible baby killer'' has been the
general theme, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tiring, the media scrutiny,'' Hamlin said. ``I've
been roasted pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Proctor, who is handling appeals in the case for the
prosecutor's office, feels a little burned and misunderstood by the
media as well. She might sum up some of the coverage as
``Prosecutor attempts to imprison innocent pastor.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the case is an important one. She said her office
believes its research shows that the state's priest-penitent law,
which dates to the 19th century, was written very narrowly and
doesn't apply to this situation. It's Proctor's legal opinion that
the law requires the person who hears the confession to be
ordained, which Hamlin is. But the person making the confession
must do so out of his or her religious beliefs, which she doesn't
think applies in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the person making the confession must be a member of a
religion that has a formal rite of confession, such as the
Catholic, Orthodox and Episcopal churches, Proctor asserts. Again,
she said, that doesn't apply to Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what I hear coming from Pastor Hamlin and his attorney
is that they keep arguing what the privilege should be,'' not what
it actually is, Proctor said. ``We don't make the law.... It was
our job to pursue this.''
</P>
<P>
   Proctor also points out that at least one other person was
present for part of the time when Martin and Hamlin spoke _
Martin's mother, which she says diminishes any claim of strict
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The mother has told authorities she doesn't remember what she
heard when Hamlin and her son spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Also, prosecutors say Hamlin spoke to two other pastors after he
initially counseled Martin. One of those pastors later called Child
Protective Services to report Martin had confessed to killing his
son, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get down in this case to someone believing their testimony
would violate their religious beliefs,'' Proctor said. ``And
consistently, in these cases of your beliefs vs. the law, the law
take precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven McFarland, director of the national Center for Law
and Religious Freedom of the Christian Legal Society in Annandale,
Va., scoffs at that interpretation of the law as an improper
intrusion into fundamental religious rights that date back hundreds
of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least since the Reformation, the confessional has been
sacrosanct from state invasion,'' said McFarland, who entered
Hamlin's case on a friend-of-the-court basis for his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clergy have not been allowed to be involuntary conscripted as
informers for the state,'' he said. ``That message apparently
hasn't gotten through to the Pierce County Prosecutor's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Ban agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really a solitary key legal issue here, and that is
whether our state's clergy-penitent statute should be interpreted
to apply only to a favored few faiths, i.e., the Catholic Church
and possibly the Episcopal,'' he said. ``The way to avoid that is
to construe our state clergy-penitent statue as applying to all
faiths. We believe it is capable of that kind of broader
interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   McFarland also asserts that the prosecutor's office is capable
of making its case against Martin without Hamlin's testimony.
According to court documents, Martin's former wife told authorities
he had told her that ``Devyn was fussing, that he lost control,
that he picked up the child and shook him.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's mother also told a detective that her son admitted to
her that ``he did it,'' that he had shaken the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who talked to the accused and heard him
confess,'' McFarland said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hamlin continues to visit Scott Martin in the Pierce
County Jail every two or three weeks to offer spiritual guidance,
meetings he has grown to treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grown into being a good time of accountability'' for
Martin, Hamlin said.
</P>
<P>
   And however wrenching it has been for him personally, Hamlin
said he'd do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the legal precedent,'' he said. ``It's
distracted me somewhat as a pastor, but at the same time, it's
allowed me to raise the consciousness of people.''

ENERGY DEPARTMENT BARS RELEASING CHINA SPY DATA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)   (jw) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the House select committee that
found China had stolen American nuclear weapons secrets said Sunday
that the Department of Energy was improperly holding up the release
of some of the committee's still-classified report.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on ``Fox News Sunday,'' Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., said the Energy Department was objecting to the public
disclosure of some information even after agencies such as the CIA
had determined that its release would not harm
intelligence-gathering sources or methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those kinds of objections not based on sources and
methods are not proper in this circumstance,'' Cox said, adding
that his committee was ``trying to frankly turn them around on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, Cox's committee unanimously approved a
voluminous, but secret, report on China's acquisition of American
technology, including the theft of nuclear weapons design
information from Energy Department-owned laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department spokeswoman Brooke Anderson defended Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson's decision to block the release of
nuclear weapons information from the public version of the
committee's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working with other agencies and Congress to
declassify as much of the report as possible without releasing
information that would compromise intelligence sources or methods
or classified nuclear weapons information,'' she said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Her statement continued, ``Discussions are ongoing, but
Secretary Richardson under no circumstances will bow to pressure
and release sensitive nuclear weapons information.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox hopes to release a declassified version of the report by the
end of April, when the committee is scheduled to go out of
business. Theoretically, the House of Representatives could
overrule executive branch decisions on classification, but that
would be unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Some, but not all, of the committee's findings have appeared in
news accounts in the last several weeks, prompting new inquiries by
the House and Senate into how the Clinton administration and the
White House have handled the issue. The allegations also figured in
the just-completed visit to the United States by Chinese Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji, who denounced them as untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Cox suggested Sunday that his committee's findings about Chinese
espionage went beyond what had appeared in news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to what's been in the newspaper, the pattern is
broader still,'' he said. ``And in fact, the pattern extends back
several decades and continues almost certainly to this very day.''

   The committee's ranking Democrat, Norm Dicks of Washington,
appearing on the same television program as Cox, said he talked on
Saturday night to Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national
security adviser, about getting the report out ``as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks attributed the delay in declassification to the need to
protect human intelligence sources in China.

 &HT;    Falcons add depth through draft
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons didn't address any pressing needs in the
NFL draft Sunday, but coach Dan Reeves doesn't feel they have any
that were urgent in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   So with 19 of 22 starters coming back to a Super Bowl team, and
the other three spots spoken for, the goal was to add depth.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials got more than they planned on when they picked
Utah State safety Johndale Carty in the fourth round, and Iowa
safety Eric Thigpen in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta didn't adhere strictly on Saturday to the ``best player
available'' strategy in rounds one through three, but they did in
rounds four through seven on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't anticipate getting two safeties,'' Reeves said. ``We
see (Carty) as a strong safety. He's a big hitter. On our board,
(Thigpen) was too good a player to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   In between those picks, the Falcons drafted Kent wide receiver
Eugene Baker in the fifth round, and Kansas State middle linebacker
Jeff Kelly in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh round, Atlanta added LSU center Todd McClure and
Eastern Kentucky wide receiver Rondel Menendez, who's small _
5-feet-9, 178-pound _ but very fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' main needs appeared to be backup defensive end, and
a speedy wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   They picked picked defensive end Patrick Kerney in the first
round Saturday, tight end Reggie Kelly in the second, and fullback
Eric Paulk in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, like Menendez, is slight, at 6-feet and 162 pounds.
Though not as fast as Menendez, he had an incredible college
career.
</P>
<P>
   He led the nation in 1997 with 103 catches for 1,549 yards. He
missed five games last season, but had 10 catches for 124 yards
against Georgia, and 13 catches for 227 yards and two touchdowns
against Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez has 4.24-second speed in the 40-yard dash, and averaged
nearly 20 yards per catch.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is a hustle middle linebacker, Thigpen an All-Big 10 free
safety, and McClure an undersized (6-1, 283 pounds) but sound
center who earned All-SEC honors the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Carter may have been a steal. He had 248 tackles as a sophomore
and junior, when he also had six interceptions, before struggling
in a new defensive scheme last season.
</P>
<P>
   He also had shoulder surgery after nine games which some team
officials felt should have waited until after the season.

SKIP SPENCE, SONGWRITER AND PSYCHEDELIC GUITARIST, DIES AT 52  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Calif.)   By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander (Skip) Spence, a pivotal figure in psychedelic San
Francisco rock, died on Friday at Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz,
Calif., where he lived. The cause was lung cancer, said his son
Omar. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Spence was a founding member of Jefferson Airplane and Moby
Grape. As a songwriter, he twisted blues, country and pop into
unpredictable shapes. He was primarily a guitarist, although he was
drafted to play drums in the Airplane. But as early as the 1960s,
Spence had been found to be a paranoid schizophrenic. After making
his 1969 solo album, ``Oar'' (Columbia), he was institutionalized
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Spence was born on April 18, 1946, in Windsor, Ontario, and
arrived in San Francisco by the mid-1960s. On his way to an
audition for the band that became Quicksilver Messenger Service, he
was spotted by Marty Balin of the nascent Jefferson Airplane, who
decided based on Spence's looks that he was the drummer Balin
wanted. Although Spence had never played the drums, after a week of
practice he joined Jefferson Airplane for its debut album in 1966,
``Jefferson Airplane Takes Off.'' He wrote some of the band's early
songs, including ``Blues from an Airplane'' and ``My Best Friend,''
a single from the Airplane's 1967 album, ``Surrealistic Pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, he had helped start the band Moby Grape. In September
and October of 1966, Moby Grape spent eight hours a day rehearsing
songs by its five songwriters. It stood out among San Francisco
bands with its three-guitar front line and its capacity for
elaborate pop vocal harmonies as well as virtuoso jamming. Spence
wrote the band's most innovative songs, using unconventional
structures and experimenting with studio effects. ``His mind was
always churning over with stuff,'' Peter Lewis, another Moby Grape
guitarist, told an interviewer. ``It was hard for him to sit and
talk. He didn't deal in words, but in ideas. Yet he was an
inspiration, always able to get people going on his trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The band was quickly signed to Columbia Records, released its
debut album in June 1967 and started a remarkable streak of bad
luck and misguided decisions. The label released five songs
simultaneously as singles, virtually guaranteeing that no one song
became a hit. After the party to celebrate the release of the
album, Spence and the band's two other guitarists, Jerry Miller and
Peter Lewis, were arrested with three underage girls, though
charges were later dropped. The band's first national tour earned
it few new fans.
</P>
<P>
   Moby Grape settled in Los Angeles to record a second album in
late 1967, but spent more time partying than recording. Columbia
had the band start new recording sessions in New York City, where
Moby Grape was thrown out of numerous hotels and Spence took
increasing amounts of hallucinogens.
</P>
<P>
   One of his songs for ``Wow,'' Moby Grape's second album, was
recorded with a 1930s-style dance orchestra and featured an
appearance by Arthur Godfrey. After ``Wow'' was released, during
recording sessions in July 1968, a delusional Spence went after
band members with a fire ax. He was jailed at the Tombs, in the
basement of the Criminal Courts building in Lower Manhattan, and
then committed to Bellevue Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was discharged at the end of 1968, and went to Nashville.
There, in four days in December, he made ``Oar,'' on which he
played every instrument through multitracking. It included
quasi-Appalachian ballads, eerie psychedelia and whimsical tunes
with titles like ``Lawrence of Euphoria.'' Ignored at the time, it
has since gained a cult following among musicians. It was Spence's
last album.
</P>
<P>
   His mental illness worsened, and he spent much of the 1970s and
1980s in and out of mental hospitals. In 1981 he became a ward of
the state of California. He continued to play guitar and write
songs, and he remained in contact with the members of Moby Grape.
In 1990 he contributed a new song, ``All My Life I Love You,'' to a
reunion album, with the band recording as the Legendary Grape
because of a legal dispute over the Moby Grape trademark. ``Oar''
was reissued as a CD in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Spence was commissioned to write music for a revived ``Twilight
Zone'' episode, but the score was not used. In recent years he had
been living under home care. Spence sat in with the reunited Moby
Grape in concerts in Northern California in 1993 and in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``More Oar,'' an album of new recordings of the songs on ``Oar''
by performers including Beck, Tom Waits, Michael Stipe and Robert
Plant, is scheduled for release in July.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Omar, Spence is survived by his half-brother,
Rich Young; his sister, Sherry Ferreira; his children Aaron, Adam
and Heather Moon, and 11 grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: A GENUINE BUDGET CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, April 19:
</P>
<P>
   The current budget impasse in Albany involves a disagreement
that is far more profound than New York's normal partisan
squabbling. The state is in danger of turning sane financial
priorities upside down, while undermining its own efforts to
improve public-school standards. Gov. George Pataki is the
politician most responsible for creating the mess, and it is up to
him to chart a way out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Pataki proposed a $2.7 billion multi-year property tax
relief program, known as STAR, that was to become the centerpiece
of his re-election campaign. The measure targets wealthy suburbs,
which have long complained about the burden of school property
taxes. To that end, STAR compensates districts for cutting school
taxes through a formula that provides the most aid to counties
where home prices are highest. When fully financed, it will reduce
the base value of each home in wealthy Westchester County by
$72,000 for the purpose of assessing school taxes. Poor counties
where property values are below the state average will get $30,000
in exemptions on each home.
</P>
<P>
   To get STAR through the Democratic Assembly, Pataki also agreed
to phase in a $1.21 billion program to improve education statewide,
most notably by establishing universal pre-kindergarten classes and
reducing class size in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons the budget is stalled in Albany right
now is that Pataki is backtracking on his end of the commitment.
Pataki may be right that New York cannot afford all his
pre-election promises. But it is outrageous that he wants to
protect a property tax reduction geared to helping people who live
in expensive houses in wealthy suburbs over education aid that is
critical for children in poor districts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state Board of Regents is in the process of
imposing stringent new graduation requirements on public-school
students and their teachers. But a recent dry run of the new tests
showed that more than a quarter of the state's high school seniors
and more than a third of those in the city would not have graduated
if the standards had been imposed this year. The public schools
will need every bit of aid the state has promised, along with
federal help and new mechanisms for financing school construction,
to prepare the next generation of students.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has been making some tentative moves toward a
presidential campaign, but he can hardly present himself to the
nation as a successful governor when back home he is robbing the
poor to give to the rich, leaving many of the state's public-school
students flailing helplessly. The governor must keep his commitment
to education, even if it means cutting back on the STAR program.
The Legislature must hold out until the governor comes to his
senses.

VAUGHN SAYS HE'S READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn took batting practice again Sunday.
He said if he wasn't on the 15-day disabled list he could have
played Sunday against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have,'' he said. ``If this was the playoffs, I would
play. I'm swinging the bat OK, it's just a matter of waiting. There
was no need to rush this (injury), it was just a matter of healing
and taking some time. Now I'm pretty much ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn injured his left ankle in his only game as an Angel when
he fell on the steps of the Cleveland Indians' dugout at Edison
Field on opening night. He plans on making the Angels' six-game
road trip to Toronto and Kansas City beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the ballpark Sunday, he was still under the
impression he would come off the DL in time for Tuesday's game
against the Blue Jays. Actually, he comes off the DL on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my head I've been thinking Tuesday all along,'' said
Vaughn. ``It was just wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two weeks have been difficult for the new Angels
slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has, I mean, you're here to do a job and be there, then
this (injury) happens,'' he said. ``All I'm thinking about now is
starting the season again and putting this behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene's days: Todd Greene has hit safely in eight straight
games and had belted homers in three consecutive games entering
Sunday. He is tied for second in the American League with 15 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   It's welcome news for Greene, who spent the majority of the past
two seasons rehabbing his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just getting pitches up in the zone,'' Greene said.
``When I can consistently stick to my plan at the plate, I feel I
can hit the ball pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   His said his current hitting streak, the longest in his career,
is just one of those things that happens when mechanics feel right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I've just been getting my one hit a game,'' he
joked. ``It's playing, the more I play the more consistent I can
be. Right now I'm feeling pretty comfortable out there. It's just a
matter of keeping it going through the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after: After a solid effort Saturday, Angels pitcher Ken
Hill said he is feeling much better. He worked seven innings,
giving up five hits and three earned runs. Hill is learning to
pitch without raising his arms over his head on his windup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just mechanics, that's it,'' Hill said. ``Last night it
felt better. It's coming around. It's just a matter of time. The
more I get out there, the better I will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley to go: Chuck Finley (1-1, 7.30 ERA) will start his third
game of the year Tuesday against Toronto. He has given up 10 earned
runs in 12 innings over his two previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   In three starts against the Blue Jays last season, Finley was
1-0 with a 3.43 ERA.

MURDER CASE TESTS LEGAL LIMITS OF WHAT MAN TOLD PASTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Everyone agrees what happened to little Devyn
Martin was tragic. The 3-month-old boy was shaken so violently one
day two years ago that his brain slammed repeatedly against his
skull, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   How to best seek justice for his death, though, has pitted
prosecutors against a pastor and ignited a national debate over
society's secular courts vs. religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It's also landed the case before the Washington state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierce County Prosecutor's Office wants to try Devyn's
father, Scott Anthony Martin, in the baby's death, alleging he
committed second-degree murder when he shook his son to death in a
fit of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they say they need to call as a witness a Tacoma
pastor to whom they believe Martin confessed the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But the pastor refuses to take the stand despite the trial
judge's threat to jail him because he asserts anything confided to
him in his capacity as a clergyman must remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor, 36-year-old Rich Hamlin, has the looks of the
boy-next-door: lanky, friendly, open. He once aspired to
professional basketball, and graduated from Pacific Lutheran
University, just down the road from his South Tacoma church.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin taught high school for four years before becoming a
pastor. Today, he's the ordained minister of the 75-member,
independent Evangelical Reformed Church.
</P>
<P>
   He's mystified as to why the state would try to force him to
divulge something as sacrosanct as what a penitent told him in
confidence, a privilege he and his attorney claim is protected by
centuries of law and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you approach clergy, you do so with confidence that it
will remain private,'' Hamlin said. ``It's really a part of Western
civilization. ... What they're trying to do here is fundamentally
change the relationship between clergy and parishioners. That
relationship is based on candor, trust and confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin wants one thing known: Although he is bound by his faith
to remain silent, he, too wants whoever killed little Devyn Martin
to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want justice,'' Hamlin said. ``My God is a just God. Let's
let the state do what they're ordained to do. And let me do what
I'm ordained to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the state is doing, said Pierce County
Prosecutor Kit Proctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastor Hamlin maybe feels we're pursuing him,'' Proctor said,
``but what we're really trying to do is get this before the
jury.... We believe the pastor does have relevant information about
how this baby was injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin was a pastor with the national organization of Youth for
Christ _ for which he still works part time _ when the organization
got a phone call in July 1997 saying a suicidal man in Lakewood,
north of Everett, Wash., needed to ``see a preacher.'' He responded
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The man was Scott Martin, now 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   During that meeting at Martin's apartment, Hamlin will say only
that he offered spiritual guidance, prayer and counseling. He would
meet with Martin two more times in the next few days, at the
medical center where the baby died and the night before Martin
turned himself into police after he was charged in his son's death.
</P>
<P>
   What came next was something Hamlin never imagined could happen
when he was ordained: Prosecutors took him to court in January
1998, demanding he repeat what Martin had revealed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surreal, the questions they were asking me,'' he said,
staring off in the distance. ``The church and the civil magistrate,
if you will, were crossing paths.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Steve O'Ban, told the court that Hamlin had a
constitutional right not to testify. His silence also was protected
under the Washington state law known as the priest-penitent
privilege, O'Ban said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pierce County Superior Court Judge Brian Tollefson didn't
see it that way. He ruled Hamlin was in contempt of court and
ordered him to testify or go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor, who never dreamed he'd become a poster boy for the
priest-penitent privilege, made his stand. Despite having a wife
and three young children, he said he was prepared to go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recessed for lunch,'' Hamlin said. ``There were some
supporters with us in court. We prayed, and I kissed my wife
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   But his attorney, O'Ban, received a week's extension from
Tollefson to make an emergency appeal to the state Court of
Appeals. That court accepted the issue on an expedited basis,
keeping Hamlin out of jail while the judges considered the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then in July, the Appeals Court voted 3-0 in Hamlin's favor.
Pierce County prosecutors appealed to the state Supreme Court,
which heard arguments in the case last month. It's not known when
the high court will rule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Martin remains in the Pierce County jail on $250,000
bail. His attorney, Gary Hood of Tacoma, said he is outraged that
Martin's trial has to be delayed again because of the Supreme Court
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Scott Martin's attorney, I'm very concerned about it, and
we're intending on challenging it on a speedy trial basis,'' Hood
said. ``Mr. Martin has been in jail almost two years now, and he's
not very happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hood said prosecutors should either reduce Martin's bail so he
can get out while the appeal is pending or dismiss the charges
without prejudice, meaning they could be refiled at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hamlin has grown a little weary of the media
attention and feels burned by what he considers to be the
one-sideness of some of the coverage, especially on some radio talk
shows. ``Pastor protects possible baby killer'' has been the
general theme, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tiring, the media scrutiny,'' Hamlin said. ``I've
been roasted pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Proctor, who is handling appeals in the case for the
prosecutor's office, feels a little burned and misunderstood by the
media as well. She might sum up some of the coverage as
``Prosecutor attempts to imprison innocent pastor.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the case is an important one. She said her office
believes its research shows that the state's priest-penitent law,
which dates to the 19th century, was written very narrowly and
doesn't apply to this situation. It's Proctor's legal opinion that
the law requires the person who hears the confession to be
ordained, which Hamlin is. But the person making the confession
must do so out of his or her religious beliefs, which she doesn't
think applies in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the person making the confession must be a member of a
religion that has a formal rite of confession, such as the
Catholic, Orthodox and Episcopal churches, Proctor asserts. Again,
she said, that doesn't apply to Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what I hear coming from Pastor Hamlin and his attorney
is that they keep arguing what the privilege should be,'' not what
it actually is, Proctor said. ``We don't make the law.... It was
our job to pursue this.''
</P>
<P>
   Proctor also points out that at least one other person was
present for part of the time when Martin and Hamlin spoke _
Martin's mother, which she says diminishes any claim of strict
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The mother has told authorities she doesn't remember what she
heard when Hamlin and her son spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Also, prosecutors say Hamlin spoke to two other pastors after he
initially counseled Martin. One of those pastors later called Child
Protective Services to report Martin had confessed to killing his
son, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get down in this case to someone believing their testimony
would violate their religious beliefs,'' Proctor said. ``And
consistently, in these cases of your beliefs vs. the law, the law
take precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven McFarland, director of the national Center for Law
and Religious Freedom of the Christian Legal Society in Annandale,
Va., scoffs at that interpretation of the law as an improper
intrusion into fundamental religious rights that date back hundreds
of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least since the Reformation, the confessional has been
sacrosanct from state invasion,'' said McFarland, who entered
Hamlin's case on a friend-of-the-court basis for his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clergy have not been allowed to be involuntary conscripted as
informers for the state,'' he said. ``That message apparently
hasn't gotten through to the Pierce County Prosecutor's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Ban agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really a solitary key legal issue here, and that is
whether our state's clergy-penitent statute should be interpreted
to apply only to a favored few faiths, i.e., the Catholic Church
and possibly the Episcopal,'' he said. ``The way to avoid that is
to construe our state clergy-penitent statue as applying to all
faiths. We believe it is capable of that kind of broader
interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   McFarland also asserts that the prosecutor's office is capable
of making its case against Martin without Hamlin's testimony.
According to court documents, Martin's former wife told authorities
he had told her that ``Devyn was fussing, that he lost control,
that he picked up the child and shook him.''

   Martin's mother also told a detective that her son admitted to
her that ``he did it,'' that he had shaken the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who talked to the accused and heard him
confess,'' McFarland said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hamlin continues to visit Scott Martin in the Pierce
County Jail every two or three weeks to offer spiritual guidance,
meetings he has grown to treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grown into being a good time of accountability'' for
Martin, Hamlin said.
</P>
<P>
   And however wrenching it has been for him personally, Hamlin
said he'd do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the legal precedent,'' he said. ``It's
distracted me somewhat as a pastor, but at the same time, it's
allowed me to raise the consciousness of people.''

FOR COLLEGES, A NEW FOCUS ON LABOR

<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Yale and Harvard universities have long
dueled over who has the best students, best football team and best
law school, but over the weekend they competed with conferences
aimed at building academia's bonds with the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer numbers, Yale won hands down, attracting 500 people to
Harvard's 150. But the Harvard students did not seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can only bode well for the labor movement that there are
two, three or four conferences taking place on the same weekend,''
said Aaron Bartley, a first-year Harvard law student who helped
organize the conference at his school. ``It indicates there is a
new level of attention and interest in labor issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Many participants said the fact that students from two of the
nation's most prestigious universities _ places hardly viewed as
bastions of the proletariat _were flocking to conferences on labor
illustrates just how far the union movement has come since four
years ago, when labor seemed comatose.
</P>
<P>
   The two conferences had somewhat different themes. At Harvard,
the focus was on creating a nationwide student-labor alliance to
build on recent anti-sweatshop demonstrations on campuses. The
students say they hope to use their voice to help unions on a
variety of issues, like increasing wages for university janitors.
</P>
<P>
   To make theirs a nationwide effort, the Harvard students worked
with students at Stanford in California and Kent State in Ohio, who
also held labor-related conferences this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, one focus was on helping the university's more than
1,000 graduate teaching assistants form a union. The school has
refused to grant them union recognition, insisting that they are
students, not workers. The other focus was on protecting the right
of all workers to organize, as speakers asserted that hardball
corporate tactics, like firing union supporters and threatening to
close factories, had denied millions of American workers the right
to join unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harassment, intimidation and coercion are routine in union
elections across America,'' Linda Chavez-Thomson, AFL-CIO executive
vice president, said at the opening session of the Yale conference
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Students, professors and union members crowded into the
185-year-old Center Church on the New Haven Green to hear labor
leaders and intellectuals talk about how the right to organize was
systematically trampled and how unions were pivotal in building
better lives for workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the great struggle to form unions in the 1930s and
1940s that led to the great middle class in the 1950s and 1960s,''
said John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm was the returning hero at the conference, having made a
name for himself in labor circles since graduating from Yale three
decades ago. Wilhelm, often mentioned as a possible future
president of the AFL-CIO, helped lead Yale's secretaries in a
unionization drive 15 years ago and more recently spearheaded one
of the nation's most successful unionization campaigns, in which
tens of thousands of Las Vegas hotel and casino workers have joined
his union.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm's appearance had an ulterior motive: to recruit some of
the nation's best and brightest into the union movement. He told
the students that the hotel workers' union had someone on hand, as
did the AFL-CIO, to sign up anyone interested in a career in the
labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-nine years ago, I answered an ad: `Labor trainees
wanted. Long hours. Low pay.' '' he said. ``We're still running the
same ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Clawson, a sociology professor at the University of
Massachusetts, one of the organizers of the Yale conference, said
the meeting was intended in part to attract students to labor
careers. The conference featured workshops on women and unions,
becoming an organizer, overhauling the health-care industry,
teaching social change and organizing graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope it will help to show students a different
world and alternative possibilities,'' he said. ``There are
exciting events taking place and possibilities for engagement and
even employment outside the corporate world.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opening session of the Harvard conference, Marshall Ganz,
a former organizing director with the United Farm Workers who
teaches a course on organizing at the Kennedy School of Government,
said it was short-sighted of unions not to reach out to students in
the past. One reason unions declined in recent decades, he said,
was that they had largely shunned younger people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unions were afraid of universities in the 1960s, and they cut
themselves off to a critical source of renewal,'' Ganz said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Harvard conference was smaller than Yale's because it was
set up by students with little outside support. In contrast, the
Yale meeting had considerable financial and logistical assistance
from Connecticut unions, the AFL-CIO and Scholars, Artists and
Writers for Social Justice, a two-year-old group of intellectuals
that has made common cause with labor.
</P>
<P>
   As if to show that they were not elitists who had forgotten how
to take to the streets, the students at Harvard and Yale started
their conferences with protests. At Harvard, dozens of students
rallied at the Museum of Fine Arts to support museum workers in a
contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, undergraduates and union members braved the rain to
join hundreds of graduate students in their unionization drive. One
protest sign said, ``Union Power in Ivory Tower.'' The rally, like
the Yale conference, was a mixture of punkish graduate students,
clean-cut undergraduates, burly construction workers in union
parkas and graying faculty members and labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything said about unions this weekend was positive.
Pointing to the scandal at a union representing New York City
municipal workers, Katha Pollitt, the writer, told the Yale
conference that corruption had turned many people against unions.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, Amanda Cage, a union organizer, had a similar
message, saying, ``One of the biggest problems in organizing
workers is the workers who've had bad experiences with unions in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Harvard conference there was widespread concern
that it was hard to get more than 1 percent of the student body
involved in labor matters. Bill Capowski, executive director of a
group that seeks to mobilize students for pro-labor and progressive
causes, said, ``A troubling problem is that sometimes I see
thousands of students going to the World Wrestling Federation, and
we're wondering, `How come we can't get one or two volunteers for
our office?' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After most hockey games, Wayne Gretzky is a
quick-change artist, out of uniform and out of the locker room
before anyone else on the team. But Sunday was different, for so
many reasons, and Gretzky still wore his Ranger jersey and pants
more than an hour after the conclusion of the final game of his
brilliant career.
</P>
<P>
   His blue jersey was dark and wet with sweat and spilled water
and maybe a tear or two. When asked why he had not changed it,
Gretzky first said a few proper things about getting to the news
conference on time without making reporters wait in a back hall at
Madison Square Garden. Then he leveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably, subconsciously, I don't want to take it off,''
Gretzky, the player known as the Great One, said. ``I'm not going
to pull it on ever again. It's hard. It's hard to take it off right
now. I have to be honest with you. I don't want to take it off.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the times he cried between smiles during the
day's festivities, Gretzky said: ``Tears of joy. Tears of joy. No
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon was filled with sincerely sentimental moments like
those. Following the game, a 2-1 Pittsburgh victory in overtime,
Gretzky skated a few slow laps around the ice before a cheering
capacity crowd which included many of the greatest players of his
era, including Mark Messier and Mario Lemieux. T
</P>
<P>
   The trip was like the tours teams take when they are awarded the
Stanley Cup, but teams like the Rangers, who don't qualify for the
playoffs, have no trophies to hold aloft. So Gretzky waved with his
bare hands, blew kisses to his wife, gave up a thumbs-up here and
there and picked up a few hats thrown by fans and put them on his
head, one a blue Yankees cap, another a red beret. On one of his
laps, his teammates fell in behind him in formation, clapping their
hands along with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be a celebration,'' Gretzky said, referring to
the ceremonies held before, during and after the game. ``I didn't
want everybody crying and all that stuff. The Rangers did a nice
job at keeping it short, sweet and classy.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon also included video-taped messages on the
scoreboard screen from Michael Jordan, the retired basketball star,
and Gordie Howe, one of the other two hockey players mentioned with
Gretzky as the best of all time. The other member of the trinity is
Bobby Orr.
</P>
<P>
   Before the opening faceoff, the Rangers gave Gretsky a black
Mercedes S500 automobile. During timeouts, the scoreboard screen
showed highlights of his great moments on ice as well as some silly
ones from television appearances when he was younger and had longer
hair. Before periods and after the game, the house lights were
dimmed and images of Gretzky doing marvelous things with the
Edmonton Oilers, the Los Angeles Kings, the St. Louis Blues, the
Rangers and Team Canada were projected on the smooth white ice. It
created a ghostly effect, appropriate for a wispy player with silky
moves whose exploits are now all in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only am I mentally ready to retire, I'm physically ready
to retire,'' Gretzky said. ``It's hard. This is a great game, but
it's a hard game. I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier, who played with Gretzky for nine seasons and four
Stanley Cups in Edmonton and for one year in New York, said he
supported Gretzky's decision. ``Hockey's a tough game and a
dangerous game,'' said Messier, now the captain of the Vancouver
Canucks. ``And you need to be prepared and you need to be mentally
and physically ready to play. And if you're not, it can get
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   To play successfully and avoid injuries, a player must be
``completely consumed'' by the game, Messier said, and he indicated
that Gretzky had told him he had lost that edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne didn't feel that he was doing that,'' Messier said. ``I
think that's probably why he retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, who retired two years ago after being treated for
Hodgkin's disease and battling back problems, seemed to be in
agreement. ``There just comes a time when you step back and realize
that maybe you're not the player that you were years ago,'' Lemieux
said. ``I'm sure it had an effect in Wayne's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky called Messier the greatest player he ever played with
and Lemieux the best he ever played against.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky scored no goals Sunday before Jaromir Jagr's goal 1
minute 22 seconds into overtime ended the game, but he added one
assist to his unmatched totals. Every time he touched the puck, the
fans rose to their feet, gasped and cheered. In 20 seasons in the
National Hockey League, he had 2,857 points _ 894 goals and 1,963
assists _ in regular-season play. No other player is even close in
any scoring category. He also played one season in the World Hockey
Association, and his statistics there provide an odd historical
footnote. Combining NHL and WHA games, in both the regular season
and playoffs, he finished his 21 seasons as a professional with
1,072 goals. Howe, who also played in both leagues, finished with
1,071.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky spent only the last three seasons of his career in New
York, and his effectiveness declined noticeably in that span. Until
Sunday, the most interesting and memorable game of his Ranger
career was a playoff match with Florida two years ago in which he
scored a three-goal hat trick to lead a victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans in the Garden Sunday, many from out of town, were
there to cheer the whole career, and the presentation was tasteful.
During the pre-game warmup, fans by the Rangers bench, many wearing
his jersey, stood and bowed with their extended arms in an
exaggerated sign of worship. He threw pucks to them. Instead of the
rock anthems that usually accompany hockey shows in the 1990s, the
speaker system was programmed thematically, and lyrics such as
``nobody does it better'' and ``the trick, you said, was never play
the game too long'' were heard.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Bryan Adams sang ``O, Canada!'' even though two
American-based teams were playing, and he changed a line near the
end of the anthem to ``We're going to miss you, Wayne Gretzky.''
The commissioner of the NHL, Gary Bettman, announced that Gretzky's
uniform number, 99, would never be worn again by an NHL player.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, whose mother, father, wife and children were at the
Garden, said he might some day consider owning an NHL team but that
he just wanted to get away from the game for a little while and
hang around with his family and maybe play some. Still an athlete,
he had plans for Monday. ``I'm going bowling,'' he said.

DNA TESTS ARE FREEING SCORES OF PRISON INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (js) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ It was a gruesome slaying. Debra Sue Carter, a
21-year-old barmaid, was found on the floor of her garage apartment
in December 1982 in Ada, a town of 16,000 people southeast of
Oklahoma City. She had been raped, and words were written on her
nude body in ketchup and fingernail polish.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, two men were charged with murder in the case.
They were well known in Ada: one was a junior high school science
teacher and coach, Dennis Fritz; the other, Ronald Williamson, was
a local hero who had played minor league baseball for the Oakland
Athletics and the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific evidence helped convict them: 17 hairs found on the
victim's body and analyzed under a microscope. At their trials in
1988, an expert from the state crime laboratory testified that some
of the hairs were an exact match to Fritz, and the others to
Williamson. The expert also said that semen found on the body could
have come from them.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz received a life sentence, and Williamson was sentenced to
die. At one point, Williamson came within five days of being
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week they were freed by newer scientific evidence, DNA
analysis that was not available 12 years ago. DNA analysis showed
that the hairs and semen could not have come from either of the two
men.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA tests were done by five laboratories, including one at
the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, the same agency that
had done the microscopic tests in the 1980s. Now the labs say the
DNA matches that of a convicted kidnapper who testified against the
two men.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the Oklahoma case calls into question
unproven science that has led to criminal convictions for a
century. The men are the 61st and 62nd inmates in the nation to be
exonerated by DNA evidence, according to the Justice Department.
Williamson is the 78th person in the country since 1970 to be
cleared after being on death row, says the Death Penalty
Information Center, an anti-death penalty group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get thousands of people out,'' said Barry Scheck, a
lawyer for Fritz and director of the Innocence Project at the
Benjamin Cardozo School of Law in New York. Scheck was a lawyer in
the O.J. Simpson murder trial who attacked DNA evidence against the
former football star because, Scheck said, the methods used to
collect and analyze that evidence were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juries eat it up when someone says `expert' and `science,' ''
said Mark Barrett, who along with Sara Bonnell represents
Williamson for the State of Oklahoma's Indigent Defense System.
``Hair analysis, handwriting analysis, bite-mark analysis _
unproven science has no place in the courtroom,'' Barrett
continued. ``Everyone who's ever been convicted on microscopic
evidence ought to have their case reopened.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers are pushing for federal legislation to guarantee
inmates an opportunity to require DNA testing. Only New York and
Illinois have such laws. Fritz, for example, had exhausted his
appeals and would not be free now if his DNA had not been tested as
part of Williamson's case.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against Fritz and Williamson included the testimony
of two jailhouse informers and a witness who was a felon. One
informer said that she had heard Williamson threaten to kill his
mother as he had killed Ms. Carter. A witness at the bar where Ms.
Carter worked said he had seen Williamson there the night of the
killing. And prosecutors made much of a dream that Williamson said
he had had about the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case had all the building blocks of a wrongful
conviction,'' Barrett said. ``Unproven science, a jailhouse snitch,
a dream and a tainted eyewitness.''
</P>
<P>
   That witness is now the suspect. The DNA tests show that the
genetic material of the witness, Glen Gore, 38, matches the semen.
Gore, who was serving three 40-year sentences for kidnapping and
other charges unrelated to Ms. Carter's murder, walked away from a
prison work crew on Wednesday and remained at large Sunday. He has
not been charged in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz and Williamson, at a fund-raising picnic by the local
chapter of Amnesty International Sunday afternoon, said they were
angry and wanted to be compensated. Fritz, 49, who became something
of a jailhouse lawyer, plans to move back to Kansas City to be with
his mother and to spend time with his daughter, 25, here. He said
he might work for the Innocence Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some student loans to pay off _ they've been charging
me interest all this time,'' Fritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson's brown hair has turned gray. Now 46, he has recently
been hospitalized for a pre-existing mental illness, bipolar
disorder. He said that playing the guitar made life tolerable in
the state's death-row cells, which are underground.
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered suicide before his new trial was ordered
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting out of this state,'' Williamson said. ``A lot of
people still think we must have been guilty or we wouldn't have
been charged.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday, the two men visited with an aide to Gov. Frank
Keating, seeking compensation for the time they served.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson's lawyer, Barrett, said that most Oklahomans favor
the death penalty, all the more since the bombing, four years ago
on Monday, that killed 168 people at the federal building here. The
state has executed 15 inmates since 1990, when executions resumed
after a 24-year gap; it has about 150 prisoners on death row, out
of 3,500 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one case, people think that it could just be a mistake,''
Barrett said. ``But with 78 cases, they start to see that there's
an epidemic of wrongful convictions. The error rate in the death
penalty is not one that would be acceptable in most people's lines
of work.''

 &HT;    As new week begins, so do new lives for many fire victims
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE _ Some residents who saw their homes go up in
smoke three days ago prayed for understanding and comfort at area
churches Sunday, a reprieve from the monumental tasks of starting
over again. Others sifted through the remains of their obliterated
homes in search of prized belongings as if they were on an
archaeological dig. But as the fire dwindled to tiny hot areas
underground, what residents haven't done is heal much.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's service, Raymond and Mary-Ellen Sanchez, both 33,
and their two daughters cried as one as they spoke with Fr. Frank
diPasquale near the altar in St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in
western Port St. Lucie, just blocks from the now-charred lands. The
fire leveled their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no family here,'' Mary-Ellen said. ``This is my family
here, my church. I guess I need to let it out and what better place
to let it out than here?.... We have worked together for 14 years
and to see it washed away in seconds, it's heart-wrenching.''
</P>
<P>
   At Holy Family Catholic Church, Fr. Tom Cauley told his
parishioners to look to God and dwell on the positive: the massive
donations and the moral support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taught us in the past week something about our capacity
to do good,'' he said. ``He teaches us through life experience. We
have come together in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   On Franklin Street, 59-year-old Martha Brann dug through the
pool of dust, ash, and stones that used to be her house, trying to
recover buried, burned jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, it's becoming real tiresome,'' she said. ``I mean
at night, last night, I might have gotten three hours sleep.'' In a
small but meaningful blessing, Red Cross volunteer Judi Arel
brought her a present: a diamond-studded cross Brann's son gave to
her last Christmas that Arel had found in the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what she wanted,'' Arel said. ``She's been telling me
for two days about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire was all but completely out Sunday, with two teams of
Navajo firefighters identifying and extinguishing hot spots.
Division of Forestry personnel stayed in St. Lucie County to
organize the final phases of eliminating the blazes' remnants and
to be available should another emergency arise, division senior
forester John Fish said. About 85 workers from his division, the
federal government, the South Florida Water Management District,
and other agencies were working Sunday, he said. Most of St. Lucie
County's firefighters were back to their normal schedules,
department firefighter Jeff Stabile said.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of burned land was scaled back to 759 acres from
previous reports of 2,400 acres, Fish said. The larger number
includes the area within a general fire perimeter, but not all of
the land inside that perimeter actually caught on fire, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Power was restored to all 2,000 residents who had been without
electricity in the fire area, Bell South spokesman Rob Seitz said
in a news release. Telephone service was restored to everyone
without significant damage, spokeswoman Janice Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators still haven't determined what caused the fire,
Fish said. ``It's obviously human caused,'' he said. ``Just was it
malicious?'' Investigators may have an answer sometime this week,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though short-lived rains Saturday made brush less incendiary,
firefighters are still wary of the potential for more problems, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility's always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing complaints that the ravaged neighborhoods should have
had fire hydrants, Fish said they wouldn't have made a difference
since Thursday's whipping winds caused the fire to turn into a
conflagration in such a short time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hydrants are only as good as the fire trucks you have
hooked to them,'' he said. ``Really, water was not a limiting
factor.''

   MORINI, Albania _ As Serbian authorities resumed their brutal,
arbitrary purge of Kosovo, a further tragedy Sunday temporarily
halted the hordes crossing into Albania with frightened faces. Five
refugees, including three children, died when their small car was
blown to bits by a powerful anti-tank mine placed at the border as
a Serbian defense against a possible NATO assault.
</P>
<P>
   The pause was brief. Soon, the Yugoslav authorities had reopened
their border, and the flow was back to about 1,000 refugees an
hour. They came on tractors with shot-out tires, in carts drawn by
desperately tired horses draped with incongruously decorative red
tassels, and thousands were said to be heading for the border on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   With 30,000 refugees arriving in Albania and Macedonia on
Saturday, and another 40,000 either leaving Kosovo or massing at
its borders on Sunday, international monitors here believe this
could mark the beginning of another major effort by Serb forces to
purge Kosovo of its Albanian majority under cover of the NATO air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   With many villages already cleared, refugees report that Serb
forces are combing the hillsides for Albanians hiding there.
Refugee accounts also indicate that the central areas of cities
like Mitrovica are being cleared _ a description underscored by the
arrival of larger, more expensive automobiles that hurry past
tractors and horse-drawn wagons as soon as they arrive in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Yugoslavia and Albania are being heightened not
just by the flow of refugees, but increasing battles across the
border that the Serbs attribute to ethnic Albanian guerrillas
hiding out in Albania, and Albania attributes to Serbian
aggression. Either way, Yugoslavia severed diplomatic relations
with Albania Sunday, the Albanian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are subject to the arbitrary whims of the Serbs,
who are determined to show they rule Kosovo. Even as Serbian forces
expel huge groups from their homes in Kosovo, the Yugoslav
authorities have repeatedly and arbitrarily clamped the borders
shut. The refugees are then forced from the border, or collected in
columns several miles long, either herded by Serbs or left to fend
for themselves until the next border opening. International
monitors are not certain what this is intended to accomplish, nor
can they at times be certain what the lack of refugees at certain
crossings means. That was the case on April 7, when thousands of
refugees who were turned back at the border seemed to vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities clamped the border shut again after Sunday
morning's explosion, chasing away other refugees who were
attempting to help the survivors. The bodies of three children in
the car were brought back to Yugoslavia, monitors said.
</P>
<P>
   The border crossing then was quiet through the early morning, as
a heavy rain again pounded this area of eastern Albania, turning
camps and fields housing more than 75,000 refugees into seas of
slimy mud and wet clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the border reopened just after 9 a.m., the stream
of refugees resumed, with monitors reporting about 6,000 by
mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There may be as many as 60,000 refugees on their way to the
border crossing here, many of them moving on foot, said Owen
O'Sullivan, chief of the observer team from the Organization for
Cooperation and Security in Europe, which has been monitoring the
border.
</P>
<P>
   He said the presence of the mines on the Yugoslav side of the
border has been known since they were placed there about two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The mines are set on the asphalt just behind a series of squat
concrete pyramids that are lined up across the entrance to the
narrow bridge that joins the border crossing in Yugoslavia with
Albania.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sunday morning's deadly mine blast killed five of seven refugees
squeezed into a small white sedan. They were all members of a
family rousted from their home in the village of Belacevac, near
Pristina, by Serbian troops Friday afternoon. Witnesses said that a
tractor-pulled cart went off the asphalt roadway early Sunday
morning. Since the concrete barricades block most of the roadway,
there is only a narrow slot left through which refugees can pass.
</P>
<P>
   To get the wagon back on the road, the refugees tried to clear
some space by getting a few vehicles to back up. Ibush Berisha, 44,
of Belacevac, tried moving slowly in reverse to a position near the
concrete barricades
</P>
<P>
   ``The road was blocked so he pulled back and tried to park the
car right next to the barricades,'' said Saim Cucalli, 60, a
retired professor, also from Belacevac, whose cart had gone off the
road and caused the congestion. ``When Ibush backed up the car, it
exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   The rear half and roof of the small sedan were blown off.
Cucalli said several of the victims were thrown from the car by the
power of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran to try to help them but the Serbian police told us to
get lost because the area was filled with mines,'' he said. ``So we
had to leave them.'' Bjork Therkildsen, a monitor with the European
group, said the bodies of the three children who died were taken
from the border by Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car was treated at a local hospital in Kukes
and released. His wife and mother both died, while another son was
rushed to a hospital in Tirana, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   When Yugoslav guards reopened the border at 9:20, refugees
immediately began to cross, staring at the wreckage. Like most
other refugees, they carried stories of beatings and robbery by
Serbian police, and of a strong push by Serb authorities to expel
them.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from around Belacevac, said that a few days ago there
was a skirmish between Serb troops and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the separatist rebels. They also said that Serbs burned the house
of an Albanian family in Belacevac and wounded two women who tried
to run away.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NATO bombings began more than three weeks ago, more
than 600,000 Albanians have been forced out of Kosovo, according to
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Well over half have come
to Albania, placing an enormous burden on aid groups and on
Europe's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   The border crossing at Morini, as well as the city of Kukes,
about 10 miles away, have become increasingly dangerous. In the
past week, five cross-border rocket bombs presumably aimed at a
nearby rebel encampment fell just outside the city. And observers
have reported mortar fire across the border.

   NEW YORK _ While waiting in the tunnels of Madison Square Garden
before the start of the tributes to Wayne Gretzky, seated behind
the goal watching the game and appearing at the post-game
interviews, Mark Messier never removed his sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a look he sought to effect. It was simply that he
wanted protection from the flashing cameras if he could not hold
back the tears.
</P>
<P>
   Messier, Gretzky's teammate on the great Edmonton Oiler teams of
the 1980s and then on the New York Rangers, walked onto the ice
during the pre-game tribute Sunday after flying in from Vancouver.
The sound was deafening as fans roared their appreciation for the
greatness of Gretzky and for the enormous contributions of Messier.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps there was no greater measurement of the greatness of
Gretzky than the fact that he reduced players who would fill the
ladder below him to the level of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Messier stood on the ice beside Mario Lemieux before the game,
joined by Gretzky and his former coach and general manager in
Edmonton, Glen Sather. Also on hand were Paul Coffey, a vital
component of those Oiler teams; Mike Keenan, who coached Gretzky
briefly in St. Louis, and Ulf Samuelsson, who had been dealt by the
Rangers earlier this season. Gordie Howe presented a recorded video
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have missed it for the world,'' Messier said. ``You
know, it was kind of fun sitting in the crowd tonight, too, and
just watching the whole show come down from a fan perspective. We
don't get that opportunity to sit in the stands with the people and
hear the comments and that's what I really wanted to do tonight, to
really come here and just _ I know it's hard because of all the
things going on _ but just try to take it all in like a fan would
and sit in the seats and watch the game. It was a great way to see
him play his last game.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier was showered with as much gratitude as anyone to take a
turn on the ice Sunday, the memory of the Stanley Cup he brought to
New York still vivid. But what brought Messier here, skipping a
Canucks team dinner to attend, was a chance to pay tribute to not
only a great player, but to a friend, and to honor a friendship
that began when the two were just kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Wayne and I have been growing up together as
18-year-olds and going through the things we did obviously cemented
a bond between us that is next to being brothers, so to speak,''
Messier said. ``I just think that there was so much pressure on him
and he knew he had some friends that he was able to talk to when we
were younger, where he could be Wayne Gretzky himself inside the
dressing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier said that in their conversations this week, he never
attempted to talk Gretzky out of his decision to leave the game,
but admitted that it made him reflect on the 20 years that have
passed and where his own career stands.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, the Pittsburgh Penguins' star who retired early after
incurring Hodgkin's disease and then returned to back problems that
he could not overcome, understood Gretzky's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always too soon when you see a great player retire,''
Lemieux said. ``You always think they can play until they're 40, 45
years old. But there just comes a time when you step back and you
realize that, maybe you're not the player that you were years ago.
That's always frustrating for a great athlete, not being able to
play at the level they once played at and I'm sure that had an
effect on Wayne's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional today,'' he added of watching Gretzky
take those final laps around the ice, just as Lemieux had in
Pittsburgh. ``I almost cried a couple of times. I remember the way
I felt in Pittsburgh when I skated around and thanked the fans and
everybody that had been a part of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be on that score sheet with him some way
tonight,'' said Brian Leetch, the Ranger captain, who scored the
lone Rangers goal, on an assist from Gretzky and Mathieu Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we scored at the end of the second, I retaped my stick
like I usually do. Then I was looking at it and I said, `You know I
really shouldn't take this out on the ice in case it breaks or
something.' Wayne had just given me one of the sticks that he had
signed and I took those two and put them in the back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sather also hurried to New York to see this final tribute to
Gretzky, who began his NHL career in Edmonton under his tutelage.
But he admitted that he had little to teach Gretzky, who arrived as
a slightly built 17-year-old, but armed with an intelligence for
the game that was unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is a million memories as far as I'm concerned,''
Sather said. ``Not only in the games, but in the practices, locker,
on the buses. I don't know what he's going to leave as far as the
fans are concerned, probably the way he sets up behind the net,
tricky behind-the-back passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is one thing. We used to play a game in
Edmonton of three-on-three, and he would fool around with us like
he'd fool around with his kids in the backyard, except he was
fooling around with pro players and guys who had played pro hockey
their entire lives. It was like he was just having a good time with
us and we couldn't get the puck off of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The memories that I have about Wayne don't have too much with
what he did on the ice,'' Sather added. ``I think it's what he did
off the ice.'' &QL;

WEEK OF ABORTION PROTESTS BEGINS LOUDLY IN BUFFALO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ On the first day of a much-anticipated weeklong
rally, anti-abortion protesters returned to the streets of Buffalo
in full-throated fashion Sunday, seven years after raucous
anti-abortion protests here triggered more than 600 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   There was an abundance of enthusiasm and displays of conviction
but no violence and no arrests in three events Sunday, a morning
church service, an afternoon news conference and an evening church
meeting filled with songs and videos. The events were organized by
the national anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, the sponsor of
the weeklong rally here and in other parts of western New York that
is being called Operation Save America.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a sign, perhaps, of the frenzied week to come when
abortion-rights supporters appeared, unannounced, at the
anti-abortion news conference and rally, held in downtown Buffalo.
They chanted slogans, hoping to drown out their opponents or to at
least provide a running commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing to be here at the epicenter of the spiritual
battle that's manifesting itself in western New York,'' said Jerry
Crawford, who is coordinating the efforts of Operation Save America
in Rochester. His voice bellowing with fortitude, he continued,
``There is a Holy God, and this nation has deeply, deeply offended
him!''
</P>
<P>
   To which an abortion-rights protester shouted, ``Are you God's
public relations assistant?''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Operation Save America seems to be an event made for
the cameras. The rally is taking place less than six months after
the as-yet unsolved killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a physician who
performed abortions and was shot in his home in a Buffalo suburb by
a sniper. And Buffalo is a city that, thanks to the Blizzard of '77
and the Spring of Life, as the abortion protests of 1992 were
known, is stuck with an image of being a magnet for unruly weather
and unruly demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expect this week's rally to be smaller than the 1992
event, with perhaps 200 to 600 people from around the country,
compared with more than 1,000 people in 1992. They have also
broadened their protests this time to include child pornography,
school violence and teen-age sex. Anti-abortion demonstrators plan
to stake out positions in front of bookstores, schools and other
locations in addition to abortion clinics, including the one where
Slepian worked.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the plans, abortion-rights protesters said they
expected to shadow their adversaries every step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their kind of America is an America of male domination, of
racism, of theocracy,'' said Mary Lou Greenberg, a longtime
activist and abortion-rights supporter from Manhattan who
participated in the march across the Brooklyn Bridge in memory of
Amadou Diallo on Thursday before traveling to Buffalo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the unexpected presence of abortion-rights supporters
providing a dueling soundtrack, Sunday's news conference was also
noteworthy for what the anti-abortion leaders said of their plans
to deal with a recent court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a victory for abortion-rights activists and State
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara
agreed to expand to at least 50 feet the 15-foot buffer zones
between protesters and abortion clinics. Sunday, though, the Rev.
Flip Benham, the national director of Operation Rescue, hinted that
his followers would test the limit, if not flout the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think those buffer zones are the most ridiculous
things you've ever heard of in your life?'' said Benham, clutching
a Bible and smiling on a chilly, blustery day under slate-gray
skies. ``We are going to honor the law of Almighty God and submit
to Him, no matter what the cost.''

   Four-legged gal crashes street party

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Freaknik was three days of calm.
</P>
<P>
   Beefnik was 30 minutes of udder chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Maxwell, 57, was hauling two newly purchased cows from
Fairburn, Ga. to his home in Braselton, Ga. on Sunday afternoon
when his cattle trailer overturned between Fifth and 10th streets
on the Downtown Connector. The cows broke away when Maxwell and
Atlanta police tried to transfer them to a police horse trailer.
One cow was quickly apprehended. The other became a four-legged
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   With all northbound traffic backed up at the wreck scene, the
cow hoofed it down the empty northbound lanes of the connector,
ignoring police officers who surrounded the moving animal like a
cloud of flies. About 40 police made chase on foot, on motorcycles,
in patrol cars.
</P>
<P>
   The cow traveled down the exit lane, hung a quick right onto
Peachtree Place and ducked into an alley halfway up the block. She
scampered behind the building, crossed Spring Street and was
trapped in the walled corner of a parking lot across from a
Checkers hamburger restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While helicopters from television stations hovered, police
closed in and finally lassoed the cow. Both cows were taken to the
mounted patrol facility in Grant Park until Maxwell finds a new
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   The massive response was available because so many officers were
on Freaknik duty. Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard put the
episode into perspective: ``This is one female that didn't get the
word the nice girls were supposed to stay away.''

DODGERS THROW IT AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Through two weeks, opponents have run against
Dodgers pitchers and catchers, and pinch-runner Reggie Sanders was
set to do the same in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   He never got the chance, though the threat of a steal proved
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers reliever Alan Mills' errant pickoff throw wound up near
the Dodgers' bullpen and allowed Sanders to move to third. Phil
Nevin followed with an RBI double as the Padres beat the Dodgers
4-3 on Sunday at Qualcomm Stadium to send L.A. limping home.
</P>
<P>
   After sending the fans notice with a 5-1 start, the Dodgers
ended a road trip that was no trip at all, losing five of seven on
their first venture away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Dodgers were 15 games above .500 at home but
were 35-46 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first week it was, `Oh boy, they're the greatest
thing going, go look at the new-look Dodgers,''' first baseman Eric
Karros said. ``We haven't played well this week and it's, `Oh, boy,
it's the same club as last year.' If we get into June and July and
we're still hovering around .500, then there's issues.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the only issue in the series finale against the Padres
was what happened in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers lefty Onan Masaoka walked Wally Joyner with one out.
Mills, who had allowed one run in six appearances, came on in
relief and Sanders pinch-ran for Joyner. Given Dodgers catcher Todd
Hundley's inability to throw out runners so far in 1999, there was
little question Sanders would try to move up a base.
</P>
<P>
   The first 12 would-be base-stealers of the season were
successful against Hundley. And though he did throw out two Padres
on Sunday, both came after the runners slid past second base.
</P>
<P>
   With that as the backdrop, Mills tried to keep Sanders close at
first. But his pickoff throw was into the runner. Karros couldn't
reach the ball, and the speedy Sanders moved to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw the ball away,'' Mills said. ``Simple and plain.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevin, pinch-hitting, then lined a double to the right-field
wall to score Sanders and give the Padres a 4-3 lead. Trevor
Hoffman recorded the final three outs for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miceli (1-0) pitched an inning of scoreless relief for the
win. Masaoka (0-1) allowed an unearned run for the first decision
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those mistakes kill you,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``That was a tough one. Hate to kind of beat ourselves, but that's
what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't help themselves by stranding 10 runners on
base. They had only one hit _ a double by Raul Mondesi _ in 10
at-bats with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix was the Dodgers' inability to score with runners
on second and third with one out. Devon White, who smacked a
pinch-hit three-run homer Saturday, tried to score on Mondesi's
sharp grounder to third. He was thrown out at the plate by Dave
Magadan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dodgers took a 3-2 lead in the seventh when Mondesi
and Karros hit solo homers off Padres reliever Donne Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who points to the bench and the bullpen as the two most
crucial components of a team, put his relief pitchers in perfect
position to face the lefty-dominated Padres lineup late.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes began the seventh by striking
out Damian Jackson, but allowed a single to Eric Owens. Valdes,
bothered by a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand,
was lifted in favor of Masaoka, a lefty. Switch-hitter Quilvio
Veras delivered a single to right to score Owens.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Masaoka walked Joyner with one out, bringing in
Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good things happen, a lot of close games,''
Johnson said. ``(A) 3-4 road trip would have been better than 2-5.
But I like the way this club battled.''

   _ NATO said Sunday that the previous 24 hours had been the

Brussels said 36 targets were struck overnight, including an

SPORTS COLUMN: NEVER A GAME QUITE LIKE IT
</HEADLINE>
   (See also HKN-RANGERS-PENGUINS) 
(rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The other great ones never had an advertised last
game. Babe Ruth hit three home runs one day for the Boston Braves,
and left soon after. Michael Jordan's last shot won a sixth title
for the Chicago Bulls six months before he walked away. Joe Montana
threw his last pass, then announced his departure.
</P>
<P>
   But hockey's Great One, 38-year-old Wayne Gretzky, had an
advertised last game Sunday, and there has never been a game in any
sport quite like it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other great ones, the Great One had a last chance to
hear a last hurrah doing what he did. In a game. With the New York
Rangers long eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs, the 2-1
overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins didn't mean as much as his
assist on Brian Leetch's goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian,'' he said later with a modest smile, ``will go down as
the guy who scored the last goal that I ever set up.''
</P>
<P>
   Engrave the numbers now in his NHL career records: 1,963 assists
to go with 894 goals for 2,857 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's game wasn't so much a game as it was a celebration
of all the games in the Great One's career.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed commissioner Gary Bettman saying, ``When you take off
that sweater, your jersey, you will be the last player in the NHL
to ever wear 99.'' He appreciated the fond farewells from Mark
Messier, Mario Lemieux and, on the video board, Michael Jordan. He
peeked at the videotapes of his historic goals.
</P>
<P>
   When the game was over, he skated slowly around the Madison
Square Garden ice, waving to all the fans who were standing and
applauding. As if he didn't want to leave. And the game had
provided the perfect stage, the perfect ending for a career
arguably more dominant than that of any athlete in any sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hockey player,'' he said Thursday night in Ottawa after
his last game in Canada. ``That's what I am. I play hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   He never tried to be anything else. Never wanted to be anything
else. And he played hockey more artistically than anyone ever has
in a sport known for its often brutal toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday, that artistry was there, just not as much of it as
there once was. But whenever he touched the puck, the crowd roared,
hoping he would do something magical, as he so often had.
</P>
<P>
   John Muckler, the Rangers' coach, was hoping that, too, when he
called a timeout with about 30 seconds remaining in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up,'' the Great One said later, ``and I said, `My
goodness, I've got 30 seconds to go.' That's when it hit me that I
was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Muckler had received a note that his daughter
in Edmonton had given birth to a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the timeout,'' Gretzky recalled, ``John said, `I just
had a grandson today in Edmonton and you've got to get the winner.'
And maybe when I was younger, I might have got that winner for him,
but I didn't get it for him today.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, on a breakaway, he appeared to have a chance for
that winner, but Tom Barrasso, the Penguins goaltender, swooped to
the puck first. And after only 1 minute 22 seconds of overtime,
Jaromir Jagr scored the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was fitting that the best young player in the game
scored in overtime,'' the Great One said, meaning Jagr. ``Everyone
talks about passing torches and all that stuff. He caught it.
That's what I told him. I said, `You caught it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Great One laughed, adding that Jagr told him, ``I didn't
mean to do that.'' Then Gretzky said he told Jagr, ``That's what I
used to say.''
</P>
<P>
   With the game decided, the Great One shook hands with the
Penguins as if a Stanley Cup playoff series had ended, hugged his
Ranger teammates, then skated in slow circles and waved to the
applause that had seemed almost continuous since he had glided onto
the ice for the warm-up before the last of all his games that began
with those one-on-one games as a youngster in Brantford, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built our backyard rink,'' his father, Walter, remembered,
``because I was freezing waiting for him at the other rinks. He'd
go in our backyard with the kid next door the goaltender, Brian
Rizzetto.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 5, Wayne Gretzky's hockey genius was obvious. Playing
against 10- and 11-year-olds, he made the Brantford novice all-star
team. At age 11, he scored 378 goals in 68 games, including 3 in 45
seconds. But of all the games and all the goals, his father's
favorite occurred on Dec. 30, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone rang late that night,'' Walter Gretzky recalled.
``Wayne said, `I called to let you know I did it _ 50 goals in 39
games.' I said, `What took you so long?'''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard had scored 50 goals in a 50-game
season for the Montreal Canadiens more than half a century ago and
Mike Bossy had scored 50 in 50 for the Islanders, but the Great One
had scored his 50 in only 39 games, en route to 92 goals that
season and a nickname that is almost an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate mediocrity,'' the Great One once said. ``If there's one
thing I can't accept, it's mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Wayne Gretzky still has too much artistry to be
mediocre, the threat of mediocrity is as good a reason as any as to
why he played his advertised last game. &QL;

THE SLOW WORK OF PICKING JURORS IN POLICE ABUSE CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One prospective juror said her judgment could be
affected because her father was a retired police detective. She was
excused.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that two of his brothers were retired New York City
officers and that his son was an officer in Connecticut, but that
he would have ``no problem'' being impartial. He was accepted for
the preliminary panel, and so could be part of the final jury that
will judge the case against five New York police officers.
</P>
<P>
   So it has gone in recent days in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn
as a judge and lawyers go about the slow work of selecting a jury
for the trial in one of the city's most emotionally and racially
charged cases in recent years, that of four officers accused of
brutalizing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, and of a sergeant
accused of joining them in an attempted cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection resumes Monday with 24 people picked so far for
Judge Eugene Nickerson's preliminary panel of 100. Twelve jurors
and six alternates are to be chosen from that panel.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of interviews last week, the judge dismissed 26
people for various reasons; some were ill, some had business
commitments and some admitted that they might not be able to base
their verdicts exclusively on the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were excused because of a personal link to one
defendant, Officer Justin Volpe, 27. He is accused of ramming a
toilet plunger handle into Louima's rectum and then his mouth in a
police station restroom after Louima's arrest in a street brawl in
Brooklyn in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was young, my son would ride bicycles with Mr.
Volpe,'' one woman said. She did not say how long ago that was. The
other jury candidate said, ``I know the Volpe family through the
Boy Scouts of America.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the alleged restroom attack, Volpe is accused of
beating Louima in a police car. Prosecutors say that another
officer, Charles Schwarz, held Louima down during the restroom
attack and also beat him in the car, that Officers Thomas Wiese and
Thomas Bruder were also involved in the car beating and that Sgt.
Michael Bellomo tried to cover up that beating. All five say the
charges are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   In a case laden with racial overtones _ Louima is black and the
officers are white _ the racial breakdown of the 24 people accepted
for the preliminary panel is 21 whites and three blacks. Of the 50
people the judge has interviewed so far, five have been black.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 were called from a group of more than 750 prospective
jurors. Lawyers in the case said they thought that the preliminary
panel of 100 would ultimately reflect the racial makeup of the
court's district, which includes Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island
and Long Island and is 23 percent black, according to the latest
Census Bureau estimates.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Yale and Harvard universities have long
dueled over who has the best students, best football team and best
law school, but over the weekend they competed with conferences
aimed at building academia's bonds with the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer numbers, Yale won hands down, attracting 500 people to
Harvard's 150. But the Harvard students did not seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can only bode well for the labor movement that there are
two, three or four conferences taking place on the same weekend,''
said Aaron Bartley, a first-year Harvard law student who helped
organize the conference at his school. ``It indicates there is a
new level of attention and interest in labor issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Many participants said the fact that students from two of the
nation's most prestigious universities _ places hardly viewed as
bastions of the proletariat _were flocking to conferences on labor
illustrates just how far the union movement has come since four
years ago, when labor seemed comatose.
</P>
<P>
   The two conferences had somewhat different themes. At Harvard,
the focus was on creating a nationwide student-labor alliance to
build on recent anti-sweatshop demonstrations on campuses. The
students say they hope to use their voice to help unions on a
variety of issues, like increasing wages for university janitors.
</P>
<P>
   To make theirs a nationwide effort, the Harvard students worked
with students at Stanford in California and Kent State in Ohio, who
also held labor-related conferences this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, one focus was on helping the university's more than
1,000 graduate teaching assistants form a union. The school has
refused to grant them union recognition, insisting that they are
students, not workers. The other focus was on protecting the right
of all workers to organize, as speakers asserted that hardball
corporate tactics, like firing union supporters and threatening to
close factories, had denied millions of American workers the right
to join unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harassment, intimidation and coercion are routine in union
elections across America,'' Linda Chavez-Thomson, AFL-CIO executive
vice president, said at the opening session of the Yale conference
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Students, professors and union members crowded into the
185-year-old Center Church on the New Haven Green to hear labor
leaders and intellectuals talk about how the right to organize was
systematically trampled and how unions were pivotal in building
better lives for workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the great struggle to form unions in the 1930s and
1940s that led to the great middle class in the 1950s and 1960s,''
said John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm was the returning hero at the conference, having made a
name for himself in labor circles since graduating from Yale three
decades ago. Wilhelm, often mentioned as a possible future
president of the AFL-CIO, helped lead Yale's secretaries in a
unionization drive 15 years ago and more recently spearheaded one
of the nation's most successful unionization campaigns, in which
tens of thousands of Las Vegas hotel and casino workers have joined
his union.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm's appearance had an ulterior motive: to recruit some of
the nation's best and brightest into the union movement. He told
the students that the hotel workers' union had someone on hand, as
did the AFL-CIO, to sign up anyone interested in a career in the
labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-nine years ago, I answered an ad: `Labor trainees
wanted. Long hours. Low pay.' '' he said. ``We're still running the
same ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Clawson, a sociology professor at the University of
Massachusetts, one of the organizers of the Yale conference, said
the meeting was intended in part to attract students to labor
careers. The conference featured workshops on women and unions,
becoming an organizer, overhauling the health-care industry,
teaching social change and organizing graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope it will help to show students a different
world and alternative possibilities,'' he said. ``There are
exciting events taking place and possibilities for engagement and
even employment outside the corporate world.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opening session of the Harvard conference, Marshall Ganz,
a former organizing director with the United Farm Workers who
teaches a course on organizing at the Kennedy School of Government,
said it was short-sighted of unions not to reach out to students in
the past. One reason unions declined in recent decades, he said,
was that they had largely shunned younger people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unions were afraid of universities in the 1960s, and they cut
themselves off to a critical source of renewal,'' Ganz said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Harvard conference was smaller than Yale's because it was
set up by students with little outside support. In contrast, the
Yale meeting had considerable financial and logistical assistance
from Connecticut unions, the AFL-CIO and Scholars, Artists and
Writers for Social Justice, a two-year-old group of intellectuals
that has made common cause with labor.
</P>
<P>
   As if to show that they were not elitists who had forgotten how
to take to the streets, the students at Harvard and Yale started
their conferences with protests. At Harvard, dozens of students
rallied at the Museum of Fine Arts to support museum workers in a
contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, undergraduates and union members braved the rain to
join hundreds of graduate students in their unionization drive. One
protest sign said, ``Union Power in Ivory Tower.'' The rally, like
the Yale conference, was a mixture of punkish graduate students,
clean-cut undergraduates, burly construction workers in union
parkas and graying faculty members and labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything said about unions this weekend was positive.
Pointing to the scandal at a union representing New York City
municipal workers, Katha Pollitt, the writer, told the Yale
conference that corruption had turned many people against unions.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, Amanda Cage, a union organizer, had a similar
message, saying, ``One of the biggest problems in organizing
workers is the workers who've had bad experiences with unions in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Harvard conference there was widespread concern
that it was hard to get more than 1 percent of the student body
involved in labor matters. Bill Capowski, executive director of a
group that seeks to mobilize students for pro-labor and progressive
causes, said, ``A troubling problem is that sometimes I see
thousands of students going to the World Wrestling Federation, and
we're wondering, `How come we can't get one or two volunteers for
our office?' ''

MAN SAID TO HAVE CONFESSED TO KILLING OF POLICEWOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Hawaii, Ga., Va.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man charged with killing an Orange, N.J., policewoman
confessed to his mother and to the authorities over the weekend
that he had committed the crime, a person close to his family said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Condell Woodson, 25, who was arrested early
Saturday at the home of a cousin in Newark, N.J., later told his
mother, Beverly Woodson, who visited him at the Essex County Jail,
that he had fatally shot the officer, Joyce Anne Carnegie, in
Orange on the night of April 8, said the person close to the
family, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Essex County prosecutor's office declined Sunday to say if
Woodson had made a formal confession to authorities. But the person
close to the family quoted Woodson's sister, Natasha, as saying
that he had done so.
</P>
<P>
   Several family members who were detained and questioned by
authorities when Woodson was arrested in a predawn raid on Saturday
at the cousin's home in Newark refused to discuss the case Sunday,
and were reluctant even to give their names to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But one, the wife of Woodson's cousin, said Woodson had called
them from the Essex County Jail. ``He called us last night and said
he's not mad at us,'' said the woman, who asked to be identified
only as S. Shields, her maiden name. ``He said he loves us, and
he's just glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews Sunday with Woodson's father and others who have
known the suspect provided a detailed portrait of Woodson as a
troubled young man, who grew up as an Army brat in New Jersey,
Hawaii and Virginia; became a gifted athlete and honor student at
Orange High School; struggled in recent years to hold jobs and
raise a 2-year-old son in Georgia, and has been convicted on a
variety of drug, weapons, robbery and assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had been living in Georgia since 1993, Woodson was
said to have traveled to New Jersey last month after the death of a
grandfather he had been close to. He had then stayed with relatives
and friends in Orange and, since Tuesday, at the home of the cousin
in Newark where he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives, while reluctant to talk about the case, told of
being terrorized by a score of heavily armed federal agents and
police officers, who broke down the front and back doors of their
home in a 3:30 a.m. raid, pointed guns at infants and took eight
people, including three children, into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, who is charged with murder, felony murder, robbery and
weapons offenses in the death of Ms. Carnegie, is being held in
lieu of $1 million bail for an arraignment early this week in Essex
County Superior Court. If convicted, he could face life in prison
or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Sunday that Woodson _ the fourth person
arrested in a convoluted case that began when Ms. Carnegie
approached a robbery suspect and was shot in the head and abdomen
11 days ago _ was traced through a pistol that authorities believe
was used in the shooting.

SUSPECT IN JOURNALIST'S SLAYING IS ARRESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an arrest that could end the seven-year investigation into
the execution-style killing of a crusading antidrug journalist in
New York City, the police in Colombia on Saturday captured a man
who has been considered a major figure in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts published in newspapers in Colombia, the
police arrested Guillermo Leon Restrepo Gaviria in a wealthy
neighborhood known as El Poblado in the city of Medellin. Restrepo
is wanted in the United States by federal prosecutors in the
killing of the journalist, Manuel de Dios Unanue, who was shot in
March 1992 while eating in a Queens restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   De Dios, who was 48, had written several exposes about the Cali
drug cartel for two Spanish-language magazines he published in New
York, Crimen and Cambio 21. De Dios was also a former editor of El
Diario-La Prensa, the largest Spanish-language newspaper in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said de Dios' articles in the magazines enraged
the former leader of the cartel, Jose Santacruz Londono, who
ordered Restrepo to arrange the murder and offered to pay him
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe Restrepo contacted cartel members in New
York to plot the shooting. Six people in the United States were
convicted in the attack. Five of them confessed to participating in
the plot to kill de Dios.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who confessed, John Harold Mena, said he was the
first person Restrepo contacted to plan the killing. Mena became a
leading witness for the prosecution in the case and avoided a life
sentence. In October 1996, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after de Dios was killed, a 19-year-old Colombian
immigrant who prosecutors said was the gunman in the killing,
Wilson Alejandro Mejia Velez, was convicted and sentenced to life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Londono, known in Colombia as ``Mil Rostros,'' or ``A Thousand
Faces,'' was shot to death in a 1996 gunfight with the police on a
darkened highway outside Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   Restrepo evaded law enforcement officers until Saturday. For the
last two months, Colombian agents had been following him as part of
an investigation into money laundering. According to reports in the
Colombian newspaper El Tiempo, Restrepo was arrested by agents as
he arrived in the commercial center of El Poblado for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been actively seeking to apprehend him,'' said Eric
Friedberg, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, who was the
chief prosecutor in the de Dios case. ``He is the final and perhaps
the most significant piece of the puzzle that we began putting
together five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedberg said he had evidence that after de Dios' slaying,
Restrepo ordered the deaths of four people related to Mena, the
chief witness in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Friedberg said that his office would probably request that
Restrepo be extradited to the United States to stand trial for the
killing of de Dios. In 1997, the Colombian government reinstated
its extradition treaty with the United States, but the treaty is
not retroactive and does not apply to the warrant filed for
Restrepo's arrest in the killing of de Dios.

NATO SAID TO HIT PLANTS OWNED BY MILOSEVIC ASSOCIATES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Adds 5th and 6th grafs with results of the weekend's military
action)  (Exclusive) 
(rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT AND STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In listing its bombing targets in Yugoslavia, NATO
has generally described them as facilities that feed Slobodan
Milosevic's war machine. What the Pentagon does not usually say is
that some of the refineries and factories have also been chosen as
targets because they are run by cronies of the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, according to senior NATO and Pentagon officials, is to
undermine Milosevic's control by chipping away at his system of
political and economic patronage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't care if his soldiers die in Kosovo, as long as he
stays in power,'' one senior military officer said of Milosevic.
``But if you blow up some things near and dear to him _ or to
somebody close to him _ then that could have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   While NATO's bombing seems to have solidified popular support
for Milosevic, the officials said they hope the attacks against
some of the targets will turn loyal supporters against him by
destroying their own sources of wealth and power.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing continued over the weekend, with NATO saying Sunday
that the previous 24 hours had been the busiest to date in the
bombing campaign, with 500 sorties flown on Saturday afternoon and
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   During the night 36 targets were struck, officials in Brussels
said, including an explosives plant, a refinery complex, an
airfield, radar and communications sites and military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's oil and gas industry, for example, has suffered
enormously under NATO's strikes. While the stated aim of those
attacks has been to choke off fuel to the armed forces operating in
Kosovo, the strikes must also be a blow to Dragan Tomic, the
director of Yugo Petrol, who as speaker of the federal Parliament
in Belgrade, is a close ally of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, a missile strike destroyed the Zastava automotive
plant in Kragujevac. Its director, Milan Beko, has served under
Milosevic as minister of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Four days earlier, NATO struck a tobacco factory and warehouse
in Nis, and damage to tobacco factories has been reported in other
cities. According to American intelligence reports, a major player
in Yugoslavia's tobacco distribution is Milosevic's son, Marko.
</P>
<P>
   So far, economic and industrial targets have made up only a
small portion of NATO's targets. Of the roughly 200 targets
attacked since the air war began on March 24, only a dozen have
been strictly industrial sites, like factories. That percentage
grows when those targets are combined with fuel storage and
ammunition factories.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO presses on with bombing that has done little to stop the
purging of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, some NATO and Pentagon
military leaders have advocated striking still more economic and
industrial targets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   These commanders, including the alliance's supreme commander,
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, believe that NATO has to escalate its efforts
to undermine Milosevic's 11 1/2-year grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue sustaining this air campaign and intensifying
it in a way that he sees he is slowly but surely starting to lose
those instruments of power that keep him in power, then he's going
to have to make a decision,'' Secretary of Defense William Cohen
testified on Capitol Hill last week.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, disclosed that NATO's political leaders had not yet
approved a small group of targets that he grouped together under
the objective ``decimate.'' He said NATO warplanes could begin
striking such targets ``in a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton declined to identify those targets, but the highly
classified list includes additional industrial and economic sites,
according to a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking those targets would carry a much higher risk of
civilian casualties and would cause the kind of profound disruption
of day-to-day life for ordinary Yugoslavs that NATO has so far
sought to avoid, that official said.
</P>
<P>
   Such strikes could also undercut NATO's stated rationale for its
bombing: to degrade the military and police forces involved in the
killings in Kosovo rather than wage war on the people of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Pentagon and NATO are looking for ways to
intensify pressure on Milosevic's government. ``We're trying to
make the price higher and higher,'' a senior defense official said.
``And there are lots of ways to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While not aiming directly for Milosevic, American and NATO
officials say they are targeting what they describe as his four
pillars of power: the political machine, the media, military and
security forces, and the economic system.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American military officer said the targets on NATO's
list included strikes at ``the things that keep him afloat.'' The
idea, the officer said, is to instill fear in those whose economic
standing depends on Milosevic, to make them think ``we didn't
bargain for this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can achieve that mindset, then who knows what will
happen?'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes and cruise missiles have struck half a dozen
targets considered to be part of the ``national command
authority,'' several of them in and around Belgrade. These include
headquarters and bunkers believed to be used by political and
military leaders _ although it is not clear whether anybody was
killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia's state-run economy, virtually any industrial or
economic activity can be linked to Milosevic's government. Ever
since the former Yugoslavia collapsed into its rump state today,
and the economy was hit from 1992 to 1995 by comprehensive
sanctions, Milosevic, a former banker and Communist bureaucrat, has
been able to tighten his control of the little business left.
</P>
<P>
   The core elements of the economy _ including agriculture, fuel,
manufacturing and exports and imports _ are operated by Milosevic's
cronies virtually as fiefs, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has used funds gained from industry and his cronies
mostly to finance an effective security apparatus to maintain
political control, according to experts and intelligence estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But his family and associates also have benefited, living far
more lavishly than most Yugoslavs, whose standard of living has
declined markedly since the country began its bloody breakup in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook last week challenged
Milosevic to admit to his people that he has bought three villas in
Greece. European media reports also have spoken of the family
funneling money to Swiss banks through French accounts held by
Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's son, Marko, is also said to profit from his
position; his holdings are believed to include a discotheque and a
tobacco distribution network. Before the war, Yugoslav media
reported that he had announced plans to open a Disney-style theme
park, called Bambiland.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials have estimated damage from the bombing as
high as $100 billion, including damage to roads, destroyed bridges
and railways which has the ripple effect of disrupting commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no signs that Milosevic has lost the backing of
his key supporters.
</P>
<P>
   One American government official familiar with the Yugoslav
economy said the prospects were slim that Milosevic's cronies,
however battered, would turn on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scenario that would involve these guys acting as a group
seems fairly unlikely,'' the official said. ``They don't have
anywhere to turn besides Milosevic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic appoints the executives of each of the country's
monopolies, many of whom also serve as government ministers. Dejan
Kovacevic, the minister of construction, also heads Mastrogradnje,
one of the country's largest construction firms. Zivota Kosic, the
minister of energy and mining, also heads a natural resources
concern called Duvanksa Industrija Nis. Nis is southern Serbia's
largest city, and has been a repeated target of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Another state-run industry that has been severely disrupted is
ammunition production, which is overseen by an umbrella
organization headed by Maj. Gen. Jovan Cekovic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the industry has a clear military function, it has also
historically provided Yugoslavia with hard currency, and the
destruction of the plants has crippled another source of profits
for people close to Milosevic, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and NATO officials declined to provide a list of
economic or industrial targets that have been struck. But
Yugoslavia's official news agencies have reported strikes against
several, in addition to oil depots and refineries. They include a
small-plane manufacturer in Pancevo, a construction-equipment plant
in Krusevac and a plastics factory in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   NATO maintains that each of its targets has military value, even
if some have a benign civilian use, too. For example, NATO has
repeatedly struck a plant in Cacak that Yugoslav officials
portrayed as an appliance factory. Reporters allowed to tour the
scene described vacuum cleaners in various states of destruction.
Western officials say the plant also included a subterranean
ammunition section.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's targets are chosen by military aides to Clark in
Brussels, Germany and Italy. These targeting officials work closely
with a little known cell within the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the
Pentagon, called J-2T, where officers consider a range of technical
aspects, including which weapon is the most effective for a
particular mission and where exactly it should be aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The planners weigh the military value of a target against the
drawbacks, namely the risk to pilots if the target is in a heavily
defended area and the risk to civilians if it is in a heavily
populated area.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the Pentagon and at NATO's headquarters in Belgium
review each target carefully to justify striking it. Hitting
industrial and economic sites requires walking a fine line, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Planners have been restricted by NATO's political process..
Cohen said President Clinton, like leaders of other major NATO
countries, reviews the target list, considering ``the political
consequence of hitting a particular target.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insist the bombing, which continued for a 26th
day Sunday, is taking a toll, wearing down Yugoslav materiel,
supplies and resolve. But the political process has kept some
targets off the list.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has sought approval _ so far unsuccessfully _ to attack
another of the pillars of Milosevic's support: the communications
industry. Control of radio and television has been a mainstay of
the Yugoslav leader's 11 1/2 years in power. One radio station is
even owned by his daughter, Marija.

IN HER HANDS, SECURITY AT A GATHERING OF WORLD LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (js) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the crowds Kathleen Hickman has warily
surveyed for security risks in 15 years with the Secret Service,
none comes close to the exotic high-wire gathering of world leaders
massing on her watch this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hickman, a cool, well-tailored professional, has worked her
way up from the ennui of the service's check-fraud squad and the
electricity of the presidential campaign vigil to become overall
coordinator of security for the throng of NATO leaders and their
entourages gathering here for their 50th anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, that means no fewer than 44 motorcades _ 19 NATO
members plus 25 aligned nations _ traipsing the city for much of a
week, tightly shepherded from airport to hotel and embassy by an
armada of assorted police and security forces, from G-men and
-women to city subway detectives. Coordinating all this is Ms.
Hickman, one of the Secret Service's master planners who learned
the ropes in having advanced the protection of presidents and
potentates, but never on a scale such as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've implanted a security plan that we have always been
comfortable with,'' Ms. Hickman said, offering not a murmur of
complaint when asked whether her yearlong, highly complex
assignment took on an even graver degree of watchfulness when NATO
began its air assault on Yugoslavia in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not adjusted the security plan but we are more aware
of what's going on overseas,'' the slender, 41-year-old Texan said
evenly, as vigilant in an interview as any agent out on a
dignitary's rope line. ``We feel comfortable with our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   All about her as she talked in the Secret Service visitors
museum were woeful reminders from the past of the high-stakes task
before her, from ``Kennedy Shot'' headlines to pistols seized from
would-be assassins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I insure that everyone is working together as a team,'' Ms.
Hickman said, her faith in the plan manifest as she emphasized the
critical role played by the FBI and a dozen other organizations on
guard for everything from hidden bombs to bacteria assault.
</P>
<P>
   For the three business days of this supersummit meeting that
begins on Friday, the downtown heart of the city will be turned
into a virtual moated citadel of rulers and bodyguard brigades. Ms.
Hickman's office will track the principals and their thousands of
protectors, keeping ambulances roving about the inner sanctum and
anti-terrorist snipers watching from the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Federal office employees in a 12-by-15-block core around the
White House have been told not to show up on Friday, while vehicles
and even pedestrians will be barred through the weekend from the
Federal Triangle center of the summit gathering. Among the many
human inconveniences, Ms. Hickman will be desk- and phone-bound
with no time for her favorite idea of relaxation, jogging with her
19-month-old son as he rides like a dignitary in his baby chariot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder on me than it probably is on him,'' she said,
guardedly declining to specify all sorts of details from her life,
from individual names to the family time she plans with her husband
and son after the last VIP's wend their way out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she arrived at the heart of all the programmed
wariness of the NATO gathering, the dedicated planner had to
finally admit that life can be serendipitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing I planned on doing,'' Ms. Hickman said. ``I
come from a background of hard work,'' she added, referring
particularly to her father's labors in the Texas furniture
business. Her education degree from Texas Tech University opened no
job opportunity, so she took a management job in a Dallas hotel for
a few years. And there, President Ronald Reagan's Secret Service
detail appeared one day, all wired and efficient, and she had to
work with them on hotel security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were recruiting at that time, especially for females,''
said Ms. Hickman, who eventually applied, passed the intelligence
test and found that with the addition of some weight-lifting to her
jogging regimen, she could handle the physical side, too. Her four
brothers, who work in private businesses like restaurants and
electronic communications, were delighted, she said, at the
emergence of the family's first law-enforcement professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're our best recruiters,'' Ms. Hickman said of the service,
which has 2,304 agents, including 217 women. ``We know the life. We
know what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond her adventurous younger years of darting with the
presidential party to Russia, Nepal and Australia, Ms. Hickman said
she came to love the service as much for its mundane tasks _
getting wet, cold and exhausted for the team's success, running a
polygraph machine, plodding after a check forger. ``I think if you
see the bad times as well as the good times, you just feel that the
Secret Service is like a family,'' said the agent, who has never
had to fire her pistol beyond the practice range and never hopes
to.
</P>
<P>
   As she awaits the NATO leaders, Ms. Hickman seems the
personification of a laconic, watchful, unflappable guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has always been a hard worker all his life, you know
_ Depression era and all,'' she explained when asked about the art
of her job. For all the service's high-tech watchdog tools, the
agent insisted the key to the coming week remains a blue-collar
sort of esprit. ``Part of this job is discipline. Showing up when
you need to show up. Being on time.''

KRONE SAYS FAREWELL WITH THREE WINNERS TO FINISH WITH 3,546

<P>
   It may not have drawn as much attention as Wayne Gretzky's
goodbye at Madison Square Garden, but Julie Krone also said
farewell Sunday when she rode three winners at Lone Star Park in
Grand Prairie, Texas, on the final day of her career at the races.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Krone, the most accomplished female rider in the
world, ended her 18 years in the saddle with a flourish. But she
missed the big one when her mount, Desert Demon, could not quite
overtake the 30-1 long shot T.B. Track Star and lost the $300,000
Lone Star Derby by one length.
</P>
<P>
   Krone, who won her first race at Tampa Bay Downs in 1981, won
3,546 races that included 277 stakes, and her mounts won more than
$80 million in prize money. But she suffered severe injuries in
recent years, and announced two weeks ago that she would close her
career because she wanted to pursue new interests, had nothing left
to prove and did not want to risk more injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very relieved I had some winners today,'' Krone said.
``The competitive side of me wanted to go out as a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone shared the spotlight Sunday with another racing star, Real
Quiet, last year's winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness,
who went off the 1-2 favorite in the $250,000 Texas Mile. But Real
Quiet could not catch Littlebitlively, who won the race for the
second straight year and was still in front by the length of his
neck when they crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The race marked the second defeat in a row for Real Quiet, who
also ran second on March 7 in the New Orleans Handicap at the Fair
Grounds. He is owned by Mike Pegram and trained by Bob Baffert, and
was ridden by his regular jockey, Gary Stevens. The winner, owned
by John Franks and trained by Bobby Barnett, ran the mile in 1:35
3/5 with Carlos Gonzalez riding. He was the second choice at 3-1,
and he set the pace throughout.  &QL;

US OFFICIALS DENY REPORT THAT GROUND WAR IS PLANNED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO bombs set off a series of spectacular
blazes at Serbian oil refineries, President Clinton vowed to
continue the air campaign until ``belligerent tyrant'' Slobodan
Milosevic withdraws his forces from Kosovo and allows the return of
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials, appearing on a round of
Sunday television talk shows, once again said they had no plans to
send in ground troops, and they denied a British newspaper report
that NATO is preparing 80,000 troops for a ground war as early as
May.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, asked whether US
troops are preparing for the possibility of a ground war, replied:
``There is not any training for such an operation.''
</P>
<P>
   US Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been
mostly supportive of administration policy, reacted on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press'' by expressing concerns that the lack of a ground
war plan may be hurting the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   While not calling for a ground war, Kerry said: ``We should have
a plan. We never should have taken it off the table. I think we may
have complicated the equation here by having it off the table as
way back as last fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   --Yugoslavia broke off diplomatic relations with Albania, saying
that Albania is helping NATO bomb Belgrade and other Yugoslav
targets.
</P>
<P>
   --Scores of ethnic Albanians still inside Kosovo were killed in
new clashes with the Serbian forces in the central portion of the
republic.
</P>
<P>
   --The expected arrival of Apache helicopters Sunday was delayed
by poor weather conditions at the airport in Tirana, Albania. The
Apaches are expected to go after Serbian ground forces and tanks
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade and elsewhere, the sky was filled with black smoke
after NATO warplanes hit several plants. NATO officials said they
had struck oil facilities and had devastated Yugoslavia's ability
to refine crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   A strike on a refinery in Novi Sad injured eight people,
according to the state-run Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Sunday's bombing knocked out 13 military
vehicles, hit two MiG-21 fighter jets on the ground, and struck
supply lines. Serbian media said they also struck several bridges,
including one near the southern Serbian town of Raska that serves
as a major rail link to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our air campaign is getting stronger,'' Albright said on
ABC-TV's ``This Week.'' ``I think if you listen day by day to the
damage assessments, you can see that greater damage is being done
to the things that really matter to Milosevic, those that he holds
dear. Those are being damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a letter published Sunday in The Times of London,
made clear that he wants to replace Milosevic as Yugoslav president
and also that he does not want to see Kosovo become an independent
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that the solution to hatred in the Balkans is
even greater Balkanization,'' Clinton wrote. ``Once we start
redrawing maps, the disputes and displacement of people would be
hard to stop. The best solution is not the endless shifting of
Europe's borders along ethnic lines, but rather integration among
European states that work together to make a virtue, not a blood
feud, out of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, the realization of this vision will require a
democratic transition in Serbia itself, for the region cannot be
secure with a belligerent tyrant in its midst.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also focused on Yugoslavia's neighbors, talking with the
presidents of Albania, Hungary, and Romania. Clinton promised to
fulfill his promise of returning the Kosovars to their home and
also told the leaders that he would focus new attention on
rebuilding southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials played down speculation about
ground troops, there was frustration with the delay in bringing 24
Apache helicopters to Albania. The low-flowing choppers carry chain
guns and 16 laser-guided anti-tank missiles.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO spoke about another night of successful bombing,
contending that Milosevic's army is losing much of its
functionality, there was also an array of evidence that things are
getting worse for the Kosovar Albanians. NATO officials said they
had evidence of mass graves in Kosovo, some apparently dug by the
Albanians under forced labor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 200,000 more refugees are expected to cross the
border from Kosovo in coming days, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic, speaking on
``This Week,'' denied that Serb forces were killing anyone in
Kosovo or elsewhere.
</P>

   ``All citizens in Yugoslavia are safe, free, and equal,''
Jovanovic said. ``There is no killing, no raping, no depriving of
anybody of any human or national minority of citizen's rights.
These accusations are a mere NATO propaganda aimed at justifying a
blunt aggression against Yugoslavia as a sovereign European
state,'' he said.

   Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican, criticized fellow
Republicans who he said are reluctant to support Clinton in the
wake of the impeachment trial. ``They've got to get over it,''
Lugar said on ``Meet the Press.'' ``NATO is on the right side of
history. Ethnic cleansing has got to stop. And the American people
support that. They're prepared really to support a ground war.''

FBI FILES DETAIL THREATS AGAINST LATE SEN. HENRY JACKSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The late Sen. Henry Jackson's ardent support for
Israel brought him a string of death threats laced with vitriolic
anti-Semitic rhetoric, according to documents in the senator's FBI
files.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a Democrat from Everett, was subjected to a variety of
harassment as a result of being a prominent public official. Once
he was spat on by a Yippie demonstrator in Wisconsin, protesters
twice pelted him with marshmallows, and once his Everett, Wash.
home was vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI files, obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
under a Freedom of Information Act request, reveal for the first
time the extent and intensity of threats against his life. They
increased in the mid-1970s, as Jackson prepared for his 1976
presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and his family took the threats seriously. He often had
more security around him than any politician in state history. He
was taken off airplanes through special doors, driven off the
tarmac at Sea-Tac International Airport, and had both state patrol
and U.S. Marshal escorts for such mundane duties as a speech at
Western Washington University in Bellingham. The reason for the
security wasn't explained at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's son, Peter Jackson, said in an interview that Black
September, the Palestinian terrorist group responsible for the 1972
Munich Olympics massacre, threatened to assassinate his father. As
a result, the family's mail at home was X-rayed, and Jackson
secretly wore a bullet-proof vest during an Everett Fourth of July
parade.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to prevent the senator's children from being
kidnapped, his home was placed under police surveillance and his
children were kept indoors whenever possible and watched whenever
they left the house.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson received about a dozen death threats during the 1970s,
when he was highly visible as a leading voice on U.S. foreign
policy, as a presidential candidate, as the chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee during the oil crisis, and as a frequent guest on
television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   The threats were occasionally graphic _ one writer suggested
that Jackson should be killed and that some of his remains could
then be used as fuel during an energy crisis. Others were oddly
respectful, with one reading, ``The Honorable Henry Jackson. This
is a warning to you and your wife. If you win you are a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   Most threats were investigated by the FBI, but in the few cases
when letter writers were identified, prosecutors generally deemed
that the threats were too vague to warrant prosecution. Many of
those making threats seemed to be unbalanced _ one threat was
traced to someone trying to frame an ex-spouse; another to a
homebound 70-year-old Pennsylvania woman who was apparently whiling
the hours away by penning vicious notes to elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Security for Jackson was increased several times _ in 1975, when
someone threatened to shoot him at the Tampa Airport; in 1976, when
someone threatened to bomb a speech by Jackson in Buffalo; and in
1979, when the senator's trip to Israel was preceded by several
fliers purportedly from the Red Brigade, a European terrorist
organization, that depicted Jackson with a Star of David on his
forehead and bore the caption, ``Sen. Jackson Sentenced to Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is one of the legendary giants of Washington state
political history. Jackson served in the House of Representatives
from 1941 until 1952 and in the Senate from 1953 until his death in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI files reveal nothing that might sully Jackson's place in
history; there is not a hint of personal or professional
impropriety. In fact, the one time the FBI investigated Jackson, in
1948, the worst thing the agents could come up with was that
Jackson ``is considered `liberal' in that he advocates social
legislation and pro-labor measures for the benefit of the working
class.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI claimed that Jackson had been supported by the Communist
Party during his 1944 House campaign. But the files also note that
``reliable confidential informants have advised that Jackson has no
Communist Party connections.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by the end of his career, Jackson was one of the
strongest anti-Communist voices in Congress, a leading architect of
U.S. Cold War foreign policy and a determined critic of detente.
Some of his foreign policy aides later held key posts in the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson also had little patience for the excesses of the Red
Scare. Even before the height of Congress' frenzied quest to find
domestic subversives, Jackson had repeatedly rebuffed pressure from
House leaders to accept the chairmanship of the House Un-American
Activities Committee, according to a memo from an FBI agent in
Jackson's files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike many conservative anti-Communists, Jackson emphasized
more the external danger posed by the Soviet Union than the
internal problem of subversion,'' said Robert Kaufman, a University
of Vermont political scientist whose biography of Jackson is
scheduled to be published by the University of Washington press
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, asked Jackson to
serve on the committee that Martin Dies Jr. of Texas had chaired
with a wild degree of irresponsibility, Jackson refused to do that.
... Then his first major committee responsibility in the senate was
to serve on (Joseph) McCarthy's committee, where he played an
honorable role in bringing McCarthy down and exposing his
recklessness,'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Jackson's long career as a federal officeholder, most
of his contacts with law enforcement were with the FBI. The files
provide a detailed catalog of every incident and episode that
provoked suspicion, starting with the night in 1956 when someone
broke into Jackson's car in Hoquiam, Wash., and stole his shaving
kit, a pair of binoculars, and a notebook in which Jackson, using a
secret code he had developed, jotted down thoughts during a trip to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The files include an assortment of warm correspondences between
Jackson and longtime FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, newspaper
clippings about Jackson's wedding, and the threatening missives.
</P>
<P>
   The threats appear to have been largely motivated by Jackson's
strong identification with Israel. Jackson was the most prominent
champion of American military and economic aid to Israel and of the
emigration rights of Soviet Jews at a time when those causes were
not popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was viewed as a real hero, not just by Russian Jews but by
Jews in this country and throughout the world,'' said Ester Kurz,
legislative strategy director for the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, a lobbying organization. ``He clearly thought
there was a moral component to our obligation to Israel following
World War II, and he was a strategic thinker very engaged in the
Cold War and the need to counter Soviet influence who saw Israel
playing an important role in that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson traced his support for Israel to two incidents. In 1939,
as Snohomish County prosecutor, he claimed to have effectively shut
down a group of fascist sympathizers in Everett called the Silver
Shirts, and in 1945, on a trip with a group of other congressmen,
Jackson visited the Buchenwald concentration camp three days after
it was liberated. He also credited his mother for instilling in him
the value of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The threats began after Jackson's first abortive presidential
campaign in 1972. On Oct. 9, 1973, Jackson received a two-sentence
letter typed on the letterhead of the Islamic Center of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sir,'' the letter began. ``On behalf of the more than
14,000 Muslims in the Bay Area, I condemn you as an immoral man. We
earnestly pray to God for your destruction and the destruction of
all you stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Several writers, including the 70-year-old Pennsylvania woman,
clearly associated Jackson with support for Jewish causes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the woman wrote to Jackson, ``If you want to stay
alive, shut up about American oil men and their dollars. You don't
understand inflation and the Jews. Ask Germany about inflation
and... Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Another writer, from Michigan, wrote to ``the very soon late
Henry Jackson,'' warning that Jackson would be killed if he took
any pro-Jewish positions. Yet another, identifying himself as ``a
patriot'' who hates your... guts,'' wrote ``I hope the Arabs run
every damn Jew into the sea and you with them.''
</P>
<P>
   A Floridian who complained to Jackson that ``you come from the
wrong side of the country in the first place,'' also complained of
Jackson's support for Jewish causes, and said ``please keep out of
Florida before something happens to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another writer penned a series of threats involving Jackson,
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, and U.S. District Judge John
Sirica in 1974 and 1975. This writer complained that by traveling
to Colorado and New Mexico, Jackson had been ``spending the
people's money wasting gasoline and polluting the air with Henry
Jackson's special kind of hot air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that Washington, D.C. is probably somewhat cleaner
without you and that the Senate is lacking one of its most
dishonest members... (and) the state of Washington is getting a
break,'' the writer said before launching into an ominous
prediction. ``(Astrologist) Jean Dixon and I agree on one thing _
that 1975 is the year of your death and that of Ted Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the threats, the FBI records contain no evidence of any
attempts on Jackson's life, and the senator died of natural causes
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy FBI files end abruptly with a copy of a two-sentence
telegram FBI Director William Webster sent to Jackson's wife,
Helen, upon the senator's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in the FBI were shocked and saddened by the sudden
death of your husband, and I extend our heartfelt sympathy to you
and your family,'' Webster wrote. ``His many contributions to our
nation will ensure for him a place in our history, and we join with
all Americans in mourning his death.''

COMMENTARY: WHO'S AFRAID OF BIG BAD BALKAN QUAGMIRE?
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The birth announcements for the new, isolationist Republican
Party seem to be somewhat premature. True, there has been a lot of
dark muttering about morasses and quagmires _ Yugoslavia has been
compared to every kind of bad-driving terrain known to mankind,
except perhaps really deep potholes. But this is a congressional
sentiment from the rapidly aging partisans of the Gingrich
revolution, most perfectly articulated by House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, the guy who declared that having been abroad once, he
saw no reason to ever go back. The Republican candidates for
president are a different matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the field is split on what to do about Kosovo,
but the avowed opponents of American involvement are all long,
long, long shots like Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer and Sen. Bob Smith.
Saying that the Republican presidential canddates lean toward
isolation is like examining school spirit among teen-agers and
interviewing only those who did not get invited to the prom.
</P>
<P>
   The isolationists get more than their share of attention because
their leading light is so eminently loud and quotable. Buchanan,
who advocates less foreign intervention and more defense buildup,
keeps seconding Otto von Bismarck's remark on how the Balkans are
``not worth the healthy bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.''
Talk-radio aficionados may be familiar with this reference, but the
rest of the nation has got to be thinking about an army of small
fluffy dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the real Republican field seems to be getting more
hawkish by the day, possibly because the Kosovo crisis has worked
so well for Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate
who has been the most outspoken voice for engagement. McCain has
been winning the talk-show war. A Vietnam war hero, he is perhaps
best positioned to get away with expressing confidence about how
quickly American troops and equipment could beat a small country
with a second-rate military. His reputation as the one
(non-Buchananite) Republican who is not afraid to say what he
thinks seems to be impressing the public, although to Washington
insiders, demonstrations of McCain's propensity for
straight-talking are superfluous. This is the man who is planning
to run in the Iowa primary as the Republican who led the battle
against federal subsidies for ethanol, a highly uneconomic but very
deeply corn-based fuel.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the man with all the money and all the
endorsements and all of just about everything except positions,
clocked in late on Kosovo, with the air of someone who had just
finished an all-nighter, poring over lists of major exports,
historical highlights and regional cooking tips.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session with Texas journalists earlier
this month, Bush dissociated himself from the Armey school of
you've-seen-one-continent-you've-seen-them-all. Slobodan Milosevic,
he said, needs to be taught a ``lesson'' and NATO forces should be
satisfied with nothing less than ``an unconditional surrender.''
His only reservation, Bush added, was whether the bombing campaign
was being done with enough ``ferocity.'' He seemed to have been
breathing deeply from that Alamo-enhanced air.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole has called on President Clinton to build up and
deploy ``the forces necessary to win the war.'' Steve Forbes wants
to expand the bombing and arm the Kosovars. Dan Quayle is dead set
against ground troops, except that they might be inevitable. For
terseness, vagueness and grumpiness, none of them can hold a candle
to Al Gore's only Democratic competition, former Sen. Bill Bradley.
Bradley, you will be happy to know, has ``serious questions about
our policy'' and is worried about ``becoming bogged down in a
quagmire.''
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that all this effort at being forceful on foreign
policy is now being directed at a military engagement engineered by
Bill Clinton. As a candidate, after all, the president's most
memorable statement on foreign affairs may have been his
explanation of how he would have voted in the Senate when George
Bush needed support for the Gulf War: ``I guess I would have voted
with the majority if it was a close vote. But I agree with the
arguments the minority made.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leading Republican candidates have histories that
made it inevitable that they would land somewhere in the
internationalist camp. But polls showing increasing American
support for the effort in Kosovo may also have had an effect. Bill
Clinton has flummoxed the Republicans so often they may now suspect
that the man who got the public to overlook adultery may be able to
get the public enthusiastic about international quagmires, too.

IN NEW YORK LEGISLATURE, ENTRENCHED MAJORITIES LORD IT OVER THE
UNDERDOGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In an office near the Capitol is a collection of
computers that look as if they belong in a Museum of Woefully
Antiquated Technology _ crotchety curios from the mid-'80s that can
barely be used to write reports, never mind send e-mail or access
the Internet. To the researchers for the Republican minority in the
Assembly who have to work on these machines, every keystroke is a
reminder that in Albany, it isn't easy to be out of power.
</P>
<P>
   More than their counterparts in other state capitals and in
Washington, the majority parties in the New York Legislature have
devised myriad ways of keeping their rivals down. This year, life
for the have-nots _ Assembly Republicans and Senate Democrats _
seems to have got only worse. The strategies range from the
parliamentary (blocking votes on bills proposed by the minority) to
the petty (forcing a Republican assemblyman to remove his photo
from a constituent newsletter because his sweatshirt featured an
elephant, that egregious Republican symbol).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Senate allocated $75 million for ``member
items,'' a euphemism for pork barrel projects that lawmakers dole
out to their districts. The Republican Senate majority, which holds
36 of the 61 seats, got 95 percent of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has become so oppressive that they think that they
are extending us a courtesy by allowing us to sit in the chamber,''
said Sen. David A. Paterson, a Manhattan Democrat and the deputy
minority leader. ``They probably think that they have a right to
make us sit in the gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Albany's rules and customs relegate Senate Democrats and
Assembly Republicans to bystanders, largely barred from influencing
legislation and able to attract attention only as gadflies. And the
everyday indignities do not even reflect what is probably the
majorities' ultimate perquisite: the ability to gerrymander
legislative districts every 10 years during reapportionment, which
makes most majority incumbents hard to oust on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the majorities' leaders whether the system is unfair and
they generally give two responses: ``This is how it has always
been.'' And, ``Tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, complaining about the majority is common in
legislative bodies, as underdogs seek to use their misfortunes to
galvanize voters. Still, the majorities in New York go to unusual
lengths to enfeeble the minority parties.
</P>
<P>
   The majorities control all operating expenditures for their
houses, and they allot resources in a manner familiar to any
younger sibling. The Assembly Republicans' obsolete computers were
once the Assembly Democrats'. The Senate minority leader, Martin
Connor of Brooklyn, is entitled to a state car. The hand-me-down
that he got was the majority leader's in the early '90's and has
nearly 100,000 miles on it.
</P>
<P>
   The majorities can and sometimes do rifle through the official
mail that minority members send through legislative postal
services. The majorities say they have the right to insure that
such correspondence is not politically oriented, which would
violate the rules. But the minority blocs cannot check the
majorities' mail.
</P>
<P>
   Experts who have studied state legislatures say relations in New
York's are so strained in large part because the majorities have
maintained power for so long _ the Assembly Democrats since 1975,
the Senate Republicans for almost the entire century.
</P>
<P>
   In other large states with expansive legislatures, like
California, Illinois and Pennsylvania, control has shifted more
often, which prevents one party from amassing the resources and
changing parliamentary rules.
</P>
<P>
   New York ``is a strongly partisan state, but also one that is
unlikely to have the balance of powers flip,'' said Rich Jones,
director of legislative programs at the National Conference of
State Legislatures.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There tends to be a little more comity in the New York Senate
than in the Assembly. The Senate is a smaller body and some members
have formed friendships across party lines. Even so, some Senate
Democrats are talking about suing over Senate customs. They note
that Democrats represent most of the state's urban voters, meaning
that black and Hispanic residents receive far less in
Senate-sponsored aid than white ones do.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about such inequities, John McArdle, a spokesman for Sen.
Joseph L. Bruno of Brunswick, the majority leader, said, ``This is
the way that these initiatives have been distributed for years.''
</P>
<P>
   McArdle added that Republican senators receive more money for
staff members and bigger offices because as members of the
majority, they serve as committee chairmen and thus have more
duties.
</P>
<P>
   In the Assembly, the tensions appear to be more pronounced now
than at any other time in memory. The speaker, Sheldon Silver, a
Manhattan Democrat, rarely speaks with the Republican minority
leader, John J. Faso, who represents a district near Albany and has
close ties to Gov. George E. Pataki, a fellow Republican. The
Democrats have a 98-52 advantage in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Silver views Faso as a mouthpiece for the governor and has
repeatedly cracked down on the Assembly Republicans in an effort to
punish Faso for behavior that Silver contends is overly
belligerent. For example, Silver has prevented Republicans from
becoming co-sponsors on politically popular bills. Faso, in turn,
has all but called Silver a dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has come under steady attack from Faso, Pataki and the
Republican State Committee, and he does not dispute that he is
using his chamber's rules for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are typically on the sidelines, the minority blocs
play an important role in the rare instances when the Legislature
tries to override a veto. Both majorities lack the two-thirds vote
that is required for an override, so they have to turn to minority
members for support.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the minority blocs labor in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Republicans' frustration boiled over last week,
when Silver employed an arcane parliamentary maneuver to take away
one of their few rights: the ability to try to force a vote on a
bill. The Republicans were seeking to bring legislation to the
floor that would ban the procedure that abortion critics refer to
as ``partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   After a caustic debate over the rules enforced by the Democrats,
Faso rose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked and saddened by the way the majority distorts and
contorts the rules,'' he said. ``You should be ashamed at the way
in which you have allowed this body to descend. I weep for what you
are doing in this house.''

KINGS' ROBINSON FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ At 8:30 this morning, Larry Robinson will walk into
general manager Dave Taylor's office, at which time he expects to
learn whether or not he has a future as the coach of the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   If Robinson's tenure is over, it won't be a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, Robinson quite possibly concluded his
four-year stint with a 3-2 loss to the St. Louis Blues before a
sellout crowd of 16,005 attending the last regular-season game at
the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jason Blake, signed to an amateur tryout contract Friday
night, scored his first NHL goal in his first game and was the
Kings' best player. The final details of a three-year,
$1.85-million contract for Blake are being worked out. As for
Robinson: Taylor and team president Tim Leiweke addressed
season-ticket holders before the game, and when the subject of the
coach arose, Taylor was lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is aware of the situation with Larry,''
Taylor said. ``We did offer him an extension at the start of the
year. He refused it. We'll sit down and resolve his situation. I
can't tell you much more than that now.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Robinson sounded like a man preparing for the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd still like to remain in hockey,'' Robinson said.
``It's whether they want me or not.... All I know is, myself and
the coaching staff, (whether) we had anything we could have done
differently, I don't think so. Given the circumstances, I think we
did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt on the last game of the season, he said: ``I'm
going to relish this day, the players we have, the staff. I have to
think about the happy times, the great friendships. There's no
sense getting upset worrying about things when you don't know
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What irrefutably did happen was a 32-45-5 season that may turn
Robinson _ a finalist for Coach of the Year in 1997-98 _ into a
scapegoat. If Robinson did have a failing, some of his players said
after the game, it was that he was too patient with players who
weren't performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not back, it's unfortunate,'' center Ray Ferraro said.
``If it's true he's not back, it won't be the only change. It's not
Larry's personality to be a (jerk). He's about as nice a guy as you
could play for and about as nice a guy as I've ever played for.
Most of us who got second and third chances better keep our heads
up if a new guy comes in. Larry gave every guy the benefit of the
doubt, and in some cases he was taken advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille added: ``I respect Larry. I love playing for him.
He's a good person. Sometimes, he was too nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Jason Blake, he agreed to join the Kings late Friday
night after receiving a call in Cleveland while on a trip with the
International Hockey League's Orlando Solar Bears, for whom he will
play in the postseason. In his one-game showcase, the 5-foot-10,
180-pound Blake displayed a combination of speed and skill not seen
by the Kings this season at the center position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best feeling I had was obviously scoring the goal, but
also how welcome I was,'' said Blake, who completed his college
career at North Dakota this season and is no relation to Kings
captain Rob Blake. ``Luc Robitaille came to me 10 times to give me
a hug after I scored the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Defenseman Doug Bodger, 32 and an unrestricted free
agent, said there's a 50-percent chance he'll retire.... Defenseman
Rob Blake said he'll play for Canada in the upcoming World
Championships in Oslo, Norway.... The Kings assigned wingers Pavel
Rosa and Jason Podollan, defensemen Jan Nemecek and Jaroslav Modry
and goalie Ryan Bach to the Long Beach Ice Dogs.... The Kings will
play one exhibition game at the Forum in the fall, which will be
the going-away party for the building.

COURT BATTLE LOOMS OVER LONG-TERM DETENTION OF REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISE OLSEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle will be the stage for one of the nation's
biggest court battles over whether the U.S. government violates the
rights of non-citizens by indefinitely jailing those who cannot be
deported.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``lifers'' or ``unremovables,'' around 150 of these
non-citizens are held long-term in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Most committed criminal offenses, served time and were then
ordered deported but have remained locked in limbo because their
governments refuse to take them back.
</P>
<P>
   Under an unusual agreement, the claims to liberty of five
``lifers'' will be considered when all five federal district court
judges in Seattle meet jointly to review central arguments on both
sides. That could happen as early as June.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the controversy is whether the government has
failed to give aliens fair treatment before holding them
indefinitely or whether detainees lost their due process rights
when they were ordered deported.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold a joint hearing on the first five cases was
crafted by Seattle federal judges as part of a strategy to handle
an estimated 50 cases from long-term detainees expected to flood
the federal court this year, said Jay Stansell, assistant federal
public defender.
</P>
<P>
   Stansell participated in the talks with the judges and the U.S.
Attorney's office about the cases.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the population of indefinite detainees has grown
quickly because the state has many refugees from Southeast Asia,
the former Soviet Union, Somalia and other nations that don't
accept deportees.
</P>
<P>
   The men expected to be included in the first five cases reflect
the nationalities of Washington's long-termers: two are Vietnamese,
one is Laotian, one is Cambodian and one is from the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Their individual circumstances are very different. But all are
refugees who settled in the Northwest. All have criminal
convictions, mostly for property crimes, though one served time for
manslaughter. And all have been held months or even years by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service because they cannot be
deported and the INS considers them a flight risk or a safety
threat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five, Son Thai Huynh, 31, a convicted burglar and
Vietnamese refugee, has been in INS custody for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has justified Huynh's long detention because of his
criminal convictions and an alleged association with a Seattle
gang, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   But the joint hearing has given Huynh some hope of a second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot in these years. I've thought a lot,'' said
Huynh, whose parents and siblings live in Seattle. ``I'd like a
chance to go back with my family and prove myself _ that I'm a good
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other detained refugees, Huynh and others in the first
five cases arrived here as youths, most of them with their
families, and quickly got into trouble that eventually resulted in
a deportation order.
</P>
<P>
   Huynh harbors strong fears _ bolstered by bad memories _ about
what could happen to him if he were sent back to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Huynh, whose features reflect more his American father than his
Chinese mother, was ostracized in Vietnam as a ``G.I. soldier
kid.'' He was not allowed to attend school, and was taunted and
beaten up, he says. When he arrived in the United States, as a
teen, he was illiterate and he has never been able to learn to read
or write.
</P>
<P>
   Though some long-termers have no criminal records, none of those
in the first five cases was hand-picked as ``Mother Teresas,''
Stansell said.
</P>
<P>
   Huynh and the other four all have criminal convictions.
Cambodian Kim Ho Ma served time for manslaughter. Huynh, Dennis
Batyuchenko, from Belarus, Khamseane Sivongxay, a Laotian, and Bin
Phanh, a Vietnamese, all have property crime convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Stansell said the issues in the cases go far beyond the criminal
histories of the individuals.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the U.S. government clearly is violating the
constitutional rights of ``lifers.'' Some detainees spend years in
prison, while the INS makes no progress toward deporting them to
their home countries _ the government's justification for
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Stansell also argues that existing periodic reviews are
inadequate. And, he notes, the process is far less strict than a
civil commitment procedure _ the way that U.S. citizens can be
locked up indefinitely under U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil commitment hearing, the government must prove that a
person is a danger to himself or others and is unable to control
his or her actions. That's far different than immigration reviews
where the burden of proof is on the detainee to prove he's not
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But INS officials _ and the federal attorneys who represent them
_ say that they're protecting citizens by keeping dangerous aliens
locked up long-term and that existing reviews are sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   They point to studies of how aliens who were released in the
past often reoffend.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher L. Pickrell, the lead
attorney arguing the cases for the INS in Seattle, said that
detainees are not truly held indefinitely since there is some
possibility that countries like Vietnam will change their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, for example, recently negotiated a treaty to take
deportees from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Pickrell also said the U.S. government has argued that aliens
who are ordered deported lose all the rights that they formerly
enjoyed and thus are not entitled to due process.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seattle cases, the potential exists that all five federal
district court judges could issue separate decisions on the common
issues at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   That action would send a message that would be heard not only in
Western Washington, but in legal circles across the country where
the debate is intensifying over an estimated 3,000 long-term
detainees held So far, California's Eastern District is the only
other federal court to have seriously grappled with the issue of
long-term detainees since Congress significantly changed
deportation laws in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There, district judges have ruled in favor of detainees in
several individual cases, essentially agreeing that indefinite
detention violates their rights and that the federal court has the
power to act in these kinds of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Here, advocates for long-term detainees are hoping that progress
will be quicker because all five district judges will be reviewing
the issue at about the same time. That way, any appellate court
reviews would come faster and perhaps even a ruling by the U.S.
Supreme Court.

TWO EUROPEAN PHONE GIANTS KEEP TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Italy and Germany gave their approval Sunday for Telecom
Italia SpA to continue discussions about a possible merger with
Deutsche Telekom AG. The decision is expected to complicate the
struggle for control of Telecom Italia, which faces a $65 billion
hostile bid from its Italian rival, Olivetti SpA.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions toward a merger, if successful, would create one
of the world's largest phone companies. But numerous obstacles
remain, not least of which are the Italian government's concerns
about the German government's majority stake in Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   German and Italian ministers disclosed their governments'
approval of the talks in Dresden, Germany, on Sunday where they had
attended a meeting of European finance officials the day before.
</P>
<P>
   German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said his nation had ``a
fundamental sympathy for the idea that the two companies could get
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea uniting both sides, Eichel said, was that such a
combined European giant would have a ``big advantage'' competing
with global Japanese and American telecommunications giants.
</P>
<P>
   His Italian counterpart, Vincenzo Visco, agreed, saying both
governments had concluded ``that the matter should be examined
attentively and that it is interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is doable,'' he added, ``we do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the companies said a deal could be announced as
early as Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema had laid the ground work
for Sunday's discussions in a phone conversation on Friday with
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Italy, Visco said, it was clear a merger was only
feasible if the German state divested its 72 percent share in
Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian minister of the treasury,
which formally holds Italy's remaining 3.4 percent share of Telecom
Italia, seconded his colleague, saying there ``has to be a balanced
relationship between both sides.'' Telecom Italia is the former
national phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Visco suggested that the problem was not insurmountable,
saying that the crucial issue was ``that ownership does not
interfere in management.''
</P>
<P>
   One idea being considered to assure equal representation,
advisers to the companies said, is to create a holding company that
would control the shares of Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia and
its mobile phone subsidiary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many analysts note that since the deregulation of European phone
markets in 1997, Deutsche Telekom, despite the Bonn government's
large stake, has received far less protection from the German
government and far tougher scrutiny from German phone regulators
than the Rome government and Italian regulatory authorities have
given Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia's chief executive, Franco Bernabe, has sought a
white knight to thwart the hostile bid from Olivetti. For his part,
Ron Sommer, the Deutsche Telekom chief, has assembled a fund for
strategic acquisitions to fortify Deutsche Telekom's position
against strong European and domestic competitors, including the
German steel and machinery group, Mannesmann A.G., which has
emerged in recent years as a powerful European phone company and an
ally of Olivetti in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's intention to sell as much as $12.7 billion in
fresh stock, which was announced on Thursday, will dilute the
German government's stake to about 62 percent, and Eichel Sunday
reaffirmed Germany's intention to gradually reduce its stake
further, though he said it would do so only under favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bernabe said that he had been casting about for a
strong industrial partner even before the Olivetti bid. Among his
arguing points to Deutsche Telekom, one adviser said, was that the
proposed merger would greatly enhance the combined companies'
liquidity and produce a ``nice balance sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the German government's planned steps to dilute its
stake in Deutsche Telekom would help overcome the Italian
government's resistance to the merger, Bernabe has argued.
</P>
<P>
   The principal complications, this adviser said, are the
challenge posed by merging two former state monopolies, with
sharply contrasting Italian and German business cultures and
bloated work forces that are only gradually getting used to the
idea of competition.
</P>
<P>
   For Deutsche Telekom, this adviser said, a further challenge
would be sorting out its industrial and financial ties with France
Telecom, with which Deutsche Telekom is allied in two alliances.
Their future, this person said, would be ``precarious.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the crowds Kathleen Hickman has warily
surveyed for security risks in 15 years with the Secret Service,
none comes close to the exotic high-wire gathering of world leaders
massing on her watch this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hickman, a cool, well-tailored professional, has worked her
way up from the ennui of the service's check-fraud squad and the
electricity of the presidential campaign vigil to become overall
coordinator of security for the throng of NATO leaders and their
entourages gathering here for their 50th anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, that means no fewer than 44 motorcades _ 19 NATO
members plus 25 aligned nations _ traipsing the city for much of a
week, tightly shepherded from airport to hotel and embassy by an
armada of assorted police and security forces, from G-men and
-women to city subway detectives. Coordinating all this is Ms.
Hickman, one of the Secret Service's master planners who learned
the ropes in having advanced the protection of presidents and
potentates, but never on a scale such as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've implanted a security plan that we have always been
comfortable with,'' Ms. Hickman said, offering not a murmur of
complaint when asked whether her yearlong, highly complex
assignment took on an even graver degree of watchfulness when NATO
began its air assault on Yugoslavia in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not adjusted the security plan but we are more aware
of what's going on overseas,'' the slender, 41-year-old Texan said
evenly, as vigilant in an interview as any agent out on a
dignitary's rope line. ``We feel comfortable with our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   All about her as she talked in the Secret Service visitors
museum were woeful reminders from the past of the high-stakes task
before her, from ``Kennedy Shot'' headlines to pistols seized from
would-be assassins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I insure that everyone is working together as a team,'' Ms.
Hickman said, her faith in the plan manifest as she emphasized the
critical role played by the FBI and a dozen other organizations on
guard for everything from hidden bombs to bacteria assault.
</P>
<P>
   For the three business days of this supersummit meeting that
begins on Friday, the downtown heart of the city will be turned
into a virtual moated citadel of rulers and bodyguard brigades. Ms.
Hickman's office will track the principals and their thousands of
protectors, keeping ambulances roving about the inner sanctum and
anti-terrorist snipers watching from the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Federal office employees in a 12-by-15-block core around the
White House have been told not to show up on Friday, while vehicles
and even pedestrians will be barred through the weekend from the
Federal Triangle center of the summit gathering. Among the many
human inconveniences, Ms. Hickman will be desk- and phone-bound
with no time for her favorite idea of relaxation, jogging with her
19-month-old son as he rides like a dignitary in his baby chariot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder on me than it probably is on him,'' she said,
guardedly declining to specify all sorts of details from her life,
from individual names to the family time she plans with her husband
and son after the last VIP's wend their way out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she arrived at the heart of all the programmed
wariness of the NATO gathering, the dedicated planner had to
finally admit that life can be serendipitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing I planned on doing,'' Ms. Hickman said. ``I
come from a background of hard work,'' she added, referring
particularly to her father's labors in the Texas furniture
business. Her education degree from Texas Tech University opened no
job opportunity, so she took a management job in a Dallas hotel for
a few years. And there, President Ronald Reagan's Secret Service
detail appeared one day, all wired and efficient, and she had to
work with them on hotel security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were recruiting at that time, especially for females,''
said Ms. Hickman, who eventually applied, passed the intelligence
test and found that with the addition of some weight-lifting to her
jogging regimen, she could handle the physical side, too. Her four
brothers, who work in private businesses like restaurants and
electronic communications, were delighted, she said, at the
emergence of the family's first law-enforcement professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're our best recruiters,'' Ms. Hickman said of the service,
which has 2,304 agents, including 217 women. ``We know the life. We
know what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond her adventurous younger years of darting with the
presidential party to Russia, Nepal and Australia, Ms. Hickman said
she came to love the service as much for its mundane tasks _
getting wet, cold and exhausted for the team's success, running a
polygraph machine, plodding after a check forger. ``I think if you
see the bad times as well as the good times, you just feel that the
Secret Service is like a family,'' said the agent, who has never
had to fire her pistol beyond the practice range and never hopes
to.
</P>
<P>
   As she awaits the NATO leaders, Ms. Hickman seems the
personification of a laconic, watchful, unflappable guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has always been a hard worker all his life, you know
_ Depression era and all,'' she explained when asked about the art
of her job. For all the service's high-tech watchdog tools, the
agent insisted the key to the coming week remains a blue-collar
sort of esprit. ``Part of this job is discipline. Showing up when
you need to show up. Being on time.''

KANAAN'S RUN HITS A WALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ (setital)Screeeeeetch . . . (endital)
</P>
<P>
   Tony Kanaan's run with his first pole position as a CART driver
came to a screeching end on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After leading from the second lap to lap 45, the 24-year-old
Brazilian took turn six too hard in lap 45, barreled into tires and
was knocked out of the CART Championship at the Toyota Grand Prix
of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Kanaan said. ``The track was breaking up,
and I just ran off line a little bit and lost it. It was tough.
Sometimes you learn the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan's mistake, hence, dropped him the furthest of any driver
in the CART race. He started the day with the pole position and
ended up 22nd of 27 drivers. His drastic plummet, forcing him out
of the final 40 laps, appeared to blast his morale.
</P>
<P>
   The rising star, CART's Rookie of the Year last season, exited
the Grand Prix soon after the crash. That was even before Juan
Montoya had his champagne celebration as the victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened today hurt,'' Kanaan said. ``But I proved to
myself that I can run up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Kanaan's premature departure changed the Grand Prix's
tenor. A yellow flag popped up from lap 46 to lap 51 because of his
miscue, but that wasn't the significant change.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the departure may have paved the way to Montoya's
victory. The 23 year old from Bogota, Columbia led from Kanaan's
exit to the checkered flag. Unlike Kanaan, Montoya didn't have the
luxury of a pole position and had to advance from his fifth
starting position for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan (Herta) was the toughest guy to get by,'' Montoya said.
``And it was too bad what happened to Tony (Kanaan).''
</P>
<P>
   Herta finished third, behind Dario Franchitti. Not only was
Herta a menace to Montoya, but he also was to Kanaan briefly. Herta
stole Kanaan's lead in the first lap, but Kanaan reclaimed the lead
in the second lap.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the majority of the race while Kanaan was in it had
Kanaan leading in front of Montoya and Franchitti, the three raced
tight and appeared on track to jockey for position. But Kanaan's
exit prevented that and perhaps took away some of the race's
thrill. The race became a dogfight between Montoya and Franchitti,
yet Montoya never relinquished his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan (Montoya) passed us on the restart, and then the three of
us (Kanaan, Montoya and Franchitti) were going at it, nose to
tail,'' Franchitti said. ``It was a shame for Tony. I think we
would have had a pretty good battle the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan's race lasted 53 minutes, 59 seconds. Montoya's was 52:29
longer than Kanaan's. On Saturday, when he won the pole position,
he also won several wristwatches from his race engineers. They bet
him that he couldn't have a best lap quicker than 1:02.5. He
finished 1:02.332, claiming the watches, including a Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, especially after his fate, he may have not wanted
the watches. He could have wanted time to move faster, pushing him
to May 2 in Nazareth, Penn., CART's next race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good until 40 laps to go,'' he said. ``I am very
disappointed, but you learn from your mistakes.''

 &HT;    Man fighting for `Confederate History Month'
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Larry Powell is Southern and proud.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who had five great-great-uncles fight for the
Confederate States of America, is urging city and county leaders to
recognize April as Confederate History Month.
</P>
<P>
   But images die hard.
</P>
<P>
   An officer in the local chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans,
Powell has spent his adult life challenging the idea that the
Confederacy was only about slavery. He believes Floridians _
two-thirds of them, by last count, from somewhere else and many of
them unable to say which side Florida fought for in the Civil War _
need to know the state's history, good or bad. And he says he wants
to honor Floridians who died for a cause they believed in, even if
other Americans disagreed and some called it treason.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, Jupiter, Hypoluxo and Tequesta have
issued the proclamations _ without dissension, but the Palm Beach
County Commission hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expressed my displeasure by not sponsoring the
proclamation,'' said County Commission Chairwoman Maude Ford Lee,
who is black. ``It's a very offensive time in history for my people
and I would not be supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century and a half after the United States fought a
four-year campaign to keep 11 Southern states from setting up their
own nation, the war still draws powerful emotions and opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they call it Civil War History Month? Why take only
one side of it?'' asked Lyman Stanford, a professor of social
science at Florida Atlantic University.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, then mostly agricultural and home to only 140,000
people, was the third state to secede in 1861, and sent the largest
percentage of soldiers of any Confederate state. It is now
America's fourth most populous state, a demographic tossed salad,
and easily the most assimilated and least Southern of the former
states in rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven years, Gov. Lawton Chiles issued a carefully
worded proclamation. ``Whereas, we study the war between the blue
and the gray for the same reason we study all wars, with a view to
understanding the historical events which compelled them, so we may
continue to learn to live together and seek to avoid future
conflicts,'' says the decree, which urges Floridians to ``engage in
historical study of the events of 1861 to 1865 and to solemnly
contemplate that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush's office has not decided whether to issue a
proclamation, a spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said Floridians can mark the commemoration without
endorsing the Confederacy's causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly part of history,'' Powell said. ``Florida was a
major part of the Confederacy. The main idea is to encourage people
to go out and read about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell is an officer of the Sons of Confederate Veterans'
15-member West Palm Beach chapter _ the next nearest chapters are
based in Fort Lauderdale and Vero Beach. Powell and his Vero Beach
counterpart did not approach any local governments in Martin or St.
Lucie counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis native, raised in South Florida and descended, on
his mother's side, from turn-of-the-century Miami pioneers, is a
retired Hialeah firefighter of 22 years who moved to Palm Beach
County in 1997. Powell, who participates in Civil War reenactments,
said his group has fought the use of Confederate images by hate
groups. The association's Internet Web page lists a procedure for
members to report such ``heritage violations'' _ use of Confederate
symbols to promote racism or intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our biggest struggle,'' Powell said. ``They use the
American flag and the cross, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Confederate Memorial Day, April 26, is still a state holiday, as
are Confederate military commander Robert E. Lee's birthday, Jan.
19, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis' birthday, June 3.
The state also marks the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday,
the third Monday in January, and Emancipation Day, June 19, the
anniversary of the occupation of Tallahassee and enforcement of the
Emancipation Proclamation. Of those, only King's commemoration
closes state offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War Roundtable, a discussion group with members from
Broward County to the Treasure Coast, does not support or oppose
the proclamation, President Gerridine La Rovere said. She said she
couldn't speak for the group, whose members represent all positions
on the Civil War, but that she'd support the goal of raising
consciousness about the war and its causes and effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what we do with the Roundtable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rivers, a professor of history at predominantly black
Florida A&AMP;M University in Tallahassee, said he believes the war was
mostly about slavery. He said most Northerners fought to preserve
the Union and didn't care about blacks or slavery. But those
Southerners who did not openly support slavery, or claimed to be
fighting strictly for their homeland, countenanced the institution
with their silence _ much like Americans who looked the other way
during this century's darkest racial times share the blame for
them, Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to necessarily honor them or understand their
motives, ideas and attitudes,'' Powell said. ``You can have a
Confederate history (month) without legitimizing the Confederacy,
if you are holistic enough to look at the entire role _ not only of
the Confederacy, but the role of blacks. And women. . . . You have
to look at all the other players.''

WITH SELES AT HER BEST, U.S. ROMPS IN FED CUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Fifteen years ago, a stunning prospect named
Monica Seles moved from Yugoslavia to Florida, seeking the ideal
setting in which to become a world No. 1. Five years ago, Seles, in
the midst of a 27-month exile from tennis after her 1993 stabbing
in Germany, became an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The new allegiance not only gave Seles a sense of validation at
her Florida address; it also qualified her to represent the United
States in Olympic and Fed Cup competition, and her desire to play
on both teams figured prominently in her return to tennis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Performing to the hilt for her adopted home country Sunday, the
25-year-old Seles clinched the first-round Fed Cup confrontation
between the United States and Croatia. With a purposeful 6-0, 6-3
mauling of Iva Majoli, the 1997 French Open champion, Seles not
only gave the United States a 3-0 lead in the best-of-five-match
series, which it went on to sweep, but also improved her Fed Cup
record to 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   Seles felt she could safely play in the event only after it was
moved from Zagreb, Croatia, to the Raleigh Racquet Club, whose
2,500-seat stadium sold out on two weeks' notice. She experienced
mixed emotions during the weekend: not only were many members of
the Croatian delegation old friends of her late father and coach,
Karolj, but she was aware that the NATO bombings that forced the
relocation of this round from Croatia had targeted her Yugoslav
hometown of Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult three weeks,'' said Seles, who has been
in contact with friends and relatives by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Seles insisted the hostilities overseas did not affect her
relationship with the Croatian team. ``We see each other as
friends, as tennis players; we're not the politicians,'' said
Seles, who kissed Majoli at netside after their match.
</P>
<P>
   Seles encountered little resistance from Majoli, who admitted to
still feeling the effects of the demanding 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 10-8
loss to Chanda Rubin on Saturday that kicked off this series.
Majoli identified the pulverizing shots bearing down on her from
all angles of the court Sunday as vintage Seles. ``It was more like
her playing perfect and I could do nothing,'' Majoli said.
</P>
<P>
   As Croatia's Fed Cup captain, Vjeran Friscic, put it: ``Monica
doesn't give you time even to think. She's so good a player that
even if you give your 100 percent, you can lose, you can maybe get
four games.'' That was all Silvija Talaja got from Seles in
Saturday's second singles match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always seem to produce the best tennis for Fed Cup, and I'm
really focused,'' said the third-ranked Seles, who prepared for
this team event by capturing her first clay court title in seven
years last week in the Bausch &AMP; Lomb Championships at Amelia
Island, Fla. Sunday's victory took Seles, whose ferocity in the
18-minute opening set induced virtual paralysis in Majoli, only 43
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Seles, the 23rd-ranked Rubin, who replaced the injured
Davenport in singles, posted a 2-0 singles record over the weekend
and, according to King, re-established herself as a major contender
after a slow rehabilitation from major wrist surgery in 1996.
Sunday Rubin, a 23-year-old from Louisiana, took a less arduous
route to success than in her near-three-hour marathon with Majoli.
She pounded the 70th-ranked Talaja into submission, 6-3, 6-4, in 71
minutes. &QL;

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   My fellow commuters and I were in the last minutes of the Long
Island Rail Road ride into New York City. Suddenly, the conductor
announced we would not be able to enter Pennsylvania Station but
would be diverted to the Hunters Point Avenue stop. As we
disembarked to make our way to the No. 7 subway station, the
conductor announced the subway ride would be free to compensate for
the inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the station, the ticket booth workers could
not open the gate to the platform. Passengers were permitted to
jump the turnstiles. It was amazing to watch the various styles.
The younger folks easily lifted themselves up and over. Some
elderly people were hoisted over by other passengers. One creative
type went over hands first and somersaulted upon landing.

   The Rev. James Gilhooley had grave doubts as to whether he would
make the 10:05 a.m. train from Cold Spring, N.Y., to the city. As
he was rushing to the station, he prayed that there would be a
delay, but when he finally got to the station, he found he had two
minutes to spare. Human nature being what it is, Gilhooley was then
more than a little annoyed when he heard an announcement that the
train would be 10 minutes late. On reflection he calmed down. ``I
recalled my almost hysterical prayer to my employer,'' he said,
``and realized that it was I who was responsible for the delay.''

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   At a Rangers game at Madison Square Garden last month the puck
flew over the glass and into the hands of a spectator. The lucky
man impressed the rest of us by walking over to a young boy five
seats away and giving him the souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was delighted and there was a general murmur of
appreciation, except for a heavy beer-swilling man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a son, too,'' he grumbled loud enough for the boy to
hear, ``and he's in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thought the remark in poor taste but no one knew what
to say. Then a woman spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your son's in the hospital?'' she asked politely.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we speak,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are you doing here?'' she said.

   Jane Block, shopping in her local health food store, placed a
container of fresh tofu in her basket. A well-dressed man
approached her and in a clipped British accent asked exactly what
she did with the tofu. She replied that normally she put it in her
refrigerator, looked at it for several weeks and then threw it
away. The man replied: ``That's exactly what my wife does with it.
I was hoping you had a better recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a little early in life for such angst, Lorrie Stuart
thought. She was on a Second Avenue bus as a small boy walked down
the aisle with his mother. The boy was whimpering, ``I can't take
it, I can't take it, I can't take it.'' When they reached their
seats, she heard the youngster continue his lament, indicating a
New Yorker is a New Yorker at any age: ``I can't take the bus,
Mommy, I want to take a taxi,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like any father watching one of his son's hockey
games, Walter Gretzky looked on intently from the stands Sunday,
his hands cupped around his mouth. Sometimes he offered his son
advice, sometimes encouragement and sometimes well-deserved
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you miss that?'' he hollered, after Wayne Gretzky,
Walter's son, whiffed on a shot in front of an open net during the
Rangers' 2-1 loss to the Penguins, the final game of a glorious
20-year career in the NHL. Moments later, it was, ``That's the
way,'' after Wayne helped set up Brian Leetch for the Rangers' goal
with another one of his signature passes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of mixed emotions for Walter, 60, who sat with his
wife, Phyllis, his daughter-in-law, Janet Jones, and his three
grandchildren in the lower-section seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad,'' said Walter, who retired in 1991 after 37
years with the telephone company in Brantford, Ontario. ``But at
the same time, it's what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like just yesterday he skated for the first time,''
he added. ``I just can't find the words to say how proud I am of
Wayne. He's accomplished so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times during play stoppages, fans formed a line on the
stairs next to Walter, hoping to get an autograph. With a warm
smile, and sometimes with a story about Wayne, he obliged every
request.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky credits his father as the greatest influence in
his life, both on and off the ice. Walter was his son's first
coach, and he remains his close friend and confidant.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne has sought Walter's advice on nearly everything over the
years, especially when faced with a tough decision. But when Wayne
was faced with his hardest choice _ deciding whether to retire from
the game he has dominated across two decades _ Walter was left out
of the loop, saying Sunday that his son never consulted him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Walter said that Wayne did not inform him of his
decision until last week, and that Wayne told his mother first, two
months before. The reason Wayne never asked for advice on this one
was simple, Walter said. It was because he would have done and said
everything to keep Wayne from hanging up his skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a year ago, I asked him, When are you going to retire,
when are you going to quit?'' Walter said. ``And he says, `Well,
Dad, you have to understand something. Every year you go to camp,
the guys are bigger, faster, stronger, smarter. They are better,
and I'm getting older.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wanted to quit when he was still an asset to the
team, not a drag on anybody. He didn't want to be told, `Maybe you
should retire, Wayne.' He made this decision on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``I would have liked to see him play another
year, maybe two.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne was 6 years old when Walter flooded the backyard of the
family's home in Brantford, creating the rink where Wayne would
play for six hours every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks I made the rink so that Wayne could be a
hockey player,'' Walter said, holding court with the news media
outside the Rangers' locker room before the game. ``But the truth
is, I used to take him to the outdoor rink at the park, and I used
to freeze to death. Kids don't get cold, especially when they are
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I came home one night and said this is ridiculous,'' he
added. ``You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make a rink in
the backyard so that he can go out there when he wants, and for as
long as he wants. And I could sit in the house where it was nice
and warm. So it was self-preservation. That's the honest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne said that the most touching moment Sunday was when his
father came up to him after the game and told him how proud he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a son, you want to hear it,'' Gretzky said with
moist eyes. ``He told me he was very proud of me.'' &QL;

CANADIANS FLOCK TO SEE THE GREAT ONE ON ICE ONE LAST TIME

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Sunday was a sad day to be Canadian, it was an
even sadder day to be a Canadian standing outside Madison Square
Garden at 3:14 p.m., holding a small sign that said, ``I need 1
please.''
</P>
<P>
   But such was Rick Laliberte's plight. As Wayne Gretzky, hockey
legend and native of Brantford, Ontario, began skating for the
Rangers in his last professional game, Laliberte, member of
Parliament from Beauval, Saskatchewan (pop. 717), strode up and
down a chilly Seventh Avenue in a state of increasing desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our national sport,'' Laliberte, a strikingly tall man
clad in black shorts, whose haircut looked something like a
coonskin cap, said distractedly. ``Got to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Laliberte did not need to be warned about fake tickets. He had
already given a scalper $300 (about $450 Canadian), only to be told
at the gate that the tickets were counterfeit. ``It's luck,'' he
said. ``It's a game of luck, isn't it, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the game wore on, Laliberte's countrymen stood on the
steps of the Garden, hoping for a last-minute godsend while
reflecting on the day's significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a Canadian, it's an identity thing, but it's also a piece
of history,'' said Romen Abergel, a transplanted Torontonian who
lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. ``I only watch hockey
now because of Gretzky _ it's too rough now. And I don't think I'm
going to watch much more after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Huber, an investment banker from Calgary who recalled
skating against a 12-year-old Gretzky in a Pee Wee League game in
which the little Great One scored 11 goals, said that by doing so
much to popularize hockey in the United States, Gretzky had
indirectly undermined the game in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two things that symbolize the Americanization of
hockey,'' Huber said as he politely turned down offers from several
scalpers. ``One is when the Americans won the Olympics in 1980. The
other is when Gretzky was traded to L.A. He opened up the market,
but now Canadian teams like Calgary can't afford marquee players
anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if it's just down to Montreal,
Toronto and Vancouver soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone tried to get in. At Charley O's restaurant and
sports bar on the north side of the Garden, John Durko, another
transplant from Toronto, was happy to watch the game on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been passing off the whole game,'' Durko said a few
minutes into the second period, as he dug into a plate of Buffalo
wings. ``That's the kind of player he is. He's still got eyes in
the back of his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the game ended, the competition outside the Garden
remained fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want a ticket,'' said Glenn Jamieson, an oil rig
worker from Nova Scotia. ``All I want is a stub. I'm Canadian,
Gretzky's from Canada, hockey's Canada and Canada's hockey. He's
never coming back.'' He approached a woman passing by. ``Were you
at the game, Sweetie?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who asked to be identified as ``the otherwise
honorable and eminent Raina Perlmutter'' of Cedarhurst, Long
Island, had not been at the game. She, too, had come to scavenge
for stubs, for her brother, a die-hard Ranger fan who moved to
Toronto several years ago. ``I thought they'd be laying on the
ground here,'' she said, adding she was ``too old to be doing this.
Isn't this pathetic?''
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson returned a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you'll get a nice ending,'' he said, flashing a pair of
glossy stubs. ``I got two $105 tickets. This'll go in my
scrapbook.''

JONES WINS HEATED 400
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT, Calif. _ Appropriately for April, Marion Jones was taxed
to the limit Sunday in the Mt. San Antonio College Relays.
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon when temperatures reached into the low 90s,
Jones timed 50.79 seconds in a rare appearance in the 400 meters to
win by more than two seconds over LaDonna Antoine.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-time state champion at Thousand Oaks High, however,
slowed noticeably over the final 50 meters. She collapsed on the
infield for nearly 20 minutes before gaining enough strength to
meet a media phalanx and sign autographs from the crowd of 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race marked the only appearance this year in Southern
California and in the 400 for Jones, the 1998 world leader in the
100, 200 and long jump who now resides in North Carolina. Jones,
23, whose goal is to win five gold medals in the 2000 Olympics,
fell short of her goal to break 50 seconds as well as her meet
record of 50.36 set last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said her only other 400 this season might come in the
World Championships in Seville, Spain, in August as a member of the
U.S. 1,600-meter relay team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to run against the best in the world,'' Jones
said. ``When I have time to sit down and say I am the best, then I
have too much time on my hands. I try to keep myself busy and train
hard. Then, I can step on the track and say I am the best in the
world. It is not being cocky. It is just being confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Ato Boldon couldn't ask for better conditions or a faster track
in the 200 heat. A new pair of spikes, though, would have come in
handy for the 1997 world 200-meter champion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite running gingerly because of sore toes from a change to a
new design, Boldon, a Trinidad native and former NCAA champion from
UCLA, tiptoed to victory in 20.19 seconds, the fourth-fastest time
in the world this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This track always does amazing things, but I had to take what
my foot gave me,'' said Boldon, who posted the world's fastest
100-meter time of 1998 in last year's Mt. SAC Relays. ``I was not
able to move on the second half where I usually move.''
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband, won the shot put in a world-leading
and career-best 70 feet, 3 inches to upset world champion John
Godina. Godina rebounded to win the discus at 213-3. Tisha Waller
won the women's high jump with a yearly world-best of 6-6}.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Marsh and Inger Miller were winners in the men's and
women's 100 in wind-aided marks of 10.06 and 10.92. For Marsh, 31,
the 1992 Olympic champion in the 200 meters, it was only the second
race in two years after being sidelined for 18 months because of
bone spurs in his left heel.

THE PRINCESS RIDES OFF LIKE A QUEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE _ On a January day in 1981 in Tampa, Fla., Julie
Krone made her first ride as a professional jockey.
</P>
<P>
   The horse, appropriately enough, was named Tiny Star.
</P>
<P>
   On her best day, wearing her best shoes, Krone has been checking
in at 4 feet, 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   But at Lone Star Park on Sunday, there was little doubt who was
the day's giant.
</P>
<P>
   Five races. Three victories. A dozen long and loud ovations. One
messy congratulatory cake. And one final stretch drive in the Lone
Star Derby that almost gave the day a storybook finish.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, Julieann Louise Krone said goodbye to racing
Sunday. On a day spiced by champions and by upsets, the tiniest
star stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just about as perfect as it could be,'' said
history's winningest female jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was princess for a day at Lone Star.''
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years, after more than 20,000 mounts and 3,546 winners,
after horrific, rag-doll spills in 1993 and 1995 that left her
wondering if she'd ever ride again, Krone went out a winner by all
but the pickiest of bettor's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, she left on her own terms, on the strong back of a
horse gallantly driving for the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to walk out and realize that, OK, that was the last
time, is important,'' Krone said afterwards. ``I've been on both
ends of the rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone rode big-stakes winners, none bigger than Colonial Affair
at the Triple Crown's Belmont Stakes in '93. And she encountered
grim setbacks _ ``laying on the grass,'' as she put it, ``with
bones poking through my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first major spill on the track came at Meadowlands (N.J.) in
1989 and shattered Krone's left arm. Doctors had to insert a plate
and seven screws.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the Saratoga (N.Y.) season in 1993, Krone was
thrown again. Her right ankle was so shattered, her doctor said the
only worse ankle injury he had seen had been on an airplane-crash
victim. Nine months later, Krone was riding again.
</P>
<P>
   But when she was involved in yet-another spectacular spill, this
one at Gulfstream (Fla.) Park in January, 1995, Krone needed the
help of a psychiatrist to heal the mental scars.
</P>
<P>
   In her autobiography, ``Riding for My Life'', Krone wrote about
the demons that visited her when she was recovering from the
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were on a morphine drip for 18 days, you'd be seeing
the devil, too,'' Krone said, able to smile about it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I had to choose all over again, knowing the spills and
everything that lay ahead, for the chance to experience the joy and
the recognition, I would definitely choose to go through it again _
devil or no devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone came back from the mental traumas and returned to become
one of racing's leading jockeys again. Her victory in February at
the Fair Grounds in New Orleans was the 3,500th of her career.
</P>
<P>
   But no star, even the tiniest and brightest ones, is forever.
</P>
<P>
   Once a high school dropout, she returned home to Michigan in
1997 and received her high school diploma. Through her therapy,
Krone became interested in psychology and wants to get a college
degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's not as if something is pushing me out of the sport,''
she said. ``It's more something pulling me.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Krone, 35, will go down as a pioneer in women's sport.
The little girl who grew up on a farm, riding her pony Dixie, is
proud of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes tend to be known for their successes,'' she said.
``But I would rather have some little girl say, ``Oh, Julie Krone
fell down but she came back. She wasn't afraid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Don't remember her for her smiles in the winner's circle, Krone
said. Remember her for her persistence.
</P>
<P>
   Krone won Lone Star Park's second race Sunday aboard Dance to
Fit. Atop Executive Girl in the third race _ christened the Julie
Krone Classic _ she won again. After the race, fellow jockeys
presented her with a big cake ... and then promptly, playfully,
dumped it on her.
</P>
<P>
   Her final victory came aboard Paris Jet in the fifth race _
three races, three consecutive wins. As Krone hit the finish line,
track announcer John Dooley cried, ``Julie Krone ... When will it
end?''
</P>
<P>
   Like all good princess stories, this ending was a happy one. nn

GRACE ZIA CHU, 99, GUIDE TO CHINESE COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grace Zia Chu, who introduced a generation of Americans to
Chinese cuisine though her cooking classes in Manhattan and her
landmark book ``The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' died Thursday
at a nursing home in Columbus, Ohio. She was 99.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when most Americans believed that chop suey was a
classic Chinese dish, Mrs. Chu led her students and readers, step
by step, down the complicated byways of Chinese cooking, which, she
explained, differed from region to region and, ideally, relied on
raw ingredients that did not come from a can.
</P>
<P>
   For home cooks bewildered by the unfamiliar ingredients and
techniques involved, Mrs. Chu proved to be an ideal guide.
Assuming, correctly, that her readers knew precisely nothing about
Chinese cuisine, she wrote clearly and simply, tailoring her
recipes to the realities of the American kitchen, even if that
meant calling for creamed corn in the recipe for chicken velvet
corn soup.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chu was born in Shanghai. She was the eldest of the nine
children of Zia Hong-lai, a Christian educator and editor, and
Sochen Sze. After graduating from the McTyeire School for Girls in
Shanghai in 1918, she won a scholarship to Wellesley College in
Wellesley, Mass., where she earned a degree in physical education
in 1924. After returning to China, she taught at McTyeire and
taught physical education at Ginling College in Nanjing, and from
1935 to 1947, she was a vice president of the world Young Women's
Christian Association.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, she married Chu Shih-ming, an army officer and an
official in the Nationalist government who at one time was an
interpreter and aide-de-camp to Chiang Kai-shek. When he was posted
as a military attache to the Chinese Embassy in Washington in 1941,
Mrs. Chu took on the entertaining duties that transformed her into
an ambassador for Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chu returned to China after World War II but left in 1950
and took up permanent residence in the United States, becoming a
citizen in 1955. By that time she had settled in Manhattan, where
she began teaching cooking classes at the China Institute. For the
next 30 years, she taught at the institute, the Mandarin House
restaurant and at her apartment on West 111th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Her classes later resulted in two cookbooks, ``The Pleasures of
Chinese Cooking'' (1962) and ``Madame Chu's Chinese Cooking
School'' (1975).
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' Mrs. Chu patiently
guided her readers through unfamiliar territory. She listed and
described the basic ingredients of Chinese dishes, and the utensils
and techniques used to prepare them. She showed how to use a
Chinese cleaver, how to hold chopsticks, how to grow bean sprouts
at home and how to order a proper Chinese meal in a restaurant. In
a concession to American tastes, Mrs. Chu included recipes for chop
suey, chow mein and other Chinese-American hybrids, but then
pressed on to offer more authentic fare like string beans in bean
curd sauce and lobster with black bean sauce, as well as
challenging banquet dishes like shark fins with Chinese cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book may well be the finest, most lucid volume on Chinese
cooking ever written,'' Craig Claiborne wrote in The New York Times
in 1962. To a generation of Americans familiar with the
distinctions among Sichuan, Hunan and Cantonese cooking styles,
``The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' reads like a period piece, but
in the early 1960s it was a badly needed instruction manual. It is
telling that in his review of the book, Claiborne had to explain to
readers that a wok was ``a Chinese cooking utensil.''
</P>
<P>
   With Arthur Chu, Mrs. Chu wrote ``Oriental Antiques and
Collectibles: a Guide'' (1973), ``Oriental Cloisonne and Other
Enamels'' and ``The Collector's Book of Jade'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1965, and Mrs. Chu moved to Columbus in
1986. She is survived by her sister, Ruth Zia, of Columbus; two
sons, Samuel, of Columbus and Daniel, of New York City; three
grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

ROOKIE IS IN AWE AS GRETZKY PASSES THE TORCH

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manny Malhotra, a wide-eyed and grinning 18-year-old,
may not have looked much different from any other fan crammed into
Madison Square Garden Sunday. But he was wearing a Rangers jersey
with No. 6 and his name stitched on the back rather than the No. 99
jerseys that pervaded the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed into the corner of the bench nearest center ice as Wayne
Gretzky was honored before his final game, Malhotra watched
carefully. Not yet born when Gretzky scored his first goal in the
NHL and not 1 year old by the time Gretzky had 100 goals, he was
now a successor to Gretzky's center position, a teammate and, oddly
enough, a friend of the superstar 20 years his senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I've been alive, he's been in the league,''
Malhotra said. ``It's kind of almost an eerie feeling to think that
after this we're not even going to see him on the ice anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gretzky concluded the most brilliant career in NHL history
Sunday, Malhotra finished his rookie season, well aware that his
career would never reach the heights that Gretzky's had, but
touched that Gretzky had allowed the two to bond without a hint of
difference in age or skills.
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky beckoned his teammates to join him on his final lap
around the ice, they trailed in his wake as they had all during his
tenure here. But even if he was the center of attention, having
them beside him was the only way he would have it. ``That was
pretty special to me,'' Malhotra said. ``All of us wanted to hoist
him off the ice, but he didn't want that. He wanted to be with the
guys. That was another thing that represents what Wayne is all
about. He wanted everybody to share in this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The first week of training camp, Gretzky issued a dinner
invitation to Malhotra, who was the Rangers' first-round pick in
the 1998 NHL entry draft and the seventh selection over all. As the
months and games passed this year, Gretzky's everyman persona in
the locker room caused Malhotra to sometimes forget that this was
his boyhood idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great friend,'' Malhotra said. ``He treats everybody
equally. From day one he was very kind to me. He's said a lot of
nice things about me and to me and allowed me to relax a lot. He's
been really a great friend and a great teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   It came to an end Sunday, a day that Gretzky's teammates knew
might be coming but hoped until last week to avoid. It was not
until Thursday night in Ottawa that Gretzky told them that his
decision had been made to step away from the game at 38 years old.
After the players heard the word from Gretzky, it was the reaction
from the fans that shook Malhotra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting in Ottawa it was pretty special, and you had a sense
of just how big he is in the hockey industry, in the world, as a
role model,'' Malhotra said. ``We were in an opposing building, and
every time he touched the puck everybody was going nuts. They
wanted him to be a hero that night. Friday with the press
conference, to see how many news stations, how many people, were
there to cover it, it was another big event. You can see how big it
is. But still, it's nice to have that feeling that he's a normal
guy and I have that opportunity to speak with him as a normal guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody ever will play the way he does. I
learned a lot of the way he handles himself off the ice, with
media, with fans, just the way he carries himself in general. He's
a real classy man. Next year, I'll obviously have more
responsibility on the ice. But in terms of coming up after Wayne, I
don't think anybody is ever going to fill that void that he's left.
No one is ever going to be 99.''

NEW DRIVERS PICK UP SPEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ It took 25 years, but the Long Beach Grand
Prix has finally run out of Unsers and Andrettis.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1983, the race through the streets of
Long Beach was not graced by the presence of six-time winner Al
Unser, Jr. Little Al, the most veteran driver on the Championship
Auto Racing Teams (CART) circuit at 18 years, was home
rehabilitating a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   For the eighth straight time here, Michael Andretti, the 1986
winner and heir to his dad Mario's legacy, finished down the track.
He's gone 7, 21, 22, 7, 9, 6, 16 and 16 his last eight tries here,
and in general has been a non-factor. He last led a lap here in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dynamic change for a race which has traded on auto
racing royalty for most of its 25 years, one in which an Unser or
an Andretti won 10 of 12 races between 1984 and 1995. It's a given
that half of the crowd on hand Sunday was there to see and display
skin. But even the half on hand for the exhaust probably never
heard of winner Juan Montoya until he got the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   Or runnerup Dario Franchitti, or pole sitter Tony Kanaan, and
certainly not those three Brazilians in the field named Cristiano,
Helio and Tarso. There were six rookies in the field and more than
half of the 27 entrants have been on the circuit four years or
less.
</P>
<P>
   So as Long Beach prepares for its next 25 years, becoming
acquainted with the next generation of driver is a priority. And
this is only bad for those tethered to the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Zanardi, now racing Formula One, emerged here with wins in
1997 and 1998 and should be back in 2001. Scotland's Franchitti and
Valencia's Brian Herta have finished 2-3 here in consecutive years.
Kanaan impressed everyone before losing control of his vehicle on
lap 45. Rookie Montoya, meanwhile, won his his first race in just
his third CART ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing good young rookie crops come along every year,''
said Chip Ganassi, whose career as a team owner has been much more
successful than his driving career. He finished 25th in 1984, but
Target/Ganassi racing has won three straight CART season titles and
now four straight in Long Beach. ``I only wish they all had an
equal opportunity to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   CART success trades on the speed of the car. On a narrow and
unpassable road circuit like Long Beach, there is much more driving
than racing. Franchitti said the difference Sunday was Montoya's
Honda handling the turns better than his.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to finding a winning driver than what Ganassi
called ``DFL,'' an embellishment of dumb luck. Montoya, 23, began
driving karts at the age of five and has been competing since he
was nine. He attended the Skip Barber driving school at the age of
17 and has dominated every step he's taken in racing. He won the
European Formula 3000 championship last year.
</P>
<P>
   That success led Ganassi to put him into the Target/Ganassi
number four car that Zanardi drove the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have high expectations, and anyone we would have
put into number four would have faced expectations,'' said Ganassi.
``I knew Juan had the talent. I didn't know he had the mental
toughness to put the challenges (of the last two races) behind him
like he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanical problems cost Montoya a higher finish in his first
race in Miami (he finished tenth), and he ran out of gas late last
week in Japan. ``We (the team) let him down in his first two races,
but he came in focused on what he had in hand instead of the last
two races.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi said Montoya and the team crew share a dynamic that is
as healthy as it is important. ``A certain bit of (driver)
impatience can prod a team. It's a push-pull thing. You have to
push the driver, and to an extent, the driver has to push back. A
little bit of impatience in a driver can help ... a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya aside, other new Beach names have a little bit of
talent. Last season, runnerup Franchitti won three races and
finished in the top five nine times, and he and Montoya have the
best road cars.
</P>
<P>
   Herta has 27 top ten finishes in the last three seasons and has
been third in back-to-back LBGP's. Sunday's show came in his backup
car because of a fuel problem. ``We didn't have the car to race
with the leaders today, so getting on the podium is a great
finish,'' said Herta.
</P>
<P>
   Herta said some of the day's best driving was done by Kanaan, a
24-year-old Brazilian who was the 1998 rookie of the year with four
top five finishes. He led 44 laps Sunday before a turn nine miscue.
``Sometimes you learn the hard way,'' he said. ``It hurts, but I
proved to myself that I can run up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Fernandez won in Japan last week on an oval and was
fourth in Sunday's road course in a brand new chassis. Canada's
Greg Moore has 20 top five finishes in three seasons and doesn't
turn 24 until next week. And Christian Fittipaldi, the nephew of
racing legend Emerson Fittipaldi, was about the only driver
attempting to pass on a day in which the race had more parade-like
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   For tradition's sake, it's nice to have an Unser or an Andretti
around. But it's also nice to know Long Beach won't have to depend
on them.

BEN STEPHANSKY, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO BOLIVIA, DIES AT 85 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben S. Stephansky, President Kennedy's ambassador to Bolivia at
a complex time in its history, died on Saturday at his home in
Washington. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Stephansky, whose Ph.D. was in economics from the University of
Wisconsin, was labor attache at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in
the mid-1950s. President Adolfo Lopez Mateos later remembered him
as ``the one American who really understood Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephansky became a career Foreign Service officer in 1956 and
was labor adviser in the State Department's Bureau of
Inter-American Affairs from 1957 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   After John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, ``able young career
men were promoted to ambassador, such as Stephansky in Bolivia,'' a
close Kennedy aide, Theodore C. Sorensen, wrote later.
</P>
<P>
   By then Bolivia was in the 10th year of the period that has been
called the Bolivian National Revolution. It followed a rebellion in
1952 touched off by the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, the
first party in the country's history to gain widespread popular
backing. At that time, the party was a broad alliance and it had
left and right wings.
</P>
<P>
   The 1952 rebels, including miners and national policemen, got
the Bolivian army to surrender after three days of fighting, and
the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement leader Victor Paz Estenssoro
became president for four years. Paz Estenssoro was at first a
neutral force between his party's wings.
</P>
<P>
   An American political scientist, James M. Malloy, wrote in his
book, ``Bolivia: The Uncompleted Revolution,'' (Books on Demand,
1970) that in the Kennedy administration, there was ``a positive
aim to make Bolivia a showcase of guided `democratic revolutionary'
change.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously high aid commitments were increased and
broadened,'' Malloy wrote, ``and a pro-revolution ambassador,
Benjamin Stephansky, was sent to La Paz,'' Bolivia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   With that, President Paz Estenssoro, who was re-elected
president in 1960, came to believe that Kennedy would be unstinting
in giving aid to Bolivia. As Malloy put it, ``Paz then decided to
go all the way with the United States and to shape his regime in
close accordance with the expectations of the Alliance for
Progress,'' the aid program for Latin America that the Kennedy
administration began in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1961, on the day before Kennedy formally nominated
Stephansky to be ambassador, the White House announced that the
United States had offered, and Bolivia had accepted, nearly $10
million in immediate economic aid and relief.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Paz Estenssoro, Washington and Bonn approved a plan
under which the Inter-American Development Bank, the United States
and West Germany would make capital and technical expertise
available, and Bolivia would reduce and discipline its work force.
</P>
<P>
   But in August 1963, the Bolivian cabinet resigned in a crisis
brought on by the Paz government's inability to put into effect a
plan to rehabilitate Bolivia's large and vital tin-mining industry.
The plan entailed dismissing 2,000 workers. Confrontations between
the Bolivian government and tin miners continued. By late 1963
things began to get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   By then it had also been announced that Stephansky would not
stay on as ambassador past the end of 1963 and would return to
Washington because of his wife's health. Then, in 1964, the
Bolivian military overthrew the Bolivian government, and a junta
controlled by Gen. Rene Barrientos Ortuno took power.
</P>
<P>
   Stephansky went on to become, in 1963 and 1964, deputy assistant
secretary of state in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. He was
executive secretary of the United States-Puerto Rico Commission on
the Status on Puerto Rico from 1964 to 1966 and deputy U.S.
representative to the Organization of American States with the
personal rank of ambassador in 1967 and 1968. Later, he held
various posts in foundations and other fields.
</P>
<P>
   Stephansky was born in what is now Ukraine and was brought to
the United States in 1915. He received a bachelor's degree from the
University of Wisconsin in 1939 and his doctorate in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Anne; two sons, Evan of Alexandria,
Va., and Tom of Denver; a daughter, Kate Stephansky of Olney, Md.;
and two grandchildren.

LONG SHOT'S NAME HAS BETTER RING AFTER LONE STAR DERBY WIN
</HEADLINE>
 STAR DERBY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Chris Candies liked everything about T.B.
Track Star except the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was terrible,'' he said. ``Until now.''
</P>
<P>
   What changed the mind of the 29-year-old trainer was hearing
T.B. Track Star called as the long shot winner of Sunday's $300,000
Lone Star Derby. The name has a certain ring to it now, Candies
concedes.
</P>
<P>
   T.B. Track Star, a 31-to-1 long shot ridden by Eddie Martin,
finished 11/4 lengths clear of Desert Demon and Julie Krone to
spoil Krone's swan song as a jockey. Congratulate, who opened an
eight-length backstretch lead in swift fractions, held on for
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to catch him,'' said Krone, whose
high-pitched voice was audible on ESPN's replay as she screamed at
her mount in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Black Mercury, the even-money favorite trained by Bob Baffert,
was never in the hunt. He finished fourth in the 11/16 mile race
after breaking awkwardly from the gate and getting sandwiched into
the first turn. Baffert saddled odds-on favorite Real Quiet to a
runner-up finish in the Texas Mile an hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by T.B. Track Star helped erase the memory of a
bitter loss he suffered at Fair Grounds on March 29, when he was
disqualified from an allowance win in one of the most controversial
calls of the New Orleans track's season.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's race, he had officially won once in six
starts. But Candies was confident in the gray colt, claimed for
$20,000 in January by co-owner and previous trainer Forrest Lanning
of Kenner, La.
</P>
<P>
   Candies, a Thibodaux, La., native, said he had watched T.B.
Track Star for two months and tried to claim him out of the same
Fair Grounds maiden race, but lost the drawing to Lanning. He
finally got to train the horse when he purchased a half-interest
from Lanning for $40,000 on behalf of his father, Kevin, after the
race lost by disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   Candies decided to run T.B. Track Star in the Lone Star Derby
because the competition didn't appear formidable. And as the race
approached, he liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got stronger every day this week,'' Candies said. ``He
blossomed right before my eyes. He kind of put it all together for
us today. I thought maybe we could sit tactically in the race and
make a big-time move and win it, kind of like what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   T.B. Track Star patiently chased Congratulate for nearly a mile
before taking command in midstretch. He was timed in 1:42.92, and
paid $65.60, by far the highest price in three runnings for a Lone
Star Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   None of the horses in the race will try the May 1 Kentucky
Derby, and T.B. Track Star is likely to run again at Lone Star this
season.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, T.B. Track Star was named by his Florida
breeder, Theodore Bottomley, a farm night watchman. Bottomley
acquired the colt's dam, She's a Barron, for free in lieu of
payment for services rendered. He names each of his mare's foals
with his initials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the mistake of looking up his breeding,'' Lanning said
of T.B. Track Star. ``It's zero out of zero, by zero out of zero.
He's got no pedigree at all. But this horse is just an athlete.''

GENTILOZZI WINS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Chris Neville, the reigning Trans-Am rookie
of the year, didn't waste any time before he pulled a big-time
rookie maneuver. Brian Simo, who founded the clothing company No
Fear, drove as if he had No Brain.
</P>
<P>
   With the two top qualifiers out of his way virtually before
Sunday's race began, Paul Gentilozzi cruised to his second
consecutive Trans-Am victory at Long Beach and third in the eight
races run here.
</P>
<P>
   Gentilozzi finished 2.7 seconds ahead of John Miller IV and 4.7
seconds ahead of Michael Lewis in a race that was shortened to 32
laps due to several cautions. This one, though, wasn't determined
at the finish but at the start.
</P>
<P>
   Neville, a promising 27-year-old who on Saturday had captured
his first pole, was pushed down Shoreline Drive and into the first
turn by Simo, who had won the final two races of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Neville, in trying to hold off Simo, hit his brakes too late,
spun 180 degrees and came to a stop in the middle of the track.
</P>
<P>
   Simo and Lewis skated past him to the right and Gentilozzi
squeaked past to the left. But Stu Hayner, who finished second last
year and had jumped from 10th to fifth on the start, came around
the corner and plowed into Neville knocking them both from the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Brian was going to be aggressive he's from Southern
California and Chris is young and a little impetuous,'' said
Gentilozzi. ``I knew I only wanted to win the race (not the
start).''
</P>
<P>
   The pileup caused race officials to restart the race and when
they did, Simo drew a black flag and a stop-and-start penalty for
jumping the pace car.
</P>
<P>
   Simo went back to 19th and was eventually knocked out on the
eighth lap when he was part of a three-car pileup that started when
actor Craig T. Nelson, making his Trans-Am debut, crashed into the
tire barrier in front of the Aquarium of the Pacific fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Simo and Neville were unavailable for comment after the race,
but Gentilozzi said he was the benefactor of testosterone run amok.
</P>
<P>
   When Gentilozzi, who had won nine poles and seven of the 13
Trans-Am races last season, scrambled in the last week with changes
to his car and banged it up Saturday in qualifying, the rest of the
top contenders suddenly felt hope especially on a course in which
there are only two good passing opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were relegated to third (in qualifying) and when that
happened, everybody else starts feeling their oats and feels
immortal,'' Gentilozzi said. ``It was obvious that going into Turn
1 that Brian did a good job messing with Chris' head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like to have your first pole. There's a lot
of pressure. ... I can remember the feeling that Chris was having
and I can sympathize with the way he feels now. He feels he got
robbed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Simo's gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to the Queen Mary,'' said Gentilozzi. ``I don't
know where he was going. The rest of the field hadn't even passed
the hairpin (leading onto Shoreline Drive and the starting line)
and he took off. It was way too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who overtook Lewis for second after the caution was
lifted on Nelson's wreck, made a few nominal runs at Gentilozzi but
never mounted a serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to chase Paul down,'' said Miller, who finished third
in Long Beach last year. ``We got close a couple of times. The care
made a couple of mistakes and I made a couple of mistakes. We'll
just chase him some more.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something Neville and Simo would have loved to try Sunday.

SPORTS COLUMN: COUCH GETS SQUEEZED BEFORE FIRST GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 12 hours before the NFL draft, Leigh Steinberg, the agent
for Oregon quarterback Akili Smith, had reached a tentative deal
with the Cleveland Browns, owners of the first pick.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg is one of the most skilled negotiators in the
business, and, being a draft-day veteran, he can smell a setup.
Something just did not feel right. So Steinberg went to the Browns
and pleaded with them: draft Kentucky's Tim Couch if you want, but
don't use Smith to make Couch more signable. The Browns said they
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's instincts proved accurate. The Browns indeed used
Smith to make sure Couch's signing bonus, which ended up being a
record $12.2 million, did not enter into the $14 million to $15
million stratosphere. It was a ruthless tactic but, to be blunt,
also a smart one. The Browns not only got their man, but also got
him at their price. The fat paycheck being earned by Carmen Policy,
the team president, is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Policy is a shark, and it is that quality that allowed him to
keep the hands of the 49ers flush with Super Bowl rings. He will do
the same with the Browns. Make no mistake: Policy will have his new
franchise in the Super Bowl within five years.
</P>
<P>
   There were several teams that had excellent drafts , but the
Browns head the list because not only did they draft Couch, a
skilled passer with good character, but Policy also made sure the
finances stayed within reason. A signing bonus that could finance
two small countries would hurt the Browns in the long term, and
Policy needed to make sure Couch did not break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   As the two-day draft concluded Sunday night, the Browns were not
the only team to do well.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Cardinals, Minnesota Vikings, Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins got A's. Arizona picked up
two starters in Ohio State wide receiver David Boston and Eastern
Michigan offensive tackle L.J. Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota drafted a talented protege to Randall Cunningham in
Central Florida quarterback Daunte Culpepper. The Vikings also
selected offensive lineman Jay Humphrey from the University of
Texas, the only decent long-snapper in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay can pair Louisiana State defensive tackle Anthony
McFarland with Warren Sapp. The Redskins made a blockbuster trade
to get cornerback Champ Bailey from the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC East also got better. Quarterback Donovan McNabb is in
Philadelphia, Bailey is in Washington, Cardinals quarterback Jake
Plummer has a new target in Boston and protection for his backside
in Shelton. The Cowboys, facing life without Leon Lett because of a
drug suspension, picked a talented defensive tackle in North
Carolina's Ebenezer Ekuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams got better right away,'' Dave Campo, the Cowboys'
defensive coordinator, said of his division rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Chargers and the Giants made some of the more
questionable moves. Oklahoma running back Jermaine Fazande was
taken in the second round by the Chargers and South Dakota State
tight end Steve Heiden was picked in the third. Both are
fourth-rounders at best.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager, is one of the
smartest personnel men in the business, but his second-round pick,
Ohio State running back Joe Montgomery, had some in the league
scratching their heads. Why take Montgomery in the second round
when he would have easily been there much later?
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Miami Dolphins, who took one of the biggest
known risks in the draft by selecting troubled running back Cecil
Collins, a first-round talent with second-rate character. Collins
was arrested for unauthorized entry and battery while in college
and he also failed a drug test for marijuana while at McNeese
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves an opportunity,'' Miami coach Jimmy Johnson said
of Collins, a fifth-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about Collins, former Giants running back Tyrone
Wheatley, now with the Dolphins, requested a trade, saying the
six-man backfield is too crowded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already there were some coaches and executives in the league who
were privately patting themselves on the back, saying that Collins
going low is proof that the league is learning its lessons when it
comes to troubled players. Then one assistant coach put things in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The coach said his team's security report, a document that
details players' arrests, listed some two dozen players who had
been accused of the same crimes as Collins or worse. The coach said
the litany of arrests included spousal abuse, armed robbery and gun
possession charges.
</P>
<P>
   And many of those players, the coach said, were drafted in the
first four rounds. They didn't suffer the same kind of news media
scrutiny that Collins did, so their alleged crimes were mostly
unknown. Thus, teams felt comfortable drafting them because their
misdeeds would most likely never become public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams want to do the right thing, honestly,'' the coach said,
``but then they see that big, fast back or that quarterback with
the great arm and go gaga. Teams want to win; that's the bottom
line of a draft.'' &QL;
