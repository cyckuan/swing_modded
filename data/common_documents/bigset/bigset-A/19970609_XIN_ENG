LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Prime Minister Tony
Blair is to take part in 90-minute question-and-answer sessions
with the public in a bid to keep in touch with ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street sources were quoted by BBC television as saying
today that the question-and-answer sessions will be held each
month on a Friday and the first experiment session is expected to
start on Friday with the focus on crime.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose Labor party won a landslide victory on a May 1
election, is committed to staying in touch with ordinary British
citizens and will not become isolated in Westminster (British
parliament), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining this initiative on Saturday, Blair said: "We have
been elected as New Labor with a set of specific promises to
fulfil. It's our contract with the British people. Like contract,
it's dependent on the satisfaction of both sides."
</P>
<P>
"That's why I want the British people to have the chance
regularly to intervene to make sure we are living up to our
promises," Blair added.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today expressed the hope

signing defense pact with it after the Gulf War, will remain solid
under a new French government.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Join Palestinian-Israeli Experts Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Uniteed States is expected to
join the imminent Palestinian-Israeli expert meeting here to
narrow the differences between the two sides on major issues on
top of the Mideast peace crisis, according to the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties that hinders its convocation, the meeting
will go on as scheduled this evening to discuss the resumption of
the stalled peace talks that broke off in March as Israel broke
ground for Har Homa, a new Jewish neighborhood in disputed Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Egypt's last-minute contacts with both sides to
clear the obstacles, a U.S. delegation would take part in the
Cairo meeting as an observer, besides Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's top aide Osama el-Baz, well-informed sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian meeting of experts would begin by 20:00
hours local time (17:00 GMT), according to the sources here.
</P>
<P>
However, as time slipped away, the Palestinian and Israeli
sides still face some controversial points, especially the
Jerusalem status and halting construction of new settlements.
</P>
<P>
The decision of holding the Palestinian-Israeli expert meeting
was made after a meeting between Yitzhak Molcho, advisor to
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat Friday and was
announced here Saturday following talks between Arafat and Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian minister of local government and chief
negotiator, arrived here this afternoon, leading a Palestinian
delegation that includes Hassan Assfour, coordinator of
negotiations affairs, and Marwan Kanafani, advisor to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Beating a note of cautious optimism over the outcome of today's
meeting, Erekat said that "let us meet but without indulging in
optimism."
</P>
<P>
Arafat's political advisor Nabil Abu Radainah said that there
was nothing new up till now on the part of the Israelis who still
refuse to freeze their settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation embarked on the trip to the Egyptian
capital only after Erekat denied a report that Israel had agreed
to a freeze in settlements building.
</P>
<P>
Kanafani said earlier today that Israel had agreed in principle
to halt the Har Homa project.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources anticipated that the Israeli delegation
would include Molcho and Dan Navehm, Israeli cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources told Israel Radio that there is a possibility
to reach a compromise during today's meeting on "certain
suspension" regarding building of settlements, but these sources
denied reports that Israel has agreed to halt building in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, known
for his anti-peace process stance, expressed opposition to the
negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians under the
auspices of Egypt and said Israel should run its own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has reportedly proposed a five-point initiative,
including calls for halting the settlements, stopping any change
in the status of Jerusalem, and committing Israel to the peace
accords it signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said they would agree to return to the
negotiating table if Israel accepted a freeze on settlement
activities until both sides concluded talks on the final status of
the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Enjoys Press Freedom, Says President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour said today that the Isles enjoyed a level of press freedom
unsurpassed anywhere in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference organized for the visiting journalists
from Kenya at the Maisara State Lodge in the town of Zanzibar,
Amour said that journalist were free to practice their profession
freely in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Amour said, however, that there were limits to any freedom,
including press freedom, and anyone found to work beyond existing
regulations will be censured.
</P>
<P>
The president gave the example of the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) coverage in Zanzibar, which he said was "of the
kind that would not have been tolerated anywhere else."
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions asked by the visiting newsmen, Amour
stressed that there was not any crisis and violation of human
rights in Zanzibar and noted that the misinformation was being
spread by the opposition in an attempt to attract foreign
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
He said any oppressive regime would want to arrest and torture
its opponents which was not the case in Zanzibar where prisons
were almost empty with some having only seven inmates and whose
crimes were not of a political nature.
</P>
<P>
He said the people of Pemba were let down by the opposition
Civic United Front (CUF) party, denying allegations that the
government has suspended the right to schooling of children whose
families are suspected to sympathize with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Amour explained that it was the opposition who had initiated
the boycott of classes in Pemba early in 1996, prompting
government intervention to persuade pupils to go back to school.
</P>
<P>
The president said the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund are still in the isles to cooperate with Zanzibar
since it is their policy not to interfere in the internal affairs
of sovereign states, refuting earlier reports for the withdrawal
of the two international monetary organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said some malicious propaganda against Zanzibar, which has
led to the suspension of aid, has had little effect on the
country's economy, adding that the 1997/98 budget proposals have
been written in consideration of reduced external revenue.
</P>
<P>
On plans to make Zanzibar a free port by the year 2000, Amour
said the move was aimed at making Zanzibar a transit trade center
for East and Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
On the anti-drug campaign, the president said his government
is stepping up efforts to check the trafficking and abuse of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member mass media delegation has been in Zanzibar
since July 4. They will wind up their tour of the Isles tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Global Ivory Summit Faces Hard Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The fate of tens of thousands
of elephants will depend on the outcome of disputes at a meeting
to be attended by representatives from 138 countries in Harare,
capital of Zimbabwe, tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The 138 countries are members of the United Nations Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe, which between them have 175,000
elephants, are leading the charge.
</P>
<P>
They are backed by South Africa which also supports a proposal by
its domestic national parks' managements for a resumption in trade in
white rhinoceros products.
</P>
<P>
The ban on ivory trade was imposed in 1989 after poaching had
reduced Africa's elephant population to 625,000 from 1.3 million
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
It has since fallen to about 580,000. According to figures
issued by the CITES, Asia is home to about 50,000 elephants.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of the African elephant on the endangered species
list did not enjoy the support of the countries now seeking a change.
</P>
<P>
Often the elephants there are cramped for space. Zimbabwe, for
instance, is home to 66,000, but its reserves can support 40,000 only.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and its allies seek a lifting of the ban exclusive to
themselves. Ivory for sale would be got only from natural deaths or
from elephants shot after attacking people or trampling their crops.
</P>
<P>
Ivory stocks sterilised in warehouses are huge, about 3,000
tusks in Zimbabwe, slightly fewer than those in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have proposed that the only country to
receive ivory legally should be Japan, where it is primarily used
to carve hankos.
</P>
<P>
A recent CITES panel of exports had a good look at the merits of
all three applications.
</P>
<P>
There were niggles about Botswana's "inadequate" controls over
stocks. Zimbabwe's enforcement of the ban on the ivory trade was
labelled "grossly inadequate".
</P>
<P>
Namibia won high praise and the conclusion was that the proposal
would benefit both elephants and communities.
</P>
<P>
The World Wide Fund for Nature concurred with the conclusion in
principle, but came out in favour of no trade in ivory.
</P>
<P>
Against any lifting of the ban is the London based Environmental
Investigation Agency (EIA), who believes it has been "a huge success"
in saving the African elephants.
</P>
<P>
Southern African conservation ministers noted recently in Windhoek
that opposition to relaxing trade ban comes "mainly from people far
removed from the realities of our wildlife conservation".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Namibia's Ministry for Environment and Tourism said
his country's elephant population numbers between 6,000 and 9,000, the
most of this century.
</P>
<P>
The ivory ban has been counterproductive, he said, adding:
"elephants were by far the biggest losers".
</P>
<P>
He said the ban stripped elephants outside of national parks of all
value and made them disposable.
</P>
<P>
"CITES completely ignores the most insidious and irreversible
threat to wildlife in the world habitat loss," the spokesman claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, more than half of the elephants
wander outside protected areas. Only if they are seen not to be a
pest, if they are worth more alive than dead, will they survive,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Delegation Arrives in Cairo for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli negotiation delegation
flew in here this evening for talks with the Palestinians in a
bid to renew full-scale peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador to Egypt Zvi Mazel hailed the role played
by Egypt to find a way out of the foundered peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian role is good," said the ambassador upon
receiving the Israeli delegation, referring to the successive
visits paid by Osama el-Baz, political advisor of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, to Tel Aviv and Gaza to help resume
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian-Israeli meeting at experts' level later today
will discuss the basis of resuming negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team will consist of cabinet secretary Danny
Naveh, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's senior aide Yitzhak
Molcho and his new political adviser Uzi Arad, as well as
Foreign Ministry adviser Ya'acov Bardugo.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation headed by Saeb Erekat, Palestinian
minister of local government, arrived earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation embarked on the trip to the Egyptian
capital only after Erekat denied a report that Israel had agreed
to a freeze in settlements building.
</P>
<P>
The decision on holding the meeting was made after Arafat
conferred with Netanyahu's senior aide Friday and announced
following his meeting with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Egypt's last-minute contacts, a U.S. delegation
is also likely to take part in the Cairo meeting as an observer,
besides Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's top aide Osama el-Baz,
well-informed sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian meeting of experts would begin by
20:00 hours local time.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of consultations between Israeli and Arab leaders and
among Arabs themselves has boosted the view that a way out of the
current deadlock is pending, and that this has to involve a
cessation or slowdown of Israeli settlement building in disputed
areas, including the Har Homa project in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that Egypt has proposed a five-point
plan, which includes a freeze on any change in the status of
Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement building in the West
Bank for "a sufficient period."
</P>
<P>
In return, the Palestinians would make a firm commitment to
meeting Israel's security demands, they added.

<HEADLINE> Cholera-Hit Zanzibar Gives Green Light to Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
today gave a green light to continued tourist activities after
an outbreak of cholera.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ministry of Health said the disease
was already under control and subsiding.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which follows a report that a number of
tourists coming to Zanzibar went down since cholera broke out on
March 28, stressed that vaccination against cholera was not
compulsory in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
It said tourists could enter Zanzibar without getting vaccines
but it advised that they were free to take oral vaccine against
the disease in their respective countries as an additional
protection.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which has so far killed 31 people and affected
more than 260 others, has compelled the government to close all
restaurants to check the spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
However, closure of restaurants has forced tourists who had
lodged in hotels without restaurant facilities to leave Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The Air Europe plane, which lands in Zanzibar four times a
week, has for three consecutive weeks stopped flying tourists to
Zanzibar for lack of passengers for fear of the killer disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli delegations
opened talks here this evening under the auspices of Egypt in a
bid to renew full-scale peace talks that collapsed two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties that hinders its convocation, the meeting
went on as scheduled to discuss the resumption of the stalled
peace talks that broke off in March as Israel broke ground for
Har Homa, a new Jewish neighborhood in disputed Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It was almost canceled after a Palestinian senior official
said that Israel had agreed to a pause on settlement
construction, an issue at the center of the peace crisis.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's top aide Osama el-Baz took
part as an observer in the meeting that begun at 20:00 hours
local time, according the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian minister of local government and
chief negotiator arrived here this afternoon, leading a
Palestinian delegation that includes Hassan Assfour, coordinator
of negotiations affairs, and Marwan Kanafani, advisor to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Erekat denied any agreement on any issue has preceded the
meeting. "No agreement has been reached with the Israelis so far,
and the gap remains wide," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians will affirm at today's meeting
the need to restore the peace process to its right track. "The
Israeli government has to red with the israelis so far, and the
gap remains wide," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
While the chief Palestinian negotiator refused to disclose
when the Cairo meeting would end, reports said that the
Palestinian delegation would leave for Gaza shortly to report to
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat on the
meeting's outcome and the Israeli proposals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian sources said that if no progress is made
here, a tripartite summit involving the Egyptian, Palestinian and
Israeli leaders would become a possibility.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation, which flew in later, agreed to make
the trip to the Egyptian capital only after Erekat denied a

NICOSIA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis

He said he had told Albright that the missiles would arrive as

made in efforts toward a solution to meet the security needs of
the Greek Cypriots.

According to U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns,
during the talks, Albright expressed "the U.S. long-standing

<HEADLINE> Iran Voices Concern over Turkish Presence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran today voiced its concern over
the presence by Turkish military forces in northern Iraq, saying
it is "sensitive" to Iraqi territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Bourujerdi told
reporters here that Iran gave importance to security of the
regional states and understood the Turkish security problems.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted that the move taken by Turkey is not the solution
to the problem.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Turkish government troops have carried out
cross-border military operations in northern Iraq since May 14 to
destroy the establishment of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party
(PKK) there.
</P>
<P>
Bourujerdi urged Turkey to immediately bring the current
operations in northern Iraq to an end.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey is required to solve its security problem in
cooperation with the regional Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
Bourujerdi said consultations already underway between Iran
and Turkey on the developments in northern Iraq were useful and
Iran believes that such cooperation should continue.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the Iranian diplomacy, Bourujerdi stressed that
Iran will continue to strictly follow its policy of not
allowing the presence of the PKK forces on the Iranian soil.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Parliament Meets Under Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Sierra Leone's dissolved
parliament met on Saturday, in defiance of a ban on political
activities, to denounce the two-week-old military coup and called for
the return of ousted civilian President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the 50 members of the
80-seat parliament unanimously approved a resolution calling on the
military regime to restore the constitution suspended after the coup
on May 25, during the meeting at the Miatta Conference Hall in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Several members of parliament have fled the country in the wake of
the coup.
</P>
<P>
"We the members of parliament unequivocally condemned the overthrow
of the constitutionally elected government of Sierra Leone," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
It called for urgent immplementation of the peace accord signed
between Kabbah's government and rebels, who launched the civil war
in 1991 and have now flooded into Freetown at the call of the coup
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Legitimate grievances of the armed forces of Sierra Leone, the
Revolutionary United Front and all other aggrieved parties must be
immediately addressed," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the coup leaders have been meeting
civilian politicians of the country, trying to win them over, and have
proposed a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has accepted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The coup makers have also sent delegations to west African states
to explain their actions and win support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
There is no report on the military's reaction to the meeting
at the movement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the new military regime has called on the
residents of Freetown to go out to the streets this afternoon to show
their opposition against foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Kamara, spokesman of the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council (AFRC) was quoted as saying on the state radio: "We are
calling on all Sierra Leoneans in Freetown to take to the streets in
their millions, to demostrate against foreign intervention."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the call was made a day before a proposed
meeting on Monday of the United Nations Security Council to discuss
the Sierra Leonean situation.
</P>
<P>
The AFRC statement, read by the spokesman, suggested that the
meeting would give the go-ahead to the intervention by west African
peace-keeping forces led by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"If Freetown does not demonstrate against foreign intervention, the
UN and the international community will take this as a support, that
the people of Sierra Leone want foreign intervention," it added.
</P>
<P>
Another report said there were some people gathering at the
national stadium this afternoon, but it could not confirm whether it
was the meeting called on by the military.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Experts' Talks End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli experts
concluded their two-and-a-half-hour talks here tonight which were
designed to renew full-scale peace talks. But no details were
divulged.
</P>
<P>
Both delegations flew home after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Reporters were kept away in distance as delegates swiftly
walked out of the talks, making no remarks.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties that hinder its convocation, the meeting
went on as scheduled in a bid to reopen the peace talks that
collapsed in March as Israel began construction of a settlement
plan in Har Homa, a new Jewish neighborhood in disputed Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the request of the Palestinian and Israeli
sides under the auspices of Egypt, was almost canceled after a
Palestinian senior official said that Israel had agreed to a pause
on settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's top aide Osama el-Baz took
part as an observer in the meeting that begun at 20:00 hours local
time (17:00 GMT), according the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian minister of local government and
chief negotiator arrived here this afternoon, leading a
Palestinian delegation that includes Hassan Assfour, coordinator
of negotiations affairs, and Marwan Kanafani, advisor to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Erekat denied any agreement on any issue has preceded the
meeting. "No agreement has been reached with the Israelis so far,
and the gap remains wide," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians would affirm at today's meeting
the need to restore the peace process to its right track.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that if no progress is made here, a
tripartite summit involving the Egyptian, Palestinian and Israeli
leaders would become a possibility.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation, which flew in later, agreed to make
the trip to the Egyptian capital only after Erekat denied a
report that Israel had agreed to a freeze in settlements building.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation included Yitzhak Molcho, advisor to
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Dan Navehm, Israeli
cabinet secretary.

LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Bertie Ahern, who is set to become
Ireland's new Prime Minister, has promised to discuss with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, whose opposition Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats
alliance just won a narrow victory in the general election, was
quoted by press reports from Dublin as saying that he expected to
have contacts with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams this week.
</P>
<P>
"I would say I would have contact with Gerry Adams over the
next week if this is possible,'' Ahern said, adding that the
Northern Ireland conflict would be a top priority for the next
government.
</P>
<P>
On the future of the Northern Ireland issue, Ahern expressed
optimistic views on forging a settlement to the 28-year conflict
over Northern Ireland by saying "The possibilities of moving
forward are tremendous."
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments, which had refused to allow
Sinn Fein to attend the all-party talks on the future of Northern
Ireland since last February, have recently reopened contacts with
Sinn Fein in a bid to give a fresh impetus to the Northern Ireland
peace process.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-one people aboard a

A United Airlines spokesman said the pilot of Flight 1517 from

The pilot saw what he described as a Cessna airplane nearby and
took evasive action, steering the jet into an abrupt upward turn.

Two flight attendants were bumped around inside and sustained
minor injuries.

The jet carrying 76 passengers and five crew members later

<HEADLINE> Irish Opposition Wins Narrow Election Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's main opposition alliance,
including the Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, has
snatched a cliffhanger election victory by snatching 81 of the 166
seats in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the Fianna Fail leader Bertie Ahern, who is set to
become the country's new Prime Minister, is expected to have to
woo some support from smaller parties or independents in an effort
to form a working majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ahern was quoted by press reports from Dublin as saying that he
was confident that the parliament would elect him as Ireland's new
Prime Minister when it reconvenes on June 26.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the possibility of enlisting electoral support
from Sinn Fein, the political wing of Irish Republican Army (IRA)
guerrillas, which won one seat and will take its place in the
Irish parliament for the first time since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
On the future tasks of the new government, Ahern said that
three government priorities were "to cut taxes, cut crime and work
for a Northern Ireland settlement."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, final results indicated that Prime Minister John
Bruton's three-party ruling coalition, which won 75 seats in the
election, would have no chance to stay in power. No Irish
government has won an re-election since 1969.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the so-called ruling "Rainbow Coalition" seems to
be triggered by the poor performance of Bruton's main election
partner Labor leader Dick Spring.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party, which is the country's third largest political
party and won 32 seats in 1992 election, suffered a crashing
defeat by losing 15 seats.

BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission announced
on Monday that it had approved emergency medical aid worth 2.8
million ECUs (3.2 million U.S. dollars) for Nicaragua.

<P>
The aid, managed by the European Community Humanitarian Office
(ECHO), will enable European non-governmental organizations to
carry out a nine-month program to control epidemics in the Central
American country.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said the grant would finance supplying basic
medicines and medical supplies for treatment and prevention,
organizing training and preventive campaigns, and providing basic
sanitation and clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show the cases of malaria in Nicaragua have
doubled over the past five years, while those of cholera have
tripled.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the country's population of 4.3 million has no
access to clean drinking water. In rural areas, more than 70
percent do not have basic sanitation facilities.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Strives to Resume Trade Ties With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has taken measures to resume
trade ties with Syria by buying Syrian food and re-opening customs
offices on the border with Syria, according to the Iraqi News
Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
INA today quoted Hameed Shukur Mahmoud, director general of
Iraqi Customs Authority, as saying that Iraq has taken measures
to reopen two customs offices on the border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud said that these measures come within the requirements
of implementing the contracts signed between Iraq and Syrian
companies under the "oil-for-food" deal which allows Iraq to sell
oil in order to buy food and medicine urgently needed in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian business delegation paid a visit to Iraq last week and
signed with Iraq a number of commercial contracts to supply the
Iraqis with food and other daily necessities under the
"oil-for-food" deal signed by Baghdad and the U.N. in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to these contracts, Syria will export to Iraq 5,000
tons of chick-pea, 3,000 tonnes of soap, 4,000 tonnes of washing
powder and 6,000 tonnes of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
These are the first contracts signed between the two countries
after a 17-year interruption of their trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Iraq severed all its ties with Syria in 1980 since the breakout
of the Iraq-Iran War as Damascus sided with Tehran during the
8-year-long war.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two neighbors have further worsened
after Syrian troops joined in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Later last month, a Syrian trade and industrial delegation,
the first one in the past 17 years, paid a historic visit to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad hopes for the resumption of Iraq-Syria ties to return
to "their normal situation" as before, an Iraqi official told INA
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sa'd Qassim Hammoudi, chairman of the Arab and International
Relations Committee at the National Assembly, said that "the interests
of the two brotherly countries (Iraq and Syria) necessitates the
return of their ties to the normal situation not only in the
trade and economic fields but also in other aspects."
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi trade delegation is expected to visit Damascus on
mid-June to "carry out more contracts" with Syrian companies,
according to INA. A re-opening of the borders is likely to be
announced during the delegation's visit.

<P>
Gligorov said that Taiwan is a part of China and that the
Taiwan issue is an internal matter for China. Macedonia backs
China's position on Taiwan and supports its reunification efforts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that China does not pursue any interest of its
own in the the former Yugoslavian region, and always believes that
disputes between the countries in the region should be solved with
a peaceful approach.
</P>
<P>
The countries in the region are China's friends, Jiang said,
adding that he hopes the parties involved will handle the problems
through patient negotiations so as to become good neighbors.
</P>
<P>
This is in the fundamental interest of the people of the region
and conducive to European and world peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the world is moving toward multi-polarization since
the end of the Cold War, Gligorov believed that all countries have
a responsibility in maintaining world peace, and that his country
is happy to see that China is playing an increasingly important
role on the international scene.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the multi-polarization of the world helps
developing countries and small and medium-sized nations to have an
independent role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We stand for a new international political and economic order
that is fair and reasonable should be built on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence and other universally
acknowledged norms governing international relations."
</P>
<P>
China and Macedonia share similar views on many major
international issues, Jiang said, and that China is ready to
strengthen consultation and cooperation with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two presidents signed a joint communique
between China and Macedonia, and attended the signing ceremony for
an agreement between the Chinese and Macedonian governments on
reciprocal protection of investment, an agreement on avoiding
double taxation and the prevention of evasion of income and
capital taxes, a cultural cooperation plan from 1997 to 1999, and
an agreement of cooperation between the China Chamber of
International Trade and the Economic Chamber of Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Training Leaders For China's State-Owned Enterprises Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Wu Bangguo, Chinese vice premier
and member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, emphasized the importance of a three-year
program for training executives and officials of key state-owned
enterprises, when he spoke at the opening ceremony of one of the
courses at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee here
today.
</P>
<P>
Wu called it an important means of improving the management and
Party building in the enterprises and said that, "improving the
leadership of state-owned enterprises ensures the Party's
political guidance in them and It is demanded by reforms and
development."
</P>
<P>
The general assessment of state-owned enterprises' leaders will
be an important job this year, he said, and the assessment will be
based on appraisals by both higher authorities and the employees.
</P>
<P>
He said that training leaders of state-owned enterprises should
combine the study of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, the Party's basic line, and the
Party Central Committee's and the State Council's guidelines and
policies on reform and development of state-owned enterprise with
a socialist market economy, new technology, and management
techniques.
</P>
<P>
"Its aim is to improve the overall political quality and
professional management standards of officials of these
enterprises," Wu explained, emphasizing improved supervision of
state-owned enterprises, because many cases of inefficient
management are caused by out-moded ideas, lack of professionalism,
internal quarrels, and even corruption.
</P>
<P>
To improve supervision, he said, the role of Party committees,
boards of directors, boards of supervisors, and the workers'
congresses should be brought into full play.

<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in talks
with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov this afternoon, said that
Gligorov's visit will strengthen the friendship between the two
governments and peoples and will raise Sino-Macedonian relations
to a new level.
</P>
<P>
China and Macedonia have a tradition of friendship, Jiang
noted, and bilateral relations have achieved many things since
diplomatic ties were opened in 1993. The two countries' leaders
have frequent contacts, the two sides have deepened their
cooperation in politics, the economy, education and the media, and
have been supporting each other in international affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attributed the development of bilateral friendly
relations to two things: Both sides strictly abide by the
principles of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs; and there is no
conflict of interest between the two countries and developing
relations is in the fundamental interests of the two governments
and peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called Macedonia an important country in the Balkan
region and said that China places great importance on developing
relations with it, and respects its independence, territorial
integrity, and sovereignty, and its people's choice of development
road and domestic and foreign policies in relation to their own
national situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is ready to further its relations with
Macedonia on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov said there have been frequent high-level visits since
diplomatic relations were opened, and that there is still great
potential to develop friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia and China share similar views on international
affairs and both countries are making an effort to safeguard world
peace and international cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He thanked China, which is a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, for its support to Macedonia in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote bilateral trade and economic relations,
Jiang said, both sides should encourage companies and regions to
have more understanding and contacts with their counterparts,
cooperate in various ways and encourage the various departments to
play a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of Hong Kong's forthcoming return to the
motherland, Gligorov said he wanted to express his best wishes to
the Chinese government and people and wish Hong Kong a stable and
prosperous future.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An international exhibition of
equipment used in shoe and leather production opened today in
Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
About 400 shoe manufacturers from China's inland areas, Hong
Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries had many of their new products
on display. Famous Italian and German manufacturers were present.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has become an important production and export center
for Chinese shoes, with the greatest production, sales, and export
volume of any province or autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
It produced more than 1.3 billion pairs of shoes in 1996, and
had 3.2 billion US dollars worth of exports, up 18.5 percent from
1995.
</P>
<P>
But it has still not produced any internationally famous brand
of shoes.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the four-day exhibition will help the province
improve the quality of its shoes and help it catch up with
international trends.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Palestinians, Israelis to Meet Again Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli experts will
resume negotiations within the next few days on reviving the
deadlocked peace process, Egyptian presidential political advisor
Osama el-Baz said today.
</P>
<P>
"They will meet again in the coming few days, with the active
participation of Egypt, to reach agreement on the major
contentious issues," Baz told the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
(MENA).
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met here on Sunday night
for the first time in nearly three months in a bid to renew
full-scale peace talks that were paralyzed when Israel began
construction on a new Jewish settlement in the disputed Arab East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Baz, who has been shuttling between the sides trying to revive
peacemaking, attended the talks as an observer.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were held within a positive and constructive
spirit, made "some progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The two delegations have seriously sought to narrow the gap
that divides them and they have managed to reach some progress,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting that lasted for over two hours was chaired by chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli cabinet secretary
Dannay Naveh.
</P>
<P>
The delegations left immediately after the talks to brief the
Israeli government and the Palestinian National Authority over the
results. They later joined Egypt in hailing the good atmosphere
and progress at the Cairo meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials have confirmed that the fate
of the housing project was discussed in the Egyptian-brokered
talks.
</P>
<P>
They said another Palestinian-Israeli meeting with the
participation of Egypt will be held in Israel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has intensified its mediation efforts in the crisis since
a summit between Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu last month.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is pushing a five-point plan which would include a freeze
on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on the Jewish
settlement building in the West Bank for "a sufficient period." In
return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to addressing
Israel's security demands.
</P>
<P>
Israel reportedly has hatched a face-saving compromise under
which it will slow down the construction of the settlement in East
Jerusalem to a near halt to allow the resumption of talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
So far Netanyahu has refused to stop the construction for fear
that such a move will tear his right-wing coalition apart.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Epic About Hong Kong Premieres in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The movie "Opium War", which tells
about the British war of aggression against China from 1840 to
1842, premiered in Beijing today, as part of the festivities
for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Following the war, Britain forced the Qing Dynasty to sign an
unfair treaty and grabbed Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Among the audience were Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and
State Councillor Li Tieying.
</P>
<P>
The production of the film cost more than 80 million yuan (9.6
million US Dollars), and was done by a team of directors from
China's inland areas, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, headed by Xie Jin,
one of China's most successful film directors.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of shooting such a movie is to remind all Chinese of
the past. For any nation, ignorance of the outside world means
backwardness, and a backward country is doomed to be bullied,"
said the 74-year-old Xie.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jiazheng, the minister of Radio, Film and Television,
called it an epic movie. "Only when a country really stands equal
to other nations, can she look her past humiliations in the face,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingqi, vice-director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, said the movie provides all the
Chinese people with a good chance for patriotic education,
especially the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jin and his crew started filming last May. Over 50,000
people, including 3,000 foreigners, appeared in it. More than
20,000 sets of clothing and 20,000 props were made for the movie,
and 47 ships were made or rehabilitated for the film.
</P>
<P>
"The Opium War" is scheduled for 300 cinemas in 14 cities. The
republic of Korea, Japan, Germany and Italy have also bought the
right to show the movie.

<HEADLINE> BIS Report Praises China's Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASLE, SWITZERLAND, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The annual report of the
Basel-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) praises
China's outstanding economic progress.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was published here today, said China reduced
inflation to seven percent by the end of 1996 while economic
growth was maintained at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Further successful demand management will depend on reforming
China's state-owned enterprise sector," it said.
</P>
<P>
Against the background of falling inflation, administered
interest rates were reduced in May and again in August. Yet
monetary policy remained cautious as real interest rates were kept
positive, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Major progress was also made last year in modernizing the
monetary policy framework, including the establishment of an
interbank market no longer subject to interest rate ceilings; the
promotion of more competitive sales of Treasury securities and a
trial launching of open market operations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese yuan stayed virtually unchanged against the dollar
as intervention channeled strong capital inflows into reserves, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Given still large inflation differentials vis-a-vis trading
partners, there was a real appreciation of eight percent,
following one of 11.5 percent in 1995, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian President Visits Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- President of the Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic said here today that peace
would never be implemented fully unless war crimes ended.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic made the remarks at a ceremony held by his Turkish
counterpart Suleyman Demirel to welcome him in the presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic, who arrived here Sunday evening for a two-day
official visit to Turkey, said there were several problems in
implementing the Bosnian Peace Agreement (Dayton Agreement),
adding that several countries were trying to change the agreement
or to implement it only partly.
</P>
<P>
After the four-year civil war in Bosnia, Dayton Agreement was
signed in December 1995 by the leaders of the warring parties on
the division of territory, war criminals, releasing prisoners of
war and repatriating refugees.
</P>
<P>
"we want all the articles of the Dayton agreement to be
implemented fully and we want the refugees to return to their
homes and war criminals to be tried," said Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
He added that he came to Turkey to brief the leaders of the
country on the recent situation in Bosnia and exchange views with
them, because Turkey is an important power and a member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In response, Demirel said that Turkey supported
Bosnia-Herzegovina even in their difficult days and will continue
to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish head of state said: "Clashes ended, elections took
place in the country, and joint institutions have been
established. Thus, the Bosnian people are able to heal the wounds
of war. Yet, the peace installed in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be
long-lasting."
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey would do its best to contribute for the
implementation of the Dayton agreement, for the preservation of
peace and the creation of atmosphere for stability and
restructure of the Bosnia-Herzegovina's economy.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes Slander on China's Freedom of Religious Belief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official cited a series
of facts to refute some Westerners' slander on the freedom of
religious belief in China at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"China's policy of the freedom of religious belief has been
supported and welcomed by the broad masses of the religious people
in the country, and has been praised by many personnel in the
international community," said Ye Xiaowen, director of the Bureau
of the Religious Affairs under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, some Westerners have turned a blind eye to
the fact that there are hundreds of millions of religious people
and thousands of religious organizations in China which are
engaging in a large number of normal religious activities, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
With ulterior motives, they called the Chinese government's
crackdown on the activities of a small number of cults, which
threatened the social and public interests, "persecution of
religious people" and "intolerance of religion", he said.
</P>
<P>
In truth, since the 1980s, a group of cults have formed in some
places around China, he said, adding that though small in number,
they have greatly harmed Chinese society, and aroused hatred from
both the ordinary people and the religious people.
</P>
<P>
He cited Wu Yangming, who founded the "the Established King
Sect" in east China's Anhui Province as an example, saying that Wu
spread heresy, and claimed that his group will "unite the country
in the spirit of the "the Established King Sect".
</P>
<P>
Wu, in collusion with other key members of the organization,
have seduced and raped 19 young women, the youngest of whom is
only 14 years old, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The sentence of Wu and his partners by the Chinese judicial
departments drew applause and the deep gratitude of the local
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
In China, people who do not believe in any religion as well as
those who do, have the same rights and obligations under the law
and no one is granted special privileges, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The religious cults and their actions, which proved dangerous
to society and the public welfare, were punished to safeguard the
people and the sanctity of the law and to maintain social order,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is groundless and creates suspicion when some people attack
China's crackdown on criminals by saying that it "persecutes
religious people", he said.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM to Visit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino is to pay a two-day official visit to Turkey on June 11-12
in a bid to enhance Albanian-Turkish ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly news briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Omel Akbel said that bilateral relations and regional
issues would be discussed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Ankara, Fino is expected to meet Islamic
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and other Turkish
officials.
</P>
<P>
The return of Turkish businessmen who fled from
chaos-stricken Albania, the increase of Turkey's investments as
well as logistic assistance to Albanian army and police will
also be on the agenda, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Fino's visit to Ankara aims to ask for economic help from
Turkey, according to informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Turkey plans to extend the time limit of its
troops stationed in Albania, Akbel said that Turkey has not made
a decision in this regard, adding that other countries
participating in the mission were also considering this issue.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government has reportedly asked the Italy-led
multinational peacekeeping force to extend its time limit for
another three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Akbel said that Turkey had been making efforts
to help restore peace and stability in that country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has decided to provide a 50-million-dollar aid to
Albania in a bid to help the country overcome its current
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
At present, Turkey has 850 troops in Albania, as part of
the 6,000-strong multinational peacekeeping troops stationed there
to help local army and police to keep order.

<P>
TOKYO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar dropped to 111.80 yen
this afternoon, its lowest point this year on the Tokyo Foreign
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The drop stems from fear of renewed trade friction between
Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was trading at 112.25-31 yen at 5 p.m., down from
113.18-21 yen at 9 a.m. today, and from 114.25-35 yen late Friday

<HEADLINE> Iranian Senior Official Visits Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Alaeddin Bourujerdi arrived here today on a surprise visit to
Turkey, carrying a message from Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani concerning ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency said that Bourujerdi
will present Ransanjani's message to Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Tuesday, and he has no plan to meet with other Turkish
high-ranking officials during his visit here
</P>
<P>
Turkish military accused Iran of providing support for the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting an
almost 13-year-old separatist war for autonomy in eastern and
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Bourujerdi told reporters in Tehran Sunday that Iran voiced
its concern over the presence by Turkish military forces in
northern Iraq, saying it is "sensitive" to Iraqi territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran gave importance to security of the regional
states and understood the Turkish security problems. But he
pointed out that the move taken by Turkey is not the solution to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops have carried out
the cross-border military operations in northern Iraq since May
14 to wipe out the PKK rebels there.
</P>
<P>
Bourujerdi urged Turkey to immediately put an end to the
current operations in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Introducing Chinese History to the Public in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- When an exhibition on the Chinese
 postal history opens in the Town Hall of Shatin in July this
year, Hong Kong people will be able to see valuable exhibits from
the China Museum of Stamps.
</P>
<P>
This is part of efforts made by the Museums Section of the
Regional Services Department to educate Hong Kong people on the
Chinese history and culture.
</P>
<P>
"Now Hong Kong is about to return to the motherland, it's time
for Hong Kong people to get better acquainted with the Chinese
history and culture and to know more about Hong Kong's history and
 culture," Shui Yuen Yim, Chief Curator of the Museums Section,
said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Yim is now in charge of the preparatory work for the Hong Kong
Museum of Culture, which is being constructed and scheduled for
opening in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Due to historical reasons, Hong Kong students can find little
information about the history of Hong Kong and the mainland in
their textbooks and actually they know more foreign history than
that of Hong Kong and the mainland. Now it's time to make up the
missed lesson," Yim said.
</P>
<P>
"Every place has its own history. We are the provider of
cultural services, and it's our task to introduce our own history
and culture to the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong now has four small museums which are all
housed in age-old buildings. They have many limitations in both
capacities and styles, and it is necessary to build a large modern
 museum.
</P>
<P>
The new museum is designed to reflect the history and culture
of Hong Kong and the mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has over 6,000 years of history, which is evidenced
with the unearthed relics in recent years, and the problem is that
 we've not paid enough attention that it deserves," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said material civilization brings changes to Hong Kong day
by day, and people tend to demolish the old and set up the new. As
 a result, it's hard to preserve valuable historical items, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to collecting those items and handing them
down to future generations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 when preparations for the museum started, Yim and
his colleagues have collected more than 50,000 pieces of
historical and cultural relics, of which some 6,000 pieces came
from the New Territories.

<HEADLINE> EU, Switzerland Sign Customs Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Switzerland today signed a customs agreement to combat smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed on the periphery of the EU finance
ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, is due to come into force on
July 1. It is being added, in the form of a protocol, to a 1972
Free Trade Agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The main aim is to mount a coordinated campaign against
fraudulent cross-border operations during goods transit activities.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland was the only major European country with whom the
EU did not have such an agreement. The agreement fills a gap in
the network of legal provisions the EU has been putting in place
since 1989.

"A Museum is a public institute that has close relations with
the society. The sole purpose of our museum is to raise the
cultural level of Hong Kong people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Folk art constitutes a significant part in Yim's collections.
</P>
<P>
"Other museums usually spend most of their money on protecting
highly-valuable refined relics, but folk art, which is equally
valuable in reflecting history, does not enjoy sufficient
protection and attention, and many are disappearing with the
passing away of the older generation," Yim said.
</P>
<P>
Yim has been visiting the inland areas fairly frequently to
collect folk art items that he believes are valuable, such as
paper-cut, Lunar New Year paintings and kites.
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather buy hundreds of pieces of folk art than buying one
single expensive unearthed relic with the same sum of money. They
may be quite usual in the eyes of some people, but I dare say that
 in 10 years' time they will demonstrate their value," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yim said that he and his colleagues have had very close
cooperation with Mainland counterparts. In the past few years the
Museums Section held four major historical and cultural relics
exhibitions with exhibits on loan from Mainland museums.
</P>
<P>
"To put on show a piece of Chinese cultural relics in Hong Kong
 is quite special--more special than put it on show in any other
place, because we are using it to arouse Hong Kong people's
interest in knowing about China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the handover of Hong Kong provides them with
abundant opportunities to make good use of the rich resources of
historical and cultural relics in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The museum includes halls of different themes such as Chinese
Culture, History of the New Territories, Guangdong Opera, Modern
Hong Kong Art and Design and Folk Art.
</P>
<P>
Located in the center of Shatin New Town, the museum is
designed into a Chinese siheyuan-style building. It costs about
800 million HK dollars (102.56 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Yim studied history in the Chinese University of Hong Kong,
Oxford University and Ohio State University. He joined the Museums
 Section in 1987 after serving seven years in a government
department for preserving historical buildings and relics.

<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen people arrived in
Beijing's Tian'anmen Square today after a 2,850-km trip on foot
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The trip started in February at Shatin Park in Hong Kong's New
Territories.
</P>
<P>
Through the activity, the travellers plan to raise 20 million
HK dollars (2.56 million US dollars) from the Hong Kong residents
to aid school dropouts in poor parts of China. The activity is
sponsored by the Hong Kong Planters Movement, which was founded in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The participants have walked through the provinces of
Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Hebei where they visited poor
areas, publicizing "Project Hope" along the way, an activity begun
by the Chinese government to help poor children go to school.
</P>
<P>
A torch, which was lit at the starting ceremony in Shatin Park,
was handed to college students from Beijing on June 7, when the
travellers entered the city limits.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of June 12, they will head for the Great Wall at
Badaling, north of Beijing, with 250 people from Hong Kong, who
have been supporting them on the trip.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mandela Consults Egypitan, French Leaders About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today that he had consulted with top leaders
of Egypt and France about possible asylum for former Zairean
president Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are still going on to find a country that would
accept him (Mobutu)," Mandela told reporter in Cape Town, the
legislative capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela declined to give details about his Sunday
consultations with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak, French
President Jacques Chirac and Premier Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's top aide Parks Mankahlana told press last week that
political asylum for Mobutu was not the problem at this stage as
the primary consideration was to find an appropriate place for
Mobutu to receive medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, who is suffering from prostate cancer, is reportedly
living with a large entourage in a luxury hotel, 20 kms outside
the Moroccon capital, Rabat.
</P>
<P>
The deposed president arrived in Morocco on May 23 from Togo
where he had taken refuge from attacks by the armed forces of
Laurent Kabila, now the renamed Democratic Republic of Congo's
president.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan government said then that Mobutu had come for
just a "brief stay" before going into permanent exile elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's final destination at the time was believed to be
France, where he owns a lavish villa.

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A federal task set up last year to deal with church burnings
said yesterday that almost 200 suspects have been arrested, more
than 75 percent of them since the task force's creation, but
evidence thus far does not support fears of a national conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
-- From the outside, it looks to many as if the plot line of
President Clinton's second term has turned into "The Incredible
Shrinking Agenda," with minuscule initiatives posing little
challenge for a White House staff worn out by the bigger battles
of the past.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- House Republicans offered a 16 billion dollar plan to
provide health care for uninsured children today, but they said
they could not completely fulfil their promise to set aside 1.5
billion dollars to help low-income elderly people pay health
insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
-- A freight train carrying hazardous chemicals struck a coal
train in ST.Albans, West Virginia, killing an engineer and
producing an explosion that sent clouds of hazardous fumes into
the air. Two workers on the freight train were also injured.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Ralston isn't expected to remain a candidate for Joint
Chiefs Chairman. The Air Force general cut short a trip to Asia
and returned to Washington amid expectations that he would be
dropped from consideration for the top military post because of an
adulterous relationship in his past. It appears unlikely that he
even will be nominated by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft is in talks to invest about 1 billion dollars in
cable firm Comcast, people familiar with the talks said. The move
could prod other cable operators to expand high-speed Internet
access.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong province in south China
is holding a series of activities this week in memory of Lu Xun
(1881--1936), one of China's most famous writers, thinkers, and
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of calligraphy and painting marking the 70th
anniversary of his stay in Guangdong, where he was a professor at
Zhongshan University from January to September of 1927, opened
Sunday as the start of the series.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1927, a purge ordered by the head of the Kuomintang
Chiang Kai-shek (1887--1875) led to the deaths of many
communists. Outraged by Chiang's cruelty, Lu lent his support to
the Communist Party, although he never became a member of it.
</P>
<P>
The memorial series includes seminars and discussions. One
seminar is being held in Jiangmen city on "Lu Xun and the 21st
century" and "Lu Xun and study on Hong Kong and Macao."
</P>
<P>
Students will have an opportunity to hear reports on Lu Xun and
his literary ideas at Zhongshan University, South China Normal
University, and the Guangdong Museum.
</P>
<P>
The activities are being organized by the Guangdong Federation
of Literary and Art Circles, the Lu Xun Society of China, and the
Guangdong Society of Lu Xun.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Telecom has upgraded
its system and conducted emergency exercises in anticipation of a
flood of phone calls in the hours around the handover ceremony at
midnight June 30.
</P>
<P>
The company believes that phone calls will surge greatly as
people make social arrangements or exchange good wishes with
friends at the historical moment.
</P>
<P>
Today's South China Morning Post reported that this massive
traffic may mean that some customers will have to try 10 times
before getting a dial tone.
</P>
<P>
"We are anticipating traffic will be higher than anything in
history," said Peter Yu Kwok-chu, manager of Local Operations
Branch.
</P>
<P>
Overseas phone companies have been warned to expect a flood of
calls to and from Hong Kong and alternative international routings
 have been planned if certain cables and satellite links are
overloaded.
</P>
<P>
The local network has been upgraded, particularly in the Wan
Chai area where most of the handover activities and the estimated
8,000 journalists will be concentrated.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Attracts 33 Million Dollars of Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian stock exchange (NSE) in
1996 attracted nearly 33 million U.S. dollars of foreign
portfolio investment, the Nigerian Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pascal Dozie, former president of NSE, disclosed this at the
36th annual general meeting of the exchange, which was held in
Lagos last week.
</P>
<P>
Dozie noted that this is an improvement over the 1.14 million
dollars recorded in the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, said the amount is too insignificant for a
country blessed with rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Capital market operators pointed out that despite the approval
of an investment promotion decree and a foreign exchange decree
by the government in 1995, foreign investment in Nigeria is still
too small when compared with other African countries like South
Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have blamed the country's unclear political future
for the slow pace of foreign investment into Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Hails Israeli-Palestinian Cairo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
today that the Palestinians and Israelis held "promising" talks
here Sunday on the resumption of deadlocked peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the wheel of talks between the two sides will run as
any delay is detrimental to both parties," Mubarak told reporters
at the end of his visit to Qaroun oil fields, some 80 kilometers
south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Saturday for the first
time in nearly three months in a bid to renew full-scale peace
talks that were paralyzed when Israel began construction on a new
Jewish settlement in March.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak refused to say whether the meeting was held on certain
or specified bases, but said the atmosphere prevailing it was
"good."
</P>
<P>
"The two parties will consult with their leaderships and we will
see if they will meet within days or later but in general we
are supporting the peace drive to the end," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials have confirmed that the fate
of the housing project was discussed in the Egyptian-brokered
talks.
</P>
<P>
They said another Palestinian-Israeli meeting with the
participation of Egypt will be held in Israel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's political advisor who shuttled between
the sides trying to revive peacemaking, attended the talks as an
observer. He said the talks made "some progress."
</P>
<P>
The negotiators did not speak to reporters at the end of the
meeting but they later joined Egypt in hailing the good atmosphere
and progress at the Cairo meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has intensified its mediation efforts in the crisis since
a summit between Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu last month.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was pushing a five-point plan which would include a
freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on the
Jewish settlement building in the West Bank for "a sufficient
period." In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment
to addressing Israel's security demands.
</P>
<P>
So far Netanyahu has refused to stop Jewish settlements
construction for fear that such a move would tear his right-wing
coalition apart. But the Palestinians said only a freeze to the
settlement construction would help revive the talks.

HANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Hangzhou Dunpai Chain
Drive (Group) Company and Japan's Tsuba Kimoto Chain Co. opened a
company today in Hangzhou, the capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, with an investment of 29.5 million US dollars to produce
industrial chain.
</P>
<P>
The two companies each have a 50 percent interest. By 2004, the

</P>
<P>
By that time its annual income is expected to reach 448 million
yuan (about 54 million US dollars) with exports exceeding 25
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou Dunpai Chain Drive is presently the largest industrial
chain manufacturer in China and one of the ten largest in the

<HEADLINE> Japanese Papers Wary About Defense Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Leading Japanese newspapers said
today that operations cited in the newly released interim report
on Japan-United States defense cooperation may violate the
Constitution, which bans participation in collective defense
activities.
</P>
<P>
The papers called for efforts to gain the understanding of the
Japanese people and Japan's neighboring countries when reviewing
the 1978 Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the U.S. worked out the interim report through
high-level talks Saturday in Honolulu. They will finalize the
review this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Shimbun said operations such as rear logistic support
by Japan's Self-Defense Forces, minesweeping operations to help
the U.S. military, providing the U.S. military on combat
operations with intelligence and ammunition, and the inspection
of vessels of other nations on the high seas surrounding Japan,
which were all proposed in the report, may be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
"Such changes in policy should not proceed without national
consensus," the Asahi said.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional ban on collective self-defense rights, and
on the use of force to settle international disputes, contributes
to the trust of East Asian countries in Japan and the stability of
the region, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Mainichi Shimbun said the interim report steps into gray
areas edging close to participation in collective defense.
</P>
<P>
There were too many unclear elements concerning the definition
of areas for rear support of the U.S. military in combat
operations, the Mainichi said.
</P>
<P>
The leading business daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, said it is
important to secure transparency in debates on the review in order
to seek the understanding of Japan's neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Anti-landmines Art Exhibition Ends in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An anti-landmines art exhibition
as part of the global campaign to ban the production, export and
use of anti-personnel mines ended here today at Sheraton Hotel
gardens.
</P>
<P>
Muwonge Willson, an official of Uganda Red Cross Society said
the exhibition was welcomed by enthusiastic Ugandan visitors so
much that it had to be prolonged for another two days.
</P>
<P>
The ten-day exhibition of sculptures by Kenyan artist Kioko
Mwitiki, one of Kenya's leading sculptors, has attracted over
70,000 visitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 25 sculptures dubbed "living metal" also showed this
year's theme of the pan African movement -- peace and unity.
</P>
<P>
Mwitiki who has done sculptures in Montana, U.S.A and held
private fund-raising in the same place during the exhibition
presents a bigger-than-life music band comprising sculptural
pieces made of iron sheets or bars available from destroyed
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
They include players strumming guitars, drumming and singing
in straining vocal chords about the need to ban landmines,
Willson explained, adding that some empty chairs in front of the
band mean the audience are not listening because some people in
the world are still producing and using anti personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Mwitiki said, "the inspiration for the exhibition is out of a
desire to help stop the misery caused by the landmines."
</P>
<P>
According to materials available in the exhibition, over 100
million landmines are inflicting appaling sufferings on
individuals, families and their communities in more than 70
countries over the world, with over 30 million scattered across
at least 18 countries in Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
These mines kill and maim 2,000 people monthly across four
continents in the world. Among them, civilians are the most.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to March 1995, the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) hospitals and surgical teams treated over 30,000
victims of landmines world wide.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, landmines have extensively been used by the rebel
Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony in the north. This has
left thousands of innocent people in northern Uganda either dead
or maimed.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the terrible injuries to human beings, the
landmines prevent farmers from sowing crops, hinder relief
efforts, and generally place an impossible strain on economies
trying to recover from armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Due to all these, the ICRC, the United Nations and other
influential organizations in 1994 launched a campaign demanding a
total ban on landmines' manufacture stockpiling, transfer and use
and since then more than 50 governments have committed themselves
to the ban.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan exhibition supported by the ICRC is spearheading a
world wide campaign for the abolition of landmines.
</P>
<P>
It followed a highly successful one held in Kenya at the end
of March this year and is going for Angola where there are
estimated over 10 million landmines left during the civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) in
1996 recorded a transaction of 882 million shares worth of 7.063
billion Naira (about 83 million U.S. Dollars), the Nigerian
Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pascal Dozie, former president of NSE, disclosed this at the
36th annual general meeting of the exchange, which was held in
Lagos last week.
</P>
<P>
Dozie noted that this performance represented an increase of
122.2 percent over 1995 in volume term, and a growth of 284
percent in value term.
</P>
<P>
The renowned banker attributed the impressive growth to the
on-going operational upgrading efforts at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts include a review of the allocation system on the
trading floors, introduction of five percent movement limit,
reduction of the settlement period from a fortnight to a week.
</P>
<P>
The NSE all-share index also grew by 37 percent from 5092.15
in 1995 to 6992.10 in 1996, Dozie said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), emerging
market data base started producing investible index for the
Nigerian stock market in addition to the IFC global composite
index for the market.
</P>
<P>
According to Dozie, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and South Africa are the
only three countries in Africa with IFC investible index, which
generally guides investors in making investment decisions on any
market.
</P>
<P>
Activities in the new issues market is also on the upward
trend, he said, adding that 37 applications for new issues valued
at 21.5 billion Naira (about 253 million Dollars) were approved
for listing in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the continued growth of the market, the former NSE called
on the government to constitute the Nigerian Investment Promotion
Commission as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The decree for the establishment of the commission was
approved by the government in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Strives for More Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Swaziland government has
tabled a bill introducing new investment incentives in a bid to
attract more investment and boost the manufacturing sector in
particular, according to informed sources reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Investment Promotion Bill will lead to a reduction in the
corporate tax rate from 37.5 percent to 30 percent during the
current year. Another five percent decrease will be phased in
over the next five years, bringing the rate to 25 percent, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bill aims broadly to promote new investment, protect
existing investments and facilitate the settlement of investment
disputes. It also provides for the establishment of an investment
promotion center, which should provide all necessary information
to investors.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's labor and business are generally supportive of the
bill, but are unsure whether it will improve the country's
ability to compete in the region.
</P>
<P>
It was not enough to drop corporate tax rates when many
Southern African countries already had lower tax rates, Swaziland
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Executive Dirctor Harvey Bird
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must demonstrate that we are facilitating new investment
in the kingdom," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, bordering with South Africa and Mozambique, is a
landlocked country with its economy having been improved
remarkably in recent years.

CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries today.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The World Bank has offered Jordan 100 million
U.S. dollars in loans for its energy and social security sectors,
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Development
Prime Ministry Affairs Jawad Anani, 40 million dollars of the
fund will be allocated to help restructure Jordan's energy sector
and the remaining 60 million dollars will be earmarked for a
planned social security net program designed to deal with
unemployment and poverty issues of the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has so far lent about 1.4 billion dollars to
Jordan since the early 1960s, and all but 250 million dollars of
the amount had been disbursed by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The World Bank (WB) will provide Lebanon 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars during next four years as a sign of faith in the
country's reconstruction, the local newspaper Daily Star reported
today.
</P>
<P>
That means the WB will increase its annual financial package
to 400 million dollars from the present level of 100 million, the
World Bank Governor James Wolfenson told a press conference he
held jointly with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Other than the 400-million-dollar annual basket allotted to
Lebanon, Wolfenson said, Lebanon will also get 600 million
dollars over the next four years from the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), an offshoot of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Wolfenson maintained that Lebanon's financial package is
higher than that of other countries in the region, and stressed
that the world financial body has allocated a total of 604
million dollars in loans to Lebanon since March 1993.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Water Commissioner Meir Ben-Meir and his
Jordanian counterpart have agreed that Israel will soon begin

for the production and distribution of its drugs in Israel, has
been selling here since 1953 through Assia-Reisl, a Teva
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
The parent company decided to upgrade its dealings with
Israel, because of the very high level of medicine and government
support for direct involvement by international firms in Israel,
according to its chairman and chief executive officer Raymond
Gilmartine.

LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Nigerian government
insisted on Sunday night that the coup soldiers in Sierra Leone
would be dislodged from power "by other means" if negotiations
failed, the "Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't yield to logic, we will take other measures,"
the national daily quoted an authoritative source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made in the wake of a faltering diplomatic
initiative by rebel soldiers in Sierra Leone to win foreign
sympathy for the ouster of democratically elected government led
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders dispatched emissaries at the weekend to Cote
d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, among others, apparently to solicit
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
On whether the government has a time frame for its initiative,
the source explained: "We are talking to other people and trying
to get some other things done. So, you cannot set a deadline
yet."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the rebels are talking to some mediators,
among whom are believed to be Ivorians.
</P>
<P>
"There is hardly any face-to-face contact now between Nigeria
and the rebels. Very soon, there has to be a face-to-face
contact," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted the temporary respite may have
given room for burgeoning confidence in the Sierra Leonean coup
makers as the coup leader, Major Johnny Koroma on Sunday made his
first public outing in Freetown, capital of the tiny west African
country.
</P>
<P>
Government officials in Abuja, Nigeria, acknowledged that the
ECOMOG venture to remove the coup leaders may be somewhat tricky.
</P>
<P>
"It might be difficult, it may not be as easy as some people
think," said one source, quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as a sign of burgeoning confidence in the besieged
coup soldiers, the new military regime announced on Sunday that
it had reopened the country's borders, which were closed shortly
after the coup on May 25.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Heart ailments have increased
sharply in Kenya where estimatedly some 1.2 million people, five
percent of the Kenya population are at risk, according to the
latest statistics issued in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
High on the list in the eastern African country are wealthy
professionals who have adopted western lifestyles, the "East
African" weekly newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Kenyatta National Hospital, the country's
largest referral hospital, showed a 36-percent hike of
in-patients with cardiac diseases between 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Heart failure alone accounted for a 47-percent rise from 279
in 1992 to 527 last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
New bookings for treatment at the out-patient cardiology
clinic total 1,541 for June to September this year.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a marked increase in public appeals to
assist Kenyans in seeking specialist surgery abroad, notably the
United States, Britain, India and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
There are three principal types of heart problems in Kenya,
coronary artery disease which tends to afflict better-off people,
rheumatic heart disease found mainly among the poor, and
congenital conditions among children, such as a hole in the
heart.
</P>
<P>
Kenya now has some 20 cardiologists for adult patients, fewer
than 10 specializing in children and five heart surgeons, against
one in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Studies Antibiotic Therapy against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South Afrcian medical
researchers are studying antibiotic therapy against heart attacks
and strokes, local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
A clinical trial involving 25 patients with various vascular
diseases triggered by atherosclerosis, commonly known as
hardening of the arteries and a major cause of heart and brain
attacks, has begun at Johannesburg Ceneral Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The patients, whose ages range from 40 to 70, are being given
the antibiotic, azithromycin in a six-month experiment involving
the early use of antibiotics to help avert heart attacks and
strokes possibly cuased by a little-known germ, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers include a senior pathologist from the National
Occupational Health Center Dr. Allan Shor, who in 1990 discovered
the first evidence of infected cells in the tissue of diseased
arteries.
</P>
<P>
Shor's find of arterial infection was a major breakthrough
after five years of research in Europe and the United States in
the germ, Chlamydia Pneumoniae, and the presence of its
antibodies in the blood of patients with coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
The germ is spread by coughing and sneezing and initially
attacks in the respiratory system, sometimes leading to
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent experiments in Finland, Italy, Britain, Canada and
the U.S. confirmed that the germ might be the cause of diseases
other than respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
Once the results of the first batch of volunteers are known,
Shor plans to test 75 more subjects with serious peripheral
vascular disease and cerebrovascular and cardiac diseases, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Urban Residents Report Bigger Income Growth in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
residents of Chinese cities have seen speedier growth in their
annual income over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the State Statistics Bureau among
40,000 families from the country's cities, where 87.4 million
families live.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, urban families with an annual income
surpassing 10,000 yuan (about 1,204 U.S. dollars) totaled 66.42
million in 1996, accounting for 76 percent of the families
surveyed, a rise of 70 percentage points over 1991
record. Meanwhile, the number of urban families with annual income
standing at from 30,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan was also increasing.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were 1.92 million families with yearly earnings
above 100,000 yuan; 6.25 million families with annual income
between 30,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan; 58.29 million families with
income between 10,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan; 19.26 million families
with an income ranging from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan; and 1.68
million families lived on an annual income below 5,000 yuan,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Incomes in different areas varies widely, with those in coastal
cities much higher and those of inland cities significantly lower.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of the families with income exceeding
100,000 yuan were from south China's Guangdong Province, totalling
1.06 million households, as well as 180,000 families in Shanghai,
120,000 in Zhejiang Province and 100,000 in Jiangsu Province, with
Shanxi, Jilin, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Qinghai and Ningxia having a very
small proportion of families earning this level of income.
</P>
<P>
Families with an annual income of 10,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan
were equally distributed throughout the country, the survey
revealed.
</P>
<P>
China had 3.063 million poor families and 11.76 million
residents in its urban areas in 1996, representing a reduction of
266,000 families and 660,000 residents respectively from the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Call for Remembrance of Historical Humiliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 days before the return of
Hong Kong, Chinese scholars have urged their countrymen to
remember the great humiliation they suffered a hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, 1898, Britain forced the Chinese government to sign
"The Convention Respecting An Extension of The Hong Kong
Territory," under which the New Territories were leased to Britain
for 99 years.
</P>
<P>
A group of historians from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences today referred to it as "The Day of National Humiliation."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting marking the 99th anniversary of the event, Liu
Yongsu, an expert on the history of Hong Kong, said that the loss
of Hong Kong resulted from the invasion of British warships. It
also could be attributed to China's weak national strength and the
corrupt, ineffectual government of the Qing Dynasty, he said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the convention indicates that "if a country lags
behind the rest of the world, it cannot avoid being trampled
upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that in the years since Hong Kong was seized, the
British government has cruelly oppressed the territory and is
responsible for racial discrimination there.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yuebiao, another expert on the history of Hong Kong, said
that the Sino-British negotiation concerning the Hong Kong issue
in the 1980s has become an important topic of academic discussion
among historians.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the Hong Kong issue is clear," he said. "It
derived from the British policy of invading China and the unequal
treaties China was forced to sign with Britain last century."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shunhong, a research fellow, said that the Hong Kong
handover symbolizes a transition in international relations from
unequal to equal.

<HEADLINE> Putonghua Courses Popular in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Hong Kong
people are queuing up to sign on for Putonghua courses as the
handover approaches.
</P>
<P>
Employers are stepping up their Putonghua training programs to
ensure staff, including senior business executives, civil
servants, teachers and salespeople, are bilingual or trilingual.
</P>
<P>
Today's South China Morning Post reported that the territory's
biggest employer, the Hong Kong Government, has taken 19,800
people through their northern tones since 1992, seeing a sevenfold
increase in student numbers in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Civil Service Training and Development Institute chief training
officer Patrick Wong said some 300 Putonghua courses were
scheduled for 7,300 civil servants in the 1997-98 year.
</P>
<P>
The number of civil servants taking the language courses had
jumped from 1,000 in 1992-93 to 7,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce has also organized
more than 10 introductory Putonghua courses for its English
speaking members.
</P>
<P>
"The response was very good," a spokesman said. "Students
included directors, managers and other senior executives who are
keen to learn the language to deal with their counterparts in
China."
</P>
<P>
Learning Putonghua is also becoming mandatory at universities.
From this academic year, the Hong Kong Chinese University requires
all newly admitted students to take a Putonghua course. It is the
first institute to make the language compulsory.

<HEADLINE> Malta Plane Hijack Ends Peacefully in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The hijack of an Air Malta plane ended
peacefully at the Cologne-Bonn international airport in the
surrender of the two hijackers this morning, a few hours after the
incident began, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The two hijackers emerged out of the Boeing 737 jetliner with
hands up after giving up their weapons to the air crew, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said 79 passengers and six crew were on the flight
scheduled to Istanbul from Valletta, Malta. Five hostages were
freed about an hour after the plane landed at the Cologne-Bonn
airport, including a woman who was taken to hospital for her heart
condition.
</P>
<P>
The jet landed on 4:48 a.m. local time in Germany. The
hijackers asked for a television crew to board the plane to record
a message for broadcasting, which demanded the release of Ali
Agca, who is serving a life sentence in an Italian prison for
trying to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers seized the flight after it took off and forced it
to land at the Cologne-Bonn airport. The hijacked plane was taxied
to a cargo area of the Cologne-Bonn airport, with normal
operations at the airport continuing a few hundreds yards away
throughout the incident.
</P>
<P>
Police took a low-key approach in dealing with the incident and
used a Turkish speaking translator during the negotiations with
the hijackers, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes Distortions about Christianity (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are currently ten million Christians in China, more than
14 times the number in 1949. One important reason for this is that
the Three-Self Patriotic Movement has changed the situation of the
churches in China, and they are no longer "foreign churches" under
the control of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the official said, the movement has greatly improved
Chinese Christians' sense of responsibility for their own
churches, he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are some 12,000 churches and about 25,000 sites
of congregation in China. According to the statistics of the
1990s, more than 600 churches are built annually. The period
between 1992 and 1996 saw the publication and circulation of
nearly ten million Bibles. More than eight million copies of the
Psalms have been published by the Chinese Christian Association in
1983.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, he said, a united mass is observed in Chinese
Christianity. As they got rid of the shackles of foreign mission
board, Chinese Christians increased their understanding and
respect of each other in the course of the Three-Self Patriotic
Movement.
</P>
<P>
This is in line with the Bible's teaching that all churches
should "unite as one," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, Christians are on good terms with the broad masses of
people. Christians are part of the Chinese citizenry, and their
mottos "Love the country, love the church, glorify the God and
benefit the people" and "a Christian should be a good citizen"
have become common philosophical tenets of the majority of
Christians.
</P>
<P>
During 1992 and 1994, some 20,000 Christians were selected as
advanced individuals and become witnesses of the Gospel in
socialist China, he said.

<P>
The official said that the Three-Self Patriotic Movement has
won the approval and support of the majority of the Christians in
China, the respect of the people, and the sympathy and
appreciation of many overseas friends.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the Archbishop of Canterbury as saying in 1987 that
the Chinese were working hard for a better future, and the
Three-Self Patriotic Movement was aimed at ensuring that
Christianity will play a positive role in it. the archbishop
expressed his hope that no one shall jeopardize the movement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he stressed that each country's churches should
worship Christ in their own language, and absorb nutrition from
their own cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
The religious reform in Britain in the 16th century was a fight
for the independence and autonomy of the Church of England, and
resulted in the establishment of Anglicanism, he added, pointing
out that this was Britain's version of a Three-Self Movement.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the National Council of the Churches of the Christ in
the United States of America passed a statement about China,
saying that it is based on purpose of spreeding the Gospel
that the Chinese Christians wish to expurgate the label of
"foreign religions" from their belief and organizations.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that overseas Christians should respect the
efforts made by Chinese Christians among their own people, and
should not try to restore the type of missionary work that
prevailed in the past.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that some people in the West try to
revive colonialism and imperialism which made use of region to
cover their aggression of China, and still want to use religion as
a political tool against socialist China.
</P>
<P>
A few of them, recklessly attack the Chinese Church which
sticks to the Three-Self Principle, distort the facts, tell lies
and even create stories to deceive overseas Christians, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese Christian organizations and believers
are firmly against such actions.

<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The following is a speech on
religious affairs in China by a leading official of the State
Council's Religious Affairs Bureau:
</P>
<P>
I. The Status of Religion in China
</P>
<P>
China is a country with many religions: Buddhism, Taoism,
Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodox Church to
name the most prominent, and other regional religious belives
among ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
The policy of freedom of religion has been thoroughly
implemented since the beginning of reform and opening up in
1978. Chinese citizens' religious rights are well protected, and
religious activities are safeguarded by laws.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 85,000 religious sites, over 300,000
ministers, priests, or other religious authorities, and more than
3,000 religious organizations. Each religion has its own national
institutions, such as the Buddhist Association of China, China
Taoist Association, the Islamic Association of China, the Chinese
Patriotic Catholic Association, the Chinese Catholic Bishops
College, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the
Protestant Churches of China, and the China Christian Council.
</P>
<P>
There are 74 national and local religious institutes that
publish many kinds of religious journals and newspapers at home or
abroad. The number of believers in China is estimated at more than
100 million. In general, those believing in Buddhism and Taoism in
China outnumber those of other religions.

<P>
There are over 13,000 Buddhist monasteries and temples in China
with some 120,000 lamas and nuns, and over 1,700 living Buddhas,
and more than 3,000 monasteries and temples.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 1,500 Taoist temples, with 25,000 taoist
priests and priestesses.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Moslems come from 10 ethnic minority groups,
including the Hui and the Uygur, from a population of more than 18
million, most of whom are Moslems, who have more than 40,000 Imams
and more than 30,000 Islamic temples.
</P>
<P>
The number of Catholics in China is four million, and there are
a total of more than 4,000 clergymen and over 4,000 churches.
</P>
<P>
China also has nearly ten million Protestants, a figure that is
much greater than the 700,000 in 1949. There are more than 12,000
churches and 25,000 other places of worship built by missionaries.
</P>
<P>
Copyrights of all religious works are respected and protected
by the central and local governments. Religious organizations are

<P>
In China, all religious organizations have pledged their love
for the country and the religion, and they support the leadership
of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. The
Chinese government has given support to religious groups and has
encouraged them to unite their followers to get them to take part
in the country's ethical and cultural progress and material
civilization drive.
</P>
<P>
All believers are encouraged to do their best to serve the
society and to benefit the people. In Buddhism, for example, one
must make a practice of beautifying the country and benefiting
living beings, while in Prostestantism, one must glorify God and
benefit the living.
</P>
<P>
Religious believers from all of China's ethnic groups have made
a great contribution to the country's stability and social
development.
</P>
<P>
II. China's Policy and Laws on Freedom of Religion
</P>
<P>
China's Constitution provides for the freedom of religion as a
basic right of its citizens. The Chinese government respects and
protects citizens' religious choice, and applies the policy of
religious freedom, and provides a legal guarantee for religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of
China states that:
</P>
<P>
"Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of
religious belief.
</P>
<P>
No state organ, public organization or individual may compel
citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor
may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not
believe in, any religion.
</P>
<P>
The state protects normal religious activities. No one may make
use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order,
impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational
system of the state.
</P>
<P>
Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any
foreign domination."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Constitution, there are articles on
protecting religious freedom and prohibiting religious
discrimination against believers or non-believers in other laws
like the Criminal Law, the General Principles of the Civil Code,
the Law on Regional Autonomy for China's National Minorities, the
Military Service Law, the Law on Compulsory Education, the
Electoral Law for the National People's Congress and Local
People's Congresses, and the Organization Law of Village
Committees.

<P>
According to the Chinese constitution and the laws of China,
the main content of religious freedom in China runs as follows:
</P>
<P>
One, the state respects and protects freedom of religion and
religious choice as a personal matter of each individual
citizen. Religious believers and non-believers have equal rights
and duties. In enjoying freedom of religious rights, a citizen
must fulfill his or her obligation to abide by the constitution,
the law, and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Two, China has a principle of separation of religion from the
state and separation of religion from education. The state
protects normal religious activities and religions do not
interfere in state administration, jurisdiction, or
education. Normal religious activities carried out in places of
worship or done at home are arranged by religious organizations
and believers themselves and are protected by the laws of the
state. No one can interfere in these activities. The state
protects the rights of religious groups and protects the right of
religious authorities who perform their services. At the same
time, religious groups, like any other social organizations, must
practice their activities within the limits of the constitution
and the laws, and must fulfill their obligations in accordance
with the law. All individuals and organizations, including
religious organizations, must defend and honour the law, protect
the interests of other people, maintain the solidarity of ethnic
groups, and safeguard the unity of the motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
Three, all religions in China must follow a policy of
independence, independent action, and self-administration. All
religious organizations and religious followers can have
discussions, exchanges, and cooperation with foreign religious
organizations and religious believers on an equal and friendly
basis.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and religious groups will not interfere
in the religious affairs of foreign countries, and will not allow
outsiders to interfere in the affairs of Chinese religious groups.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always maintained that a correct
handling of religious questions is significant for stability of
the society, the solidarity of ethnic groups, and the development
of socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
When the normal order of the state was destroyed during the
chaotic period of the Cultural Revolution, religious groups and
religious believers were mistreated. Now China's policy of freedom
of religion has been restored and has improved and can be seen in
the stable continuity of the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party and government
leaders have met with religious leaders repeatedly, and an
important principle of the Chinese Communist Party in its
relations with the religious community and one that enjoys popular
support, has been: "Seek unity and cooperation politically while
building mutual respect religiously."

To better protect the freedom of religious belief, the Chinese
government has strengthened laws on religious affairs. In 1994,
the State Council approved the "Regulations on The Management of
Religious Activities of Foreigners within Territaries of the
People's Republic of China" and "Rules on The Management of Places
of Worship." They were aimed at bringing religion and other parts
of society into harmony, protecting citizens' right to religious
belief, protecting religious groups and places of worship,
protecting religious authorities in the performance of their
duties, protecting the freedom of religious belief of foreigners
staying in China, and safeguarding the public interest.
</P>
<P>
The "Regulations on The Management of Religious Activities of
Foreigners within the territaries of the People's Republic of
China" explicitly states that "the People's Republic of China
respects the freedom of religious belief of foreigners staying
in China, and protects them in their friendly contacts and
cultural and academic exchanges with Chinese religious groups."
</P>
<P>
Also, the "Rules on the Management of Places of Worship"
stipulates that "the management of a place of worship is
maintained by the concerned department of the place itself, and
its legitimate rights and normal religious activities carried out
there are protected by the law, and no organization or person are
entitled to infringing upon or interfering with them."
</P>
<P>
As a type of social organization, places of worship must follow
registration procedures in accordance with the law at the
concerned government departments. Only places of worship that have
registered in accordance with the law are considered legitimate,
and their rights shall be protected by the law.

In drafting laws and regulations on religion, the Chinese
government has taken the heed to reflect the policy of freedom of
religious belief and has repeatedly solicited opinions from
various aspects of the society, especially religious groups. The
laws and regulations have therefore won approval and support from
religious believers and are understood and respected by an
increasing number of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council and religious
departments at various government levels take charge of handling
religious affairs in China. They are entrusted with the
responsibility of impementing the laws, reguations and poilicies
regarding religious affairs, as well as supervising them.
</P>
<P>
The responsibilities of these departments includes implementing
the policy of freedom of religious belief in accordance with the
Constitution and law and coordinating the relationship between
religious groups and other parts of society. It is also their duty
to protect the religious belief of citizens, and the rights and
interests of religious groups, churches, and monasteries, and
handling religious affairs in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The government departments must exercise their administrative power
in accordance with the law, and shall not infringe upon religious
freedom of citizens and the legitimate rights and interests of
religious organizations and places of worship.
</P>
<P>
The government has dealt with in time misconduct that goes
against the policy of freedom of religious belief. Article 251
(formerly Article 147) of the Criminal Law of the People's Repulic
of China explicitly states that "serious cases in which any
government employee illegally deprives citizens of their rights to
religious belief and infringes upon ethnic customs and practices,
may result in custody or a sentence of two years in prison.

In China, religious leaders hold seats in the People's Congress
and the People's Political Consultative Conference at different
levels and take part in government and political affairs and
discussions.
</P>
<P>
More than 17,000 religious authorities have been elected
deputies to the People's Congress and the People's Political
Consultative Conference at different levels in various parts of
China. Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, a living Buddha and vice-president
of the Chinese Buddhist Association and honorary president of its
Tibetan branch, was elected vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Puchu, president of the Chinese Buddist Association, and
Ding Guangxun, honorary president of the China Christian Council,
have held the positions of vice-chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, and therefore become state
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Religious leaders who are deputies to the People's Congress or
members of the People's Political Consultative Conference at
different levels have taken part in discussions of state affairs
in the same manner as those non-religious counterparts do.
</P>
<P>
They also oversee the implementing of religious policies and
make suggestions, thereby enjoying equally democratic rights in
political life.
</P>
<P>
In today's world, ethnic disputes and religious conflicts have
occured repeatedly elsewhere, but a stable and harmonious
religious atmosphere has been maintained in China.
</P>
<P>
In the country, different ethnic groups, various religious
organizations and people of religion or non-religion, respect one
another and live in harmony, working together for the prosperity
of the motherland. China is now a country that enjoys political stability,
economic prosperity, ethnic unity, and social tranquility.
</P>
<P>
This fully demonstrates that the Chinese government has
implemented a policy of freedom of religious belief, and that it
has successfully managed religious affairs. And it will continue
its efforts in this respect.

SINGAPORE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The world's first nationwide
high-bandwidth communication network, called Singapore ONE, was
launched here today by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as
he opened the Asia Telecom 97, the largest telecommunication show
in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 400 households will participate in the
Singapore ONE pilot project and the number will increase to more
than 5,000 households before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, namely within 18 months, all 800,000
households in Singapore will be able to connect to Singapore ONE,
while businesses, schools and public areas will also be networked,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The pilot network and some of the services of Singapore ONE
include tele-shopping, digital library, educational services,
training and entertainment services, at speeds more than a hundred
times faster, and of higher quality, than what is currently
available over the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore ONE, a national information infrastructure that will
handle a wide ranging stream of multimedia traffic, such as voice,
data, image text and video, to the workplace, the homes and
schools, was initiated a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore ONE will transform Singapore into an Intelligent
Island, a place where information technology enhances our quality
of living, at work, at home and at play," the prime minister said.

III. Remarkable Achievements Made by China's Religious
Communities in the Field of Foreign Exchanges
</P>
<P>
Religious organizations in China have established friendly ties
with religious groups and personages in more than 70 countries and
regions all over the world. Since the beginning of the 1980s, the
organizations have enhanced international contacts and exchanges
and the major international exchanges have increased. This has
promoted mutual understanding and friendship and helped to
maintain world peace.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Thailand's Sangharaja, the religious leader of Thai
Buddhists, visited China and met President Jiang Zemin; in 1994,
the fingers of a Buddha found in China were sent to Thailand to be
enshrined and worshipped for 85 days; at the invitation of the
Christian Council of China, two archbishops of Canterbury paid
friendly visits to China successively; in 1995 and in 1996,
conferences were held in Beijing and the Republic of Korea (ROK)
respectively, for friendly exchanges among Buddhists in China, the
ROK and Japan; in 1994 and 1996, the Buddha's teeth were sent to
Myanmar to be enshrined at the invitation of the Myanmese
government.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than 40,000 Chinese Muslims have made
pilgrimages to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Chinese religious organizations and personages have also joined
some international religious organizations and participated in
international conferences on religion.

<P>
The Christian Council of China (CCC) formally joined the World
Council of Churches in 1992; its honorary chairman Ding Guangxun
is a vice chairman of the organization.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese Catholics were present at a world
conference for Catholic youth, and Chinese Taoists went to Japan
and Britain for world conferences on religion and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The freedom of religious belief of foreign nationals is
respected and protected in China: they can attend religious
activities in Chinese temples, mosques and churches open to them.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Chinese organizing committee of the
Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, religious groups in
Beijing provided religious services for representatives to the
conference, with temporary sites for religious activities set up
at the main venue in the Asian Games Village and the NGO Forum
venue in Huairou.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the religious groups and sites in
Beijing received more than 10,000 representatives from 103
countries and regions, including Gertrude Mongella,
secretary-general of the conference, former Tanzanian president
Julius Nyerere, the first lady of Djibuti, Italian and South
African government ministers, former US president George Bush, a
French bishop and officials in charge of women's affairs in world
religious organizations.

After attending religious services in a local church during a
visit to Xi'an in 1996, the German president and the first lady
expressed their deep satisfaction with the church. In March 1997,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Newt Gingrich, speaker
of the US House of Representatives, and his wife, went to the
Community Church in Shanghai for the Easter service, along with
their entourage of 70. They were impressed with the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to a radio program broadcasted in "the Voice of
America" on March 31, Gingrich was very pleased with the service,
and said that his visit to the church had strengthened his
confidence that the US should increase contacts and develop
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
When Prime Minister Howard left the church, he shook the
pastor's hand and said that the service was very good, and had
moved him deeply.
</P>
<P>
When Richard Rigby, Australian Consul General in Shanghai came to
the church to express appreciation on behalf of Prime Minister
Howard, he said it couldn't be said that there was no problem with
the issue of religious belief in China now, but it was not as bad
as some people made it out to be, most of whom did not understand
China's conditions.
</P>
<P>
China's gate is always open to foreigners who are friendly with
China, who abide by China's laws and respect Chinese religious
organizations, regardless of which country they come from or which
religions they believe in.

VI. To claim that China practices "persecution of religious
people" and "intolerance of religion" is slanderous and has
ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
China's policy of freedom of religious belief has been
supported and welcomed by the religious people in the country, and
has been praised by some people in the international community.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, some Westerners have turned a blind eye to
the fact that there are hundreds of millions of religious people
and thousands of religious organizations in China which are
engaging in a large number of normal religious activities.
</P>
<P>
They called with ulterior motives the Chinese government's
crackdown on the activities of a small number of cults, which
threatened the social and public interests, "persecution of
religious people" and "intolerance of religion".
</P>
<P>
In truth, since the 1980s, a group of cults have formed in some
places around China. Some have spread to China from abroad and
some have grown and developed on Chinese soil.
</P>
<P>
These quasi-religious organizations, though small in number,
have greatly harmed Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
The heads and core members of these organizations are people
who did not live by honest labor, preferring to enjoy an easy life
and hating to work.
</P>
<P>
They distorted the religious doctrines, spread heresy, incited
people to violate the nation's laws and intended to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
They cheated people with superstitious beliefs, purposely
created to enshroud simple ideas in mystery, and hurt and injured
people, some of whom were handicapped or even died.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they assembled groups to participate in
promiscuous activities, raped women, swindled people out of their
money, and seriously disturbed people's daily life.
</P>
<P>
Both ordinary people and the religious people detested these
practices.

<P>
Consider Wu Yangming, who founded the "the Established King
Sect" in east China's Anhui Province. Wu spread heresy, and
claimed that his group will "unite the country in the spirit of
the "the Established King Sect".
</P>
<P>
He said that they will build "a magic country with a new heaven
and earth," and demanded the women believers "not only worship his
soul but also his body." Wu, in collusion with other key members
of the organization, have seduced and raped 19 young women, the
youngest of whom is only 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
The sentence of Wu and his partners by the Chinese judicial
departments drew applause and the deep gratitude of the local
people.
</P>
<P>
Another example is Xu Yongze in central China's Henan Province,
who has been made well-known by some of the American media in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Xu was the head of the cult "the Wholistic Sect", which was
founded in the province in 1984. He flagrantly spread among the
ordinary people the idea that the "end of the world will come
soon," and that "people can only be reborn and save themselves by
crying out."
</P>
<P>
Under his influence, many people quit their jobs and gathered
together to cry and shout, which resulted in many cases of mental
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Xu has intensified his illegal activities and
adversely affected the normal production and daily life of people
in a number of areas.
</P>
<P>
The local department of public security detained him in
accordance with the law, after it obtained a large amount of
evidence concerning his activities.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the United States began to pass around the rumor
that "Xu was already sentenced to death", and even asked for
"trade sanctions" against China when the case was still in the
trial basis.
</P>
<P>
The "evidence" they referred to are simply China's crackdown on
the cults, and its punishment for disturbances of the social
order, rape, hooliganism, swindling and other crimes committed in
name of religion.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Assassination on Kuwaiti MP Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti English Daily Arab
Times said today that the assassination attempt on a Kuwaiti
member of parliament (MP) was aimed at stopping impeachment of
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Al-Jarallah, editor-in-chief of the paper, said in a
front page story that informed sources revealed the failed
attempt on Abdullah Al-Neibari, a liberal MP, was "purely local in
nature and believed to be a form of settling of old and new scores
among different groups."
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old outspoken MP and his wife were shot and wounded
by gunmen as they drove back from their seaside villa
in the southern part of Kuwait Friday.
</P>
<P>
Neibari is renowned for his fiery speeches on the floor of
the chamber against corruption and embezzlement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Three Kuwaitis and two Iranians were arrested on charge of the
attack 24 hours later and referred to public prosecution for
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jarallah stressed that the sources who have been closely
following the events and investigations revealed that names of
high ranking officials were mentioned during the interrogations.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations showed that a number of parliamentary
members were preparing to grill a number of cabinet ministers and
the gunmen carried out the assassination attempt to stop such a
move, Al-Jarallah said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the assassination attempt on Neibari "will
most likely lead to fundamental changes in the government and may
result in the dissolution of the National Assembly."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Saturday called on security authorities
to foil schemes by perpetrators who wanted to incite discords in
the country by attempting to kill a parliamentary member.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the whole country to stay calm and refrain
from inciting further tension.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti cabinet Sunday met to discuss the criminal incident
and praised the Interior Ministry for the speedy apprehension of
the suspects.

In China, people who do not believe in any religion as well as
those who do have the same rights and obligations under the law
and no one is granted special privileges.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who commits a crime will be held criminally responsible,
whether or not the person believes in a particular religion.
</P>
<P>
No one will be detained or put into prison for following a
religion or engaging in normal religious activities. But a handful
of people who have refused to obey the law and were involved in
illegal activities in the name of religion should be punished in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
No country in the world allows illegal behavior and crime in
the name of religion.
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, The United States took extreme measures,
including using helicopters, tanks and armored cars, against the
Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Japan also took severe measures to settle the case of the
poisonous gas attack in a Tokyo subway on March 20, 1995,
committed by the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult.
</P>
<P>
The religious cults and their actions, which proved dangerous
to society and the public welfare, were punished to safeguard the
people and the sanctity of the law and to maintain social order.
</P>
<P>
Such punishment was also done on behalf of the citizens'
freedom of religious belief and to ensure that normal religious
activities continue.
</P>
<P>
It is groundless and creates suspicion when some people attack
China's crackdown on criminals by saying that it instead
"persecutes religious people."

PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Three weeks after the fall of Kinshasa, Brazzaville, which is
a stone's throw across the Congo River, has flared up.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and the militiamen supporting former President
Denis Sassou Nguesso have been fighting since Thursday in the

said that the militiamen of Sassou Nguesso seemed to be gaining the
upper hand while the government troops are losing ground.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Refutes Distortions about Christianity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An official with China's Christian
Three-Self Patriotic Movement has refuted the argument made by
some people in the West in their wrongful attack against China's
system and practice of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
He said these Westerners regard China's Christian Three-Self
Patriotic Movement as an organization established by the
government to control the development of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
"This (argument) totally twists the facts, and is a kind of
malicious distortion," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The movement, which advocates self-administration, self-support
and self-propagation among the Protestant churches in China, is a
patriotic movement formed spontaneously by Chinese Christians who
sought to defend themselves against the invasion and bullying of
colonialists and imperialists in the early days, according to the
offical.
</P>
<P>
The official cited a series of facts to show a number of foreign
missionaries had made use of religion to serve the interest of
colonialism and imperialism.
</P>
<P>
In the 19th century, British missionary Robert Morrison and
German missionary Karl Friedrich Gutzlaff had, at separate times,
worked in the East-India Company and participated in selling opium
to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
John Robert Morrison, the son of Robert Morrison, and Karl
Friedrich Gutzlaff took part in the Opium War, the invasion of
China which was launched by Britain in 1840, and took part in the
drafting and signing of the unequal "Nanking Treaty," which forced
China to cede Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
American missionaries Peter Parker and Elijah Brielgman were
involved in the drafting and signing of the unequal "Wangxia
Treaty" between China and the United States in 1844.

<TEXT>
<P>
During the Second Opium War, missionaries Samuel Wells Williams
and William Alexander Parson Martin were responsible for the
"Sino-American Tianjin Treaty," and they covertly inserted into
the treaty a so-called "leniency" clause which said that Chinese
believers in Christ, like foreign believers, were not constrained
by China's laws.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, when the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded China,
American missionary Fredrich Brown collected information and acted
as a guide for the forces, leading the allies to overtake
Beijing. For his efforts, he received a commendation from the
commander of the allied forces.
</P>
<P>
The offical said in the 100 years after the Opium War,
colonialists and imperialists used religion as a cover for their
thirst for power.
</P>
<P>
In that period, before the founding of New China in 1949, China
was the recipient of the most money and missionaries from the
Western Mission Board. But the number of Christians in the country
was only about 700,000, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
This is because the Chinese people detested the suppression of
colonialists and imperialists, disapproved of unequal treaties, and
viewed Christianity under the protection of the treaties as a
"foreign religion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some patriotic and upright Christians long ago aspired to
separate China's Christianity from the control of the Western
Mission Board, launching the independent Christian movement around
the beginning of the 20th century and advocating the establishment
of a church by Chinese Christians.

Chinese Christians were greatly encouraged by the founding of
the New China in 1949, which demonstrated that the Chinese people
could stand on their own, he official said.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federation of Young Men's Christian Association,
backed by 1,577 religious leaders, openly publicized the
"Three-Self Declaration" together with 40 church leaders,
signifying that Chinese Christians were in support of the new
China.
</P>
<P>
The declaration advocated self-administration, self-support and
self-propagation, meaning that the Christian organizations were to
be run by Chinese Christians themselves, their funds to be raised
by Chinese Christians independently, and the preaching duties in
China to be undertaken by Chinese Christians on their own.
</P>
<P>
In just less than four years, more than 400,000 Christians,
or two thirds of the nation's total, signed the document.
</P>
<P>
The Three-Self Patriotic Movement is absolutely a voluntary
movement of Chinese Christians, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official in charge of the movement, Christianity
has become a Chinese-run religion because of the 40-year Three-Self
Patriotic Movement.
</P>
<P>
The movement is very conducive to the growth of Chinese
Christianity, and first and foremost, it has removed any obstacles
on the way to the development of Christianity in China, he said.

oil extraction process, is an effective pesticide, a forestry
official in Lira District, northern Uganda has confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Awaits Turkey's Financial Aid: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian diplomat has
called on Turkey to fulfill its promise to grant financial aid
to help rebuild the war-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Ambassador to Ankara, Hajrudin Somun, made the remarks
in an exclusive interview with local newspaper Daily News, which
was published today.
</P>
<P>
Somun said that Turkey, in accordance with the protocol
signed at the International Donors Conference in 1996, should
give Bosnia-Herzegovina 80 million U.S. dollars of credits and
grants, but only 2.2 million dollars has been supplied to date.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's failure to fulfill its financial promise has
been creating certain "misunderstandings," the ambassador said,
adding that this issue would be discussed during the visit of
Bosnian head of state to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia-Herzegovina, arrived
here Sunday night and will begin his official visit to Turkey
today.
</P>
<P>
Somun said: "I hope it (the aid to Bosnia) is part of the
budget in Turkey this year." He admitted, however, that he was
not optimistic about this.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bosnian ambassador stressed that money was
especially important for his country, which has no economic
growth as a result of the destruction a protracted civil war.
</P>
<P>
Despite the complaints about the delays, Somun also
maintained that his country thanked Turkey for its support in
various fields, saying that the Bosnian-Turkish relations were
good.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here noted that the remarks made by the
Bosnian ambassador aimed to remind Ankara of its obligations
provided by the International Donors Conference, whose annual
meeting falls on June 24.

<HEADLINE> Election Hopefuls Urged to Resign in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has
directed civil servants who intend to stand in the coming general
elections to resign and start seeking votes.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper "Daily Nation" today said that Moi's
direction is a further indication that the polls "cannot be far
off".
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the president as saying yesterday in Kiambu
District that the constitution is too important to be changed in
a brief period as the time left before the polls.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of opposition parties, churches and NGOs have
persisted in "minimum constitutional reforms" before the general
elections and threatened to storm Kenyan parliament on June 19 to
derail the national budget speech and force the government to
effect constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that he has a constitutional duty to maintain
security and dares the opposition to cause any form of
lawlessness in the country as they threatened.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Ford-Kenya Chairman Kijana Wamalwa said on Sunday
that opposition leaders had failed to agree on a single
presidential candidate in the coming poll.
</P>
<P>
He asked President Moi to delay the elections to enable
constitutional review to take place and challenged the government
to organize a national convention to get the views of the people
on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Firearms, Knives Create Crisis in S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Violence and murder have
often occurred in schools in Soweto, a black township near
Johannesburg of South Africa when pupils come to class with
knives and guns, local daily "The Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
There are many stabbing or shooting incidents in or near
school premises involving pupils, the report quoted Wandile
Zwane, a spokesman for the Center for the Study of Violence and
Rehabilitation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zwane attributed the increasing violence in schools to easy
access to firearms in townships. "There is also no culture of
learning, so pupils get involved in other activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no accurate statistics on the number of violent
crimes taking place in schools. But Soweto's police said bloody
incidents are reported almost every month, noting most cases go
unreported.
</P>
<P>
Zwane said Soweto teachers feel powerless to control weapons
in schools for fear of taking risk of their lives.
</P>
<P>
Aubrey Matshiqi, spokesman for Gauteng Provincial Education
Department, which is responsible for Soweto schools, said his
department was consulting teachers' unions and many suggestions
had been made, including the introduction of screening bars or
security guards at schools.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Prime Minister to Form New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- There would be no
constitutional crisis in Lesotho after formation of a new
political party by Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle on Saturday,
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) leader Monyane Moleleki has
said.
</P>
<P>
Moleleki explained yesterday that "we have a different system
of parliament here in Lesotho."
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians are not elected by the party but by
constituencies, he said, adding therefore life will be as normal
when parliament starts tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today from Maseru, capital
of Lesotho, the LCD is to be launched today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the prime minister on the formation of the
new party has sent shock waves in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Political observers expressed concern over what impact the
move would have on the country's constitutional process.
</P>
<P>
Moleleki said all members of the new party had resigned with
immediate effect from the Basutoland Congress Party. Their
position would not be affected as a result of their change of
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rule, he said, national assembly members
are not delegates of parties, but they are individual
constituencies, which do not have any political coloring.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mokhehle in April announced his retirement from
politics next year, citing ill-health and old-age as the reasons
for quitting.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Government Forces Advance Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
engaged in the "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory) military operation
are advancing slowly due to stiff resistance from rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
How fierce the resistance is can be gauged by the fact that
over the weekend the troops were able to advance merely one
kilometer in their effort to recapture 75 kilometers of road on
the main north-south highway which runs through rebel-held
territory in North Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
To gain control of that one kilometer, the government forces
had six troops killed and 21 others injured while the rebels lost
more than 70 cadres.
</P>
<P>
Since the operation was launched on May 13, the forces have
managed to recapture only 16 kilometers of the highway including
the one kilometer over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Recently 130 mm artillery guns were rushed to the battlefield
by the government forces and strength was withdrawn from most
police stations to be reassigned to the war, according to military
sources.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements were also hurriedly raised from bigger military
installations and sent into the war, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The operation had been temporarily suspended for nine days to
consolidate new positions before they were started again last
Friday by the troops who launched a two-pronged attack on the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Army's 55th Division began its advance along the A9,
Vavuniya-Jaffna Highway from the earlier captured Omantai while
the 53rd Division was pressing ahead from Nedunkerni, also
recaptured in the first stage of the operation, in the direction
of Puliyankulam Town.
</P>
<P>
The two columns are poised to link up at Puliyankulam -- a move
that would effectively separate the rebel-dominated Mulaitivu
jungles from the Weli Oya sector controlled by the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
The thrust launched last Friday is aimed at preempting the
rebels' attempt to regroup or consolidate their positions.
</P>
<P>
However, military sources said they expect strong resistance
from the rebels but are confident that the linkup of the 55th and
53rd divisions at Puliyankulam Town could be achieved in the
coming week.
</P>
<P>
A fuller appraisal of the remaining stages of the operation
would be made only after the linkup at the town.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the troops of the 55th Division were five
kilometers and those of the 53rd Division eight kilometers away
from Puliyankulam Town.
</P>
<P>
However, the military believe that the main objective of the
recapture of the whole Vavuniya-Jaffna Highway could be achieved
and the highway could be reopened to traffic in a few months.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, for their part, are planning to devise a
number of incidents in the Jaffna Peninsula and in Trincomalee
with a view to deflecting the operation against them. According to
intelligence reports, large numbers of LTTE rebels have been
arriving in these areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels suffered a setback last week when a fleet
of rebel craft carrying about 200 cadres was blown up in a huge
explosion, the cause of which is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
During the first stage of the operation from May 13 to 24,
about 200 rebels were killed and 316 injured, according to
official figures. The LTTE, which has been fighting for a separate
Tamil state in the northeast of the country, has also suffered
heavy casualties in the second stage of the operation launched by
the troops on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Casualties of the government forces in the operation have been
unusually high but the military have yet to reveal the total
number of the killed and injured.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Raises Payments for Internet Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Higher payments recently
introduced by the Kenyan government for all Internet services
providers may reduce the number of users and force smaller
operators out of the market, the "East African" reported today.
</P>
<P>
All Internet services providers in the country will pay a
five-year leasing fee of 8,200 U.S. Dollars from now to the Kenya
Posts and Telecommunication Corporation (KP&AMP;TC) for connection to
the high-speed 64-kilobyte international line, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all providers will be charged an annual interim
payment of 4,716 Dollars or one percent of their gross turnover.
</P>
<P>
Firms will also be expected to provide a list of all users and
their addresses to the Communications Commission of Kenya, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted industry sources as saying that while most
Internet companies have already complied with the new licensing
conditions, concern is mounting over the smaller companies'
ability to meet the new payment requirement.
</P>
<P>
Multinational services providers have claimed that the
requirement that they hold only up to 70 percent in local
subsidiaries would discourage foreign investment in the sector in
the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
During an Internet workshop held here last week, participants
complained about the high charges and called for an urgent
meeting between KP&AMP;TC and all Internet service providers to
review them.
</P>
<P>
Fred Bukachi, a senior official at the East African Internet
Association, warned that unless the licensing charges were
revised, Kenya's on-line business would be dominated by foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
Small non-profitable bodies such as public institutions,
community-based groups and civil organizations interested in
setting up non-commercial Internet services, particularly in the
rural areas, would be discouraged by the charges, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lucas Kenani, a KP&AMP;TC assistant manager, said the
Internet providers can pass the costs to consumers by adjusting
their prices which are already 10 to 20 percent higher than in
Europe or the United States.
</P>
<P>
The flat monthly fee covering unlimited usage of Internet
services differs from company to company, with the upper limit
being 188 Dollars a month while unlimited E-mail usage costs 47
Dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The average cost of Internet connection and installation is
about 19 Dollars in Kenya where the Internet computing industry
is estimated to have an annual growth rate of between 50-60
percent with about 5,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
The sector is dominated by Africa Online and Form-Net Africa.
Basic services they provide include E-mail, World Wide Web
access, E-mail-to-fax or faxaway and paging and designer products
targeting specific clients.

<HEADLINE> Suzhou Takes Big Steps to Protect Old City (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven Suzhou municipal
government departments, which formerly occupied four ancient
courtyards in the world-famous garden city, have been relocated
from the old city area and today opened for business in their new
offices.
</P>
<P>
The relocation is one of the major steps by the municipal
government to reduce the strain of modern-day life on Suzhou,
which has a history of more than 2,500 years.
</P>
<P>
The courtyards that had been used by the government will open
to the public or be used as tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
As part of the city's overall development plan, the move is
designed to cut down noise pollution and better safeguard the
peaceful environment of the gardens, said Zhang Xinsheng, mayor of
Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
So far, the municipal government has moved out 130 factories
and more than 35,000 residents from their former homes. The city
plans to shift another 60,000 people over the next ten years. By
then, one third of the old city-area residents will have been
relocated.
</P>
<P>
"The old city will only appear as the cultural, tourism and
commercial center," Zhang said, adding that by the year of 2000,
Suzhou is to close one third of the present 96 factories in the
old city area, move out another one third and preserve only the
remaining one third that are non-polluters and produce goods
typifying local character, such as embroidery, traditional musical
instruments or stage costumes.
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, Suzhou, which last year had a gross
domestic product of over 100 billion yuan (some 12 billion US
dollars), built all of its new factories in the new city areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weiren, a garden designer, said "the essence of the
Suzhou gardens is their quietness and the reduction of the
population in the old city area is a fairly good plan."
</P>
<P>
The old city was built in 514 B.C. covering 14.2 square
kilometers. It suffered serious damage from wars and uprisings
throughout its history. Rebuilt time and again in the original
site, it has always been the local political and economic center.

<P>
Surrounded by the city moat, the old city area is crisscrossed
with lanes and waterways and has more than 160 scenic bridges. The
garden designers built more than 100 unique private homes with
courtyards -- now the Suzhou gardens.
</P>
<P>
Yan Daoming, a city planning expert, said "it is necessary to
move the political and industrial centers out of the old city area
to preserve its original beauty."
</P>
<P>
The decision was also supported by I.M Pei, world-renowned
architect and advisor for Suzhou's city construction. "The world
only has one such old city, so it is worthwhile to pay any price
for its protection," Pei said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yunzhu, a female worker, formerly lived in the old city
area, where it only took her five minutes to walk to her
factory. Four years ago, her chemical plant was moved from the
city center to the new city area, and it takes her 30 minutes
by bike to her plant.
</P>
<P>
Like many other residents of the old city area, she felt
traveling to work was inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
Now, she has moved to her new house in the new city area. She
said, "I chose to move, as I should make an effort to protect the
old city, though I was reluctant to leave the old city area I am
familiar with."
</P>
<P>
Suzhou has spent 30 billion yuan (3.75 billion dollars) in the
past 10 years to build 53 residential villages in western and
eastern parts of the old city, together with department stores,
schools, hospitals, banks and recreational centers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city has renovated more than 800 ancient
lanes and 163 bridges. Historic preservation plaques have been
placed on more than 200 ancient buildings and some 500 ancient
trees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a dredging project has started along the 35-kilometer
ancient river.

<HEADLINE> Botswana's Economic Growth Tops 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Botswana recorded economic
growth last year of 7 percent compared to 3.1 percent in the
previous year, the country's Central Bank has announced.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by the bank on Saturday in its
annual report, reports reaching here from Gaborone said.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed what it termed "the robust real Gross
Domestic Products growth", the highest in the southern African
country, to booming diamond sales.
</P>
<P>
Diamond mining recorded a growth of 9.9 percent for the
financial year to March 31 mainly due to increased capacity at
Jwaneng Mine and to higher prices of gems.
</P>
<P>
The trade sector, the report said, recorded a 7.3 percent
growth rate, while manufacturing grew by 6.5 percent, up from 4.3
percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Increase Loans to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) will provide
Lebanon 1.6 billion U.S. dollars during next four years as a sign
of faith in the country's reconstruction, the local newspaper
Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
That means the WB will increase its annual financial package to
400 million dollars from the present level of 100 million, the
World Bank Governor James Wolfenson told a press conference he
held jointly with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Wolfenson, who arrived here from Damascus, Syria, on Sunday
afternoon on his first visit to Lebanon, praised the Lebanese
government for its efforts in rebuilding the war-torn economy and
outlined the financial assistance the bank has planned for
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"My purpose for coming to Lebanon was to look at some of the
work we are doing here. We are a friend and supporter of Lebanon
because we trust the government," he told reporters at the end
of his meeting with Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Other than the 400-million-dollar annual basket allotted to
Lebanon, Wolfenson said, Lebanon will also get 600 million
dollars over the next four years from the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), an offshoot of the bank.
</P>
<P>
"This year alone we have loaned Lebanon so far a total of 170
million dollars and 100 million dollars in guarantees," he said,
noting that additional 150 million dollars were available from
the IFC.
</P>
<P>
He added that there were "no holdbacks or restrictions over
their (funds') use and we are working with the (Lebanese)
government closely."
</P>
<P>
Premier Hariri pointed out that, altogether, Lebanon could
expect 2.2 billion dollars of funds over the next four years from
the WB.
</P>
<P>
Wolfenson maintained that Lebanon's financial package is
higher than that of other countries in the region, and stressed
that the world financial body has allocated a total of 604 million
dollars in loans to Lebanon since March 1993.
</P>
<P>
The additional funds available to Lebanon will reportedly come
amid signs of renewed faith on behalf of the World Bank in the
government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
In a report published last November, the World Bank praised
the recovery achieved in Lebanon so far and gave an optimistic
prognosis for Lebanon's continued economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The report was issued after Hariri toured some European states
last June to raise 5 billion dollars his government needed to
carry on its ambitious reconstruction plan in the next five
years.

<HEADLINE> Israel Unveils New Unmanned Aerial Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Elbit System Ltd., one of
Israel's major military firms, is unveiling an advanced
short-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which it says has
garnered interest in Israel and other nations.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Jerusalem Post, the UAV, meant to provide
tactical intelligence for ground forces and direct artillery fire,
is called the Hermes-450S, developed and manufactured by Elbit's
subsidiary Silver Arrow, based in Herzliya near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The Hermes, a single-engine drone, can stay in the air for 20
hours at an altitude of some 6,100 meters, and except for the
engine, it contains backups of all of its vital systems.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Yeshayahu Shapira, Silver Arrow's managing
director, as saying that there were already several orders for
the Hermes, but he would not identify them.
</P>
<P>
Elbit executives said the Israeli army is likely to order it
as part of its program to update its UAV capability.
</P>
<P>
Elbit has recently won a contract from the Israeli army to
develop advanced avionics for the F-15 upgrade, a contract valued
at 12.5 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contract will be executed via Elbit's subsidiary EFW,
based in Fort Worth, Texas in the United States.
</P>
<P>
This month, Elbit will supply the first prototypes of the
system to the Israeli Air Force and will install the avionics on
the F-15s in November.
</P>
<P>
Elbit executives also said that they will highlight their
company's ability to upgrade combat jets and helicopters during
next week's Paris Air Show in France.
</P>
<P>
In the air show, Elbit will display the MIG-21 it upgraded for
the Romanian air force, which was executed in accordance with an
agreement between Elbit and Romania to market MIG upgrades to
third countries.
</P>
<P>
Elbit President Joseph Ackerman told the Jerusalem Post that
two-thirds of his company's business stems from upgrades.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Price Goes Up in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Petrol price in Uganda went up
from 1,150 Shillings (about 1.0748 Dollars) to 1,170 Shillings
(about 1.0935 Dollars) per liter last week, reported local daily
"The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that petrol price started to rise in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the petrol price per liter fell by as
much as 20 Shillings from December last year. In April, the price
of petrol fell to 1,150 Shillings from 1,160 Shillings per liter.
</P>
<P>
However, kerosene price went down last week to 830 Shillings
from 840 Shillings per liter while diesel remained at 1,030
Shillings a liter.
</P>
<P>
On the reason of Kerosene price reduction, the paper said that
it is a product of an appreciating Uganda Shilling against U.S.
Dollar, falling world fuel prices and a reduction in fuel duties
in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper didn't give the reason for petrol price
rise.

<P>
SALT LAKE CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Utah Jazz, which made

<HEADLINE> Asia Oil &AMP; Gas Conference 1997 Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Asia Oil and Gas Conference
1997 opened here today to deliberate on pressing issues in the
energy industry.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference with the theme "Asia: Preparing for the
Next Millennium" will discuss questions such as global energy
perspectives and outlook, regional economics and politics,
prospects in the Asian upstream sector, cooperation and investment
opportunities in Asia, prospects for futures and derivative
markets and new business strategies.
</P>
<P>
Officiating the conference, Malaysian Acting Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim said that driven by rapid economic growth, the
Asia-Pacific region has undergone a vast change over the last
decade and witnessed a significant increase in demand for energy.
</P>
<P>
The region's rapid economic growth creates its own challenges
with one of these coming from the energy sector, he said, warning
that before long, oil production will no longer be adequate to
meet demand.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region's current demand for energy is well
over a quarter of the global total and is forecast to rise to
one-third by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
At current rates of production, the region's reserves are
expected to be depleted within 15 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, Asian oil markets will become more dependent on
the Middle East for supplies and under this scenario, natural gas
will play a more prominent role in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He held that the future of gas is assured with ample reserves
to meet global demand for a long time to come. However, he said
that to ensure future availability of gas, new export projects
will have to be implemented in regions that are far away from
consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
More than 550 participants from 31 countries and regions
including China are attending the conference organized by the
Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute of Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Makes Protest Against Indian Chopper Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has lodged
a protest with India against the intrusion and violation of the
Bangladesh air space by an Indian Air Force helicopter recently,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who has
been accusing the government of selling out sovereignty to India,
expressed concern over the landing of the Indian helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"It is unholy and dangerous exercise that a foreign fighter
could safely intrude into our airspace, safely landed, stayed and
took off without obstruction," said the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on
Sunday said an Indian Air Force helicopter landed at Chunarghat on
May 20, at 1815 hours (local time). The helicopter carried six
persons in uniform and one in civilian clothes.
</P>
<P>
"After they were told by the local people that the place they
had landed was inside Bangladesh, the helicopter took off at 1820
hours (local time) and flew eastward towards India," the release
said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government was asked to investigate immediately the
reason for such violation, provide detailed information on the
helicopter and its crew and other passengers, and also ensure
prevention of recurrence of such incidents, the release added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Party to Win Majority at Local Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's major ruling party has
virtually gained majority control of the country's over 4,000
local administration bodies, according to latest results of the
local elections held throughout the country last month.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML)
won over 56 percent of all the seats for local-level
administration officials which had been announced so far, the
Elections Commission here said today.
</P>
<P>
The local elections were held in two phases on May 17 and 26
for a total of nearly 190,000 seats at various local
administration bodies including those at village, municipality and
district levels.
</P>
<P>
So far the results of the polls for about 90 percent of all the
seats had been announced, an official of the Election Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition the Nepali Congress (NC) party, which had
controlled some two-thirds of all the local bodies in the country
for the last five years, could only garner nearly 30 percent of
the total seats, the official said.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML leaders launched various programs in recent years to
strengthen the party's organization network at grassroots levels
with a view to taking over the majority control of the country's
local authorities from the NC party.
</P>
<P>
A senior CPN-UML leader earlier had predicted that his party
would won control at over 60 percent of all the local bodies
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, the largest party of Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand's three-party government, joined the ruling
coalition in March after a NC-led coalition government lost a
confidence vote in parliament.

</P>
<P>
In addition, 231 firms preferred to wait and see how the

declined to reveal their intentions.
</P>
<P>
Only about seven companies said that they would sack workers,
the poll added.
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies blamed the economic downturn for their
sacking plans, claiming they would choose to lay off those lazy or
inefficient workers if necessary.
</P>

Some 43 percent of the companies surveyed urged the government
to solve the country's economic problems, while 20 percent called

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Build World's Tallest Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a 94-storey
skyscraper, believed to be the world's tallest, will start this
September in Cosmopolitan Shanghai and be finished by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The building of the 460-meter Shanghia World Financial Center
will cost 960 million US dollars and will be jointly invested by
Mori Building Co. Ltd, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of
Japan, and 34 other Japanese and US financial companies, said
Youxikawa Kiyouxi with Mori's Forest Overseas Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
The office- and hotel-building, located at Lujiazui Financial
and Trade Zone in Shanghai's Pudong New Area, was designed by the US
architectural firm, KPF.
</P>
<P>
Kiyouxi said it was Pudong's promising future of economic
development that encouraged Mori to put up 30 percent of the total
investment into the project.
</P>
<P>
Mori is currently building a 50-storey office tower near the
site of the skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
When built, the Shanghai World Financial Center will be eight
meter's taller than the current record-holder Petronas Twin Towers
in Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur, which is 451.9 meters in height.
</P>
<P>
The 68-storey 384-m-high Diwang (King of the Land) Commercial
Mansion in south China's booming city of Shenzhen is holding the
record of China at present.
</P>
<P>
Some other Chinese big cities, including Guangzhou, Chongqing,
and Beijing, are also planning to erect skyscrapers over 100
stories, according to early reports.

<HEADLINE> 429 Fires Hit U.S. Churches Since 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 429 arsons and
bombings have struck churches across the United States since 1995,
with 38 percent done in black churches, a report by a national
arson organization said today.
</P>
<P>
Although 162 black churches suffered burning attacks between
January 1, 1995 and May 27, 1997, the National Church Arson Task
Force said that black churches were not major targets of criminals
and there have not been enough evidence of "a national conspiracy"
aimed at colored people.
</P>
<P>
The task force, formed by the order of President Bill Clinton a
year ago to coordinate probes into a string of suspected racist
fires in black churches, said that conspiracy charges were filed
in "a limited number of cases" and they "tended to be confined to
a small geographic area."
</P>
<P>
But some pastors disagreed, saying they were racial. "It is
terror perpetrated against people of color who have no defense,"
said the Rev. Robert Jeffrey, pastor of New Hope Baptist Church in
Seattle who is attending a three-day conference in Washington
Sunday on rebuilding the burned churches.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that 110 suspects, 85 percent of which
white, were convicted in 77 fires, or 18 percent of the total
arsons, bombings or attempted bombings.
</P>
<P>
More than three quarters of the attacked black churches are in
the South, it said. The burned churches also include 11 synagogs
and four mosques.
</P>
<P>
Federal and state authorities arrested 199 suspects, 42 percent
of which juveniles, in 150 fires, or 35 percent of all the
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Motorist Killed Due to Curiosity Over Road Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A man who slowed down his car to
poke his nose into a road accident was killed by angry teenagers
in Chon Buri province on Sunday as the man's car blocked their
way.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old unlucky man was shot on his way to Bang Saen, a
seaside resort frequented by Thai holiday makers, by one of a
group of teenagers who were traveling behind him in four other
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The teenagers apparently were angry as the man slowed down his
car and tried to have a better look at a roadside accident, which
caused a minor traffic jam, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The man was chased and shot by the teenagers when he tried to
drive off later. He was found dead when he was sent to a nearby
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Local police are looking for clues to identify the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The traffic jam is a long-standing problem which tortures
travelers in the tropical country, especially in Bangkok and
nearby areas where people seem most likely to lose patient. People
driving cars on congested routes are advised to avoid causing any
inconvenience to others on the traffic.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Protects Rights of Workers in Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is looking at
ways to protect the rights of workers who lose their jobs when
foreign investors wind down their businesses in Thailand or move
to other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a government source, state agencies responsible
for labor have been slow in some cases to enforce regulations,
resulting in foreign investors leaving the country without paying
adequate compensation to workers.
</P>
<P>
The Labor and Social Welfare Ministry has proposed an ad hoc
committee to solve such problems. The committee would be chaired
by deputy prime minister Sukavich Rangsitpol who overseas the
ministry with 14 representatives from related state agencies.
</P>
<P>
The committee will look to tackle problems over the long-term,
including amending regulations in order to strengthen the rights
of employees.
</P>
<P>
At least 2,500 factories owned by foreign investors are
operating in Thailand, but some are relocating to lower-wage
countries.
</P>
<P>
Staporn Kavitanon, secretary-general of the Board of Investment
(BOI), was quoted today by the local press as saying that labor
problems could grow more serious during the current economic
slowdown as some factories are relocating.
</P>
<P>
The BOI already has its own committee to ensure that labor
issues are addressed at factories that have BOI privileges, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks Active In China's Money Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Overseas banks which are licensed
to deal in the local currency in Shanghai have become active
participants in China's inter-bank money market.
</P>
<P>
Total lendings by six overseas banks had reached 269 million
yuan by the end of last month, according to the Shanghai-based
fund center.
</P>
<P>
The first lending by the banks occurred in early April when
Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi put ten million yuan into the
money market.
</P>
<P>
Limited assets in the Renminbi yuan made it difficult for such
overseas banks to grant huge loans to overseas-funded ventures,
and they now are mainly involved in banking services like
accounts opening, depositing, settlement and fund-raising
activities in the money market, said Huang Jinrong, deputy
president of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that, judging from their activities on the
money market, the banks have already demonstrated their ability to
handle funds efficiently. (8.3 yuan = one US dollar)

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wants Resolution of Kashmir Issue: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif says Pakistan wants good relations with India by resolving
the outstanding issues between them including the Kashmir problem.
</P>
<P>
"People want good relations but also want resolution of the
problems," he said in an interview with the India-based EL-TV
network telecast which was published on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said restoration of trade links between Pakistan and India
would benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to carry people with us, who also want progress on
Kashmir and other issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif urged the need for easing visa restrictions by both
Islamabad and New Delhi. "I can assure you from my side, there
will be no problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hot-line between the prime ministers of the two countries
would soon be installed and then "we can talk with each other and
sort out the matters on personal level," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for withdrawal of Indian troops from the
Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and suggested a cut in the
defense budgets of both India and Pakistan "through a mutual
agreement."
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the Indian Prime Minister (Inder Kumar Gujral)
that troops should be withdrawn from Kashmir as a first gesture
which will help in building an atmosphere of trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif conceded that there are limitations on both sides.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the limitations of Mr Gujral, but I too have
got my own limitations. I found Mr Gujral a very nice person and I
hope he will respond positively."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Islamabad would propose a cut in defense
expenditures during bilateral talks with New Delhi, Sharif said,
"Time will come for it."
</P>
<P>
But he added that it could be done only after progress was made
on other issues, "this can be done after confidence is restored".
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan and India have had a history of "hostilities,
tension, and confrontation spread over fifty years," he said. "We
expect improvement in relations once this temperature is lowered."
</P>
<P>
"We must get over the hangovers of past animosity," he said.
</P>
<P>
While expressing the hope that the next round of foreign
secretary-level talks (scheduled for June 19-22 in Islamabad) will
help in improving bilateral relations, Sharif said, "It would not
be in the interest of the two countries to talk without keeping
the Kashmir issue on the agenda."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, he said Pakistan wanted to establish
trade links with India on the bilateral level as well as through
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
"We must come out of the atmosphere of confrontation, we should
learn lesson from the past," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of his visit to India, Sharif said he would
undertake the visit "if need arises so."

fouled.

Kostadinov, who scored the last minute goal that eliminated
France from qualifying for the 1994 finals, made it 2-0 just after
half-time, playmaker Krasimir Balakov scored the third from the
penalty spot and Yordan Letchkov, another player returning after a
falling out with Bonev, wrapped up the three points in the 82nd

<HEADLINE> East China Province Sees New Economic Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu province in east China has
started to experience another round of economic boom as it
recovers from four years of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
The average economic increase is expected to be 13.5 percent
through to the end of the century, as compared to the 12 percent
set for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), says Xiao Jinghua, a
senior statistician in the province.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output value increased by 12.4 percent in April,
compared with 5.9 percent in January, and the average increase
rate stood at 10.6 percent for the first four months, with profits
up 15.7 percent, and consumer retail prices up only 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GDP accounted for 8.93 of the national total during that
period, while industrial added value made up 9.7 percent of the
national total, ranking first in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attribute the good outlook in economic
development to an improved infrastructure, steady growth in
agriculture, stable prices, and the growing service sector.
</P>
<P>
Through to the next century, Jiangsu will focus on new economic
growth areas, such as machinery, electronics, automobile and
chemical industries, that will have an average increase of more
than 17 percent in industrial added value.
</P>
<P>
The province has designated 30 key enterprises in these fields
and is making an effort to get 10 billion US dollars in overseas
investment to improve them in four or five years.

<HEADLINE> Spain Beats Czech Republic in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A penalty by Fernando Hierro five
minutes before the break gave Group six pacesetters Spain a 1-0
win over the Czech Republic in a World Cup European Zone qualifier
in Valladolid, Spain on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Scottish referee High Dallas had no hesitation pointing to the
spot when Alfonso was brought crashing down by Czech goalkeeper
Srnicek and the Real Madrid marksman made no mistakes from the
spot.
</P>
<P>
The penalty came after Spain had dominated territorially in the
first-half -- although the visitors went close after half-an-hour
with a cleverly flighted Nedved free-kick which was plucked
spectacularly out of the air by Zubizarreta.
</P>
<P>
After the interval Spain settled back to defend their lead and
the Czechs with few ideas up front were unable to capitalise.
</P>
<P>
Spain are now unbeaten in eight matches with six wins and two
draws and are one point clear of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic are struggling with just one win from five
matches.

<HEADLINE> Balance of Payments Surplus Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of payments
(BOP) surplus dropped sharply during the first five months of this
year to 448 million US dollars, the local newspaper Business World
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures from the Philippine Central Bank showed
that this level is 77 percent less than the year-ago figure of
1.961 billion US dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The BOP for May was based on the net international reserves of
the central bank as of May 31 at 10.037 billion which failed to
reach the planned target, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has targeted net international reserves at
11.323 billion US dollars for the previous months.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the bank indicated that the drop was due to debt
servicing requirements and the effect of the recent unloading of
greenbacks by the bank to defend the pesos from speculative
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The BOP records the country's transactions with other
countries. A BOP surplus means the country has more funds for
trade and investments coming in than it pays out to other
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- One hundred percent of school-age
children of the Hezhe nationality, the least populated of China's
55 minority groups, have enrolled in primary school in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there have been quite a number of university and post
graduate students of the Hezhe, which before the founding of New
China in 1949 had only two students to complete primary school.
</P>
<P>
The Hezhe population has risen from 300 in 1949 to the current
4,000. Most of them live near the two banks of the Heilongjiang
River and the Wusuli River in northeast China's Heilongjiang
province.
</P>
<P>
The minority group has its own spoken language but no written
language.
</P>
<P>
The central government has provided special funding for the
development of education in the Hezhe-occupied region. Primary
schools have been built in all of the three counties that are home
to the nationality.
</P>
<P>
The state has been offering financial assistance for those
schools and giving each Hezhe student a small amount of aid each
year.
</P>
<P>
China has also established preferential policies for schooling
and employment of minority young people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than a dozen Hezhes have received
higher education. Soem of them have become deputies to the
National People's Congress, government officials, engineers,
doctors, artists or teachers.

HANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang province in east China
has made remarkable headway in an ambitious decades-long program
to extend its 1,900-km coastline further offshore, in a major bid
to transform waters into land.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the province has farmed 1,550 sq kilometers
(equal to 155,000 ha) of land in its coastal waters, including
66,000 ha of cultivated land.

<P>
With a population of 45 million crammed into 110,000 square
kilometers of land, Zhejiang averages a per-capita cultivated land
space of only 0.03 ha.
</P>
<P>
The created "continent" has not only been turned into vegetable
yards and cotton fields, but also is the site for dozens of
infrastructural facilities and thousands of township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Newly-formed coastal land, which accounts for only 1.4 percent
of the total land area in Zhejiang, is now a leader in the
economic growth in local economy with a GDP of 60 billion yuan in
1996, 14 percent of the province's total.

<HEADLINE> Kankkunen Leads Acropolis Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Four-time world champion Juha
Kankkunen, driving a Ford Escort, jumped to a 27-second lead after
the first stage of the Acropolis Rally on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kankkunen's compatriot, reigning world champion Tommi Makinen,
was level second with Briton Richard Burns after the day's series
of specials in the eighth world championship event of the year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Colin McRae's rally ended after less than half an hour
as he crashed out during the second special.
</P>
<P>
The Scot, who had earlier finished joint fastest with Spain's
Carlos Sainz in the first special, damaged his Subaru's steering
wheel column after hitting a rock.
</P>
<P>
Mechanics were unable to repair the damage to the car of the
1995 world champion, who won the Acropolis last year.
</P>
<P>
Kankkunen, a winner of this rally in 1986 and 1991, started
steadily before cranking up the speed after the third special. In
the sixth, he took advantage of a crash by then-leader Kenneth
Eriksson of Sweden, who damaged his Subaru's suspension and lost
11 minutes to the Finn.

<HEADLINE> Scotland Beats Belarus in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- One goal from Gary McAllister helped
Scotland to beat Belarus 1-0 in a World Cup qualifier in Minsk,
Belarus on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
McAllister's 49th-minute penalty registered three more vital
Group Four points for Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Darren Jackson won the award from Turkish referee Ahmed Cakar
but there seemed little doubt about its validity with Erik
Yakhimovich guilty of the foul.
</P>
<P>
It came after Scotland had somehow survived a rocky first 45
minutes in the Dinamo Minsk stadium with Yakhimovich crashing one
early shot off the woodwork from 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
Now Brown's side have registered a fifth win in eight ties this
season as they seek Group Four security in the qualification race
with Austria and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, joint bottom of the group, and Latvia have still to
come to Scotland in the autumn and six more points will surely
guarantee at least.

<HEADLINE> Croatian President Takes Train To Vukovar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A special train aboard with Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman went to Vukovar, eastern Slavonia, on
Sunday, marking a symbolic return of Croatia to its Danube
borders.
</P>
<P>
"The Train For Vukovar-Peace Train" consisted of 21 carriages,
representing all counties of Croatia, and carried 2,000 guests
including senior government officials, representatives of various
circles and ambassadors of foreign missions in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
Vukovar is the main town of eastern Slavonia which was
controlled by Serb rebels fighting against Croatia's independence,
but will return to Croatia in the middle of next month under an
agreement reached between Zagreb and local Serbs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Before starting the trip, Tudjman told a rally in the Zagreb
railway station that by riding this train, "we are completing the
historical victory of the Croatian freedom, of creation of the
independent, sovereign and democratic Croatia".
</P>
<P>
This also was a train of reconciliation with Serbs who would
like to stay and recognize Croatia, Tudjman said, adding that the
Croatian government would guarantee them civil and ethnic rights.
</P>
<P>
The train was greeted in Vukovar by representatives of local
Serbs as well as UN administrator of eastern Slavonia Jacques
Klein.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the welcoming ceremony, Klein called for efforts to
be redoubled in helping Serb displaced persons to return their
homes elsewhere in Croatia so that Croat refugees who had fled the
region could be able to come back.
</P>
<P>
When the train was on its way back to Zagreb, it was stoned by
a group of "local Serb extremists", with one window broken but no
one hurt, according to local press reports.
