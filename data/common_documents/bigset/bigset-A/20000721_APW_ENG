<HEADLINE> Protestants Are Split on Gay Issues  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Not since the civil rights era of 1954-1965 have
major mainline Protestant denominations been so deeply divided on
an issue as they are today about how to address homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   So observes the dean of U.S. church historians, retired
University of Chicago professor Martin E. Marty, who adds that
while civil rights mainly roiled Southern churches, disputes over
gay issues cut across denominations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Christian church has always taken 200 to 300 years to
settle things: the Trinity, sacraments, popes versus councils, the
Enlightenment. Now we have all these changes in sexuality, plus
authority and autonomy issues, and the poor churches have to take
30 years to settle what normally takes 300,'' Marty says.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity's tradition against homosexual behavior is not
debated in the evangelical and black Protestant churches, any more
than it is among Roman Catholic and Orthodox bishops.
</P>
<P>
   But views have diverged sharply among mainline Protestant
denominations -- the dominant Colonial churches and younger ones
allied with them in ecumenical organizations, what Marty calls
''the front-line churches,'' buffeted and shaped by wider U.S.
culture.
</P>
<P>
   During the past nine weeks, three major mainline churches with
14.4 million members have had these showdowns:
</P>
<P>
   --In May, the United Methodist Church's General Conference voted
by a 2-to-1 majority to retain a ban on blessing ceremonies for
homosexual couples, almost guaranteeing future disobedience and
church trials. Delegates opposed openly gay and lesbian clergy by a
similar margin.
</P>
<P>
   --In late June, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) General Assembly
gave narrow approval (51.6 percent) to a Methodist-style ban on
same-sex ceremonies. To become law, the measure must now be
ratified by 87 of the church's 173 regional units.
</P>
<P>
   --Last week, the Episcopal Church's General Convention
overwhelmingly endorsed a new policy acknowledging there are
Episcopal couples, ''acting in good conscience,'' in lifelong
committed relationships outside marriage that should receive
''prayerful support, encouragement and pastoral care.'' The wording
covers both gay and lesbian couples and unwed heterosexual couples,
prompting new warnings from conservatives that toleration of
homosexual behavior will unglue Christian sexual morality as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis of Judaism's liberal Reform branch decided at a
closed-door meeting in March that same-sex couples are ''worthy of
affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual,'' although the term
marriage was avoided. That created a clear breach between the
Reform and small Reconstructionist branches on the left, and the
Conservative and Orthodox branches that preserve traditional
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   There's a similar split among the mainline Protestant
denominations, despite their affinity on many other topics.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal caucus for lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgendered members says the denomination is moving ''toward full
acceptance and celebration'' of relationships outside heterosexual
marriage. That would align the Episcopal Church with the United
Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The United Church has long promoted toleration of same-sex
couples and in 1983 declared that sexual orientation should not be
a barrier to clergy ordination. The United Methodist Church and
others with a conservative stand on ordination agree, but also
insist that homosexual clergy remain celibate, while the United
Church policy leaves that open.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Church, regional bodies are free to allow or to
forbid homosexual clergy and ceremonies, and Episcopal Church
dioceses operate with the same local option. As the American
Anglican Council, a conservative Episcopal caucus, puts it, ''two
strikingly different churches exist under the same roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Other mainline denominations that agree with the Methodists in
opposing same-sex activity include the 5.2 million-member
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming year, Presbyterians will be monopolizing the
spotlight on sexual policy. Regional meetings running through April
will vote on the bill to prohibit same-sex ceremonies. Next June,
the national assembly will decide whether to allow clergy and lay
officers with same-sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   In all denominations, the conservatives stand on the
prohibitions in the Bible. The Rev. Laird Stuart of San Francisco,
co-leader of the Covenant Network which is working for Presbyterian
change, counters that Christians have altered their understanding
of biblical teaching on other matters like slavery, divorce and
women clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our society,'' Stuart says, ''there is a growing
intolerance toward intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Parker Williamson of Lenoir, N.C., editor of the
conservative Presbyterian Layman, essentially agrees but is
confident of victory. ''If you make the culture the indicator, the
other side has something to look forward to, we agree. But we think
it's an inappropriate tool for measuring what the church will do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're betting on culture. We're betting on Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the liberal view will triumph eventually
because of growing support from mainline agency staffers, seminary
and college teachers and younger clergy. But the Rev. Robert
Bullock of Richmond, Va., editor of the moderate Presbyterian
Outlook, which has taken no stand on homosexuality, sees the
opposite among active lay members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who are joining the church, on whom the church is being
built, tend to be more traditional in their understanding of
morality and sexuality,'' he says, and the conservative
congregations are growing. ''It seems the younger generation, at a
time of moral confusion and even anarchy in culture, is looking for
a clear standard.''

Fiji Could Split in Wake of Coup
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- With turmoil in ethnically divided Fiji deepening amid
prospects that rival governments could emerge, coup leader George Speight on
Friday announced a ''crusade'' for indigenous rights throughout the South
Pacific. Calling for indigenous people to unite, Speight threatened to join
forces with Australia's Aborigines to disrupt the Olympics games in Sydney in
September. But it didn't immediately appear as if Speight had the means to carry
out such a threat. And the Aborigines have not indicated that anyone else will
join them.

House Votes To Lift Cuban Limits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to lift limits against U.S. food
and drug sales to Cuba and against Americans seeking to travel there in a major
victory for farm, business and other groups trying to ease the four-decade-old
restrictions. With supporters arguing that increased contacts would help weaken
Fidel Castro's hold over the communist nation, the House voted 232-186 to stop
enforcing rules that limit the ability of Americans to travel to Cuba. It then
voted 301-116 to also halt enforcement of rules banning U.S. exports there of
food, and of rules limiting sales there of American medicine.

House Approves Privacy Amendment
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved an amendment Thursday directing the
Treasury Department, Postal Service and other federal agencies to show how they
collect personal information from visitors to their Internet sites. The
amendment addresses fears that federal Web sites threaten privacy by tracking a
visitor's progress through the site and collecting identifiable data. In June,
the Clinton administration issued strict rules regulating ''cookies,'' small
text files placed on a person's computer.

Senate Confirms Norman Mineta
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has confirmed Norman Mineta, a former House
member and defense contractor executive, to President Clinton's Cabinet as
secretary of commerce. The Senate confirmed Mineta, who will be the first
Asian-American Cabinet member, on a voice vote late Thursday. The appointment
will be for only six months, through the end of Clinton's term. Mineta succeeds
William Daley, who recently left to run Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign.

Sources: McCain Would Be Bush's VP
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Vanquished primary rival John McCain has told a
prominent Republican governor and mutual friend of George W. Bush that he would
be willing to serve as the Texan's running mate, sources said Wednesday. McCain,
who has previously ruled out a vice presidential bid, signaled his change of
heart in a telephone conversation this week with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge,
amid a series of developments abruptly raising McCain's profile as Bush draws
close to deciding, three GOP officials said. Ridge has been considered a top
candidate for the job, but told McCain that he didn't think he was still in the
running, the sources said.

Clinton Targets Tensions in Okinawa
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ITOMAN, Okinawa, Japan (AP) -- Pivoting from the Mideast peace summit,
President Clinton stopped Friday on the hallowed ground of the last major land
battle of World War II and sought to soothe long-simmering tensions over the
huge American military presence on Okinawa. ''We take seriously our
responsibility to be good neighbors, and it is unacceptable to the United States
when we do not meet that responsibility,'' Clinton said in prepared remarks. He
pledged to complete a process of consolidating U.S. bases on Okinawa and ''to
reduce our footprint on this island.''

Bush Considers Foreign Policy Team
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush says he would pack
his foreign policy team with heavyweights who saw the nation-- and his father--
through the Cold War, such as George Shultz, Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell.
''These are all people that stood by my side when I talked about nuclear
security'' last spring, Bush said during an interview for CNN's Larry King Live.

Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading

   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose Friday, bolstered by overnight rallies on
Wall Street. The Nikkei Stock Average gained 108.20 points to 17,091.77 in early
trading. Investors were cheered up by a 147.79-point gain in the Dow, which
finished Thursday at 10,843.87. Also in New York, the Nasdaq composite index
rose 128.93 points to 4,184.56.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jeff Kent hit a three-run homer, raising his
league-leading RBIs total to 88, to help Kirk Rueter and the San Francisco
Giants beat the San Diego Padres 6-3 Thursday. Kent's 24th homer was his first
since July 2 and snapped a season-high six game streak without driving in a run.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Could Split in Wake of Coup  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- With turmoil in ethnically divided Fiji
deepening amid prospects that rival governments could emerge, coup
leader George Speight on Friday announced a ''crusade'' for
indigenous rights throughout the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for indigenous people to unite, Speight threatened to
join forces with Australia's Aborigines to disrupt the Olympics
games in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't immediately appear as if Speight had the means to
carry out such a threat. And the Aborigines, who have already said
they will stage peaceful protests at the games, have not indicated
that anyone else will join them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to make a call to all ethnic people in the South
Pacific to stand up and exert their rights,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Munro, chairwoman of Sydney's Metropolitan Aboriginal Land
Council -- which is planning peaceful protests at the games -- said
they had not been contacted by Speight.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been no discussions,'' she said. ''I would say it
is highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight could not visit Sydney to directly coordinate any such
protest since the Australian government has banned him from
entering the country, but he could try to influence others from
within Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games spokesman
Milton Cockburn refused to comment on what he called a hypothetical
threat.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
''This is not an issue police want to buy into.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight was expected to continue negotiations with Fijian
government representatives about the makeup of a new Cabinet
announced Tuesday which has yet to be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, members of the ousted Cabinet huddled in Ba, on the
western side of Viti Levu island, to plot strategy, with
establishment of a separate government emerging among the
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   At least one diplomat, discussing the meeting in Ba involving
ousted Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, likened Fiji's plight to
that of South Africa under the apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, interim government officials met with Speight
in the capital, Suva, over his demands for greater representation
in a new Cabinet. Neither side commented after the meeting at the
central police station.
</P>
<P>
   Failed businessman Speight threw Fiji into crisis May 19, when
he led an armed gang into Parliament and took dozens of lawmakers
hostage, including Chaudhry, the first ethnic Indian elected prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's coup was carried out in the name of guaranteeing
political superiority to indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   He freed his last 18 hostages on July 13 as part of a deal that
Speight said would disenfranchise ethnic Indian Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   They make up 44 percent of the 814,000 population but dominate
the economy in Fiji, a nation of 320 islands about 2,250 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The military took power 10 days after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of democracy in Fiji prompted Australia, New Zealand
and now the United States to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The American sanctions involve suspension of defense aid and
cooperation with Fiji worth an estimated $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Fijian government released figures underscoring how badly
the economy has been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, unleaded gasoline prices will rise by 10 percent, the
government announced. It also said the economy, which had been
growing at 6 percent before the coup, is now shrinking by 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Exports have been hit by labor unions in Australia and New
Zealand refusing to handle the goods. They were down 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has doubled to about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Civil servants' pay will be cut by 12.5 percent in an attempt to
cap government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Many people do not plan to wait around for the economy to
decline further -- migration inquiries to Australia's High
Commission in Suva have increased sixfold since the coup. A
breakdown of the applicants was not available, but most are
probably ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A new Cabinet was announced Tuesday, but Speight said there were
not enough of his supporters in the 20-member lineup and said he
was not consulted sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Speight supporters who left Parliament on Wednesday
were establishing a new camp at the Kalabu primary school outside
Suva.
</P>
<P>
   Details of lessons were still on blackboards at the school as
Speight's supporters hung washing out to dry and piled up furniture
outside.
</P>
<P>
   A sign outside said, ''Education, like neurosis, begins at
home.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A 5.5-magnitude earthquake shook
Indonesia's capital and other parts of Java island on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties, said
Suharjono, an official with the Meteorological and Geophysics
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said the temblor hit at 9:17 a.m. local time and its
epicenter was 20 miles deep under the Sunda Straits, about 75 miles
west of Jakarta, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The area affected lies near Krakatau, a volcano in the straits
between Java and Sumatra. Krakatau blew up in 1883 in one of the
biggest eruptions in recorded history. About 36,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's quake was the latest in a series of seismic upheavals
that have rocked the world's largest archipelagic nation in the
past month.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Lift Cuban Limits  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to allow unrestricted
U.S. food and drug sales to Cuba and let Americans freely travel
there. The vote was a major victory for farm, business and other
groups trying to ease the four-decade-old sanctions against Fidel
Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   With supporters arguing that increased contacts would help
weaken Castro's hold over the communist nation, the House voted
232-186 to stop enforcing rules that limit the ability of Americans
to travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It then voted 301-116 to also halt enforcement of rules banning
U.S. exports there of food, and of rules limiting sales there of
American medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, lawmakers voted 241-174 to reject a broader
proposal by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., that would have ended
enforcement of United States prohibitions against virtually all
trading with the Caribbean island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, approval of the narrower provisions was a major victory
for an alliance of conservative, liberal, business- and farm-state
lawmakers. And it was an embarrassing setback for House GOP
leaders, who have opposed easing the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a separate agriculture spending bill on
Thursday that would permit food and medical sales with Cuba and
prevent a president from blocking shipments of food and medicine to
any country without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear whether Thursday's votes meant that trade
sanctions with Cuba would be lifted this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This improves the likelihood we'll have some sanction
reform,'' Rep. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., sponsor of the provision easing
food and drug restrictions, said after the vote. ''But there are
many members of Congress, including people in the leadership, who
oppose lifting sanctions this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said he thinks
the Senate language -- and a compromise worked out last month
between House leaders and supporters of easing trade sanctions --
goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has supported opening food and drug trade with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, the votes seemed certain to strengthen the hand of
Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., the leader of farm-state lawmakers
who earlier this year tried to lift the food and medicine embargo
against Cuba and four other countries but ran into opposition by
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to a compromise last month that House GOP
leaders have promised to try pushing into law. Thursday's votes
seemed to increase pressure on the leaders to at least make sure
the compromise finds its way into law.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview afterward, Nethercutt did not rule out
discussing possible changes in his agreement with the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an indication the House wants us to have food and
medicine commerce with Cuba,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, anti-Castro legislators said allowing Cuba to
receive more U.S. trade and tourists would help prop up his regime.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said the revenue Cuba would
gain from easing the restrictions would help ''the worst violator
of human rights in all of the Western Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's your compassion'' for the Cubans and Americans Castro
has killed? asked House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who was a
chief opponent to Nethercutt's effort earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But sponsors of easing the trade and travel embargoes said the
result would be to accelerate the drive toward freedom in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan ''allowed Americans with backpacks to travel in
Eastern Europe, and it did help bring down the Berlin Wall,'' said
conservative Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., chief sponsor of the
language easing the travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personal freedom follows economic freedom,'' said Rep. Jerry
Moran, R-Kan., who conceded that lifting the food embargo would
help his farm-state constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of medicine to Cuba have been allowed since 1992 with
certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of an easing of travel restrictions last year by the
Clinton administration for students, athletes, artists and others,
the government says about 82,000 Americans flew to Cuba last year.
That was a 47 percent over the 55,900 who did so in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under last month's agreement between House GOP leaders and
Nethercutt, Americans could sell food and drugs to Cuba, Libya,
Iran, Sudan and North Korea. But Cubans would be required to pay
for them with cash or with credit from a third country.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition against financing by the U.S. government or U.S.
banks was seen by many critics, including some farm-state
lawmakers, as meaning that little trade would actually occur as a
result of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement would also write into law an existing ban on U.S.
tourist travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration decided a year ago to allow sales of
food and medicine to Iran, Libya and Sudan but was barred by law
from easing the embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions the House debated Thursday were offered as
amendments to a measure financing the Treasury Department and other
smaller agencies in the coming fiscal year. The overall bill was
approved by 216-202.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the bill has no language affecting trade
with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury spending bill is H.R. 4871.

<HEADLINE> Two Ex-Olympic Officials Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Two former Utah Olympic officials were
indicted Thursday on charges they paid $1 million in cash and gifts
to help bring the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Welch, 55, former president of the Salt Lake City Olympic
bid committee, and Dave Johnson, 41, the ex-vice president, became
the highest-ranking officials charged in the biggest scandal in
Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department accused them of making the illicit
payments to influence the votes of more than a dozen members of the
International Olympic Committee, which selects the host cities for
the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cash, Welch and Johnson gave IOC members
first-class airfare; medical care, including plastic surgery at
Utah hospitals; rifles, pistols and shotguns; and U.S. college
tuition for children of six IOC members, according to an internal
investigation by Salt Lake Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said Welch and Johnson diverted $130,000 for
their personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have portrayed themselves as scapegoats for the bribery
scandal, which has been under Justice Department investigation for
over a year. Welch resigned from the bid committee in 1997, Johnson
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that we defrauded the bid committee or anybody else
is preposterous. So is the charge that we bribed anybody,'' Welch
said in a statement. Later, outside his home in Huntington Beach,
Calif., he said: ''We will be acquitted and we will present a
defense that the people of Utah will understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's attorney, Max Wheeler, said: ''What the government is
doing from a moral standpoint is far worse than what Johnson and
Welch ever did. It will cause irreparable harm to other people in
this community and the effort to put on successful games.''
</P>
<P>
   A Salt Lake businessman and a former U.S. Olympic official have
already pleaded guilty in connection with the scandal, and a grand
jury indicted the son of a South Korean IOC member who was given a
job by the Salt Lake committee, on immigration-fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson were considered the investigation's chief
targets. Their indictment followed the collapse of plea bargain
negotiations with them. On Monday, they rejected a deal to plead
guilty to tax obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson were charged with one count of conspiracy,
five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud and four
counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering. Each charge
carries up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are another blow to the scandal-scarred Olympics.
The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has struggled to raise money and
keep sponsors from bowing out since the scandal erupted in November
1998.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC President Mitt Romney, who was hired to clean up after the
scandal, still has $80 million to raise for the $1.32 billion games
to break even. He said he made a personal plea to Welch to settle
case for good of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''These indictments come as no surprise,'' Romney said. ''I do
not believe this will have significant financial consequences for
the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said he expects the case to take at least a year to play
out, meaning a trial could drag into the February 2002 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate to have NBC cut into their coverage of the giant
slalom in order to report on a trial. Such a trial will only rehash
everything that has already been said about the bid committee's
actions,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said earlier this week.
</P>

   In a report issued in 1999, a Salt Lake ethics panel found that
the bid committee lavished more than $1.2 million in cash, gifts,
travel, scholarships and other inducements on members of the IOC
and their relatives. The panel largely blamed Welch and Johnson.

<P>
   In the wake of the scandal, 10 IOC members resigned or were
removed from the 105-year-old organization and the Salt Lake
organizing committee's upper management was replaced.

House Votes To Lift Limits on Cuba
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to allow unrestricted U.S. food
and drug sales to Cuba and let Americans freely travel there. The vote was a
major victory for farm, business and other groups trying to ease the
four-decade-old sanctions against Fidel Castro's government. With supporters
arguing that increased contacts would help weaken Castro's hold over the
communist nation, the House voted 232-186 to stop enforcing rules that limit the
ability of Americans to travel to Cuba. It then voted 301-116 to also halt
enforcement of rules banning U.S. exports there of food, and of rules limiting
sales there of American medicine.

Study: Greenland Ice Cap Is Melting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A warming climate is melting more than 50 billion tons of
water a year from the Greenland ice sheet, adding to a 9-inch global rise in sea
level over the last century and increasing the risk of coastal flooding around
the world, a study shows. A NASA high-tech aerial survey shows that more than 11
cubic miles of ice is disappearing from the Greenland ice sheet annually, says
the study appearing Friday in the journal Science. That's equal to about 12.5
trillion gallons and is enough to raise sea level by .005 of an inch annually.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- With turmoil in ethnically divided Fiji deepening amid
prospects that rival governments could emerge, coup leader George Speight on
Friday announced a ''crusade'' for indigenous rights throughout the South
Pacific. Calling for indigenous people to unite, Speight threatened to join
forces with Australia's Aborigines to disrupt the Olympics games in Sydney in
September. But it didn't immediately appear as if Speight had the means to carry
out such a threat. And the Aborigines have not indicated that anyone else will
join them.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved an amendment Thursday directing the

who has previously ruled out a vice presidential bid, signaled his change of
heart in a telephone conversation this week with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge,
amid a series of developments abruptly raising McCain's profile as Bush draws
close to deciding, three GOP officials said. Ridge has been considered a top
candidate for the job, but told McCain that he didn't think he was still in the

President Clinton stopped Friday on the hallowed ground of the last major land
battle of World War II and sought to soothe long-simmering tensions over the
huge American military presence on Okinawa. ''We take seriously our
responsibility to be good neighbors, and it is unacceptable to the United States

pledged to complete a process of consolidating U.S. bases on Okinawa and ''to
reduce our footprint on this island.''

<HEADLINE> Labor Probes Miss America's Claims  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department is investigating claims
by Miss America, Heather French, that a top Clinton administration
official tried to intimidate her into changing her congressional
testimony in support of a veterans employment and training bill
opposed by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   French said in an interview Thursday that Espiridion (Al)
Borrego, assistant secretary of labor for veterans' employment and
training, ''was definitely trying to shake my testimony'' the
evening before the July 12 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   French never vacillated in her testimony supporting the bill,
which top members of the House Veterans Affairs Committee refused
to give up despite White House opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Letters from two lawmakers kicked off the investigation last
week. Rep. Lane Evans of Illinois, the top Democrat on the
committee, demanded Borrego's resignation; Rep. Jack Quinn of New
York, the Republican chairman of the benefits subcommittee, sought
an explanation from Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department solicitor (Henry Solano) and ethics officer
(Robert Shapiro) are conducting a thorough and efficient review of
the matter,'' said Labor Department spokesman Carl Fillichio. ''We
take the allegations very seriously and we have been in contact
with the members' offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrego testified at the same hearing that key portions of the
legislation were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   French, in the interview, said Borrego ''never said, 'I would
like to change your opinion,''' but did say the bill ''would cause
more than 3,000 veterans to lose their jobs and become homeless. I
took that as if he was definitely trying to shake my testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   She described the conversation as ''very uncomfortable. I felt
they were trying to intimidate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Borrego did not return a call requesting an interview,
Fillichio said the official ''maintains that he never tried to
discourage Ms. French from testifying before the subcommittee. Any
misinterpretation of his conversation with Ms. French was
regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   French, the daughter of a Marine veteran wounded in Vietnam, has
made homeless veterans her cause and testified several times before
Congress about their plight.
</P>
<P>
   She said that when a Labor Department official asked to speak
with her on July 11, she thought the conversation would be about
her appearance with Herman in Cincinnati at the end of last week.
Instead, she found herself on the phone with Borrego and two other
Labor Department officials, who wanted to talk about the
legislation. Fillichio would not identify the two other officials.
</P>
<P>
   French said she has worked with Borrego previously and he knew
of her strong support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was trying to maybe soften me from my view of the bill''
supported by major veterans organizations, she said. ''It was to me
unspeakable to think I wouldn't be on the veterans' side.''
</P>
<P>
   French is engaged to Kentucky Lt. Gov. Steve Henry, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the hearing, Quinn wrote Herman that Borrego tried
to persuade French to change her mind ''after she had already
submitted her written testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn told Herman that the Labor official ''misrepresented what
the subcommittee's legislation would do, insisted that French
furnish him a copy of her testimony in advance of the hearing and
told French that since she would be appearing with you at a
function ... it would make her support of the ... bill even more
problematical.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans wrote Borrego the day of the hearing to demand his
resignation. Evans said the subcommittee staff informed him that
Borrego ''suggested'' to French ''that her appearance before the
subcommittee may not be in her best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrego also criticized provisions that already had been removed
from the legislation, which is still before the Veterans' Affairs
Committee, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st Century Veterans Employment and Training Act would
provide priority to certain veterans in all federally funded
employment and training programs. It also would require government
contractors to take affirmative action to employ qualified
veterans, set an appropriations level for veterans' employment and
training and provide grants to states for their programs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Astros 6, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jose Lima won his second straight decision after
losing 13 straight, and Lance Berkman hit a three-run double
Thursday night to lead the Houston Astros over the Cincinnati Reds
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Mike Bell struck out as a pinch hitter in the
seventh inning, making his family the first to have three
generations play for one major league team. Grandfather Gus Bell
(1953-61) and father Buddy Bell (1985-88) previously played for the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wohlers returned to the major leagues for the first time
since April 1999, making his Reds debut.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who had 33 saves for Atlanta in 1997 before losing his
control the following year, walked six in two-thirds of an innings
with the Braves last season, then was traded to the Reds for John
Hudek on April 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati put Wohlers on the disabled list with an anxiety
disorder the following day, and he tore a ligament in his right
elbow last June during a minor league rehabilitation assignment.
Wohlers then had ligament replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old reliever pitched two hitless innings against the
Braves, walked none and struck out two, throwing 14 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (3-13), who won his first start April 5 against Pittsburgh,
then didn't win until beating Kansas City on July 9. He didn't get
a decision Saturday in Houston's 11-6 loss to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Against Cincinnati, Lima allowed two runs and eight hits in 6
2-3 innings, struck out four and walked one as Houston stopped a
three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Lima escaped early trouble after allowing leadoff doubles in the
second and third innings. The Reds broke up the shutout in the
fifth on Eddie Taubensee's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin's RBI double in the seventh chased Lima. Marc
Valdes and Octavio Dotel finished with hitless relief.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williamson (3-7) allowed two runs -- one earned -- and two
hits in three innings but walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took a 2-0 lead on Bill Spiers' RBI single in the second
and Richard Hidalgo's run-scoring grounder in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman's double over the head of left fielder Dmitri Young made
it 5-0 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's solo homer in the fifth off Scott Winchester made it
6-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dante Bichette's second-inning double extended his hitting
streak to 14 games. Sean Casey singled in the sixth, stretching his
hitting streak to a career high 13 games. ... The Astros have 18
home sellouts in their first season at Enron Field, including
Thursday's crowd of 42,554. The Astros have drawn 1.7 million
through 45 home games. ... Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon needs one
victory to tie Lou Piniella for 11th on the Reds career victories
list at 255.

<HEADLINE> Forgotten French Turn Desperate  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIVET, France (AP) -- Remo Pesa pressed a button and, with a
clackety-clack, the machines in France's last factory producing
viscose -- a silk-like synthetic used in making clothes -- once again
whirred into action.
</P>
<P>
   The display was more poignant than practical. The 153 workers at
the Cellatex factory in Givet in northeastern France occupied the
premises after the factory went into liquidation July 5 and
threatened to take the toxic chemicals in the plant and blow it up.
</P>
<P>
   Their desperate struggle has become a symbol for those people
left behind by France's much-vaunted economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been completely forgotten by the boom,'' said Pesa,
who worked at the factory for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, government negotiators and union representatives
reached an agreement, with workers raising their hands in a show of
support for financial measures to help them overcome losing their
jobs. But some workers weren't satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you lose your job, it's not a victory,'' said Ferhat
Asloun, 39, who has worked at Cellatex for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds of the 97-year-old factory contain flammable and
toxic materials, including nearly 12,000 gallons of carbon
disulfide. Angry employees stacked cardboard boxes around the tank
containing the flammable chemical, the easier to set fire to it.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent copycat move on Wednesday, 96 workers at a
brewery in Alsace in eastern France went on strike, threatening to
blow up their plant to protest plans by the Heineken group to close
it. In an angry display Thursday, they dumped several 13-gallon
barrels of beer onto the street.
</P>
<P>
   The workers in Givet made headlines throughout France this week
when they spilled some highly corrosive sulfuric acid into nearby
streams. With their threat to blow up the factory, they became an
uncomfortable reminder that glowing official economic statistics do
not tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the tale of 153 people losing their jobs, the plight of
the Cellatex workers has become the story of those who do not
recognize themselves in tales of Internet revolutions and economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Givet is in the Ardennes, a rolling region of green hills
overlooking the winding Meuse River on the border between France
and Belgium. The unemployment rate in Givet is 22 percent, compared
to a national rate of 9.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The textile industry has long been a staple here, but in the
''new economy'' where company histories are more often measured in
months instead of years, factories like Cellatex are dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fighting first and foremost to save this factory. Today
the workers are very angry. They are fighting for their dignity as
humans,'' Pesa said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here in the Ardennes, we have been totally forgotten by
France,'' said Danielle Riebel, who has run a cafe beside the
factory for 23 years. ''They think we are idiots. Factories are
closing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike older workers, many of whom still think the plant can be
saved, younger ones seemed pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The young people know this was to be expected. For us, it's
over. The factory is too old,'' said 25-year-old Stephanie Pecheux,
who has worked at the factory for four years. ''Some people have
hope, but we young ones are not crazy.''

<HEADLINE> Ruling Expected in U.N. Rape Case  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The 1998 conviction of a Bosnian
Croat paramilitary commander who stood by as his subordinates
sexually assaulted a female prisoner served to broaden the
definition of rape as a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's appellate chamber
is set to rule on an appeal against the judgment, which held Anto
Furundzija personally liable for failing to stop a rape by a
soldier under his command.
</P>
<P>
   Furundzija, head of the special military police unit calling
itself the ''Jokers,'' looked on as a naked woman was threatened
with a knife and then raped during interrogation. He was convicted
of rape and torture and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred a year into the 1992-95 Bosnian war during
a bloody campaign in central Bosnia to expel Muslims from the Lasva
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The original conviction, based almost entirely on the testimony
of the unidentified victim, contained two important findings from
the court: The witness was reliable despite suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder to the point of being suicidal, and
the definition of rape was expanded and made more easily punishable
as an act of torture.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal hearings, defense attorney Luka Misetic maintained
that the prosecution failed to prove that the rapist had acted with
Furundzija's consent.
</P>
<P>
   He also called the 10-year sentence ''cruel and unusual
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Misetic challenged the impartiality of Zambian judge Florence
Mumba, who presided over the original trial. He said she had failed
to disclose her previous membership in a U.N. women's rights
commission that pushed for the reaffirmation of rape as a war
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Furundzija is one of 14 defendants from the Bosnian war who have
been convicted and sentenced up to 45 years by the tribunal,
established by the U.N. Security Council in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate ruling comes during hearings in another trial at
the tribunal, the first international proceeding to focus on
systematic rape and sexual enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for three Serb paramilitary fighters are presenting
their case after 16 Muslim women testified that they were raped
nightly at detention facilities after Bosnian Serb forces overran
the city of Foca in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Alomar Out With Bad Ankle  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar will
miss at least three games with an injured left ankle, yet another
setback for the Cleveland Indians, who have been ravaged by
injuries all season.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar was forced to leave Wednesday night's loss to the Kansas
City Royals after the sixth inning with a sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent an MRI on Thursday, which showed swelling in his
ankle and Achilles' tendon. Alomar has been told to rest it for
3-to-5 days.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar, who has also been bothered by an injured left wrist and
sore elbow this season, got a general cortisone shot on Thursday.
He will stay behind in Cleveland when the Indians start an 11-game
road trip on Friday in Minnesota and hopes to rejoin the team eary
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of swelling,'' Alomar said Thursday night after
the Indians lost 10-6 to the Royals. ''I had an old injury in my
ankle and now there is swelling in the Achilles' tendon. I think
that's why I have so much pain. They didn't find a tear, so that's
the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar is batting .261 with nine homers and 42 RBIs in 89 games
this season. Despite the bum ankle, he's currently ranked second in
the AL with 23 steals and earlier this week he became the 36th
player since 1898 to get 400 career steals.
</P>
<P>
   Although his offensive numbers are down, Alomar's defense has
been solid.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries are a major reason the Indians began Thursday's play
10&AMP;frac12; games behind the first-place Chicago White Sox in the AL
Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who are awaiting the return of starting pitchers
Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright, have had to use a record-tying 26
pitchers so far this season because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar was expected to accompany the Indians on their 11-game,
14-day road trip beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With Alomar out, Jolbert Cabrera made his first career start of
the season at second base on Thursday and went 1-for-4. Cabrera,
batting .245 with five RBIs in 44 games, played six games at second
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians would normally use utilityman Enrique Wilson at
second, but he went on the 15-day DL earlier this week with a
sprained right wrist.

<HEADLINE> Deal Lead Qualifier in Hammer Throw  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Lance Deal is enjoying his final year
of competition in the hammer throw, especially the Olympic trials
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Less nervous than he was four years ago, Deal unleashed a throw
of 245 feet, 11 inches on Thursday to lead the qualifiers into
Friday's final.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve the tension, Deal, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist,
went to Europe before the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to make this meet less nerve-wracking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His 7-year-old daughter, Sarah, also tried calming her father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was talking to my daughter this morning and she said, 'Just
pretend you're at the Olympics.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'I can't do that. I have to be where I'm at.
Otherwise, things go screwy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Things have not gone screwy too often for Deal.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, he has been the best hammer thrower and
35-pound weight thrower in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He has won six national hammer throw titles and been a
three-time Olympian. He's won two Pan American Games titles and
been a two-time silver medalist at the World Cup and once at the
Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Indoors, he owns the world record in the weight throw and has
won 12 national indoor titles, more than any other athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Deal opened the qualifying at 232-5, only six inches short of
the automatic qualifying distance, then got it on his second
attempt, despite hitting the cage with his implement.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McMahon, the 1997 U.S. champion and 1999 Pan Am silver
medalist, was the only other automatic qualifier at 235-5.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the decathlon began in hot, humid conditions, and
without Dan O'Brien, the world record-holder and Olympic champion
who withdrew because of a foot injury.

<P>
   O'Brien's heir apparent, Chris Huffins, opened a 128-point lead
after the first three of the 10 events -- the 100 meters, long jump
and shot put.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins, the 1998 and 1999 U.S. champion and 1999 World
Championship bronze medalist, ran the fastest time, 10.45 seconds,
in the 100, had the best long jump, 25-10, and was second in the
shot put at 47-11 among the 16 competitors. That gave him 2,779
points.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the men's 400
hurdles who has been plagued by depression, insomnia and paranoia
in recent years, advanced to Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Looking anything but like the smooth, graceful hurdler who won
at Atlanta four years ago, Adkins finished second in his
opening-round heat at 49.84. Eric Thomas, last year's Pan Am silver
medalist, had the fastest time in the first round, 49.25.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Price-Smith, a 21-time national champion indoors and
outdoors, led the qualifying for Friday's women's shot put final at
57-4&AMP;frac34;.
</P>
<P>
   Vanitta Kinard, a former Big 12 champion from Kansas State, led
the qualifiers in the women's triple jump with a career-best 45-4&AMP;frac14;.
Sheila Hudson, the American record-holder and two-time Olympian,
also qualified for Saturday's final at 44-6&AMP;frac14;.
</P>
<P>
   Only two finals were scheduled Thursday night -- the men's
javelin and 3,000-meter steeplechase.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Completes Third Generation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Mike Bell struck out in his major league debut
Thursday night, making history.
</P>
<P>
   With Bell's pinch-hit appearance in the seventh inning for
Cincinnati against the Houston Astros, he became part of the first
three-generation family to play for the same major league team.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfather Gus Bell played for the Reds from 1953-61 and his
father Buddy Bell played for the Reds from 1985-88.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud to be a part of it,'' Mike Bell said. ''Even though
I struck out, looking back on the at-bat, too much adrenaline was
going. Now, I realize this is the same game I've been playing all
these years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to get out there again and do something to help.
I've been playing in the minors for seven years and I wanted to do
well. I got it out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells are one of only three three-generation major league
families. The others were the Boones (Ray, Bob, Bret and Aaron) and
the Hairstons (Sam, Jerry Sr. and Jerry Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I'm extremely proud of,'' Mike Bell said. ''I'm
proud of what my grandfather accomplished and I'm proud of what my
dad accomplished. I'm proud of what I've done, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, whose brother David plays for the Seattle Mariners, said
he had not discussed the generational feat with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''My grand dad passed away and I never talked about it, and I've
never talked to my dad about it,'' Bell said. ''Maybe 20 years from
now we'll sit down and talk about it being neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon thought it was about time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been with us for about a week now and I've been dying to
get him in the game,'' McKeon said. ''You can be up here, but
you've got to get your name in the box score.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was hitting .279 with 16 homers and 55 RBIs in 88 games
with Triple-A Louisville this season.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Wohlers Returns To Majors  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Mark Wohlers pitched two hitless innings for the
Cincinnati Reds on Thursday night, returning to the major leagues
for the first time since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, when I worked in the bullpen, I felt fine,''
Wohlers said. ''I knew if the phone rang tonight, I'd be fine too
even though I haven't been in the big leagues in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who had 33 saves for Atlanta in 1997 before losing his
control the following year, walked six in two-thirds of an innings
with the Braves last season, then was traded to the Reds for John
Hudek on April 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati put Wohlers on the disabled list with an anxiety
disorder the following day, and he tore a ligament in his right
elbow last June during a minor league rehabilitation assignment.
Wohlers then had ligament replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to get back to where I want to be,'' Wohlers
said. ''I really wasn't nervous. You go out and throw two scoreless
innings and any pitcher will say that's where you want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good. As far as location of the fastball, it hasn't
been an issue. I know if I have command of my fastball and good
pitch selection, I can be successful anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old reliever pitched two hitless innings against the
Braves, walked none and struck out two, throwing 14 pitches,
including 11 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fourteen pitches in two innings, that was a break and a
blessing,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon said. ''He was smooth and he
had good command. I'm very, very pleased with what we saw tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers entered the game with the Reds trailing 6-2 in the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a golden opportunity to take a look at him,'' McKeon
said. ''It was a perfect situation for him to get his feet on the
ground. He's so smooth that he fools you with that easy motion, and
the ball gets on you so fast.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers Sign Three Draft Picks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers signed three more draft
picks Thursday, leaving only safety Rogers Beckett, their top
choice, unsigned heading into the start of training camp Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers agreed to three-year contracts with third-round
pick Damion McIntosh, an offensive tackle, and fourth-round picks
Trevor Gaylor, a wide receiver, and Leonardo Carson, a defensive
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh, a 325-pounder, spent his senior season at Kansas State
as the starting left tackle. He spent his first three seasons as a
defensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylor caught 128 passes for 2,131 yards and 20 touchdowns in
four seasons at Miami of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In his four years at Auburn, Carson had 224 tackles and 18
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers also cut running back Tremayne Stephens, who spent
the last two years with San Diego. He started two of the 13 games
he played last year, gaining 61 yards on 24 carries with three
touchdowns, and catching 18 passes for 133 yards and another score.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Probe of Root of Wars  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Solving the root causes of war should be a
priority for the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said, adding that the best way to prevent conflicts is to promote
development that benefits the poor.
</P>
<P>
   While poverty alone does not spark wars, ''social despair
provides fertile soil for conflict, especially when irrigated with
undemocratic governance and violations of human rights,'' Annan
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that governments must be willing to intervene when
wars are on the verge of breaking out, saying conflict prevention
must be the ''cornerstone'' of collective security in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came in a meeting of the council on improving the
United Nations' ability to intervene early to help prevent wars --
something widely seen as a good idea but that stirs deeply held
beliefs about sovereignty for Russia and China when the issue of
military intervention arises.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's deputy ambassador, Gennadi Gatilov, stressed that any
preventive action by the council must be with the ''clearly
expressed consent'' of the country involved.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Ambassador Wang Yingfan echoed that, saying ''the
principle of noninterference in internal affairs is essential in
guiding U.N. conflict prevention activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deputy Dutch ambassador, Jozef Scheffers, countered that
questions of sovereignty carry little weight when countries
themselves are responsible for repressing their own people -- an
argument that compelled NATO to launch its air campaign on
Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffers called for a more ''flexible'' interpretation of the
U.N. Charter, which prioritizes state sovereignty above all else.
</P>
<P>
   A rigid interpretation of the charter sought by countries such
as Russia and China ''would preclude the council from taking any
action -- preventive or not -- in the majority of issues on its
agenda and would therefore deny the Security Council to shoulder
the responsibilities the council is called on to carry out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting, the council adopted its longest
consensus statement ever, a seven-page pledge to make preventing
wars more of a priority. The statement places special attention on
the need to curb illegal sales of diamonds and small arms that fuel
wars in Angola and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greed may be one of the driving forces behind some of today's
armed conflicts, but we are not helpless in confronting it,'' Annan
said.

<HEADLINE> TV Measures for Disabled Considered  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stuck at a Chicago airport recently, Pam
Holmes wanted to call her sister who also was in the area. But
Holmes, who is deaf, had trouble figuring out how to reach a
special local operator who could relay a text message.
</P>
<P>
   She's among millions of speech- and hearing-impaired people who
could benefit from the creation of a three-digit number -- 711 -- to
make it easier to reach special operators who convert calls to text
messages. The Federal Communications Commission was planning to
require such a code Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new 711 code ''presents an opportunity not to have missed
opportunities.'' said Holmes, of Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also is expected to require broadcasters and cable
companies to provide some voice-narrated programming of the action
in TV shows in their biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   Both initiatives are part of a wider effort by the FCC to enable
more people to share in the communications revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tried to address every aspect of the virtual world and
make it accessible,'' FCC Chairman William Kennard said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a downtown city sidewalk, Kennard said there was a
time when putting ramps on street corners -- called curbs cuts -- was
a big deal. But now people accept that as the norm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to get to a place in the virtual world where this is
not debated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV plan, broadcasters affiliated with NBC, ABC, Fox and
CBS in their largest markets initially would have to provide
several hours per week of described prime time and/or children's
programming. Large cable operators and satellite companies would
have similar obligations for a set number of their channels.
</P>
<P>
   In the service, descriptions of events are squeezed into the
natural pauses already in the program. For example, television
audiences would be told that a character is running down the street
or hugging a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, this would be done using a separate audio track that
audiences could switch on or off. All sets made since 1993 can
receive this secondary soundtrack channel.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters has said that it would
cost stations more than $160,000 to implement the plan and the
cable industry believes the market could address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no consensus on this matter even within the affected
interest community,'' said David Beckwith of the National Cable
Television Association. ''We think this is an area best left to
industry efforts, not government regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also is expected to set standards to ensure that
closed captioning for the deaf is available to people using digital
TVs.
</P>
<P>
   The 711 code will consolidate dozens of toll-free numbers now in
use and provide hearing people who want to call a deaf person a
single number they can easily associate with the service -- like 411
for information or 911 for emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most hearing people were willing to do that instead of trying
to remember an 11-digit telephone number,'' said Eric Kaika, a
23-year-old student at Gallaudet University in Washington, a
liberal arts university for deaf people.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kaika uses his instant messenger account or e-mail to
reach people he knows, he says relay services are still critical
for contacting people or companies for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, now part of Verizon Communications, already has
rolled out 711 service throughout most of its 13-state Northeast
region.
</P>
<P>
   The company tracked its results in Maryland and found ''a
dramatic increase in the number of hearing users who were dialing
through relay just because it was easier,'' said Richard Ellis,
director of strategic alliances for Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   The relay service center received 18 percent more
voice-initiated calls and 10 percent more total calls over a
seven-month period.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Track Trials Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The head of USA Track &AMP; Field says the
state of the sport in this country ''is good and getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, brushing aside any suggestion that track and
field is a dying sport in the United States, said the highly
successful Olympic trials are not ''an isolated example of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather it is the culmination of three years of planning and
hard work and a mere step along the way to the sport's future,''
Masback said.
</P>
<P>
   Masback said that when he took over as chief executive officer
of the sport's national governing three years ago, ''many said that
USATF was bankrupt, suffering from a deficit of ideas, teetering on
the brink of financial ruin, and lacking confidence about its place
in the world of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Masback said, ''a mere three years later, we are stronger
than we have ever been and have solid plans for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Masback said the sport must do a better job of informing the
public about the progress being made and to strengthen USATF's
links to the International Amateur Athletic Federation and U.S.
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''America is and should be proud to have the world's best team
in the world's greatest sport,'' Masback said, ''a team recognized
around the world to be the best and the equal to Brazil and
Manchester United in soccer, the All Blacks in rugby and the
Yankees in baseball.''
</P>

   DRUG-FREE TO THE FINISH: After his emotional final race, a
last-place finish in the men's 800-meter preliminaries, four-time
Olympian Johnny Gray talked about how he had run his entire 20-year
career without using performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know throughout my career I've run against many drug
users,'' he said. ''They've mentioned it to me. They've told me.
They've admitted to me they were on drugs. They were trying to get
me to take them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't mention any names, but my coach Merle McGee. He gave
me the confidence and the space to be the athlete that I became.
I'm glad to say I stuck around for two decades a drug-free athlete.
I took a lickin' and kept on tickin'.

   SPIDERMAN LOOK: Spiderman is headed to the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.S. Olympic track and field uniforms were unveiled on
Thursday, including a Spiderman-looking outfit, complete with cape,
for the sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Men's distance runners will have a mesh top.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are subdued, in blue, black and a checkered red,
hence the Spiderman look. The uniforms are skin-tight and made of
Lycra.
</P>
<P>
   Designed and manufactured by Nike, the sponsor of the U.S. track
team, the uniforms feature a new USA logo. For decades, the U.S.
uniforms had a stars and stripes shield over the heart. The new
logo features a streamlined version of the shield, with the letters
''USA'' stacked vertically attached to golden wings, representing
victory and triumph.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CHANGING TIMES: Qwest, the newly merged companies of U.S. West
and Quest, has a seven-member team competing at the trials,
including defending world champion Anthony Washington in the
discus.
</P>
<P>
   The team members have jobs with U.S. West, a career they plan to
continue once they retire from sports. Nearly all of them said they
wouldn't have been able to continue their athletic careers without
the Qwest program, which provides support and time for their
training.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the team is pole vaulter Pat Manson, who barely
missed making the U.S. Olympic team when he lost a three-way
jumpoff. He was disappointed, he said, but not devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can go home where I have a family and a good job,'' he said,
''and I'll begin working for future competitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said that while he appreciates the support of Qwest,
he believes USA Track &AMP; Field and the U.S. Olympic Committee should
do more to help athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Al Oerter, a four-time Olympic gold medalist in the discus
(1956-68), said such support is a far cry from what athletes of his
day received.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got $2 a day,'' he said, ''and we had to give back the
uniforms when we were finished with them.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   UNRETIRED: In 1997, high jumper Matt Hemingway quit the sport
at age 25 with no intention of ever returning. After 2&AMP;frac12; years off,
he's back and better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''The passion and fire wasn't there to go to practice or jump or
do anything,'' he said of his decision to quit. ''I was tired of
track and field ruling my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved from Johnson City, Tenn., to Colorado, and lived an
entire summer in a tent. For two years, he worked as a whitewater
guide, then he got married and went to work for U.S. West, the
Denver-based telephone company that sponsors an elite track and
field team made up of people who work there.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway was not part of that team. He was a regional sales
manager, and that was all.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had no idea that I had high jumped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doing one-handed and two-handed dunks from the foul line during
lunch-time basketball games, he began to feel the competitive urge
again. He knew fellow employee and pole vaulter Pat Manson from
high school, and Manson put him in touch with coach Mike Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   The two had a long talk, and Hemingway decided to begin
training.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first day of practice jumping again I jumped my best
practice jump even from college. I jumped 7-1 in practice. I came
back two days later and jumped 7-3 and came back the next week and
jumped 7-4. It was boom, boom, boom. Everything came together.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hemingway won the U.S. indoor championship with a
personal best 7 feet, 9&AMP;frac34; inches, the best jump in the world this
year.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Seth Etherton won his fifth straight
start and Scott Spiezio homered as the Anaheim Angels beat the
Texas Rangers 6-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton (5-1) allowed a run and six hits in 7 1-3 innings. The
23-year-old right-hander struck out two and issued both of his
walks in the eighth inning while pitching through the seventh for
the first time in his eight major-league starts.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa relieved in the eighth and retired Rafael
Palmeiro on an inning-ending double play, and the Angels padded
their lead in the bottom of the inning with two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim built a 4-0 lead in the first four innings against
Darren Oliver (2-5), who was activated earlier in the day after
spending a month on the disabled list with tendinitis in his left
(pitching) shoulder. He allowed four runs and seven hits in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio opened the scoring in the second with his ninth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, who recorded his 52nd multi-hit game, led off the
third with a double and scored on a single by Troy Glaus. Erstad
leads the majors with 157 hits, nine more than he had last season
in 585 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad also had an RBI single in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim scored its final two runs in the eighth on sacrifice fly
by Orlando Palmeiro and a throwing error by third baseman Mike
Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, plate umpire Charlie Reliford ruled that
Lamb made a diving grab of Benji Gil's sacrifice bunt -- contrary to
TV replays that showed the ball hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   A night earlier, Eddings called Spiezio out at the plate on the
final play of the game. Replays showed that Spiezio's foot touched
home plate before Ivan Rodriguez tagged him for the final out of
Anaheim's 3-2 loss to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea doubled in the sixth and scored Texas' run on an
infield hit by Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who entered the game leading the AL with a .292
team batting average, were held to one hit in the first 4 1-3
innings -- a bloop single by Alicea that fell between Gil and Erstad
as the shortstop and center fielder avoided a collision in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vaughn remarkably stayed in the game after an 88-mph
fastball by Oliver struck him flush on the front of his batting
helmet in the first inning and knocked him woozy for a few seconds.
Oliver sprinted toward the plate to make sure Vaughn wasn't badly
injured, and Rodriguez bent over to comfort him until trainer Rick
Smith and a frantic Scioscia arrived. Vaughn tied a club record
with four walks. ... Angels pitcher Kent Mercker has been giving
clubhouse attendant Jimmy Brewer a lot of good-natured ribbing
since he learned that Brewer attended Mercker's 1994 no-hitter at
Dodger Stadium as an 18-year-old and left in the eighth inning to
beat the traffic. ... Angels CF Garret Anderson was scratched from
the starting lineup because of a mild strain in his left Achilles.
He hurt it running the bases the night before. He pinch-hit in the
eighth and struck out.

<HEADLINE> Adoptees Start Search For Parents  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN Du BOIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Ore. (AP) -- Even now, after more than 20 years of futile
searching, Doris Lamb has the highest hopes for meeting her birth
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted shortly after birth by a family she never really loved,
Lamb isn't just searching for her medical history or some sense of
closure. She unabashedly admits she wants the mother she never
quite had.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably not as prepared for rejection as I should be. My
heart's out there; I could crash,'' said the 41-year-old Lamb, one
of more than 4,000 Oregon adoptees who have requested their
original birth certificates under a state law that went into effect
on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Oregonians voted to give adoptees access to their birth
certificates in 1998, but the law was blocked for nearly two years
by court challenges from a group of anonymous birth mothers who
said it violated their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states -- Tennessee, Alaska, Delaware and Kansas --
allow adult adoptees access to original birth certificates, which
often have birth parents' names. A similar law in Alabama was just
signed by the governor and will go into effect Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptees and birth mothers who have been through the reunion
process agree Lamb could be setting herself up for heartbreak. Her
mother could be dead or she might not want to see her. If they do
meet, they might not hit it off or be able to overcome feelings of
abandonment and regret.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adoptees are single-minded and rush straight into contact
without thinking of the consequences; I think they need to be
wary,'' said Katherine Pedersen, 59, a birth mother who found her
son. Also an adoptee, Pedersen found that her mother didn't wish to
meet her.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of requests for birth certificates shows that
Oregon adoptees are eager to find their parents. It's less certain
if birth mothers share that excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Health Division has received about 250 contact
preference forms from birth mothers since the law took effect. Of
those, about 70 percent say they would welcome contact from the
child they gave up. But the numbers are still too small to say what
most birth mothers are feeling.
</P>
<P>
   There's no magic recipe for a first meeting. One adoptee said
she shocked her birth mother with a small surprise party. Others
have used the emotional approach.
</P>
<P>
   Once the initial rush subsides, the meetings can be similar to a
first date -- awkward silences are filled with work and family
histories and both parties wonder later if the phone will ring
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no completely good first meeting, you have to
understand,'' said Linda Davlin of Waldport. ''It's a completely
unnatural way to meet someone. It's two people getting together who
share DNA but no history.''
</P>
<P>
   Davlin was in high school when she gave up her son, a decision
she made after being told it would be best for the child. Soon
after, she read an article that said single mothers make capable
parents -- an idea whose time hadn't come before the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went out and got drunk. What else could I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Depressed and living on a diet of coffee and cigarettes, her
weight dropped below 100 pounds. She eventually married, had a
second child, then divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Davlin has since found her first son, an event that has brought
up a mountain of emotional issues but no regrets. She feels
fortunate that her son, who now lives in Iowa, was adopted by a
great set of parents and never had to face problems encountered in
other adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, children have stumbled upon troubled birth
families while birth parents have been sought by convicted
murderers. The vast majority of parents and children, however, are
simply ordinary people facing a never-quite-buried past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the situation is negative, I've never heard someone
say they wished they hadn't done it, said Dianne May of Eugene, who
found her son a decade ago. ''Knowing the truth is better than
speculation, guessing and fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb started her search at 18, after a troubled adolescence led
her from home to home.
</P>
<P>
   Using private investigators, Lamb has discovered her birth
mother's name and age. She also found out that her mother had named
her Sherry Lynn before giving her up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-arrive birth certificate will provide her mother's
exact date of birth, another clue in her long-running mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear that she'll be disappointed in me,'' Lamb said. ''A lot
of birth mothers would have kept their babies but they were told it
would be in the child's best interest to be with another family.
That wasn't the case with me and when she finds out I don't want
her to be hurt by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she's happily married with two children, Lamb's search
has become close to an obsession. Some friends jokingly refer to
her as Sherry Lynn. When she goes to a mall, she scans for faces
that look like hers. When someone says ''Hey, you look someone I
know,'' she presses for details.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was just 15 when she had her, so Lamb imagines they
could be great friends, even if they're just two strangers trying
to restore a broken bond.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had years to prepare for this,'' Lamb said. ''I know
she's fearful and probably has shame attached to having me. But if
she's anything like me, I know her pull is as great as mine.''

<HEADLINE> Serb Leaders Threaten More Protests  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb leaders are warning
of further protests if the United Nations takes ''undemocratic''
actions following the release of a Serb whose arrest triggered
rioting in Kosovo's largest remaining Serb community.
</P>
<P>
   Dalibor Vukovic, 24, was freed without bail Thursday by an
ethnic Albanian judge pending a further hearing within two weeks.
He was charged with arson, theft and assault in the burning of an
ethnic Albanian's car last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the charges were not dropped, Serbs hailed Vukovic's
release as a victory because it galvanized the Serb community in
Kosovska Mitrovica, the province's most ethnically tense city. The
four-day confrontation also underscored the tenuous hold that the
United Nations and the NATO-led peacekeeping command maintain over
the largest Serb community left in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally hours after Vukovic was freed, Serb leader Oliver
Ivanovic told about 1,000 people that the Serbian community's
response to the arrest ''proved that we can fight for justice in a
civilized manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will act in the same way to any undemocratic decision by
the international community,'' Ivanovic said. Vukovic, a medical
student and one of several Serb militants who watch over the main
bridge leading from the ethnic Albanian-dominated south bank of the
Ibar River, thanked the people for their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as you were here, I knew was not alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovic's arrest Monday night triggered rioting in which several
people, including Serbs and U.N. policemen, were injured. Attacks
against U.N. vehicles forced U.N. police to temporarily suspend
patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Serbs stole weapons from U.N. policemen, made off with
computers from a suburban police station and ransacked at least one
policeman's apartment. The specter of U.N. police unable to protect
themselves did little to enhance the image of the United Nations
among the majority ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a top British defense ministry official attacked
NATO's handling of the Kosovo conflict, saying the peace terms put
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic were deliberately
unrealistic, The Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think certain people were spoiling for a fight in NATO at
that time,'' Lord Gilbert, Britain's second most senior defense
minister during the Kosovo conflict, was quoted as saying in
comments made to a parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian said Gilbert, who in charge of intelligence during
the conflict, also was highly critical of French President Jacques
Chirac, saying his reluctance to see bridges in Belgrade destroyed
put his country's pilots at risk and prolonged the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Release 4 Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Four tired but jubilant Malaysian
hostages were taken by plane Friday from a remote southern
Philippine island to Manila after Muslim extremists released them
from nearly three months of captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy,'' several of the hostages said as they were taken
to the airport on Jolo island, their belongings in rice sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The four were part of a group of 21 mostly foreign hostages
kidnapped April 23 from a Malaysian diving resort by Abu Sayyaf
rebels. Six Malaysians and one German woman from the group now have
been released.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels earlier had promised to free three other Malaysians,
but refused to turn them over Thursday to envoys sent by
negotiators to an Abu Sayyaf hide-out on Jolo, at the southern tip
of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal apparently resulted from disagreements among the
rebel leaders over how to divide the ransom, negotiators said. The
remaining three Malaysians are reportedly now being held by a
different Abu Sayyaf commander.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf has hundreds of heavily armed rebels who are
divided into several bands led by at least five commanders. The
group has been accused of banditry, kidnappings and numerous
attacks on Christians in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Since abducting the 21 hostages from Malaysia's Sipadan resort,
the Abu Sayyaf also has kidnapped 13 Filipino Christian evangelists
and three French TV journalists. A separate armed group on Jolo is
believed to be holding a German reporter for Der Speigel magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the rebels released the son of a Philippine
government soldier who was killed in a clash with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Richard Sintos, 17, was abducted by the Abu Sayyaf on
nearby Basilan island after his father was killed by the rebels.
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said he expects two
female teachers abducted from a Basilan school on March 20 to be
released soon.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Malaysians originally were scheduled to be freed
Monday, but a last-minute demand by the rebels for a larger ransom
delayed the release. The negotiators agreed to raise the ransom an
unspecified amount from the $67,500 per person originally agreed
upon, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are demanding $1 million for the release of each
European hostage, negotiators say. The Philippine government has an
official no-ransom policy, but negotiators have confirmed that
ransoms were paid for the two Malaysian hostages released earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysian government also has promised to provide
development assistance through the Philippine government for Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the rebels released their first European captive, an
ailing German woman.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining hostages consist of six French, three Germans, two
Finns, two South Africans, 17 Filipinos and three Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators say Ghalib Andang, the Abu Sayyaf commander holding
most of the hostages, is no longer demanding an independent nation
be created in the southern Philippines for the country's Muslim
minority. But other rebel commanders reportedly continue to want an
Islamic state.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 6, Rockies 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gary Sheffield and Shawn Green homered
Thursday night as the Los Angeles Dodgers welcomed manager Davey
Johnson back by beating the Colorado Rockies 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had missed the previous four games because of an
irregular heart rhythm that caused him to be hospitalized for 3&AMP;frac12;
days. The Dodgers went 3-1 in Johnson's absence with bench coach
Jim Tracy running the team.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield hit his major league-leading 33rd homer off Masato
Yoshii (4-11) in the first to open the scoring, and Green hit his
14th with two aboard in the sixth to put the Dodgers ahead 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Jim Leyritz hit a two-out, two-run single in the
eighth off gabe White, the fourth Colorado pitcher of the inning,
to give the Dodgers their final two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park (10-7) overcame wildness to earn the victory, his
first since June 18. Park, who had lost his previous three starts
after two no-decisions, allowed four hits and three runs in six
innings while walking five, hitting a batter and striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams then pitched two scoreless innings, and Mike Fetters
blanked the Rockies in the ninth for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who lost his fourth straight start after winning three
in a row, also went six innings and gave up seven hits and four
runs as the Rockies lost for the 13th time in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Green hit a 2-0 pitch from Yoshii an estimated 439 feet over the
center field fence for his 14th homer after Mark Grudzielanek
opened the sixth with a single and Sheffield drew a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies had taken a 3-1 lead in the top of the inning when
Brent Mayne hit a two-run homer, his fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Park held the Rockies hitless until Todd Helton lined a one-out
single in the fourth after Larry Walker had walked. Jeffrey
Hammonds followed with an RBI double to tie the game 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams blew scoring opportunities in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies loaded the bases with nobody out, but Park pitched
out of trouble by retiring Mike Lansing, Walker and Helton.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre opened the bottom of the inning with a double, but
Chad Kreuter lined into a double play. Alex Cora and Park then
singled before Yoshii retired Todd Hollandsworth on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Park retired the Rockies in order in the first with two
strikeouts, ending a five-game streak in which Los Angeles
opponents had scored in the opening inning. ... The Yoshii-Park
matchup pitted pitchers from the Far East against each other.
Yoshii is from Japan and Park is a native of Korea. ... Sheffield
has hit safely in 11 straight games and has six homers in the
Dodgers' eight games since the All-Star break. ... Dodgers
outfielder Devon White, sidelined 2&AMP;frac12; months due to a partial tear
in his left rotator cuff, went 1-for-3 with an RBI and two runs
scored for San Bernardino of the California League in his first
game of a rehabilitation assignment. The Dodgers might activate
White as soon as this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Economists Vow Compassion  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President-elect Vicente Fox's top economic
advisers sought to soften their image as pro-business technicians,
saying they will try to increase social equality and offer
incentives -- not just punishments -- to get Mexicans to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The model we're using is a model that believes in the private
sector, the markets and competition, and also believes that
selective and temporary government intervention is needed to reduce
inequalities,'' Eduardo Sojo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The markets can't do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sojo, who headed economic programs when Fox was governor of
Guanajuato state, spoke Thursday alongside Luis Ernesto Derbez, a
former senior economist at the World Bank. The two, Fox's top
economic advisers on his transition team, then headed off for talks
with officials of the current administration on the 2001 federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a conservative businessman and former Coca-Cola executive,
is scheduled to take office Dec. 1, and both Sojo and Derbez said
they would like to serve as treasury secretary in his cabinet. Fox
is expected to announce cabinet appointments within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants high economic growth, no increase in tax rates but a
big boost in government spending and a balanced budget by 2004 -- a
combination some economists say is far too ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Fox's plan -- to increase tax revenues by
getting more Mexicans to file tax returns -- would include
incentives like more health-care benefits and access to credit for
registered taxpayers, Sojo said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 40 percent to 60 percent of Mexicans are paid under
the table, working or selling products off the books in what is
known as the ''informal economy,'' and thus pay no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many Mexicans remain outside the tax system, Derbez
said: ''I could make up figures, but in reality, we don't have the
slightest idea.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many Mexicans are in the informal economy because
bureaucracy makes it too difficult for them to start registered
businesses, but that some operate under the table ''to commit fraud
and avoid taxes.'' He promised to punish the latter.
</P>
<P>
   While the two advisers sought to soften their image as
conservatives, they didn't let up on Mexico's leftist Democratic
Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   That party lost most of its congressional seats in the July 2
elections, but still could constitute a swing voting bloc in the
House, where Fox's party is 27 votes short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party that lost the most'' in the elections, Derbez said,
''was the one party that was against any kind of change in the
economy, the PRD. The public perception was that these people
always created obstacles to growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's transition team on social affairs, meanwhile, said it
would try to expand opportunities for the poorest Mexicans with
scholarships and financial incentives to stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   Team members said they planned to double investment in programs
to reduce poverty, and shift administration of the programs to the
states.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Lawyer Arrested in 1982 Murder  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN WHEELER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A Detroit lawyer and a Mississippi drifter
have been charged in what authorities say was the 1982
murder-for-hire of the lawyer's wife, a former Detroit police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Randolph Jr. was arraigned Thursday on first-degree
murder and conspiracy charges in the death of Sharron Randolph.
Authorities say he arranged to have her killed in a staged robbery
attempt at a restaurant to collect $248,000 from insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors brought the case against Randolph and Sanirell
Shannon, described as a Mississippi drifter, after a witness with a
connection to Shannon contacted police.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon, 49, was arrested Thursday in Hattiesburg, Miss., on a
federal fugitive warrant, Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca
said. A Michigan warrant charges Shannon with first-degree murder
and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   A pretrial hearing has been set for July 28. Thomas Randolph
III, who represented his father at the arraignment, did not return
a telephone message left Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharron Randolph, 26, was shot in the head twice outside the
Empress Garden restaurant Jan. 8, 1982. According to news reports,
Thomas Randolph told police a man with an accent attacked them in
the parking lot, forced him to hand over his wallet and $310, and
then he was struck in the head with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Sharron Randolph, a mother of two who worked as a Detroit police
officer for three years before she was laid off in 1980, was found
dead in the back seat of their car.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pretty much out of it when I heard a far-off firecracker
sound,'' Thomas Randolph told The Detroit News at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph, who was working as a Wayne County Community College
counselor, later sued the owners of the strip mall where the
killing occurred, contending they failed to provide adequate
lighting and security.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen investigators from the Southfield Police
Department, Oakland County agencies and the FBI looked into the
killing after the witness came forward within the last few years,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like to send the message to bad guys that we never, ever,
close cases of this nature,'' Southfield Police Chief Joseph Thomas
said.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is poised to send President Clinton a
Republican bill cutting married couples' income taxes for the
second year in a row. Also for the second time, it appears headed
for a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was scheduled Friday to give final approval to the
''marriage penalty'' bill that passed the House short of a
veto-proof margin a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would cut taxes for virtually all married couples,
beginning in this election year, at a cost of $292 billion over 10
years -- still pennies on the dollar of a budget surplus projected
at $2.17 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bill was a long-overdue remedy to a tax
code disparity that forces about 25 million two-income married
couples, mainly those with two roughly equal incomes, to pay more
taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no reason on earth why the president should veto this
bill,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ''I find it
fiscally responsible to let hardworking folks keep more of their
own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed more limited marriage penalty relief but
offered to sign an earlier version of the GOP bill if Congress also
passed an acceptable prescription drug benefit for Medicare
recipients. But Republicans have refused that deal.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage legislation was part of last year's $792 billion
tax cut that Clinton vetoed. Republicans are pushing through
Congress separate pieces of the larger bill in an effort to draw
clearer, election-year contrasts with Democrats on specific tax
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are rushing to get the marriage penalty bill to the
White House so that Clinton must decide whether to sign or veto it
before the end of the Republican National Convention that takes
place July 31-Aug. 3 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers reaffirmed the veto threat
in a letter Thursday to congressional leaders. He said the marriage
bill's price tag would consume surplus money that could be used for
other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said more of the tax cut would go to the 1 percent of
Americans with the highest incomes than the lowest 80 percent and
that half the money would go to couples who get a marriage tax
''bonus'' because one spouse is the main earner.
</P>
<P>
   ''The package of bills working their way through Congress would
subvert the fiscal discipline that has helped to fuel the economic
growth of the past eight years,'' Summers said. ''This is not the
time to abandon our path of fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, a compromise negotiated by House and Senate GOP
leaders, would give some tax relief in calendar 2000 to millions of
married taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this year, the bill would increase gradually the
amount of married couples' income in the bottom 15 percent tax
bracket until couples were taxed the same as two single people.
Under current law, two single people pay the lower 15 percent rate
on a greater share of their income than a married couple.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would adjust the standard income tax deduction for
married couples so that it is equal to that of two single people,
beginning with the 2000 tax year. That would increase a married
couple's deduction from $7,350 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would raise by $2,000 the income cap for
lower-income couples who claim the earned income tax credit. It
also would ensure through 2004 that married couples could claim
personal tax credits, such as the $500-per-child credit, without
getting entangled in the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was passed under restrictive budget rules, the tax
cuts would expire after five years unless extended by a future
Congress. Over that time span, the cost was pegged at $89.8

<HEADLINE> Village Expels 29 Mexico Families  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Indian traditionalists
in southern Mexico have expelled 29 families from a village,
apparently for not sharing their religious beliefs, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a continuing struggle that has seen tens of
thousands of people, most of them Evangelical converts, driven from
their homes in Chiapas in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Torres Vera, the state representative for the area
where the expulsions occurred, said 14 Protestant and 15 Catholic
families were driven out of Plan de Ayala, near the Guatemalan
border, on Wednesday by Indians who practice a Catholicism mixed
with Indian traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The traditionalists also blocked roads into the town after the
expulsion to prevent the arrival of police, said Jesus Manuel
Grajales, the state's deputy secretary of religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Two other families were expelled Wednesday from San Juan
Chamula, just north of San Cristobal, for listening to religious
music, according to Diego Cadena, spokesman for the Fray Bartolome
de las Casas Human Rights Center operated by the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   The hillsides overlooking San Cristobal are populated by
thousands of people driven out of Chamula over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Local Mayan Indian cultures place a strong value on consensus
and village leaders in areas such as Chamula and claim the converts
undermine local cultures that have been under attack by the outside
world for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   Their critics often accuse the leaders of using the expulsions
to rid themselves of people who question their political or
economic power.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eduardo Montoya Lievano told the
government's Notimex news agency that the state would prosecute
those responsible for the expulsions in Plan de Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Mexican constitution guarantees freedom of
belief and said, ''We are not going to tolerate any violation of
that right.''

<HEADLINE> Suharto Foundation Building Seized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- State prosecutors investigating
corruption charges against ex-President Suharto on Friday impounded
an office building owned by charitable foundations linked to the
former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ''The seizure of this building will prove that we are serious in
dealing with the Suharto case,'' prosecutor Umbu Lagelozara said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-floor building located in South Jakarta's Kuningan
business district houses several of the charitable foundations that
Suharto is accused of defrauding during his 32-year reign. He is
believed to have misused millions of dollars in funds raised by the
seven institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The office tower, which will remain open for business for now,
is the second property impounded this week that had links to the
former regime.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the attorney general's office confiscated a mansion
belonging to a Suharto crony, Zahid Husein, the former treasurer of
one of the foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Attorney General Marzuki Darusman plans to bring
Suharto's case to court by Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   He has been questioned several times despite his attorneys'
protests that he is unfit after suffering a stroke last year. Some
of his children and business associates also have been
interrogated.

<HEADLINE> Talks Resume in Solomon Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Leaders of rival militias
engaged in a deadly 19-month conflict in the Solomon Islands
resumed cease-fire negotiations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The government is pushing the talks in a bid to keep sporadic
fighting from turning into a full-scale civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The archipelago nation 1,600 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia, has been plagued by ethnic conflict for more than a
year. The conflict escalated June 5 when Malaitan rebels seized the
capital, Honiara, on the Solomons' main island Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were angered by the expulsion of about 20,000
Malaitan migrants by indigenous Guadalcanal residents, known as
Isatabus. The migrants had come to Guadalcanal seeking work over
past years.
</P>
<P>
   After presenting initial statements Thursday, the two sides got
down to substantive negotiations Friday with the length of a
proposed cease-fire and its proposed starting date key issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government feels that the cease-fire agreement should come
into force as soon as it is signed,'' Prime Minister Manasseh
Sogavare said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said both rebel groups wanted to silence their weapons 48
hours after the signing -- scheduled to take place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The well-armed rebels from Malaita island have kept control of
Honiara while the Isatabus, a ragtag group armed mostly with
homemade weapons, hold most areas of Guadalcanal outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Deadly skirmishes have continued, and the Malaitans have warned
that fighting could escalate.
</P>
<P>
   The government is pushing for a 90-day cease-fire, while the
Malaitans want 30 days and the Isatabus want it to be indefinite.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were taking place aboard an Australian naval ship, the
HMAS Tobruk, anchored off Honiara ready to evacuate Australian
citizens if fighting escalates. The supply ship is considered a
neutral venue by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sogavare also confirmed Friday that his government had paid
$20,000 compensation to relatives of a Papua New Guinea national
beheaded by Malaitan rebels on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government felt it appropriate according to Melanesian
custom to pay the compensation,'' Sogavare said.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaitans responsible for his death also were expected to
pay relatives symbolic compensation in traditional shell money
known as tafuliae.

<HEADLINE> Sources: McCain Would Be Bush's VP  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In a sign that a decision is near, George
W. Bush's top adviser has contacted potential vice presidential
candidates and requested to know their whereabouts this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday that Dick Cheney called several prominent Republicans --
Arizona Sen. John McCain, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and Nebraska
Sen. Chuck Hagel among them -- to find out how they can be contacted
in the next week or so.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did not disclose whether his call meant the officials
were candidates or merely GOP officials owed a courtesy call when
the decision is made. Keating and Hagel are mentioned frequently by
GOP officials as likely candidates, and McCain less so because of
his bitter primary campaign against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has not revealed his short list, but aides
say he could announce his running mate as early as Monday -- one
week before the GOP presidential convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The names that figure most prominently in the speculation
include Cheney himself; Rep. John Kasich; Sens. Fred Thompson and
Bill Frist; Govs. George Pataki of New York, Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania and Keating, the little-known Oklahoman who is getting
the most attention from GOP observers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took himself out of the running in May, a move privately
welcomed by Bush after their campaign struggle. But McCain's name
is making the rounds again after:
</P>
<P>
   --He and Ridge talked by telephone Tuesday, and the governor
urged McCain to accept a spot on the ticket if offered. McCain said
he didn't want the job, but told Ridge that if Bush asked ''I would
serve,'' according to GOP sources.
</P>
<P>
   --House Republicans began circulating a letter urging Bush to
nominate McCain. They say McCain's attraction to ticket-splitters
and independent voters would help Republicans retain a razor-thin
House majority.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., head of the House GOP campaign
committee, urged the Arizona senator be given consideration in a
phone call earlier this week with Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator declined to talk about his conversation with
Ridge, but told CNN he doesn't expect to be picked. ''It's a
hypothetical because I don't believe I'm in the process. But if
Governor Bush called I'd certainly like to talk to him about the
weather and how things are going and how good a campaign he's
running.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain advisers said Thursday night that, despite the
developments, they don't think the senator will get the nod because
of animosity remaining from his campaign against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Bush said this week they would be stunned if
their boss turned to the maverick senator. However, even his most
trusted allies have been largely frozen out of the selection
process, thus none of the Bush sources could speak with any
authority.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has reportedly expressed similar openness to the vice
presidency during private meetings in the past, only to back away
from them once the remarks become public. However, McCain raised
the stakes higher than ever by opening himself to the job to a
fellow candidate, a close friend of Bush's, days before the Texan
makes his choice.
</P>
<P>
   The development also puts Bush in a tough position. He carefully
maneuvered in the spring to get McCain to publicly rule out his
candidacy so that the Arizona senator's supporters would not think
Bush was snubbing him. With this latest signal, Bush is almost
certain to face questions about McCain if he bypasses the candidate
who won seven primaries and drew hundreds of thousands of new
voters to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Ridge conversation is notable for another reason: It
reflects the belief among GOP officials that Ridge has fallen out
of contention. Though he comes from a key state, his feud with the
Catholic church over his abortion-rights position apparently has
hurt Ridge's candidacy. Ridge is a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The development is also likely to increase speculation
surrounding Keating, who is viewed by many in his party as a
low-risk choice. He is a Catholic who opposes abortion, a former
FBI agent with experience in Washington at two federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   He gained national attention for his leadership after the
Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not holding my breath,'' the Oklahoma governor said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore said anew that he
has not yet decided his pick. Party sources said Warren
Christopher, head of Gore's selection effort, has been asking
Democratic lawmakers about the idea of picking former Maine Sen.
George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Others thought to be on Gore's list include House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, Florida Sen. Bob Graham and
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry.

<HEADLINE> Becton Dickinson will build new $75 million plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Neb. (AP) - Excavation work on a new $75 million
Becton Dickinson pharmaceutical plant will start in August, company
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of the $146 million in improvements planned for BD's
plants at Columbus, Holdrege and Broken Bow.
</P>
<P>
   Production at the 210,000-square-foot building, to be situated
on 33 acres of land on the eastern edge of Columbus, is expected to
begin by October 2001. Construction will continue through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based company also will transfer 260
employees from the existing Becton Dickinson plant in Columbus and
add 130 new positions by 2003, said Human Resource Manager Michael
Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   The glass syringe production at the current plant will move to
the new facility to make room for the addition of another new
product line, Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   The current plant will be renovated and additional new employees
will be hired, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   BD's Columbus plant produces various types of hypodermic
needles, syringes, stainless steel tubing, needle point grinding
and needle assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   In March Becton Dickinson announced the $146 million capital
expansion program for its manufacturing facilities in Nebraska. In
addition to the Columbus projects the plans calls for renovation or
expansion of the plants in Broken Bow and Holdrege.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said its decision to invest in Nebraska was
influenced by a Nebraska Quality Jobs Board decision granting about
$3 million in tax benefits over a 15-year period and the past
performance of BD's Nebraska plants.
</P>
<P>
   The Quality Jobs Act allows a company to keep money it would
have paid the state in employee's income taxes for up to 10 years.
In return the company must agree to create at least 250 jobs and
invest $100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A Fortune 500 company, BD employs 2,150 employees statewide and
about 20,000 people in 70 countries worldwide.

   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Four tired but jubilant Malaysian hostages
were taken by plane Friday from a remote southern Philippine island to Manila
after Muslim extremists released them from nearly three months of captivity. The
four were part of a group of 21 mostly foreign hostages kidnapped April 23 from
a Malaysian diving resort by Abu Sayyaf rebels. Six Malaysians and one German

AIDS Treatments Studied

   LONDON (AP) -- While new medicines have dramatically reduced the chances of
HIV patients developing AIDS, a new study indicates the percentage who contract
non-Hodgkins lymphoma has quadrupled since the drugs were introduced six years
ago. People infected with HIV are defined as having AIDS when their immune
systems become so weak that they get one of 26 illnesses, including non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, as well as pneumonia, brain infections and some other cancers. Experts
have known that the effectiveness of the new combination drug therapy varies

House Votes To Lift Limits on Cuba

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to allow unrestricted U.S. food
and drug sales to Cuba and let Americans freely travel there. The vote was a
major victory for farm, business and other groups trying to ease the
four-decade-old sanctions against Fidel Castro's government. With supporters
arguing that increased contacts would help weaken Castro's hold over the
communist nation, the House voted 232-186 to stop enforcing rules that limit the
ability of Americans to travel to Cuba. It then voted 301-116 to also halt
enforcement of rules banning U.S. exports there of food, and of rules limiting
sales there of American medicine.

FDA Panel OK's Implanted Hearing Aid

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans frustrated with their hearing aids may soon get
to try a new surgical implant to help them hear better. Advisers to the Food and
Drug Administration unanimously recommended Thursday that Symphonix Inc. be
allowed to sell its Vibrant Soundbridge as a treatment for the moderate to
severe hearing loss that afflicts millions. Regular hearing aids that are
slipped inside the ear magnify sound. The Symphonix implant, in contrast, takes
sound and converts it to mechanical vibrations of the middle ear bones -- the
way normal sound moves those bones.

Study: Greenland Ice Cap Is Melting

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A warming climate is melting more than 50 billion tons of
water a year from the Greenland ice sheet, adding to a 9-inch global rise in sea
level over the last century and increasing the risk of coastal flooding around
the world, a study shows. A NASA high-tech aerial survey shows that more than 11
cubic miles of ice is disappearing from the Greenland ice sheet annually, says
the study appearing Friday in the journal Science. That's equal to about 12.5
trillion gallons and is enough to raise sea level by .005 of an inch annually.

<HEADLINE> Bush Tries To Deflect Gore Attack  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush learned in his
losing 1978 congressional race the price of not responding quickly
to accusations.
</P>
<P>
   So when Vice President Al Gore came to Texas on Thursday to
blast his budget policies, Bush delivered his own ''rapid
response.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All Al Gore proves when he claims Texas has a budget shortfall
when it really has a $1.4 billion surplus is that Al Gore himself
has a serious shortfall when it comes to telling the truth,'' Bush
asserted to reporters at the state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign is now weighing whether Gore's three-hour
invasion on Thursday is taking a political toll.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's escalating attacks on Bush's budget stewardship has put
the presumptive GOP presidential nominee on the defensive -- at a
time when his focus is on selecting a running mate and preparing
for the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists see the attacks on Texas' budget problems as a
ready-made national issue heading toward the GOP convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have likened it to the 1988 presidential campaign
visit of Bush's father to Boston Harbor to ridicule
then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis's environmental cleanup
policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor and his advisers see little lasting
damage from Gore's onslaught, culminating in the vice president's
combative visit to San Antonio on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused Bush of favoring oil companies and special
interests with a $1.7 billion tax cut at the expense of the state's
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a wonderful state but I think it should be -- and I
think most people agree -- it should be a state where it's just as
easy to raise a child as it is to set up an oil right,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been focusing on reports of unanticipated
$610 million cost overruns in Texas' Medicaid and state prison
programs; and of the relatively small $84 million in the state's
so-called ''rainy day fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign was quick to counterattack, asserting that
the fund was only $8 million when Bush took office in 1995; and
that the state's multi-billion surplus makes the existence of such
a fund less relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with Gore's three-hour visit, Republican comptroller
Carole Keeton Rylander upped her estimate of the state budget
surplus to the $1.4 billion that Bush cited -- from $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''My message to Al Gore is there is no deficit in Texas. The
Texas economy is strong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Complained Gore spokesman Chris Lehane: ''She's no Alan
Greenspan; she's a Republican partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a top Bush campaign official and spokeswoman, said
in an interview that Bush still has recollections of his
unsuccessful 1978 race for the House of Representatives against
then-Democrat Kent Hance.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, a series of charges by Hance supporters --
including an unsubstantiated allegation that Bush had organized
beer parties for college students -- were not quickly rebutted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He learned his lesson in 1978 and said he would never let it
happen again,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not dispute that the state has a $1.4 billion surplus --
only that certain social programs experienced overruns.
</P>
<P>
   To which Bush responded: ''Perhaps while he is in Texas he will
also explain why he is criticizing our state, when his own federal
government has cost overruns in 37 federal offices or agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Friday planned to head to his ranch, about 90 miles
north of Austin and planned to give a tour to a group of reporters
who have been covering his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a side trip to Georgia on Saturday to attend the
funeral of the late Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a close friend,
Bush was to spend the rest of the weekend on the 1,580-acre spread
making final his selection of a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Top GOP officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
they expected Bush to make up his mind by the end of the weekend,
and to announce a choice by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has narrowed his selection to no more than two or three
remaining finalists, the GOP officials suggested.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Depot Explodes in Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Dozens of giant containers filled with
fuel exploded in Afghanistan's beleaguered capital, filling the
night sky with giant plumes of smoke and sending frightened
residents scurrying for cover, witnesses said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries in the explosion, which occurred late
Thursday, after a nighttime curfew had taken effect in the
war-ravaged capital. Kabul is under curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel burned for more than two hours. It was the second fire
to ravage Kabul's fuel market in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers of the ruling Taliban religious militia cordoned off an
entire neighborhood in the heart of the capital after the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban security guards who refused to give their names said the
explosion was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Taliban say there is no evidence of sabotage, they
have stepped up security patrols in the city in recent weeks and
announced a crackdown on ''anti-government elements,'' an apparent
reference to opposition in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are battling troops loyal to ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani on several fronts, all of them in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In July, sporadic, sometimes heavy fighting has centered outside
Baghram Air Force Base, 30 miles north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who espouse a harsh brand of Islamic law, control
about 90 percent of Afghanistan and the northern-based alliance the
remaining 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Tensions in Okinawa  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan (AP) -- The world's wealthiest nations opened their
annual economic summit on Friday in hopes of rebutting critics of
globalization and shrinking the gap between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the seven largest industrial nations -- the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- held a
series of one-on-one talks before launching formal discussions
later in the day at a new conference center here that boasts a
magnificent ocean view.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin was joining the summit Friday,
to meet with President Clinton and attend a dinner focused on
foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   In his talks with Clinton, Putin expected to lodge Russia's
strong objections to a proposed missile defense system the United
States is considering. To bolster his case, Putin made stops in
China and North Korea on his way here to pick up support from the
leaders of those countries.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' discussions were aimed at answering protesters who
took to the streets in Seattle last December, and in Washington in
April, to complain that globalization -- the increased flow of trade
and investment between nations -- helps rich countries but harms the
poorest ones.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, had another kind of complaint to address: the
anger of Okinawans who are unhappy about America's huge military
presence here. Upon his arrival early Friday, Clinton delivered a
speech to the people of Okinawa, and promised to ''reduce our
footprint on this island'' by completing a 27-step process of
consolidating U.S. bases on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take seriously our responsibility to be good neighbors, and
it is unacceptable to the United States when we do not meet that
responsibility,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of demonstrators shouted ''Get rid of the bases!''
while Clinton visited the Cornerstone of Peace memorial Friday, but
were kept far away from the president. The day before, tens of
thousands of demonstrators formed a human chain around a major U.S.
air base on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, similar to the Vietnam memorial in Washington, is
inscribed with the names of 237,318 people -- soldiers and civilians
on both sides -- who died during the battle for Okinawa, one of the
fiercest of World War II. He walked alongside the memorial's black
walls, with daughter Chelsea following behind; first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton stayed home to campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Okinawa after nine days of tense negotiations
over the Middle East at the Camp David presidential retreat in
Maryland, and aides suggested that Clinton might cut his stay short
to hurry back to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit Okinawa since
Dwight Eisenhower made a one-day stop in 1960. The United States
returned these southern islands to Tokyo's control in 1972 but
still retains a high military profile, with 26,000 troops stationed
here and bases occupying about 20 percent of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   While the local economy benefits from the American presence,
Okinawans are angry about crimes ranging from thefts and assaults
to rapes and killings. Tens of thousands protested five years ago
when three U.S. servicemen abducted and raped a 12-year-old girl.
Days before Clinton's visit, a drunken, 19-year-old Marine was
arrested for allegedly breaking into a local home and climbing into
bed with a sleeping schoolgirl.

<HEADLINE> Gray Fails in Bid for Olympic Team  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Johnny Gray's bid to make history is
over, and so is his illustrious career.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Gray, the American record-holder for 800 meters,
was trying to make a record-tying fifth Olympic team Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disastrous effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I quit,'' Gray said. ''I'm officially retired. I'm ready to go
to Masters tomorrow. You'll never see Johnny Gray line up at this
stage of competition again.''
</P>
<P>
   After leading for 500 meters, the leg-weary and ailing Gray
faded so badly he finished last in his first-round heat at 1
minute, 53.21 seconds -- more than 10 seconds slower than his record
of 1:42.60.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive time he ran over 1:50 since
straining a calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gray's downfall, the crowd of 23,124 at Sacramento
State's Hornet Stadium gave him a rousing ovation, aware of his
numerous accomplishments over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Gray responded by taking a reverse victory lap and throwing his
shoes that he wore in winning last year's Pan American Games into
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, an Olympian in 1984, '88, '92 and '96, was attempting to
tie Carl Lewis for most appearances by a male on U.S. track and
field teams. If Gray had made it, he would have been the first to
compete in five games. Lewis missed the 1980 Olympics because of
the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Games.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's only medal was bronze in the 1992 games. He also has won
seven national championships and two Pan American Games gold
medals, the first in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his career is at an end.
</P>
<P>
   There were only two finals Thursday night -- Pascal Dobert, the
1998 and 1999 national champion, won the 3,000 steeplechase at
8:15.77, the fastest by an American this year, and Breaux Greer,
who finished third at the '96 trials but missed the Olympic
standard by one inch, took the men's javelin at 266 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Dobert swept past five-time U.S. champion Mark Croghan off the
final hurdle and won by three meters. He missed Henry Marsh's
trials record of 8:15.68 by only 0.09 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Croghan, runner-up at 8:16.20, was more concerned about his
10-month-old son, who has been hospitalized for six weeks with a
congenital heart defect and is in intensive care. The youngster has
had two surgeries and a stroke, and is wearing a pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's doing very well,'' Croghan said. ''He's had a good week.
He went out in a stroller today.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough, but the fact that he started to turn things around
just before I came here helped.''
</P>
<P>
   As of now, Greer, who has only met the Olympic ''B'' standard,
will go to Sydney, because only one American - U.S. record-holder
Tom Pukstys -- has met the ''A'' standard in the javelin. However,
if another American reaches the ''A'' standard of 269-0, Greer will
miss out again.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Deal is enjoying his final year of competition in the
hammer throw, especially the trials so far.
</P>
<P>
   Less nervous than he was four years ago, Deal unleashed a throw
of 245 feet, 11 inches, leading the qualifiers into Friday's final.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve the tension, Deal, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist,
went to Europe before the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to make this meet less nerve-wracking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Deal has been the best hammer thrower and
35-pound weight thrower in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He has won six national hammer throw titles and been a
three-time Olympian. He's won two Pan American Games titles and
been a two-time silver medalist at the World Cup and once at the
Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Indoors, he owns the world record in the weight throw and has
won 12 national indoor titles, more than any other athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Deal opened the qualifying at 232-5, only six inches short of
the automatic qualifying distance, then got it on his second
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McMahon, the 1997 U.S. champion and 1999 Pan Am silver
medalist, was the only other automatic qualifier at 235-5.
</P>
<P>
   The decathlon began in hot, humid conditions, and without Dan
O'Brien, the world record-holder and Olympic champion who withdrew
because of a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's heir apparent, Chris Huffins, opened a 100-point lead
after the first five of the 10 events -- the 100, long jump, shot
put, high jump and 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins, the 1998 and 1999 U.S. champion and 1999 World
Championship bronze medalist, ran the fastest time, 10.45, in the
100; had the best long jump, 25-10; was second in the shot put at
47-11, tied for third in the high jump at 6-11, and ran the fourth
fastest 400, 48.64. That gave him 4,563 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark sisters -- Hazel, 22, and Joetta, 37 -- won their
opening-round heats in the women's 800. Hazel was timed in 2:01.78
and Joetta 2:02.18, the two-fastest times.
</P>
<P>
   Their sister-in-law, Jearl Miles-Clark, already a member of the
400 team, finished second to Hazel at 2:02.07.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the men's 400
hurdles who has been plagued by depression, insomnia and paranoia
in recent years, advanced to Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Looking anything but like the smooth, graceful hurdler who won
at Atlanta four years ago, Adkins finished second in his
opening-round heat at 49.84. Eric Thomas, last year's Pan Am silver
medalist, had the fastest time in the first round, 49.25.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Price-Smith, a 21-time national champion indoors and
outdoors, led the qualifying for Friday's women's shot put final at
57-4&AMP;frac34;.
</P>
<P>
   Vanitta Kinard, a former Big 12 champion from Kansas State, led
the qualifiers in the women's triple jump with a career-best 45-4&AMP;frac14;.
Sheila Hudson, the American record-holder and two-time Olympian,
also qualified for Saturday's final at 44-6&AMP;frac14;.

<HEADLINE> Els Takes British Open Lead  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- Lounging in his hotel room, Ernie
Els was doing a little light homework when he spotted a disturbing
trend on television.
</P>
<P>
   With a late tee time, Els tuned into the BBC to check out pin
placements and see how balls were bouncing on the quirky Old
Course. What he saw was Tiger Woods, finishing with a 67 for the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Before hitting a shot, the Big Easy knew he had a tough task
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see Tiger 5 under and you haven't even started the round,
you know you got your work cut out,'' Els said.
</P>
<P>
   Els knew that feeling well. He was beaten by Woods in a playoff
earlier this year and finished second to him in the Memorial and
U.S. Open. At Pebble Beach, he had the dubious distinction of
playing with Woods down the stretch -- and finished a whopping 15
shots back.
</P>
<P>
   But for one sunny day at St. Andrews, at least, Els had the
upper hand. A birdie on the treacherous Road Hole was his eighth of
the day, and his 6-under 66 gave him a one-stroke lead over Woods
and Steve Flesch after the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he beats me by 15 from now, there should be an inquiry,''
Els said.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of inquiries after Els came in under
lengthening shadows to join 77 others who matched or broke par
under benign conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Most, though, were about Woods, whose seemingly effortless round
gave him a streak of 44 straight major championship holes without a
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a little unfair,'' Els protested. ''I just shot 66,
talk about my round or just get on the phone'' with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The questions continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not right now,'' Els pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   The questions could be expected, after Els emerged once again as
the main hope to challenge Woods' attempt to complete his career
Grand Slam with a win at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he didn't have help, however. Favorable conditions and
light winds left some pretty big names bunched under par within a
few shots of Els and the lurking presence of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Winless left-hander Steve Flesch, in his first Open, was tied
with Woods, but just behind were Tom Lehman and Sergio Garcia at 4
under. At 2 under were six winners of major titles, including
Justin Leonard, Nick Faldo, Vijay Singh and Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''Has anybody ever heard of him before?'' Flesch joked when
asked about Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Woods spent much of the first day atop the leaderboard, thanks
to his early tee time and a stretch of five birdies in seven holes
after making pars on the first eight holes.
</P>
<P>
   He did nothing spectacular, but everything right, serving notice
that the 15-8 odds local bookies had on him might be just about
right.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of loose shots,'' Woods said, adding ''We're in a
major championship, so anything in the red (under par) is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite as good as at Pebble Beach, where Woods was the only
one to finish under par in a historic blowout.
</P>
<P>
   If the first round was any indication, though, this Open won't
turn into a rout. Unless the wind blows, there are too many players
already under par, and too many good scores still to be had.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are playing well, the course is there for the taking,''
Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   Notah Begay thought so, until he found Jean Van de Velde-like
trouble on No. 17, the treacherous Road Hole that played much like
a par-5 to the field even without much wind.
</P>
<P>
   Begay, Woods' roommate at Stanford and winner of four
tournaments in the last 10 months, was 7 under and leading the
tournament when he hit a drive into the deep rough and put an iron
into even deeper rough.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get out, he twisted a wedge into water well left of
the green. He went in like Van de Velde did at Carnoustie last year
on his ill-fated 18th hole, and hit the ball out of the hazard.
Still, his triple bogey and subsequent bogey on 18 left him at 69.
</P>
<P>
   ''I acknowledge the fact that the hole has had me by the tail,
and I just approached it that way, and one thing led to another,''
Begay said. ''Before I knew it, I was getting wet and getting out
of the burn and trying to make a 3-footer for seven.''
</P>
<P>
   And having no regrets about it, unlike Van de Velde, who told
Begay once that his biggest regret was he didn't try to hit it out
of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ain't going to walk away having any regrets,'' Begay said.
''I am either going to make 6 or 7, or 8 or 9.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Primed for Tour Victory  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREIBURG, Germany (AP) -- Even Lance Armstrong now admits what
everyone else in the Tour de France has said for a week: The only
way he won't repeat as champion Sunday is if he suffers a
disastrous crash between now and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview with American correspondents prior
to Friday's individual time trial, the 28-year-old cycling
sensation said his closest challenger, Jan Ullrich of Germany, was
just too far behind.
</P>
<P>
   And though he cautioned that ''if you crash, the race isn't
over,'' Armstrong sounded a lot like a man who had already crossed
the Champs-Elysees finish line on top for the second time in as
many years.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was finding this year twice as sweet, partly because
he had gotten the better both of Ullrich, the 1997 champion, and
Italian star Marco Pantani, the 1998 winner who withdrew earlier
this week after failing to beat Armstrong in the final mountain
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a vindication. Last year was very special in
many ways, but I also knew that Ullrich and Pantani weren't
there,'' Armstrong said. ''I couldn't control that. I just had to
cycle my race. But they were both critical of my performance -- and
I thought a lot about that all through the winter and spring,
through May and June, and through the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong said he could well have ended up chasing
Pantani for winner's honors this weekend had the Italian not made
such a recklessly aggressive start to that last grueling mountain
stage Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He attacked early simply to destroy our team,'' said
Armstrong, the captain of U.S. Postal, the only American-sponsored
team in the 20-team field. ''He could have been standing on the
winner's podium this Sunday if he'd held back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Ullrich 5 minutes, 37 seconds behind, Friday's
36.5-mile time trial from Freiburg to Mulhouse, France, presents
the German all-rounder with his last clear chance to bite into
Armstrong's lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong still holds almost all the cards and can afford to
play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   As the overall leader, Armstrong races last, right after
Ullrich, and so will be able to tell if he's keeping up with the
German's pace, with time measurements at the 12-mile and 24-mile
marks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe I can win this stage,'' said Armstrong, who came
first in four of last year's 21 stages -- including both time trials
-- but has yet to win any this year.
</P>
<P>
   If he's ahead of Ullrich at the first time check, Armstrong said
he would push for outright victory. But if he's behind by much,
''I'll stay conservative because I know I'm not going to win the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   He raised the risk of crashing into a spectator, scores of whom
accidentally got in the way of riders in Thursday's race from
Switzerland to this German university town on the edge of the Black
Forest. He said the dangers of collision could increase Friday,
with more fans expected to crowd around a particularly high-speed
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a long time trial,'' he said. ''So you have to be
careful, especially since you're coming in a little tired as we all
are. ... In these towns, coming round corners can be dangerous if
you're not on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The 87th Tour de France concludes this weekend with a mostly
flat 158-mile race Saturday to the west, then -- following a
late-night transfer by Orient Express train to their Paris hotels --
a largely ceremonial final 85.5-mile dash within the French
capital.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Sign Plaxico Burress  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- Plaxico Burress signed the richest rookie
contract in team history, threw on a jersey and a pair of shoulder
pads and immediately began helping the Pittsburgh Steelers solve a
2-year-old mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Were the problems with their passing game the result of who was
throwing the ball, or who was trying to catch it?
</P>
<P>
   Burress is considered a rarity among receivers for his
combination of size (6-foot-5&AMP;frac12;) and playmaking ability (20 TD
catches at Michigan State the last two seasons), and he didn't take
long to make an impression.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing the first three days' worth of practices and
meetings, he stepped onto the field less than two hours after
signing a five-year contract worth a minimum of $8.67 million and
started catching everything thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kordell Stewart, whose problems the last two seasons
were partially the result of an inefficient receiving corps,
certainly liked what he saw -- and what he didn't see. Namely,
dropped passes and incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I called my agent and said, 'Man, let's get it on,''' Stewart
said, referring to Leigh Steinberg, who represents Burress and
Stewart. ''I'm happy he's in here now and getting some work in.''
</P>
<P>
   In only one practice, Burress was already drawing comparisons to
other top receivers. Stewart compared him to Michael Westboork.
Offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride likened his style to Haywood
Jeffires. Wide receiver Troy Edwards compared him to -- dare he say
the name -- Randy Moss?
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Plaxico in minicamp and it surprised me he can move that
well for his size,'' said Edwards, whose $6.5 million, five-year
deal previously was the highest for a Steelers rookie. ''To me, he
is a bigger Randy Moss.''
</P>
<P>
   With two first-round draft picks at receiver, Edwards predicted
what was an underachieving Steelers receiving corps the last two
seasons will soon be ''the best in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you double me, Plaxico can kill you,'' Edwards said. ''If
you double Plaxico, hopefully I can do something. I think we should
be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Burress wouldn't go that far, but said, ''I've always been
confident in my abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a big-play receiver who can do something with the
ball after he catches it, the Steelers didn't wait until Burress
arrived in training camp to reshape their offense around him.
</P>
<P>
   They moved Edwards from split end, where he caught 61 passes
last season, to flanker so Burress can play split end.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's rare to see a guy as big as he is also be as athletic as
Plaxico is,'' Gilbride said. ''When the ball is in the air, he
adjusts easily, and some guys just can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers are counting on Burress' ability to get into the
end zone to revitalize Stewart, whose career is at a crossroads. He
threw 21 touchdown passes to mostly veteran receivers in 1997, but
had only 17 TD passes the last two seasons as the Steelers slumped
to records of 7-9 in 1998 and 6-10 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kordell had my number on his speed dial, telling me, 'Let's
get this deal done,''' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Burress also was anxious, having arrived in Pittsburgh a week
ago Thursday. He spent most of the that time staying at a downtown
hotel under an assumed name, trying to fit in personal workouts
while running up a considerable room service bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried about what I missed (in three days) in
training camp,'' Burress said. ''I just want to catch up as quickly
as I can and come in and put myself in a position to make an impact
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides a $5.5 million signing bonus, the Steelers agreed to pay
Burress an additional $900,000 by March 1 that won't count against
their salary cap until next year. The only requirement is that
Burress still be on their roster.
</P>
<P>
   Burress' base salaries are $422,000, $303,000, $408,000,
$514,000 and $620,000, with incentives of $1.03 million this
season, $1.2 million in 2002, $1.5 million in 2003 and $2.0 million
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Because the NFL counts easily obtainable bonuses against the
salary cap, the incentives were structured so they don't fall into
the category but are very close to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If participating in 35 percent of the plays is easily
obtainable, we wrote it to be 36 percent,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers vice president Art Rooney II stayed up with Steinberg
until nearly 1 a.m. Thursday to get the deal done.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt strongly we wanted the fifth year, and that required
some creativity to craft something,'' Rooney said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Hire Isiah Thomas As Coach  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers have replaced one Hall of
Fame member with another on their bench.
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas was hired Thursday to make his coaching debut with
the Pacers, a route Larry Bird took three years ago that ended this
year with a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 6 of the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I go again, following in his footsteps,'' Thomas said of
Bird. ''Everything I learned about winning in the NBA came from
basically two people -- Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird decided three years as a coach was enough, even though they
were the most successful seasons for Indiana since the Pacers
entered the NBA in 1976. Thomas was apparently the choice of Pacers
president Donnie Walsh ever since Bird left on June 19, although
the selection was stalled due to Thomas being the owner of the
minor league Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel he's got the leadership, intelligence and determination
to be successful as an NBA coach,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas reportedly signed a four-year, $20 million contract, but
he and Walsh declined to discuss terms. He plans to get to work
immediately, heading to Boston where the franchise's summer league
team is playing this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''My greatest gift that I have in life is basketball. It's
something that I've been blessed with in terms of being able to
play the game, and also being able to understand the game,'' Thomas
said. ''Not being able to exercise that gift over the last couple
of years, I really found a void in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas arrived in Indianapolis on Wednesday. He and Walsh
insisted they had no agreement until early Thursday evening despite
frequent reports that he had been offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some obstacles and some hurdles to overcome. Neither
one of us were sure that we would overcome those obstacles, but
through the diligence of the lawyers and the creative brainpower of
everyone we came up with some solutions,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting a staff and meeting or talking with his players,
including six who are now free agents and can sign with other teams
on Aug. 1 are immediate priorities for Thomas. The list includes
starters Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson, Rik Smits and Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I've said to Donnie is I would like for him to assist me
in making sure that we hire the right assistants and that I bring
the right type of staff and personnel together,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd like to mix the team's younger players with its
veterans to become a more versatile team that plays ''more
up-tempo'' with a lot of defensive pressure to create turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Harter, an assistant under Bird who was also an assistant
when Thomas was playing for the Detroit Pistons, may be re-signed
by the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to sit down and talk with Dick. Dick and I have a
long relationship. We knew each other in Detroit and I have a great
tremendous respect for him,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bird, Thomas becomes a coach after compiling impressive
marks in 13 years as an NBA player, 12 as an All-Star. Four years
ago, he was selected as one of the league's 50 greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was told by NBA officials that he had to sell his
ownership of the Phoenix-based CBA, a nine-team developmental
league, to accept any NBA coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Thomas paid off part of the $750,000 he owed
former team owners -- one of the last obstacles before he could
coach the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who bought the CBA in October for $10 million, has
worked out a plan which will allow him to quickly divest himself
and begin coaching duties with Indiana immediately. Thomas has
reportedly signed a letter of intent to sell the league to the NBA
Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA spokesman could not immediately say whether the league
office had approved the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers general manager David Kahn said a procedure had been
worked out allowing Thomas to divest himself from the CBA before
the team opens training camp in October, even if the deal with the
Players Association fell through.
</P>
<P>
   ''The combination of Isiah Thomas and his willingness to divest
himself from the CBA, and David Kahn's working it out ... has
basically allowed this moment to take place,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn declined to be specific about the specifics of the
divestment, but said he was satisfied that there is a procedure in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a real surprise to me that they did it this quickly. I'm
extraordinarily surprised,'' said Jay Frye, a former owner of the
CBA's Fort Wayne Fury.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no idea what the (divestiture) agreement is,'' Frye
said. ''He (Thomas) still owes us a lot of money, so we're
interested to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas's link to Indiana goes back more than 20 years, to when
he was recruited out of his hometown of Westchester, Ill., to play
for Bob Knight at Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand how special a place Indiana is with its
basketball tradition in terms of its basketball heritage,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who averaged 16.0 points as a sophomore when he was a
first-team All-America and led the Hoosiers to the NCAA title
before passing up his final two years of college eligibility, was
uncertain what type of coach he will be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a process that we'll all watch to see what kind
of coach I'm going to be. I can honestly tell you I don't know what
kind of person is going to come out of me once I get on the
sideline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas retired as a player after the 1994 season with 18,822
points, 9,061 assists and 1,861 steals -- all Pistons records --
along with NBA championship rings in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 19.2 points and 9.3 assists over his NBA career. He
then became vice president and part-owner of the Toronto Raptors
and more recently worked as an NBC analyst on NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   He was voted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in May and will be
inducted in October.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denounces Player's Defection  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The chase apparently began as soon as Andy Morales
stepped ashore in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban baseball player landed near Key West on Tuesday with
eight others and was released to family members Thursday evening
after his immigration paperwork was processed at the office of U.S.
Catholic Conference Migration and Refugee Services.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, dressed in sneakers, dark-green jogging pants and a
T-shirt when he stepped out of a white van, kissed his fingers and
touched the ground in Florida as he was transported to a county
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Gus Dominguez, followed the van in a white Cadillac,
cell phone in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the way over here, we got three phone calls from major
league teams, wanting to confirm that Andy was here, and asking us
to call them,'' Dominguez said, declining to name the teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was Morales' second attempt to reach the United States. After
picking him up at sea last month, the U.S. Coast Guard sent Morales
back to the communist island. But he was allowed to stay in the
United States this time because he reached American soil, even
though U.S. authorities said he was brought in by illegal alien
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy to be here. I am just very nervous from the trip,''
Morales said Thursday after being examined at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, 24, said he would hold a news conference Friday. He was
planning to stay in Miami with his father-in-law, Carlos Castillo,
while he pursues his baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' wife Daiyana and their 7-month-old son remain in Cuba
awaiting approval from that government to leave for the United
States, said Rene Guim, a publicist for Dominguez.
</P>
<P>
   A third baseman, Morales caught the eye of baseball fans when he
hit a home run in Baltimore last year in the Cuban national team's
12-6 victory over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks to join other Cuban national team members who have
defected to play baseball in the United States. They include New
York Yankees pitcher Orlando ''El Duque'' Hernandez, his half
brother, San Francisco Giants pitcher Livan Hernandez, and New York
Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' U.S. arrival came in the midst of a campaign by Fidel
Castro's government against the Cuban Adjustment Act, a U.S. law
passed in 1966 at the height of the Cold War. It allows any Cuban
who reaches American soil to avoid deportation and apply for
permanent residency after a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows the immorality and the criminality of the killer
Cuban Adjustment Act,'' Lazaro Barredo, a journalist for the weekly
communist workers newspaper, Trabajadores, said on Cuban
television.
</P>
<P>
   The Castro administration blamed that law for the international
custody dispute over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who returned to the
island last month after his Miami relatives lost their seven-month
legal battle to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When Morales was repatriated to Cuba after his first attempt to
reach the United States, he asked for and was promised a job with
the government's Cuban Sports Institute, the institute's president
Humberto Rodriguez said Thursday as Castro sat in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''We assured him that what he asked for, he would have,''
Rodriguez said. However, Rodriguez said authorities wanted to watch
his attitude before deciding whether he would again play on Cuba's
national team.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' father, Adelso Morales, has said that his son was
depressed by the decision to bar him from playing again in
international events as part of the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was his reply to the fact that they no longer were giving
him opportunities to play international games,'' Andy Morales'
mother, Magdalena Leon, told Associated Press Television News in
the ballplayer's hometown of San Nicolas de Bari, outside Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was frustrated that they considered him a mediocre player,
which he is not,'' the mother added.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials had insinuated after his first attempt to
leave Cuba that Morales was not a great player. Those insinuations
continued this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily, here there are 10 third baseman who are equal to or
better than Andy Morales,'' Cuban television journalist Reinaldo
Taladrid said on the government broadcast Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Meg Mallon Takes Women's Open Lead  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. (AP) -- Laura Davies had to wonder what she'd done
to tick off Meg Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   There she was, minding her own business as she stood on the 13th
fairway, when Mallon fires her tee shot right over Davies' head.
From the 14th hole.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't some errant shot, either. Mallon MEANT to do this.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like that's a better way to play the hole,'' Mallon
said. ''But it certainly shocked them when I did that. Especially
when I hit it right over Laura Davies' head. They weren't quire
sure what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   What she was doing Thursday morning was being creative. On a day
when swirling winds and nasty rough turned beautiful shots into
bogeys, Mallon found a way around one of the toughest holes at the
U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   She also just happened to have the best round of the day, firing
a 4-under-par 68. Karrie Webb, who's already won one major this
season, is one stroke back after birdies on two of her last three
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Australian Shani Waugh is also at 3-under 69. Juli
Inkster, trying to become the first player to successfully defend
two majors in the same year, bogeyed her final hole and finished
with a 70.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam, who won her last two starts, had a 73.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I don't think that was probably something that I needed
to know,'' Webb said when told about Mallon's antics. ''I played it
from the middle of the fairway and hit a wedge on the green. I'm
not even going to think about where she hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, since Webb made par on the hole. But there could be
plenty of others playing backwards on the 406-yard, par-4 after
they hear what Mallon did. Especially after the woes most players
had there Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The hole was the second toughest of the day, with a scoring
average of 4.48. It was the undoing of at least one player, as
Dottie Pepper put two shots in the water and ended up with an 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's the smart way to play that hole. It takes all
the trouble out of play,'' said Beth Daniel, who played with Mallon
in the practice round when she and her caddie concocted their
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of trouble to be found on the hole. It has such
a severe dogleg it's almost boomerang-shaped, and players can't
even see the green from the tee.
</P>
<P>
   A big pond sits to the right of the tee, and a player needs
about a 300-yard drive to take the water completely out of play. Go
straight, and there's a bunker waiting. Throw in a narrow fairway,
and it's a double- or triple-bogey waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tee shot on 14 is very severe,'' said Mallon, the 1991
Women's Open winner. ''I had hit it in the water. I hit it in the
bunker. And I felt like going over to 13 was a better option. I
thought, ''Well, I'll try it today and see how it works and then
see what the USGA does about it.' So I don't know what they are
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably nothing, said Kendra Graham, the U.S. Golf
Association's director of Women's Competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's ingenious,'' Graham said. ''Just shows you
there's many ways to skin a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mallon's detour didn't exactly give her an easy path to
the green. Her tee shot put her about 170 yards from the hole --
about the same as she would have been if she was hitting an
approach shot on 14.
</P>
<P>
   She had a straight, open shot to the hole -- as long as she
cleared the trees. There was one big oak on the left side, two more
on the right, and four smaller trees in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It actually feeds right into the green,'' Mallon said. ''You
don't have to carry a bunker, you don't have to hit it over the
water. The only thing you have is you have to hit it over a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon didn't, putting her shot about 25 feet from the hole. She
missed her birdie putt, but at least she didn't lose any strokes
like many other players did.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon isn't the first person to get creative on the course. At
the 1979 U.S. Open, Lon Hinkle used the 17th fairway as a detour
when he birdied the 8th hole at the Inverness Club.
</P>
<P>
   So many other players copied him that the USGA planted a tree to
block his way. Hinkle continued to play the shot, simply going
around the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm interested to see what the USGA does to this,'' Mallon
said. ''I don't know if they're going to put a tree up like they
did for Lon Hinkle or put up Port-A-Lets or something. Hopefully,
they won't change the way the course is and I'll be able to do that
every day.''

<HEADLINE> Voters Face Election Distractions  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voters will have plenty of distractions this
fall when the Olympics and baseball's postseason occur just as
undecided voters normally begin to focus on the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This could make it tougher to get voters' attention until the
final few weeks of the campaign, analysts say, and increase the
public focus on the presidential debates, which will still compete
with baseball's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls have suggested voter interest in the
campaigns is lower than in recent election years. One showed the
number who do not plan to watch the political conventions, about
four in 10, twice the number who said that four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''That suggests a low-interest electorate which can be readily
seduced to watch fun events in place of boring politics,'' said
Doris Graber, a University of Illinois-Chicago specialist in
political communication. ''Politicians know this and avoid
scheduling major political events in time slots that compete with
sports events. When they do, sports always wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sports fans, like 29-year-old Duane Dorsey of Whitehall,
Pa., say they have no trouble following sports and the campaign at
the same time. But Dorsey said it helps him focus on politics when
his baseball team is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I follow the Phillies, they're pretty much out of it,'' the
office manager said, adding the political campaign would be more
important to him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people are concerned about issues that go on around the
country, they will pay attention to the campaign no matter what,''
Dorsey said. ''It's a little more important than sports. It affects
everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not all Americans are as civic-minded as Dorsey.
A recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press suggested that three in 10 Americans are not convinced it
makes a difference who is elected president, with even more adults
under age 30 feeling that way. That may be a bigger problem than
competition from sports events like the Olympics, scheduled for
Sept. 15 to Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Games, which will be televised on NBC, MSNBC and CNBC, are
taking place later than usual because they are in the Southern
Hemisphere, where it will still be early spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is that these Olympics probably will not get too much
in the way of the campaigns,'' said Tom Rosenstiel, director of the
Project for Excellence in Journalism. ''I think the American public
can hold two ideas in its head if it has a mind to.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with both campaigns said their message will break
through the sports distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center said his polling
suggests interest in the elections may not pick up until October,
making this more like 1996 than 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball playoffs and World Series are that month, but
''that's always with us,'' Rosenstiel said.
</P>
<P>
   If the combination of low voter interest and sporting
distractions makes October the key focus of the campaign, that
could magnify the importance of the presidential debates scheduled
that month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you'll see more attention paid during the month of
October and particularly in the debates,'' said Norman Ornstein, a
political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a
Washington think tank. ''If you don't know the candidates, debates
become a place you can engage them side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission that schedules presidential debates had to work
hard to find openings for the presidential and vice presidential
debates because of competition from the Olympics, baseball and
prime time pro football, said John Scardino, spokesman for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''The window was from mid-September to mid-October for the
debates,'' Scardino said. ''You've got the Olympics that run from
mid-September to the end, then you've got ABC with commitments on
NFL coverage ... then you've got Rosh Hashanah, then NBC and Fox
have baseball commitments beginning in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was extremely difficult to find the dates,'' he said,
noting the presidential debates are set for Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct.
11 at Winston Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis. A vice
presidential debate is set Oct. 5 in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   For some, sports does not interfere with following the campaigns
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to make any difference to me,'' said Tammy
Helms, a 26-year-old stay-at-home mom from Pensacola, Fla., who
says she will follow the campaigns. ''I don't pay much attention to
that sports stuff. I would think men would probably pay more
attention.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is poised to send President Clinton a
Republican bill cutting married couples' income taxes for the
second year in a row. Also for the second time, it appears headed
for a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was scheduled Friday to give final approval to the
''marriage penalty'' bill that passed the House short of a
veto-proof margin a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would cut taxes for virtually all married couples,
beginning in this election year, at a cost of $292 billion over 10
years -- still pennies on the dollar of a budget surplus projected
at $2.17 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bill was a long-overdue remedy to a tax
code disparity that forces about 25 million two-income married
couples, mainly those with two roughly equal incomes, to pay more
taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no reason on earth why the president should veto this
bill,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ''I find it
fiscally responsible to let hardworking folks keep more of their
own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed more limited marriage penalty relief but
offered to sign an earlier version of the GOP bill if Congress also
passed an acceptable prescription drug benefit for Medicare
recipients. But Republicans have refused that deal.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage legislation was part of last year's $792 billion
tax cut that Clinton vetoed. Republicans are pushing through
Congress separate pieces of the larger bill in an effort to draw
clearer, election-year contrasts with Democrats on specific tax
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are rushing to get the marriage penalty bill to the
White House so that Clinton must decide whether to sign or veto it
before the end of the Republican National Convention that takes
place July 31-Aug. 3 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers reaffirmed the veto threat
in a letter Thursday to congressional leaders. He said the marriage
bill's price tag would consume surplus money that could be used for
other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said more of the tax cut would go to the 1 percent of
Americans with the highest incomes than the lowest 80 percent and
that half the money would go to couples who get a marriage tax
''bonus'' because one spouse is the main earner.
</P>
<P>
   ''The package of bills working their way through Congress would
subvert the fiscal discipline that has helped to fuel the economic
growth of the past eight years,'' Summers said. ''This is not the
time to abandon our path of fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, a compromise negotiated by House and Senate GOP
leaders, would give some tax relief in calendar 2000 to millions of
married taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this year, the bill would increase gradually the
amount of married couples' income in the bottom 15 percent tax
bracket until couples were taxed the same as two single people.
Under current law, two single people pay the lower 15 percent rate
on a greater share of their income than a married couple.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would adjust the standard income tax deduction for
married couples so that it is equal to that of two single people,
beginning with the 2000 tax year. That would increase a married
couple's deduction from $7,350 to $8,800.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would raise by $2,000 the income cap for
lower-income couples who claim the earned income tax credit. It
also would ensure through 2004 that married couples could claim
personal tax credits, such as the $500-per-child credit, without
getting entangled in the complex alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's cost over five years was estimated at $89.8 billion
because budget rules limit it to that span, which means another
Congress would have to extend the tax cuts. Without that sunset,
the five-year cost was tabbed at $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   If extended for an additional five years, however, the Joint
Committee on Taxation projected that the compromise would cost as
much as $292 billion, even more than the 10-year, $248 billion
version the Senate passed earlier this week.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   The bill is H.R. 4810.

<HEADLINE> House Opens Door for Pay Raises  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress seem on the road to giving
themselves their third cost-of-living pay raise in four years, a
$3,800 boost made less politically risky in this era of huge
projected budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   On a 250-173 procedural vote, House opponents of the boost lost
their opportunity to derail the increase Thursday. Under a law they
passed in 1989, members of Congress automatically get a raise
unless they vote to block it.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining that the issue is still a sensitive one, no
lawmakers spoke in favor of the raise during a brief debate and
only three complained about it. Rep. Ernest Fletcher, R-Ky.,
compared congressional pay with the $25,000 average he said
families in his district earn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pay raise, I believe, is inappropriate at this time,'' he
said, adding that its $2.5 million total cost is ''a lot of money
for folks back in Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2.7 percent increase would put lawmakers' salaries at
$145,100 beginning in January. By law more than 1,000 top executive
branch officials -- starting with the vice president -- would receive
the same percentage increase.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress passed a law doubling the president's current
$200,000 salary to $400,000, effective when the next chief
executive takes office. It would be unaffected by the congressional
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The law limits lawmakers' raise to less than what civil servants
will receive and less than a complex measure of employment costs.
President Clinton has recommended a 3.7 percent raise for federal
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's procedural vote came during debate on a $29.1 billion
bill financing the Treasury Department and some smaller agencies
for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1. By tradition, the Treasury
bill -- which contains no language providing the pay raise -- is used
for any attempt to block it.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved
its own $29.4 billion version of the Treasury bill by 27-0. It also
lacked any pay raise provisions, and there was no mention of the
increase during debate.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote -- which saw majorities of both parties support
the boost -- was ensured weeks ago when Democratic and Republican
leaders agreed not to attack each others' incumbents during this
year's campaigns for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   It would be lawmakers' third pay raise in the past four years
and the first they have approved during an election year since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The recent boosts coincide with a period in which the economy
has boomed and annual federal deficits have changed into
ever-growing surpluses -- now projected to total more than $2
trillion over the next 10 years. Prior to that, the last
congressional pay raise took effect in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The House's Treasury bill -- $800 million larger than this
year's, but $2.1 billion smaller than Clinton's request -- is among
a growing number of spending measures for next year that are
becoming caught up in an intensifying budget fight between Congress
and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It faces a White House veto threat because its $8.5 billion for
the Internal Revenue Service, though $261 million more than this
year, is $466 million less than Clinton wants. It also has less
than Clinton wants for some counterterrorism programs.
</P>
<P>
   It also would forbid government agencies from giving preferences
to Smith &AMP; Wesson guns when purchasing weapons for federal law
enforcement officers. Federal officials have considered doing so in
the aftermath of the gun-maker's agreement to begin using
trigger-locks and other safety steps.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the bill contains a similar reduction in
Clinton's IRS request, and has the same restriction on federal
Smith &AMP; Wesson purchases.
</P>
<P>
   A report accompanying the House bill also would require Hillary
Rodham Clinton to provide monthly reports on the travel expenses of
her New York campaign for the U.S. Senate. Republicans have
complained of taxpayer-subsidized military flights to New York,
though her aides say the first lady is reimbursing the government
for the travel at first-class rates.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Group Decries New Documents  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Documents unearthed by the Simon Wiesenthal
Center indicate that the government of Hungary notified U.S.
occupation forces in Germany in 1947 that Nazi war criminal Adolf
Eichmann was in the U.S. zone, but U.S. authorities did not respond
to the request for his extradition for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year earlier, Eichmann had escaped from a U.S. prison
camp. With the help of ex-Nazi officials, he eventually got to
Argentina in 1958. But the founder of the Wiesenthal Center
believes that if the United States would have taken the Hungarian
request seriously, Eichmann, who was in charge of the ''Final
Solution'' to exterminate the Jews of Europe, might have been found
far earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made it easier for Adolf Eichmann to live in anonymity,
and not to worry because no one was looking for him,'' said Rabbi
Marvin Hier.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, addressed to the military governor of the American
zone of Germany, requested that Eichmann be delivered to Hungary to
stand trial for participating ''with the instructions of Himler
(sic) SS commander in the liquidation work of the Jews in
Hungary.'' It was sent on April 23, 1947, by Stephan Ries, the
minister of justice in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   A reply to the letter, dated May 15, 1951, was sent by the
president of the U.S. extradition board, which was responsible for
sending war criminals to other nations for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The response stated that the request for extradition was denied,
because a ''definite address'' was not provided, and more details
of the alleged crimes were needed. ''The material submitted in this
case does not meet the technical requirements required,'' the
letter read.
</P>
<P>
   Hier said the letter showed ''callous disinterest'' on the part
of the U.S. government, and that it was because Hungary was a
communist country.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the United States to sit on this information,'' he said,
''just because the country was communist, is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wiesenthal Center historian said that since the Nazi threat
disappeared after the war, and the United States was more concerned
about the Soviets, American officials ''wanted to get out of the
war crimes business.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Had the U.S. issued the equivalent of an all-points bulletin,
maybe more people would have been looking for him,'' said Aaron
Breitbart, senior researcher at the center. ''The reason we still
have the Nazi war criminal issue today is that the job was not
properly done a half a century ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Another historian disagreed with the center's assessment, saying
the U.S. search concentrated on Austria, Eichmann's last known
whereabouts, and that several nations, such as France and Greece,
asked for Eichmann's extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The request from Hungary was not very high on the agenda,''
said Hans Safrian, a former fellow at the National Holocaust Museum
in Washington and the author of a book on Eichmann.
</P>
<P>
   Safrian also noted that Nazi war criminals were extradited to
and later hanged in several communist nations, including Poland and
Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a common practice,'' Safrian said. ''The perpetrators
didn't like that, because they knew they would get harsher
treatment in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Safrian concurred that the long delay of the U.S.
response showed that the Americans were ''not very forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli intelligence agents eventually found Eichmann near
Buenos Aires in 1960. He was tried in Israel for his crimes against
European Jews, and was hanged in 1962. Simon Wiesenthal, for whom
the Los Angeles center is named, was involved in the search for
Eichmann and several other suspected war criminals. Wiesenthal
currently lives in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eichmann deported more than 400,000 Jewish men, women and
children just from Hungary to the death camps,'' Safrian said.
''That's the main thing.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 24
points in today's early going. Losing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a slim lead over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 30 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is down two points.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like yesterday's big rally left the market all tuckered
out.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say after the big advance, there may be little room to
move higher now.
</P>
<P>
   Further gains may be especially tricky in the high-tech sector,
after warnings about future profits from such companies as Ericsson
and Agilent Technologies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower Friday on profit taking and
some disappointing corporate earnings announcements.
</P>
<P>
   After the first 15 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 36.42 to at 10,807.45.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 31.98 at 4,152.58. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 3.63 at
1,491.84, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down
2.84 at 531.89.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently were taking a breather after Thursday's
run-up, sparked by encouraging remarks from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and strong IBM earnings. The Dow on
Thursday rose 147.79 at 10,843.87 and the Nasdaq gained 128.93 to
close at 4,184.56.
</P>
<P>
   A few earnings disappointments added to Friday's selling. One
was from Agilent Technologies, the test and measurement spinoff of
Hewlett-Packard, which late Thursday said it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to fall way short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ericsson AB, the world's largest maker of cellular-phone
and telecommunications equipment maker, said early Friday that
third-quarter profits will fall below the first- and second-quarter
levels.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved lower Friday as investors took
profits from Thursday's rally and digested some corporate earnings
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 65.82 at 10,779.51.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 4.31 at 1,491.16, and the Nasdaq composite index was down
29.51 at 4155.05

</P>
<P>
   A few earnings disappointments added to Friday's selling. One
was from Agilent Technologies, the computer products maker spinoff
of Hewlett-Packard, which late Thursday said it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to fall short of expectations. Shares of
Agilent fell $26.25 to $46.125 and Dow component Hewlett-Packard
fell $3.50 to $124.50.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cell-phone and telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson
said third-quarter profits will fall below the first- and

</P>
<P>
   Other companies reported some positive earnings results,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter earnings surged 75 percent for Sun Microsystems,
which easily surpassed Wall Street expectations amid heavy demand
for its Internet hardware and software. Sun rose $7.625 to
$105.688.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dow component Eastman Kodak met Wall Street's

<HEADLINE> FCC Mulls Telecom-Disabled Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stuck at a Chicago airport recently, Pam
Holmes wanted to call her sister who also was in the area. But
Holmes, who is deaf, had trouble figuring out how to reach a
special local operator who could relay a text message.
</P>
<P>
   She's among millions of speech- and hearing-impaired people who
could benefit from the creation of a three-digit number -- 711 -- to
make it easier to reach special operators who convert calls to text
messages. The Federal Communications Commission was planning to
require such a code Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new 711 code ''presents an opportunity not to have missed
opportunities,'' said Holmes, of Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also planned to set aside other three-digit numbers: 511
for drivers seeking local traffic information, and 211 for needy
people trying to reach nonprofit groups that provide food, shelter
or crisis counseling.
</P>
<P>
   It would be up to local governments and charities to work out
how to implement, and pay for, the new numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its efforts to extend communications services to the
disabled, the agency also is expected to require broadcasters and
cable companies to provide some voice narration of the action in TV
shows in their biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tried to address every aspect of the virtual world and
make it accessible,'' FCC Chairman William Kennard said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a downtown city sidewalk, Kennard said there was a
time when putting ramps on street corners -- called curbs cuts -- was
a big deal. But now people accept that as the norm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to get to a place in the virtual world where this is
not debated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV plan, broadcasters affiliated with NBC, ABC, Fox and
CBS in their largest markets initially would have to provide
several hours per week of described prime time and/or children's
programming. Large cable operators and satellite companies would
have similar obligations for a set number of their channels.
</P>
<P>
   In the service, descriptions of events are squeezed into the
natural pauses already in the program. For example, television
audiences would be told that a character is running down the street
or hugging a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, this would be done using a separate audio track that
audiences could switch on or off. All sets made since 1993 can
receive this secondary soundtrack channel.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters has said that it would
cost stations more than $160,000 to implement the plan and the
cable industry believes the market could address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no consensus on this matter even within the affected
interest community,'' said David Beckwith of the National Cable
Television Association. ''We think this is an area best left to
industry efforts, not government regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also is expected to set standards to ensure that
closed captioning for the deaf is available to people using digital
TVs.
</P>
<P>
   The 711 code will consolidate dozens of toll-free numbers now in
use and provide hearing people who want to call a deaf person a
single number they can easily associate with the service -- like 411
for information or 911 for emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, now part of Verizon Communications, already has
rolled out 711 service throughout most of its 13-state Northeast
region.
</P>
<P>
   The company tracked its results in Maryland and found ''a
dramatic increase in the number of hearing users who were dialing
through relay just because it was easier,'' said Richard Ellis,
director of strategic alliances for Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   The relay service center received 18 percent more
voice-initiated calls and 10 percent more total calls over a
seven-month period.

   ''We have a typical summer Friday with profit taking and low

But he thinks the tone of the market will still be positive in the

<HEADLINE> Mini Heart Pump Recipient Goes Home  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The first person to have a new type of miniature
heart pump successfully implanted to keep her blood flowing while
doctors searched for a replacement is back home after undergoing a
heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Spiller, a 52-year-old retired financial analyst, spoke
between tears Thursday as she described her joy over her improved
health.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just real happy to be here today,'' she said. ''I just
knew I had to come through this after all the support my family and
the doctors had given me.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep her alive until her transplant, the Jarvik 2000 left
ventricular assist device was implanted in Spiller's failing heart
on April 10, after her physicians gained approval from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials with the
device.
</P>
<P>
   The battery-operated device is about the size of a wine cork and
fits directly into the heart's left ventricle. When the heart can
no longer pump properly, the tiny turbine pushes oxygenated blood
throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   The implantation of the device brings scientists closer to the
goal of finding an alternative to a heart transplant. For now, the
FDA has approved study of the pump only as a bridge to transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Two other patients with end-stage heart failure have been
implanted with the device and are waiting for donor hearts to
become available. Another two had the device implanted on an
emergency basis; both died shortly after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Spiller, whose heart trouble dates back to 1987, had the implant
in her enlarged heart for 79 days. She received her heart
transplant three weeks ago and was released from the hospital July
11.
</P>
<P>
   Spiller said she is getting around just fine, and has even
cooked breakfast and washed dishes since leaving the hospital.
Before the artificial pump was transplanted, she was so weak that
she struggled to even talk.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Heart Institute, about 5 million
Americans suffer from heart failure. The ideal therapy is a
transplant, but there are only about 2,500 donor hearts available
each year. About 6,000 patients annually die before receiving a
transplant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa, Japan (AP) -- President Clinton and Russian leader
Vladimir Putin, who has been rallying worldwide opposition to
Clinton's plan to build an American defense from missiles, met
face-to-face Friday but didn't settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-minute meeting, on the sidelines of the G-8 summit of the
world's wealthiest countries and Russia in Okinawa, came after
Putin held high-profile meetings in China and North Korea and
signed up their leaders as allies in his fight against the
proposal. He fears it would leave Russia vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin issued a statement saying the two would set up
a joint U.S.-Russia center within a year for exchange of data from
systems that provide early warning in the event of a missile
launch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States and Russia underscore that continued
strengthening of global stability and international security is one
of the most important tasks today,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The two also discussed Putin's meeting this week with North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il, and Kim's reported offer to abandon his
country's missile program in exchange for help in putting peaceful
satellites into orbit, said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov told reporters that the proposal did not mean that North
Korea would receive missiles or missile technology to independently
launch its satellites. Instead, he said, the North Koreans want
other nations to launch their satellites for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If such assistance is offered, North Korea is ready to stop
ballistic missile tests,'' Ivanov said. ''It's too early to discuss
specifics, such as whether such assistance would envisage providing
funds or carrying out launches.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said that Putin gave Clinton Russian proposals on deeper
weapons cuts under the prospective START III treaty, but he
wouldn't give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. missile shield proposal has moved to center stage at
the Okinawa summit. French President Jacques Chirac said it could
trigger an arms race, and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
he was ''skeptical'' about it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said Washington's proposed missile defense
shield would protect the United States against military threats
from nations such as communist North Korea, which is heavily armed.
Washington is also considering a shield for U.S. troops in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was expected to use the issue to drive a wedge between the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. missile shield would require an amendment to the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which bans national missile defenses.
Russia already has refused to approve such a change, as proposed by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Putin met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The two agreed that Blair would visit Russia, with a time and place
to be determined later, Putin told reporters. Also, Blair said
Britain would help Russia dispose of its 40,000 metric tons of
chemical weapons, Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Scientist Seeks Asylum  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A Russian nuclear scientist who strongly
opposed his government's sale of technology to Iran has legitimate
fears about returning home and should be reconsidered for political
asylum, a federal appeals panel ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday ordered
immigration officials to again take up the case of Alexei
Chouchkov, who worked for Atom Kor, a government-funded research
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court found Chouchkov's claims of
threats and intimidation to be credible and that they rose to the
level of political persecution. The Board of Immigration Appeals
cast doubt on whether Russian government officials were behind the
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any reasonable finder of fact would be compelled to conclude
that Chouchkov was the victim of persecution such that his life or
freedom was threatened on account of his political opinion,'' Judge
Milton I. Shidur wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that the threats -- including a car theft and car
accident while Chouchkov was still in Russia, and an attack on his
mother-in-law once he left -- could not be considered coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Chouchkov was investigated for his job by the KGB, which
supervised and proposed the 1993 deal with Iran and all deals
involving nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Chouchkov said he objected to the Iran deal because Iran is a
terrorist country, and being Jewish, he did not want the nuclear
technology used against Israel. He said he told his supervisors he
would try to stop the deal, and one of them told him he would be
''very sorry about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouchkov, 43, and his wife, Natalia Kondratieva, left Russia on
a tourist visa to Germany in 1993, then fled to Argentina, where
they stayed for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Chouchkov said his mother-in-law was attacked in Russia by men
demanding to know his address after the couple arrived in the
United States in 1995. She was hospitalized for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chouchkov's lawyer, Arielle Bases, would not reveal where the
couple live.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 98; Nasdaq Falls 63  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shifted lower Friday as investors took
profits and digested some corporate earnings disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 98.29 at 10,745.58.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 12.64 at 1,482.93, and the Nasdaq composite index was down
63.28 at 4121.28
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently were taking a breather after Thursday's
strong rally, sparked by encouraging remarks from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and strong IBM earnings. The Dow on
Thursday rose 147.79 to 10,843.87 and the Nasdaq gained 128.93 to
close at 4,184.56.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a typical summer Friday with profit taking and low
volume,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co.
The tone of the market will still be positive in the days ahead
because investors are confident the Fed is done raising interest
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few earnings disappointments added to Friday's selling,
particularly in the technology sector. One was from Agilent
Technologies, the computer products maker spinoff of
Hewlett-Packard, which late Thursday said it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to fall short of expectations. Shares of
Agilent tumbled $24.125 to $48.875 and Dow component
Hewlett-Packard fell $6.625 to $121.375.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cell-phone and telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson
said third-quarter profits will fall below the first- and
second-quarter levels. Shares of Ericsson fell $2.50 to $20.063.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology losers on Friday included Intel, down $2.75 to
$140 and IBM, off $2.563 to $114.438.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good corporate earnings as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter earnings surged 75 percent for Sun Microsystems,
which easily surpassed Wall Street expectations amid heavy demand
for its Internet hardware and software. Sun rose $5.75 to $104.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dow component Eastman Kodak met Wall Street's
earnings estimates and predicted it would beat third-quarter profit
estimates as well. Shares of Kodak slipped $1.688 cents to $58.188.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 469.33 million
shares, down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.20 at 526.33.

<HEADLINE> FCC Adopts Telecom-Disabled Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators set aside new three-digit
telephone numbers Friday: 511 for local traffic information and 211
for referrals to nonprofit groups serving the needy. They also
ordered phone companies to adopt a code to reach special operators
who help the deaf make calls.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Federal Communications Commission's plan, modeled
after the 911 emergency number, drivers may someday be able to call
one easy-to-remember number to find out about congestion or
roadwork in whatever city they're passing through. Families needing
shelter, food or crisis counseling could find assistance through a
single number.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to local governments and charities to work out how
to implement, and pay for, the new numbers, so they won't be
available immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also mandated that telecommunication carriers
implement a 711 code to contact operators that relay messages
between those with speech or hearing disabilities and other
callers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its efforts to extend communications services to the
disabled, the agency also mandated that broadcasters and cable
companies provide some voice narration of the action in TV shows in
their biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tried to address every aspect of the virtual world and
make it accessible,'' FCC Chairman William Kennard said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the TV plan, broadcasters affiliated with NBC, ABC, Fox and
CBS in their top 25 markets would have to provide about four hours
per week of described prime time and/or children's programming.
Cable operators and satellite companies with more than 50,000
subscribers would have to provide the same amount of time for each
of the top five national non-broadcast channels they carry.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements take effect beginning April 2002. The
commission will later consider whether to expand the mandate to
more markets. While the measure received majority approval, two
commissioners challenged whether the agency had the statutory
authority to impose the obligations on broadcasters and others.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also ordered that details of local emergency information
contained in newscasts be made available to those who are sight
impaired.
</P>
<P>
   In the service, descriptions of events are squeezed into the
natural pauses already in the program. For example, television
audiences would be told that a character is running down the street
or hugging a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, this would be done using a separate audio track that
audiences could switch on or off. All sets made since 1993 can
receive this secondary soundtrack channel.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters has said that it would
cost stations more than $160,000 to implement the plan and the
cable industry believes the market could address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no consensus on this matter even within the affected
interest community,'' said David Beckwith of the National Cable
Television Association. ''We think this is an area best left to
industry efforts, not government regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also is expected to set standards to ensure that
closed captioning for the deaf is available to people using digital
TVs.
</P>
<P>
   The 711 code will consolidate dozens of toll-free numbers now in
use and provide hearing people who want to call a deaf person a
single number they can easily associate with the service -- like 411
for information or 911 for emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, now part of Verizon Communications, already has
rolled out 711 service throughout most of its 13-state Northeast
region.
</P>
<P>
   The company tracked its results in Maryland and found ''a
dramatic increase in the number of hearing users who were dialing
through relay just because it was easier,'' said Richard Ellis,
director of strategic alliances for Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   The relay service center received 18 percent more
voice-initiated calls and 10 percent more total calls over a
seven-month period.

<HEADLINE> Three months into MOMA strike, resolution looks no nearer  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Nearly three months after employees of the
Museum of Modern Art began their first strike in 27 years, they
seem no closer to a contract and museum management seems to be
feeling little pain - or at least not enough to force its hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although the dispute involves archivists, conservators,
curators, librarians and others not fitting the blue-collar image -
with union flyers translated into French, Italian, Spanish and
German for the museum's many European visitors - the strike has
evolved into a classic labor showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal mediator is as frustrated as we are and as I'm
sure the union is,'' said Robert Batterman, MoMA's labor attorney.
''It's gone on far longer than it should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither side seems willing to budge and each accuses the
other of bargaining in bad faith. And while management tries to
encourage workers to leave the union and return to work, the union
has put up picket lines which may complicate the museum's $650
million expansion project.
</P>
<P>
   The Professional and Administrative Staff Association, which is
a local of the United Auto Workers union, started the strike on
April 28 after working for six months without a contract. No
negotiations have been held since April 27 and no sessions are
scheduled, said Local 2110 President Maida Rosenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just refuse to negotiate and our members are hanging in
there until they get a better contract,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Local 2110, which represents 255 of the 650 museum employees,
says that museum salaries are too low, starting at $17,000, with a
median salary of $29,000. Another major complaint is job security:
The museum plans staff reductions during its expansion project, set
to begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The union also accuses the museum of trying to break up the
union through pressure tactics against activist employees.
</P>
<P>
   But MoMA lawyer Batterman paints a different picture.
</P>
<P>
   He says the museum's latest contract offer amounts to a 3
percent increase in wages and minimum salary each year for the next
three years, a better pension and dental plan, and a severance
package for any employees laid off during the expansion. It says
its wages are comparable to those at other museums across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Mitchell, a museum spokeswoman, says that while there have
been no face-to-face talks since April, both sides met with the
federal mediator in May and June. She said the museum objects to
the union demand for a compulsory union membership of the
professional staff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in stormy weather or in summer heat, staff members
pace steadfastly in front of the museum and its gift shop, passing
out leaflets and urging passersby not to enter.
</P>
<P>
   While Rosenstein asserts that gift shop sales are down and the
museum is ''relatively empty,'' Batterman says attendance is normal
and points out that 132 of the 255 union employees have returned to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstein countered that the numbers are deceptive since many
of the workers covered by union-negotiated contracts do not pay
dues and are not active in the union.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers' most undeniable success has been the cancelation or
postponement of some of the museum's summer events.
</P>
<P>
   First Run Features, a New York film distribution company,
announced that because of the strike, it was postponing an
eight-week cinema retrospective that would have started July 17. A
fund-raising concert by Sheryl Crow was canceled in May, as was the
eight-week Summergarden series by Julliard students and graduates,
which was to have begun on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   A museum statement said it ''has agreed to postpone a handful of
artist appearances, lectures, concerts, and other events out of
respect for the individuals involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum also says it's on good terms with the other four
unions representing its various workers and recently concluded
successful negotiations with the two unions for the guards and
painters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why this is dragging on so long after 27 years of stable and
peaceful labor relations at the museum is beyond my ability to
figure out,'' said Batterman.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstein echoed his frustration. ''I hope the museum will
revise its view and come to the bargaining table,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT LEE, N.J. (AP) - A Las Vegas man facing drug charges for
allegedly having $250,000 worth of marijuana in his motel room said
he needed to make money to pay off college loans.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Werner, 28, led police to his room at a Route 46 motel
Tuesday after being arrested in New York City by a narcotics task
force.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Lee detectives found 170 pounds of marijuana bundled in one
and two-pound packages wrapped in plastic. They were in two large
suitcases and most of the room's dresser drawers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't really hide 170 pounds of marijuana,'' said
Detective Lt. William Cullen. ''He put it wherever he could find a
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner told police he was supposed to deliver the drugs to two
people in Manhattan, and described himself as a simple courier,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have been unable to determine the source of the
drugs, but were able to determine that Werner brought them to
Bergen County in a car he rented in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He was ordered held at Bergen County Jail on $500,000 bail,
charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Army Meets With Hutu Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By RODRIQUE NGOWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Burundi military officers and Hutu rebel
leaders have met for the first time in their 7-year civil war to
discuss a cease-fire and the integration of guerillas into the
country's Tutsi-dominated army, a mediator said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bomani, a mediator with the Tanzanian team headed by former
South African president Nelson Mandela, said the military and
members of the rebel Forces for the Defense of Democracy would meet
again Aug. 7 to discuss a peace accord, which Mandela would like to
see signed on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Bomani said the venue for the second meeting had not yet been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's government is pressing for suspension of hostilities
before signing the peace accord, while the rebels insist that
negotiations for a cease-fire should begin only after the agreement
is signed.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the cease-fire and how to integrate the rebel
forces into the national army are still to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict erupted in October 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated the country's first democratically elected president --
Hutu Melchior Ndadaye. It has claimed the lives of at least 200,000
people, most of them civilians. Another 1.2 million have been
displaced.
</P>
<P>
   A second rebel group, Palipehutu, failed to show up for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who arrived in Arusha on Wednesday, has been overseeing
negotiations between Burundi officials and opposition leaders on a
power-sharing agreement between the country's minority Tutsis -- who
have held power since 1962 -- and its majority Hutus. The talks
began in July 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Make Colombia Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Colombia to get fresh U.S. drug-fighting
aid, President Clinton likely will have to exempt the country from
fine print that ties the money to improvements in its poor human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
   While no decision has been made, Clinton administration
officials are signaling that human rights provisions in the
Colombia package won't delay the aid, even though the State
Department rates Colombia's human rights record as poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't hold up the major objective to achieve the minor,''
said Brad Hittle, an official with the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates, who pressed to get the language in the
Colombia aid legislation, are braced for the setback of a
presidential waiver.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want the aid to go -- and there's a lot of pressure for
it to go -- the only way they can do that is by invoking the
waiver,'' said Andrew Miller of Amnesty International USA.
</P>
<P>
   Hittle said the administration wants to comply with ''the spirit
of the law'' and work with Colombia on human rights, but the top
priority is ''to get the aid flowing'' to help Colombian
authorities stop violence by guerrillas and paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the aid includes about $50 million for human rights
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is receiving the bulk of a $1.3 billion aid package
aimed mostly at helping its forces wrest control of
cocaine-producing regions from leftist guerrillas and, to a lesser
extent, right-wing paramilitaries protecting the drug trade.
Colombia is the world's leading producer of cocaine and a growing
supplier of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups have opposed the aid, fearing it will escalate the
conflict and help paramilitaries tied to the Colombian army. The
paramilitaries are accused of being the worst violators of rights
in Colombia's civil war, torturing and killing civilians they
believe linked to guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the anti-drug aid legislation requires the
State Department to certify Colombia's progress in specific areas
of human rights, such as whether soldiers accused of rights
violations were being promptly suspended and whether paramilitary
leaders were being vigorously prosecuted. The certification must be
made 20 days before money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Rights advocates say Colombia isn't close to meeting those
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just no way that the administration can certify them
with a straight face,'' said Lisa Haugaard, legislative coordinator
for the Latin American Working Group, a coalition of more than 60
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's 1999 human rights report, released in
February, described the Colombian government's rights record as
''poor.'' It said serious abuses by government forces had not
improved over the previous year, security forces were rarely held
accountable for rights violations and members of security forces
sometimes collaborated with paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paramilitary forces find a ready support base within the
military and police, as well as local civilian elites in many
areas,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver clause allows Clinton to bypass the certification
requirement if he considers it to be in the interest of U.S.
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic senators, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, wrote Clinton this week urging him not to
waive the requirement, saying the conditions ''go to the heart of
(Colombia's) human rights crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rights groups suggest the State Department might avoid
using the waiver by certifying Colombia, based on President Andres
Pastrana's commitments to improve human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has fired several top generals and recently signed
legislation making genocide and forced disappearances crimes for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The groups see those as token measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a matter of discourse. This is not a matter of
good will or nice attitudes or the right speech on human rights.
It's a question of facts,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive
director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.

has been found in Orange County, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The county plans to drop larvicide to kill mosquito eggs in all
of the county's 20,000 municipal storm drains as soon as next week
and to distribute about 30,000 containers of free insect repellent
through local pharmacies. It is the first indication the virus has
moved beyond the New York City region.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County's Health Department was preparing to declare a
public health threat on Friday, so it could obtain state and
federal funding to help defeat the virus. Also Friday, the state
Health Department announced it had evidence of nine additional
birds carrying the virus in Rockland, Westchester, Richmond and
Queens counties. The birds included six crows, two blue jays and a
sparrow. That brings the total number of birds testing positive to
29 this year.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile was fatal to seven elderly people in New York City
last summer but did not sicken scores of younger people who had the
disease antibodies in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito was one of 11 captured July 11 by a trap in the
town of Minisink. Results of the test on a type of mosquito, the
day-flying aedes japonicus, came back late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the disease in the less numerous and rural aede
japonicus means there is a good chance West Nile will show up in
the much more common culex pipiens house mosquito, said county
Health Commissioner Dr. Maxcy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   For now, County Executive Joseph Rampe doesn't favor spraying
the aedes japonicus's rural territory with pesticides.

	   WARREN, N.J. (AP) - Barringer Technologies said Friday that it
has received a contract worth up to $15 million from the Federation
Aviation Administration to supply and service additional equipment
that can detect drugs and explosives in airports.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year agreement, Barringer will install its
Ionscan trace detectors at several major U.S. airports. It will
begin delivery in the third quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Warren-based company has installed more than 425

   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - The city of Elizabeth has been awarded a
$230,000 state grant to improve the Morris Avenue business
district's streetscape.
</P>
<P>
   The grant was awarded by the state Department of
Transportation's Local Aid for Centers of Place program. The
program allocates funds for nontraditional transportation projects
in downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Morris Avenue business district serves as a gateway to the
city's Midtown area,'' said Mayor Chris Bollwage. ''This project
will provide a more positive visual experience for people entering
the city, attracting more shoppers while creating a safe and
pleasant work environment for our merchants.''
</P>
<P>
   The city intends to use $1 million from the state's Urban
Enterprise Zone program to make additional streetscape improvements
on Morris Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of new curbs, sidewalks, trees, light poles,
benches and trash cans along the avenue will begin next spring.

   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- World leaders joining President Clinton for
his final summit of wealthy industrial nations patted themselves on
the back Friday for the robust global economy but fretted that a
huge runup in oil prices could spoil the good times.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting on this island of semitropical beaches and coral reefs,
the leaders also signaled a willingness to open their checkbooks to
help underwrite any peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians. By some estimates, the cost could be upwards of $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was an upbeat farewell for Clinton, who with just six months
left in office, was the senior statesman among presidents and prime
ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Canada and
Italy. Several colleagues praised Clinton for hosting the Mideast
peace talks at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland.
French President Jacques Chirac saluted Clinton for ''his courage
and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, due to return Sunday evening to Washington, might trim
his schedule to arrive sometime earlier, White House officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there also were fresh objections to U.S. plans for a missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin renewed Russia's strong
opposition. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said, ''I'm
skeptical about it.'' Chirac said the proposed missile shield is
technically unpredictable, would cost a lot of money and could lead
to a new nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that goes in the direction of proliferation is a
bad direction,'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders gathered at the seaside Bankoku Shinryo conference
hall, built for the summit and named after the inscription on a
15th century bell, which in Japanese means ''a bridge between
nations.'' Earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien sought
relief from the heat at Okinawa's only ice hockey rink. Schroeder
toured a small island where local residents saved the German crew
of a ship wrecked in 1873.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders took satisfaction about escaping a global recession
after the 1997-98 Asian currency crisis. With the notable exception
of Japan, many of the hardest-hit crisis countries are staging
strong recoveries. Since last year, they said, prospects for world
economic growth have improved.
</P>
<P>
   However, a summit statement said, ''We are concerned about the
adverse effect on world economic growth of recent developments in
world crude oil markets.'' It is a political problem as well, with
aftershocks in the U.S. presidential race. The leaders called for
greater stability of oil markets to help insure sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   They also promised to share global prosperity with poor
countries, speeding up the process of forgiving their heavy burden
of debt or at least rescheduling payments under more favorable
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The summit countries also were expected to offer increased help
to fight AIDS in poor nations and educate the estimated 100 million
poor children not in school.
</P>
<P>
   Lael Brainard, Clinton's deputy national economic advisor, said
several leaders voiced the need to get more poor countries to a
point where they will qualify under terms set by the rich nations
for debt relief. So far, only nine of the 40 nations have qualified
but Brainard said the G-8 countries strongly supported making sure
that countries are forced to devote any money saved on making
interest payments on the debt to increasing their spending in such
critical areas as education and health.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner, the leaders questioned Clinton about the Camp David
talks and quizzed the Russian leader about his visit this week to
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said they ''warmly welcome'' the North-South Korean
summit in June, adding that they encourage the dialogue to
continue. In a statement, the leaders said: ''We sincerely hope
that such a process, including the faithful implementation of the
South-North Joint Declaration, will usher in a new era in
inter-Korean relations and reduce the tensions in the Korean
Peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement also praised South Korea's open policy towards
North Korea and Pyongyang's ''constructive attitude.'' It said the
North's reconfirmation of its moratorium on missile launches was a
''positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking later about North Korea with reporters, Chretien said,
''We are all happy that their isolation seems to be going away, but
we have to approach it in a careful way. We have to terminate the
isolation of North Korea.''

<HEADLINE> World Bank Under Fire in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Some Russian experts blame foreign aid programs
for feeding corruption and urge the World Bank and other foreign
lenders to clean up or clear out.
</P>
<P>
   These Russians say aid projects are well intentioned but
dismally executed, lining the pockets of corrupt Russian
bureaucrats and ignoring local needs.
</P>
<P>
   Aid to Russia is under scrutiny at this weekend's summit of the
world's richest nations in Okinawa. More than eight years into its
clumsy economic transition, Russia is nominally part of the Group
of Eight -- but owes huge debts to the club's wealthier members.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders insist they are doing their best to help, but say their
projects are sometimes derailed by the requirement that aid funds
travel through government channels. That opens the way for
corruption and delays, they admit.
</P>
<P>
   The latest target of Russia's foreign aid frustration is the
World Bank, already under increasing pressure from opponents in
Washington. The bank is smarting from having to cancel a farming
loan to China this month amid criticism that it would displace
Tibetan herders and harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank has launched nearly 50 projects in Russia, worth
$11 billion, since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Initial enthusiasm for the aid has turned to exasperation for
many recipients, particularly on environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
   After an October 1994 oil spill in the Arctic region of Komi,
the bank pledged $99 million in emergency cleanup loans. As of this
month, the Russian government had disbursed only part of the money
and oil was continuing to bubble out of leaky pipelines into nearby
streams, said Greenpeace Russia spokesman Ivan Blokov.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just one example of the problem with these aid
projects. It was a very smart decision, to try to clean up that
oil. But the result was catastrophic,'' Blokov said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank said $82 million of the money has been
transferred to the Russian government -- the amount necessary to
take care of the spill -- and that the rest is being reconsidered
for other projects.
</P>
<P>
   The respected Initiative for Social Action and Renewal won a
$2.5 million grant from the bank in 1997 for conservation work at
Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater lake -- then quit the
project a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Moscow director Mila Bogdan said the government body
charged with approving and disbursing foreign environmental aid,
the Center for Project Preparation and Implementation, had refused
to release the funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was impossible to work with them. It was never clear where
the money was,'' she said. ''It makes more sense to work with
small, private donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Averchenko, the government aid center's director, said
he was under constant pressure from rival Cabinet ministries trying
to influence where foreign aid goes. But he faulted the World Bank
for paying too little attention to where its money ends up.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank has been among Russia's most eager lenders. It
granted its largest ever one-time loan, $1.5 billion, in August
1998 -- just days before a massive government debt default and ruble
crash.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the World Bank was the first lender to offer money to
Russia after President Vladimir Putin's election in March: a $60
million loan to the forestry industry.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the aid would accelerate destruction
of forests and do nothing to stem widespread illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 67 Russian scientists and activists called on the
World Bank to suspend all lending to Russia until Putin reinstates
the State Environmental Protection Committee. The activists say the
government now has no way to enforce environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank agreed in a letter Wednesday not to disburse the
loan until the government clarifies its plans. But the letter's
author, bank Vice President Johannes Linn, said the environmental
committee had done little to solve Russia's ecological woes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's decision to reorganize those services ... can
therefore be seen as an opportunity to improve natural resource
management in Russia,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Pied Piper' accused of leading children to steal food and candy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) - Children at their apartment complex
followed 20-year-old Saquan Rogers everywhere, her mother says.
</P>
<P>
   Police say she led eight of them into a supermarket and had the
children stuff $15 worth of items, including Spaghetti-O's and
M&AMP;Ms, into their pockets or backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   The group, ages 4 to 13, included Rogers' 8-year-old brother.
They were filmed by surveillance cameras at the ShopRite in the
Nathaniel Court shopping plaza, police Lt. William Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tape clearly indicates that she was pointing things out to
them,'' Ryan told The Record of Hackensack for Friday's editions.
''You can see she was telling the kids what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was charged Monday with several counts of endangering the
welfare of a child and use of a juvenile to commit a crime. She was
released without bail. The children were not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan did not return messages Friday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who identified herself as Rogers' mother told The Record
she calls her daughter the ''Pied Piper'' because children come
around the young woman to listen to music and play games.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's usually out playing tag with the kids. She's a good kid.
We're decent people,'' said the woman, whose name was not given.
</P>
<P>
   The Rogers household could not be reached for comment Friday. No
phone listing could be found for the family.

<HEADLINE> British Spies Battling Bad P.R.  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- They exposed every Nazi spy operating in Britain
during World War II, inspired the creation of James Bond and once
could boast of showing upstarts like America's CIA how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Britain's spy agencies are preoccupied with matters
far more mundane than the glory days of breaking German codes and
infiltrating the communists.
</P>
<P>
   They're chasing down top-secret computers mislaid or stolen from
their own operatives -- in one case, even placing a newspaper ad
pleading for the return of a laptop and offering a reward.
</P>
<P>
   They're also contending with books written by disillusioned
agents and trying to shore up their reputation with an increasingly
skeptical public.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the hell is happening with our spies,'' laments The Sun,
Britain's most popular tabloid. ''Have our spies totally lost the
plot?''
</P>
<P>
   The gaffes involving the internal and external spy agencies --
MI5 and MI6 -- would be enough to make even famously urbane special
agent 007 lose his cool.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a definite P.R. problem,'' said Stephen Dorril,
author of ''MI6: Fifty Years of Special Operations'' and publisher
of The Lobster intelligence journal. ''Because they are so
secretive, they can't put their successes out and the public gets a
one-sided view of their failures ... and there have been quite a
few.''
</P>
<P>
   In the space of 24 hours in March, two laptop computers
containing top-secret information went missing, sparking a security
scare and more than a few allegations that the country's spies were
beginning to resemble players in a Monty Python sketch.
</P>
<P>
   The first was said to have been snatched from an agent in a busy
London train station while he waited to buy a ticket. The second,
eventually recovered, was lost in south London after another
agent's boozy night at a tapas bar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two renegade former agents have kept up the pressure
with tales of bungled operations, posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Government efforts to hound them out of their European exiles
have failed and efforts to gag them have been widely condemned by
the British media.
</P>
<P>
   So former MI5 agent David Shayler, who also has written an
upcoming book on his days as a spy, keeps updating his allegations
on his ''Shaylergate'' Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Former MI6 spy Richard Tomlinson is accused of publishing an
Internet list of former and current spies -- a charge he denies --
and has tried to peddle a book of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, lawmakers are concerned by the blunders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes right to the heart of intelligence and security,''
said Tom King, chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence and
Security Committee. ''People risk their lives in giving the
information in the confidence those agencies will keep it
protected. If they don't, then it undermines the chances of getting
such good information in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the bad press, the agencies haven't stepped up to
publicly defend themselves, constrained as they are by a code of
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   So, in a touch of irony, the most fawning praise of late came
from a former enemy: an ex-KGB operative.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which country had the best spies, Sergei Ivanov, who now
heads Russia's influential Security Council, included the British
along with his own country's operatives and Israel's Mossad.
</P>
<P>
   ''British counterintelligence has an excellent school and
traditions. They prepare their agents very well,'' he told the
Russian weekly newspaper Argumenty i Fakty.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's spy agency dates to 1909, when the Secret Service
Bureau was formed to counter a perceived threat to Britain's naval
dominance from Imperial Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Officials created two divisions -- a home section to catch German
spies trying to steal British naval technology, and a foreign
section to send British agents abroad to dig up intelligence on
German intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the focus shifted from Nazis to communists and
Irish paramilitaries and, more recently, to drug smugglers and
international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But one constant remained: the cloak of absolute secrecy for the
agencies. It wasn't until 1994 that the British government even
acknowledged the existence of MI6.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a long time, everybody knew it existed, but nobody was
allowed to say it,'' said Mark Seaman, a historian at the Imperial
War Museum, which has an exhibit on the agencies containing
memorabilia and information that never would have passed government
censors decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Official Secrets Act, which prohibits former and
current agents from talking too openly and newspapers from digging
too deeply, remains on the books and is aggressively enforced.
</P>
<P>
   But when the spy agencies refused to reveal to Parliament
details of the spiraling construction costs of their new
fortress-like headquarters on the Thames -- citing security
considerations -- lawmakers began questioning who was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War and good prospects of a lasting
peace in Northern Ireland, Britons themselves have begun to
question whether the security services' annual $1.23 billion budget
is providing value for money.
</P>
<P>
   ''At such a time we should all rally round our security services
and be supportive,'' commentator David Robson of The Express wrote
in a tongue-in-cheek editorial. ''After all, these spies live in
confusing times. No Cold War, no malign communist bloc to save us
from, perhaps nothing much to do at all.''

<HEADLINE> Man with pellet rifle charged with murder, assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man faces charges of murder and assault after
he allegedly shot five people, killing one and blinding another,
with a high-powered pellet rifle fired from a rooftop, police said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Vache, 19, was arrested Thursday after the five-hour
shooting rampage from the roof of his girlfriend's four-story
apartment building in the East New York section of Brooklyn. Vache
has been charged with second-degree murder and five counts of
assault.
</P>
<P>
   The dead man was identified as Joffre Cedeno, 30. He was hit in
the chest with a lead pellet that nicked his aorta. Cedeno was
walking along Atlantic Avenue about 5 a.m. Thursday when he was
shot from a distance of 150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, an Ecuadoran immigrant, was described by his Brooklyn
neighbors as a kind, quiet man who worked as a laborer and left for
work very early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree began at 11:40 p.m. Wednesday, when the
sniper fired at Zi-Chan Chen, 22, hitting him twice in the back.
The victim was treated at Jamaica Hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:10 a.m. Thursday, Lee Pointer, 59, was hit once in the back
as he rode by on his bicycle. He was treated at Brookdale Hospital
and released.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m. Thursday, Walter Brown, 50, was shot in his right
eye as he walked along Atlantic Avenue. Brown, who lost the eye,
was listed in stable condition at Brookdale Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jose DeJesus, 34, was also shot by the sniper - he was hit in
the right side of his torso early Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sheds 127; Nasdaq Falls 82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shifted lower Friday as investors took
profits and digested some corporate earnings disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 126.93 at 10,716.94.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 17.26 at 1,478.21, and the Nasdaq composite index was down
82.09 at 4,102.47.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently were taking a breather after Thursday's
strong rally, sparked by encouraging remarks from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and strong IBM earnings. The Dow on
Thursday rose 147.79 to 10,843.87 and the Nasdaq gained 128.93 to
close at 4,184.56.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a typical summer Friday with profit-taking and low
volume,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co.
The tone of the market will still be positive in the days ahead
because investors are confident the Fed is done raising interest
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few earnings disappointments added to Friday's selling,
particularly in the technology sector. One was from Agilent
Technologies, the computer products maker spinoff of
Hewlett-Packard, which late Thursday said it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to fall short of expectations. Shares of
Agilent tumbled $24.75 to $48.25 and Dow component Hewlett-Packard
fell $5.437 to $122.563.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cell-phone and telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson
said third-quarter profits will fall below the first- and
second-quarter levels. Shares of Ericsson fell $2.50 to $20.063.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology losers on Friday included Intel, down $3.063 to
$139.625 and IBM, off $2.50 to $114.50.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good corporate earnings as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter earnings surged 75 percent for Sun Microsystems,
which easily surpassed Wall Street expectations amid heavy demand
for its Internet hardware and software. Sun rose $5.75 to $104.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dow component Eastman Kodak met Wall Street's
earnings estimates and predicted it would beat third-quarter profit
estimates as well. Shares of Kodak slipped $1.688 cents to $58.188.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 10 years in prison for sex attacks  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A man who admitted sexually attacking
12 teen-agers and is suspected in the killing of another was
sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison after a prosecutor said,
''It is doubtful he will be able to curb his sexual impulses when
he is released.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert DeRosario, 37, of Yonkers, who had been indicted five
times, was sentenced by Westchester County Court Judge Kenneth
Lange after pleading guilty to 12 counts of sodomy, sex abuse and
endangering a child. His victims were 13 to 19 years old.
</P>
<P>
   As DeRosario was handcuffed and led away to the Westchester
County Jail, his mother, Anne D'Ambrosio, stood in the gallery,
blew him a kiss and said, ''I love you, Bobby.'' Afterward,
trembling and weeping in the hallway, she said her son was forced
into the plea bargain because he had been linked to the killing of
12-year-old Orlandito Rosario-Maldonado.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had to take a plea,'' she said. ''How could you find a
juror, an unbiased juror? They always show that poor little boy's
picture when they show my Bobby's picture. My son was never accused
of murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found dead in January 1999, half-buried in Dobbs
Ferry off the Saw Mill Parkway. He had last been seen in
DeRosario's apartment building, and DeRosario was identified as a
suspect, although no arrests have been made. A search of his
apartment turned up a computer and other property that eventually
led to the sex charges against him and a sweep of alleged Internet
pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Robert Prisco asked the judge to sentence DeRosario
to maximum, consecutive sentences - 50 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''For society's protection, he must be sent away for a very long
time,'' Prisco said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a presentencing report, he said DeRosario had shown no
remorse for the sex crimes ''and in fact sees himself as a victim
of the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorney Vincent Lanna said DeRosario had written to
the judge to say, ''He regrets what occurred and wishes to
apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, D'Ambrosio complained about the length of her
son's sentence, noting that some other pedophiles have been
sentenced to no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Come on,'' she said. ''I know he's sick, but 10 years? Three
years, five years would have been enough.''

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Hands Over Abacha Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Switzerland has transferred $66 million to the
Nigerian government from bank accounts linked to the late dictator
Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is part of $670 million in accounts frozen by Swiss
authorities in response to the Nigerian government's search for
funds stashed abroad by Abacha, his relatives and associates.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha and his relatives are suspected by Nigeria of pillaging
the Nigerian central bank during his five-year rule, which ended
with his death in June 1998. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has said the amount sent abroad may have totaled $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Bertossa, chief prosecutor for Geneva, said Swiss
authorities decided to return the money ''several days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ede, a spokesman for the Central Bank of Nigeria, said the
money had been deposited in one of the Nigerian government's bank
accounts in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian government lawyers in Geneva confirmed the transfer had
taken place. They said some individuals whose assets were seized
had persuaded Swiss officials that their funds were legitimate and
should be unfrozen.
</P>
<P>
   About $550 million in assets linked to Abacha remains frozen in
Switzerland, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite revenue from oil, Nigeria's economy has been crippled by
corrupt military regimes that have ruled the country for all but 10
years since independence from Britain in 1960.

<HEADLINE> 3rd person admits guilt in torture of mentally disabled man  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - A third person has pleaded guilty to
torturing a mentally disabled man during a series of wild parties
in which he was taped to a chair, beaten and forced to perform
humiliating acts.
</P>
<P>
   Christol Lavary, 20, of Atlantic Highlands, admitted Thursday
that she helped shave the head of 24-year-old Eric Krochmaluk of
Middletown during a party in Keansburg on Jan. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bias assault, and faces up
to 10 years in prison under the terms of a plea agreement in which
other charges, including kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated
criminal sexual contact and making terroristic threats are to be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defendants, William MacKay, 23, of Hazlet, and Daniel
Vistad, 24, of Middletown, already have pleaded guilty under the
same arrangement. All three are scheduled to be sentenced on Oct.
13.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from her lawyer, Lavary testified she knew
''there was something not normal'' about the victim and that she
knew he didn't want to have his head shaved.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants also were accused of burning him with cigarettes,
choking and beating him and abandoning him in a wooded area.
Investigators say Krochmaluk was also beaten with a curtain rod or
towel rack, whipped with a string of wooden beads, forced to wear
women's clothing and kiss people's feet.
</P>
<P>
   The torment at the Keansburg party lasted for three hours.
Authorities have said similar attacks occurred during at least two
earlier parties in Holmdel and Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   Five others still face charges in connection with the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Government Posts $56.3B Surplus  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury, thanks to a flood of individual
income tax receipts, posted a surplus of $56.3 billion in June and
is on track to produce another record bounty for the entire fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   The government's surplus last month, announced by the Treasury
Department on Friday, was 5.1 percent larger than the $53.6 billion
surplus recorded in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's surplus was in line with the $55 billion surplus
many analysts were expecting, and the $56 billion anticipated by
the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for June totaled $214.9 billion, while expenditures came
to $158.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1,
the government is running a surplus of $176.6 billion -- far
surpassing the record $124.4 billion surplus for all of fiscal year
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the first nine months came to $1.53 trillion, while
spending totaled $1.36 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   With the expected surplus for fiscal year 2000, which ends Sept.
30, it would be the first time the government has reported three
consecutive surplus years since 1947, 1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is predicting a $224 billion surplus
for fiscal 2000, while the CBO is projecting a slightly larger $232
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the biggest spending categories were: interest on the
public debt, $75.9 billion; Social Security, $43.1 billion;
programs at the Health and Human Services Department, $36.3
billion; and military spending, $28.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from individual income tax payments totaled $100.5
billion in June, compared with $93 billion for the same month last
year. Payments from corporate taxes came to $40.5 billion, up from
$39.3 billion in June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Claims of racial incidents at state park in Westport  </HEADLINE>
sfcpngho
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) - State officials are investigating
allegations that several minority children from the Bridgeport YMCA
were exposed to racial comments and actions during an outing at
Sherwood Island State Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charges are very serious and we are taking them
seriously,'' Richard Clifford, chief of the Department of
Environmental Protection's Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Camp counselors and Puerto Rican and black children claim that a
worker at the concession stand directed a racial slur at the
preteen children.
</P>
<P>
   The people with the YMCA group are also accusing park staffers
of throwing children's belongings, left on the beach during a
picnic at a nearby pavilion, into the trash. They also accused a
park ranger of making them pick up other people's trash, including
dirty diapers.
</P>
<P>
   YMCA officials also complained the children were ordered to get
out of the water by a lifeguard who allegedly said they were
''making it dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations stem from a visit to the park by about 250 young
children on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Ernest Newton, D-Bridgeport, on Friday expressed
outrage over the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''The incident described in news stories is troubling beyond
description,'' he said. ''I will not stand for any children being
treated with bigotry and bias. Parks should be places where all
people, especially children can feel welcome and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope Hageman, president of Friends of Sherwood Island, a group
that raises funds for the park, questioned the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I understand it, this group left an unprecedented amount of
debris on the beach and the park staff was overwhelmed and the
visitors were asked to pick up the debris,'' Hageman said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Depass, Bridgeport YMCA camp director, said her group
was not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We even got some extra trash bags from one park employee, who
thanked us for cleaning everything up,'' Depass said, adding that
the children, who ranged in age from 5 to 13, were not unruly.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford said he and the DEP's Affirmative Action officer, Betty
Lirot, would interview park personnel during an onsite
investigation Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The state investigation will include taking affidavits from the
staff and meeting with YMCA officials to ''actually identify what
did occur,'' according to Clifford.

<HEADLINE> Bragman: I may oppose transportation bond act  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The former majority leader of the state
Assembly on Friday said he is ''leaning toward opposing'' the $3.8
billion transportation bond act that is set to go before voters
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bragman said he hasn't taken a definitive stance on the
issue, but added that he is ''concerned'' that the bond issue would
exacerbate New York's highest-in-the-nation debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made it very clear that we need to spend the money on
roads, bridges and mass transit. But this is about how we pay for
it,'' the Syracuse-area Democrat said. ''The debt itself needs to
be reduced rather than enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternative payment methods such as a pay-as-you-go system
rather than a bond issue would be more attractive, Bragman said. He
suggested that money from the state budget's discretionary funds,
totaling ''hundreds of millions of dollars'' could be used to pay
for the projects.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver and Gov. George Pataki have ''unfettered
power'' over how they want to spend the discretionary money. And
very often members are kept in the dark about where the funds go,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly could better define how you spend the money,'' he
said. ''For the most part they will be used in a political manner.
Why couldn't we take that in a pay-as-you-go basis for other
projects?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement reached by state legislators, the bond issue
would help fund a five-year $34.2 billion capital plan for
transportation, with half the money going into mass transit and the
other half to road and bridge building.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman argued that it was unclear exactly what projects would
be funded by the bond act. For Democrats in the state Assembly, one
of the most popular aspects of the deal had been a commitment for
construction of the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan, but Bragman
said that was just a promise and not set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of information that we don't have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that although the state Legislature also passed a debt
reform package advocated by Pataki, that was ''little more than
window dressing'' and would not alleviate the state's heavy debt
load in any significant way.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman was stripped of his majority leader title and the perks
that came with it when he unsuccessfully challenged Silver's
leadership earlier this year. Bragman has since announced that he
will seek re-election in November to the Assembly seat he has held
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He said Friday that his position on the transportation bond act
would not hurt his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would just be the contrary. I voted to put this effort to
allow for a vote before voters. It's now my responsibility to help
voters make a well-informed decision,'' he said. ''My goal is to
talk about these things as early as next month.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature gave its approval to the bond act in May,
but Pataki has said he has not yet decided whether to support the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   New York pays nearly $4 billion each year in debt service. It
has the highest accumulated debt of any state at $37.5 billion, far
ahead of the second-ranked California, with $21.6 billion in debt
and twice the population.
</P>
<P>
   New York's heavy debt load is one reason why the state has
landed at or near the bottom of credit ratings - ranking second to
last among 47 states rated by Standards and Poor's and last among
the 41 states rated by Moody's Investors Service.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have said it is unclear what effect, if
any, the bond act will have on the state's indebtedness. Factors
such as the bond act's time frame and the state's transportation
needs have to be considered when calculating the effect, and those
issues will only come into play only after voters have approved the
measure, they said.

<HEADLINE> Court lets utility charge customers for charity costs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state appeals court on Friday approved
New Jersey-American Water Co.'s policy of passing along a part of
its costs for charitable contributions to its 336,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Ratepayer Advocate had opposed the passthrough charge,
saying among other things that it violated residents' First
Amendment rights to associate with charities of their own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Voorhees-based company with operations
statewide provided funding to Morristown Memorial Hospital, which
Ratepayer Advocate lawyers argued might offend some residents
because the hospital performs abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-judge panel of the state appeals court said there
was no evidence the utility's money went to support abortion.
Overall, the court said the donations do not infringe on residents'
First Amendment rights because the money went to noncontroversial
local groups such as ambulance squads, fire companies and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although these charities undoubtedly engage in some expressive
activities, such as fund-raising, there is no indication those
activities are political or ideological in nature,'' the court
said.
</P>
<P>
   The court also noted the charity passthrough amounted to about 8
cents a year for typical homeowners, saying it had ''no appreciable
impact'' on the rates paid by consumers. But the opinion did
suggest that the judges might have looked at the issue differently
if the charity passthrough had a larger impact on rates.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey-American is the state's largest privately owned water
utility.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 100; Nasdaq Slips 73  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped Friday as investors took profits
and digested some corporate earnings disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   At afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 100.41 at 10,743.00.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 15.32 at 1,480.15, and the Nasdaq composite index was down
72.71 at 4,111.85.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently were taking a breather after Thursday's
strong rally, sparked by encouraging remarks from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and strong IBM earnings. The Dow on
Thursday rose 147.79 to 10,843.87 and the Nasdaq gained 128.93 to
close at 4,184.56.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a typical summer Friday with profit-taking and low
volume,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co.
The tone of the market will still be positive in the days ahead
because investors are confident the Fed is done raising interest
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few earnings disappointments added to Friday's selling,
particularly in the technology sector. One was from Agilent
Technologies, the computer products maker spinoff of
Hewlett-Packard, which late Thursday said it expects fiscal
third-quarter earnings to fall short of expectations. Shares of
Agilent tumbled $24.75 to $48.25 and Dow component Hewlett-Packard
fell $4.375 to $123.675.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cell-phone and telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson
said third-quarter profits will fall below the first- and
second-quarter levels. Shares of Ericsson fell $2.75 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology losers on Friday included Intel, down $3 to
$139.625 and IBM, off $2.50 to $114.50.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good corporate earnings as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter earnings surged 75 percent for Sun Microsystems,
which easily surpassed Wall Street expectations amid heavy demand
for its Internet hardware and software. Sun rose $6.75 to $104.50.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dow component Eastman Kodak met Wall Street's
earnings estimates and predicted it would beat third-quarter profit
estimates as well. Shares of Kodak slipped $1.875 cents to $58.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 771.10 million
shares, down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 9.39 at 525.36.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, U.S. Make Transplant Pact  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. transplant network agreed Friday to
share with Mexico its experience in distributing organs,
inaugurating an information exchange that officials hope will boost
Mexico's less-developed system and help Americans increase Hispanic
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The formal agreement, signed Friday in Mexico City, was not
necessary from the American point of view, given that the U.S.
network regularly shares information with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexican authorities wanted to establish a formal
relationship, said Mark Rosenker, a spokesman for the United
Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the American system for
distributing donated hearts, lungs, kidneys, livers and pancreases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have much to teach and much to learn through this
exchange,'' said Walter Graham, UNOS executive director, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is not expected to lead to the exchange of actual
organs. Organs occasionally travel across borders -- from the United
States when the donated organ is in such poor condition that no
U.S. doctors want it, and into the United States when a foreign
country has no suitable patients.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the agreement is meant to help Mexico's National
Transplant Council develop a nationwide system for distributing
organs. For instance, the agreement calls for information exchange
on how to certify transplant centers and professionals and on
scientific advances in the field. It allows for sending experts
across the border to help with training.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials plan a visit to the UNOS offices in Richmond,
Va., next week.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are hoping for some insight into how to increase
donation rates among Mexican-Americans. For a variety of reasons,
some not understood, minority groups, including Hispanics, are less
likely to agree to donation.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics, the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United
States, account for about 30 percent of the kidney transplant
recipients in California and Texas but only 25 percent of the
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's transplant system is considerably less advanced that
the American system.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico performed some 630 transplants at 13 hospitals in 1999.
That compares to some 22,000 at 260 U.S. hospitals last year.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from other countries regularly visit UNOS, looking to
improve their own computer systems or study the American approach
to distribution, said Bob Spieldenner, a spokesman for the
transplant network. In recent years, representatives of Canada,
Japan, Germany and Spain have all traveled here.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Tax Cut for Couples  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed a Republican bill Friday
that would slash income taxes for 50 million married couples. The
bill invites a veto confrontation over budget surplus politics with
President Clinton as the GOP prepares for its national convention
to nominate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 60-34 to pass the ''marriage penalty'' bill, with
seven Democrats joining all but one Republican in support. Even at
a cost of $292 billion over 10 years, GOP sponsors portrayed the
bill as a modest refund of a portion of the projected $2.17
trillion in non-Social Security surplus revenue to middle-class
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would ask those who oppose this family tax relief: just how
big will America's budget surplus have to get before America's
families deserve to receive some of their tax dollars back?'' said
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were rushing to send the bill to the White House so
that the president would have to decide its fate about the same
time as the GOP convention July 31-Aug. 3 in Philadelphia, where
cutting taxes will be a major theme as the party nominates Bush for
president.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton promised to veto the bill on grounds its
benefits are tilted toward families in the top 1 percent income
range, and it and other GOP tax cuts would consume surplus dollars
that could be used better for priorities such as paying off the
public debt and providing a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the interest of fiscal responsibility, I will veto this and
any subsequent legislation that threatens our ability to pay down
the debt and strengthen Medicare and Social Security,'' the
president said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Senate nor the House vote Thursday reached the
two-thirds margin needed to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   There was a question Friday exactly when the bill would reach
the president, complicated by Clinton's absence, in Okinawa at an
economic summit. Under the Constitution, he has 10 days to veto it
-- not counting Sundays and the day he gets it -- or it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the timing of it is the real issue,'' said White
House Budget Director Jack Lew. ''It's the content of the bill
that's the real issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would remedy features of the tax code that force 25
million married couples to pay higher income taxes than single
people, mainly by enlarging the bottom 15 percent tax bracket and
increasing the standard tax deduction for couples filing jointly.
But it would also cut taxes for millions more couples who now enjoy
a marriage ''bonus'' because one spouse earns the bulk of the
family income.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized on the GOP convention timing, the high cost and
claimed benefits for wealthier couples as evidence that Republicans
have no interest in compromise and mainly want to use the
president's veto in the congressional and presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never in the history of the Senate has so much gone to so few,
with so little concern for working families,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said the marriage penalty hits hardest at
incomes between $20,000 and $75,000 a year, and couples who now
enjoy bonuses also need tax relief as they raise children, pay
mortgages and balance other needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about tax relief for the hardest-hit among
us,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ''They earned this
money and they deserve to keep more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed more limited marriage-penalty relief but
offered to sign an earlier version of the GOP bill if Congress also
passed an acceptable prescription drug benefit for Medicare
recipients. Republicans have rejected that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the bill's cost was estimated at $89.8 billion over
five years because it was passed under budget rules limiting it to
that span. Over 10 years, however, the Joint Committee on Taxation
projected the bill's cost at $292 billion.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4810.

<HEADLINE> Lansbury Withdraws From Musical  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Angela Lansbury has withdrawn from a new
Broadway musical scheduled to open next spring, saying she's
''absolutely shattered'' to do so but needs to be with her husband
as he recovers from heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the producers of ''The Visit,'' Lansbury said she
needs to be with her husband, Peter Shaw, ''day-by-day,
hour-by-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The kind of commitment required of an artist carrying a
multimillion-dollar production has to be 100 percent, and in
fairness to you, I realize I simply couldn't manage being available
to you and the company and fulfill my desire and need to care for
Peter,'' Lansbury's letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Barry Brown said the show, scheduled to open in April,
would move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are regrouping and discussing other actresses,'' Brown said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Visit'' is about a wealthy woman who returns to her
hometown and offers money for the murder of a man who seduced her
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old Lansbury is a Broadway musical veteran, having
won Tony Awards for her performances in ''Mame,'' ''Dear World,''
''Sweeney Todd'' and a revival of ''Gypsy.'' She also starred from
1984 to 1996 in the television series ''Murder, She Wrote.''

<HEADLINE> Oliver Stone Defends Movie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONCHATOULA, La. (AP) -- Oliver Stone has begun answering
questions in a lawsuit that faults his movie ''Natural Born
Killers'' for sparking a crime spree that left a woman paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Patsy Byers, who was shot and later died of
cancer, says Stone's film triggered the attack on the convenience
store clerk in 1995. The lawsuit seeks damages from Stone and movie
distributor Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers Rick Caballero and Randolph Piedrahita began taking a
deposition from Stone on Thursday at a Los Angeles law office,
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Byers was shot by Sarah Edmondson, then 18, during a two-state
crime spree with her boyfriend, Benjamin Darras. Both are now in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson has said she and Darras had watched Stone's movie
about a young couple who commit a series of murders.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers say the lawsuit has no legal basis because the
movie is protected by free speech provisions in the First
Amendment.

<HEADLINE> R.E.M. Fans Save Railroad Trestle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- An abandoned railroad trestle scheduled for
demolition has been saved for now, thanks to e-mail from fans of
hometown rockers R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   The old trestle spanning Trail Creek is featured on the cover of
R.E.M.'s first album, ''Murmur.'' Fans worldwide deluged the
mayor's office with e-mail when they heard the trestle was to be
torn down.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it is not only a symbol of R.E.M., it is also a
typical Southern landmark,'' read one message from a Norwegian
woman who said she and 30 other R.E.M. fans visited the trestle
during a trip to Athens two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Athens-Clarke County Mayor Doc Eldridge responded Thursday by
obtaining a $5,000 option to buy the trestle, though parts of it
have already been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   The salvage company hired by CSX Transportation, which owns the
trestle, stopped demolition work Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase option includes several trestles, some dating back
to the 1880s. Athens officials say buying the trestles would likely
cost about $25,000, but they want to look into buying the 30-acre
right of way for the entire stretch of tracks, a proposition that
could cost millions of dollars.

<HEADLINE> Woman's fears founded as estranged husband kills her at concert  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - After about a year of marriage,
Josephine Giaimo had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   She filed for divorce from her husband, Frank Cosenza, and got
two restraining orders to stop him from following her to church and
peeking in her windows at night.
</P>
<P>
   The orders didn't do any good. Cosenza, 77, shot and killed his
78-year-old estranged wife in a crowd of about 150 people as she
listened to a concert on the town green Thursday night. He then
killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd had been enjoying a Beatles song played by a local
band moments before the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the ages of the people involved, domestic violence
experts say this story is all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes to show that domestic violence happens to everyone,
regardless of age, regardless of income,'' said Sandra Koorejian,
executive director of Domestic Violence Services of Greater New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The warning signs were plain to see.
</P>
<P>
   Giaimo filed for divorce May 19. She remained in her East Haven
home, a tidy bungalow with a well-kept yard, and Cosenza took an
apartment in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Cosenza failed to show up for a hearing the day before the
shooting to answer allegations that he had violated a restraining
order. In a note, written on stationery printed with the motto:
''Hearts and Homes are Warmed by Love,'' he told the judge he would
not appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Giaimo painted a different picture than the
claims he penned on stationery: ''Frank Cosenza has left phone
messages and in person has threatened my life on several
occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Frank Cosenza has a gun permit,'' she continued in the court
filing. ''Frank Cosenza told me if I ever call the police again he
will kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, the court issued a restraining order, barring him
from coming within 500 feet of her or talking to her. The order
required Cosenza to surrender a gun permit and any firearms he had.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested him July 12 on a breach of peace charge after he
followed Giaimo home from church and argued with her. Police Chief
Leonard Gallo said Cosenza was angry over having to surrender his
gun permit.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the court issued another restraining order. This
time, Cosenza was barred from coming within 100 feet of her, or
trying to contact her in person, on the telephone or by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, police said he killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police Cosenza came up behind Giaimo while she
was sitting in a lawn chair, listening to the band. He put a 9 mm
pistol to her head and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Cosenza walked a few feet away, put the gun to
his head and shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard a couple of shots,'' said witness Phil Carrano. ''I
thought they were fireworks and everyone scattered. The people
started pulling out their cell phones and calling 911.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw a lady sitting in a chair and she looked dead. I can't
believe this happened in East Haven,'' Carrano told the New Haven
Register.
</P>
<P>
   Cosenza was dead on the scene. Giaimo died shortly after at
Yale-New Haven Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Giaimo, who liked to be called ''Josie,'' married her first
husband at age 16 and had three children. She had been a widow for
about 10 years when she met Cosenza, said Giaimo's sister-in-law
from her first marriage, who spoke to The Associated Press on the
condition that her name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Giaimo was an athletic, trim, energetic woman, who liked to go
out dancing and play golf and tennis. She and Cosenza would go
dancing, the sister-in-law said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after they married, the sister-in-law said the
relationship changed, and Giaimo decided to get a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers for the restraining order, Giaimo said Cosenza
''follows me on an almost daily basis,'' even when she went to
church and the town senior citizen's center.
</P>
<P>
   One night at about 10 p.m., Cosenza came to her house and looked
in the window, frightening her, she said in the court filing.
Giaimo said she was becoming nervous, had suffered headaches and
had to take medication.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, the town police chief, said police did what they could
for Giaimo.
</P>
<P>
   Cosenza did not have a record of violence, Gallo said. Police
were investigating how long he had the gun permit and whether the
gun was his.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a restraining order, we have the opportunity to intercede
ahead of most of these incidents, but when a person is bent on
violence, it is difficult to prevent,'' Gallo said.

<HEADLINE> Clooney, Wahlberg Joke Around  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- They may call each other ''mean'' and ''green,''
but George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg really are friends.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday promoting their latest movie
''The Perfect Storm,'' the pair joked about Wahlberg's sea sickness
during filming and Clooney's stint as producer.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, he's incredibly talented,'' Clooney said of
Wahlberg. ''Second of all, we got him cheaper than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg targeted his friend's dual personality.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's mean as a producer,'' he said. ''It's very different when
George is the big boss.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Perfect Storm,'' based on Sebastian Junger's best-selling
book, tells the story of six Massachusetts fishermen lost at sea in
1991. Clooney and Wahlberg starred together last year in the action
movie ''Three Kings.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Told Cops Lies About Swayze  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) -- Two construction workers pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor and were fined $110 each for giving police
false information about the crash of a plane piloted by Patrick
Swayze.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Nelson and Joshua Angel pleaded guilty to the charges on
Wednesday. Another worker, Adam Martin, is still facing charges.
</P>
<P>
   The construction workers witnessed the June 1 crash of the plane
as they worked on a housing development. The three initially told
police they didn't see the accident but then later said they helped
Swayze remove a half-empty 30-pack of beer and a nearly empty
bottle of wine before driving him to a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze's publicist has denied the actor had alcohol on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze was unhurt when he landed his 1978 twin-engine Cessna
414A after hitting a light pole and tearing off part of a wing.
Swayze, who told the Federal Aviation Administration the plane
suffered a pressurization problem, has not been charged with any
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze starred in ''Ghost'' and ''Dirty Dancing''

<HEADLINE> Publicist Sues Christina Aguilera  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A New York publicist has filed a $7 million
lawsuit accusing the mother of teen singer Christina Aguilera and
others of cheating her out of her share of the star's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Inniss says in papers filed Wednesday in state Supreme
Court that she is owed at least $2 million from the singer's
earnings from her debut album, ''Christina Aguilera.''
</P>
<P>
   The album, which reached No. 1 on pop sales charts, produced the
hit singles, ''Genie in a Bottle,'' and ''What a Girl Wants.''
Aguilera, 19, won a Grammy for best new artist of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Inniss claims she first saw Aguilera's potential in 1993 when
the singer was a Mouseketeer on the ''Mickey Mouse Show.'' Court
papers say she told Aguilera's mother, Shelly Kearns, that she
could help the girl's singing career and they later agreed Inniss
would act as Aguilera's manager.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Normand R. Kurtz, the music
industry lawyer Inniss approached for help, and his son cut Inniss
out of the girl's career.
</P>
<P>
   Normand Kurtz did not return telephone calls.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Judges Uphold Rape Verdict  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
on Friday upheld a landmark ruling that established rape as a war
crime, rejecting an appeal by a Bosnian Croat commander convicted
of watching as a knife-wielding subordinate tortured and raped a
female prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The five-judge appellate chamber rejected every ground upon
which the defense contested the Dec. 10, 1998, judgment against
Anto Furundzija, 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''The appeals chamber has not been persuaded as to the existence
of any legal errors which require it to intervene,'' the Guyanan
presiding judge, Mohamed Shahabuddeen, said in the ruling by the
tribunal's court of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hailed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It demonstrates that people who are in a position of authority
have a responsibility to govern the behavior of people under their
authority,'' said Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Furundzija, head of the special military police unit calling
itself the ''Jokers,'' stood by as one of his soldiers threatened a
naked woman detainee and then raped her during interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Furundzija received a 10-year sentence for the attack, which
happened a year into the 1992-95 Bosnian war during a bloody
campaign in central Bosnia to expel Muslims from the Lasva River
Valley. The soldier has been indicted but not captured.
</P>
<P>
   Furundzija is one of 14 convicted war criminals sentenced to up
to 45 years by the International War Crimes Tribunal on the former
Yugoslavia, a U.N. panel, since it was established in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction set two international legal precedents: the
tribunal admitted the testimony of the victim, even though she
suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder that bordered on
suicidal; and it expanded the definition of sexual assault to be
more easily punishable as an act of torture.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Luka Misetic had challenged the conviction on the
grounds that the presiding judge, Florence Mumba of Zambia, had not
disclosed her membership in a U.N. women's rights commission which
advocated the inclusion of rape as a war crime. The panel ruled
that Mumba had not shown bias in conducting the trial.
</P>
<P>
   It also dismissed Misetic's claim that the sentence was
excessive because the crime did not result in loss of life. The
panel said the trial chamber had ''exercised its discretion''
within the precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Avril McDonald, a researcher with the T.M.C. Asser Institute in
The Hague, noted that the judgment reinforced the ruling of rape as
a war crime under international law.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly watching Friday's verdict was the defense team for three
Serb paramilitary fighters accused of participating in the nightly
rapes of Muslim women at detention centers in the southeast Bosnian
city of Foca in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That trial, which began March 20, is the first international
proceeding to focus on systematic rape and sexual enslavement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops in Kosovo Tial Flap  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The murder trial of a Serb man and
his two sons, accused of killing an ethnic Albanian in a shootout
in Kosovo, took a dramatic turn Friday when the trial judge said
American troops confirmed they killed two people at the scene that
day.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patrice De Charette said the admission was contained in a
130-page report submitted by U.S. authorities Friday to the court
trying Mirolub ''Mirko'' Momcilovic, 60, and his sons Jugoslav, 32,
and Boban, 25. They are accused of killing Afrim Gagica on July 10,
1999, in a confrontation in southeastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   De Charette, who is French, would not give further details of
the report, saying it would be admitted into evidence Monday.
However, a U.N. official familiar with the case said the Americans
now confirm that they -- and not the three Serbs -- killed Gagica.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. and NATO officials in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, refused
comment, saying it was a matter for the U.N.-run court. U.N.
spokeswoman Susan Manuel, summarizing a report from de Charette,
said the Americans testified that one man had been firing at an
observation tower where U.S. soldiers were stationed.
</P>
<P>
   The armed man then fled into a shed, pursued by an American
soldier who fired two explosive rounds near the building and
''successive rounds into the shed door,'' Manuel said. U.N.
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gagica was
killed at a shed.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why the U.S. Army waited so long to provide
information in a case that has dragged on for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The case emerged at a time when key figures in the U.S. Congress
were objecting to establishment of an international criminal court,
arguing American soldiers on peacekeeping missions might someday be
charged with offenses committed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Army asked the court to reconsider the
detentions of Momcilovic and his sons because an investigation by
the Army's Criminal Investigation Division had uncovered
''additional investigative materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military had already admitted it shot a man in the area
that day, Naser Azemi. The military insisted that U.S. troops were
attacked and were following the rules of engagement when they
killed Azemi in self defense.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Thursday, however, the Army said it
reopened the investigation after receiving an inquiry from the
media, and that it passed on its findings to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on the preliminary findings ..., Task Force Falcon
immediately passed the recently developed information to the
Gnjilane District Court president for a review of the Momcilovics'
detention status,'' the U.S. European Command said in a statement
released in Germany. ''Additionally, U.S. Army Europe will conduct
a comprehensive systematic review of the circumstances in this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence marks another strange chapter in the case
against the Momcilovics, which began during the early, often
turbulent months of the international peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began April 25 and was suspended the following day
after the defense asked to introduce a security videotape showing
some of the events of the day of the shooting. Although the tape
does not indicate who killed Gagica, it shows the elder Momcilovic
answering the intercom of his motorcycle repair shop and speaking
with a stranger who ultimately demanded that he come out and
surrender his weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Gun drawn, a man later identified as Gagica tried to kick the
door down as a group of his armed companions looked on. An exchange
of gunfire followed. Minutes later, U.S. troops entered the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tape does not show who shot Gagica, human rights
observers have long contended that it raises reasonable doubt that
the Momcilovics were responsible. The court refused to accept the
tape into evidence, saying it could not determine whether it had
been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge allowed the tape to be shown Friday in the
shabby courtroom, with thick red curtains and a blue U.N. flag that
had a notice stitched on it indicating that the proceedings would
be translated into Serbo-Croat, Albanian and English.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans did not testify in the case because the
Momcilovics' attorney relied on U.S. military statements taken from
the 35 soldiers interviewed. He cited the cost of travel from their
base in Germany as another reason for not calling them to the
stand.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Black Female Judge  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Days after accusations flew in the Capitol of
racism and sexism in judicial selections, the Senate has approved
the first black female judge for a powerful appellate circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Senators approved Johnnie Rawlinson by voice vote Friday for the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Alaska, Arizona,
California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The court's caseload is almost double the average number of
cases handled by any of the 12 other circuits.
</P>
<P>
   When Rawlinson was sworn in a U.S. District judge in Nevada in
June 1998, she was the first black woman to hold a position on the
U.S. District Court in Nevada. Before becoming a judge, she spent
18 years with the office of the district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Her 9th Circuit nomination had been pending since February.
Appellate judges receive lifetime appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlinson was approved Friday along with four U.S. District
judges, Dennis Cavanaugh of New Jersey and three judges from
Florida: John Steele, James Moody and Gregory Presnell.
</P>
<P>
   This comes after members of the Congressional Black Caucus
asserted in a statement circulated Wednesday that delays in
approving minority and female judges showed racist and sexist
tendencies in Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, denied the accusations and said more minority and female
judges have been approved by the Senate under his chairmanship than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted out Rawlinson's nomination Thursday. She was
approved the next day.

<HEADLINE> Penguin Refugees Repatriated  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A month after an oil spill turned
them into refugees, 200 adult penguins and 700 chicks were returned
to their island home off Cape Town's coast.
</P>
<P>
   The penguins were among some 43,000 birds evacuated from Dassen
and Robben islands after an oil tanker sank June 23.
</P>
<P>
   The 900 penguins were the first of 23,000 birds to be released
in their home waters after being hand-fed and cleaned by volunteers
in rehabilitation centers in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Once freed from the cardboard boxes in which they traveled to
Robben Island on a ferry, the chicks stood around for a while
before slowly making it into the water.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 clean birds were trucked 470 miles east of Cape
Town to the city of Port Elizabeth and released to swim home,
giving authorities time to clean up the slick. Many of those
returned this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Peter, one of three penguins with a
satellite-tracking device glued to its back, remained out of
scientists' and journalists' sight. Peter went fishing Thursday and
returned to Robben Island only in the early hours of Friday, the
University of Cape Town's Avian Demography Unit said in a statement
posted on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It was previously feared more oil could leak from the sunken
tanker, but salvage experts now say very little oil is still
trapped in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 400 of the captured birds have died during the
rehabilitation project, the largest of its kind. The project is
likely to continue for several more months, because thousands of
penguins still need to be cleaned.

<HEADLINE> New stock exchange passes another hurdle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A new high-tech stock exchange inched closer to
becoming reality Friday when the Empire State Development Corp.
approved a preliminary environmental impact statement for the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange has been working with city and state
officials since 1996 on plans for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders and Wall Street moguls alike are dreaming of a
50,000-square-foot trading floor and new office tower bordered by
Wall, Broad and William streets and Exchange Place, just across
from the current Broad Street offices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to green-lighting the draft environmental impact
statement, the ESDC's board of directors also adopted a general
project plan for the new NYSE location.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly and Senate agreed last month to let the city
help finance the deal. The total cost is estimated at about $1.7
billion with construction to begin in the fall of 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A Marine Corps veteran who pulled New York's
Republican Party up by its bootstraps a decade ago, William Powers
has become the GOP's attack dog in the battle against Hillary
Rodham Clinton's run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Powers, the only first lady to ever run for public
office is ''cold-blooded and hotheaded'' and ''a shrill and
scheming person'' who is ''opportunistic, hypocritical and
egotistical.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention that she is ''polarizing and power hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is just from one letter he has sent out to potential
donors.
</P>
<P>
   A second fund-raising letter that surfaced Thursday said she was
''an angry woman'' driven by ''blind political ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter went on to call Clinton an ''ambitious, ruthless,
scheming, calculating, manipulating woman'' who was really one of
''the outsiders who mock our New York values and scoff at our
commonsense conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Powers said he wasn't calling the
first lady names or being a male chauvinist, just pointing out what
he feels are the facts about her. And, he promised, there was
plenty more where that came from. Powers said he had three more
such letters ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, said Powers, are helping him raise record amounts
of money for the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen a response to direct mail like we're getting
from her,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are also serving to get out attacks on the first
lady that her new Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, does not
want to personally utter. The congressman from Long Island, with
his wife and two young daughters often in tow, is seeking to
project an image as a clean-cut, earnest, honest family man. He
does not want to be viewed as a street-fighting, take-no-prisoners
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Powers has no such qualms. He, in fact, seems to relish the
attention the attacks are bringing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of like it. I talk about myself. She talks about me.
Other people talk about me. That's good for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said he is also unconcerned about the letters might
backfire and create the impression that Clinton is a victim. When
that happened during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal involving
President Clinton, the first lady's favorable poll numbers took a
jump.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about motivating your base,'' Powers said. ''My letters
are going to our base.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Powers is of the belief that Clinton is such a
polarizing figure that Republicans and conservatives will come out
in record numbers in New York this year just to vote against her.
That, he said, will not only help Lazio, but could benefit Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign in New York and other
Republican candidates across the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Powers, it marks the latest in a series of political battles
he has been waging for well over a decade. A top aide to then-Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, Powers got himself elected state chairman in the
wake of the party's disastrous showing in the 1990 election for
governor when GOP candidate Pierre Rinfret collected just 22
percent of the vote and Democrat Mario Cuomo coasted to a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   Powers inherited a party deep in debt and demoralized. He got in
his car and began traveling the state, attending local party
functions and raising money. He would stop home for clean clothes
and hit the road again. He did little else for the first year as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he helped D'Amato narrowly escape defeat at the hands
of then-state Attorney General Robert Abrams. In 1993, Powers
played a key role in helping elect Republican Rudolph Giuliani as
mayor of New York City. The big payoff came in 1994 when, with a
big assist from D'Amato, Powers helped a little-known Republican
state senator, George Pataki, topple Cuomo in the governor's race.
A former federal prosecutor from Buffalo, Republican Dennis Vacco,
was also elected attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Things have not been quite as rosy for Powers since then. In
1998, Pataki won a second term, but both D'Amato and Vacco went
down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been speculation that Powers may step down from
the state chairmanship, he seems intent on at least one last battle
against a major opponent worthy of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect her,'' Powers said.

<HEADLINE> Oxygen levels in the ocean rebound after brief scare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BARNEGAT, N.J. (AP) - Ocean oxygen levels that had dropped to
dangerously low levels off the New Jersey coast rebounded Friday,
alleviating concerns that fish kills could result.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling along the coast Tuesday and Wednesday showed dissolved
oxygen levels of about 2 parts per million in the water off
Barnegat, Bay Head, Belmar and Beach Haven, according to U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency officials.
</P>
<P>
   A new round of sampling Friday showed higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Braun, chief of monitoring for the EPA's Region II,
attributed the improvement to thunderstorms that churned up the
surf, adding oxygen to the water.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cause for concern when you get below 3 milligrams per
liter of oxygen in the water,'' said Braun. ''If it's zero, you'll
kill all your fish because there's no oxygen to filter out. The
lower your dissolved oxygen becomes, the more stressful a situation
gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish and clams, among others, must filter oxygen from the water
to live. Low levels of oxygen can kill bottom-dwelling species
because they cannot move to water with more oxygen in it.
</P>
<P>
   Hypoxia, as the phenomenon is known, is common in the ocean
during the summer, when warm water near the surface prevents
circulation and pockets of water form near the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Algae blooms can also cause it when single-cell plants die and
sink to the ocean floor, consuming oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The lower oxygen content posed no dangers to bathers, Braun
said. It doesn't occur in shallow water near beaches because wave
action continually churns up the water, adding oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The sampling, which is performed from a helicopter by EPA
technicians, consists of lowering brass containers into the ocean
between 1 and 9 miles offshore, 1 meter off the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The sample is then hoisted back up into the helicopter and
tested at an EPA lab.
</P>
<P>
   The early-week testing showed oxygen levels ranging from 1.9 to
3.7 parts per million off Belmar, 2.3 to 2.9 off Bay Head, 2.2 to 5
off Barnegat and 2 to 4 off Beach Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling performed in the same places Friday showed levels
ranging from 3.3 to 5.6 parts per million in Belmar, 2.5 to 5.7
parts per million off Bay Head, 5.2 to 7.4 parts per million off
Barnegat and 5.8 to 7.5 off Beach Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you start getting values below two for sustained periods,
you have a greater potential for impact like killing clams,'' Braun
said. ''Fish can swim out of the way and can go to areas where it's
not so low.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, prolonged hypoxia in New Jersey waters triggered fish
kills. Algae blooms were blamed for that incident.

<HEADLINE> FCC Adopts Special Phone Numbers  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drivers anywhere in the country could dial 511
to avoid traffic tie-ups and families needing food or shelter could
call 211 for help under plans approved by federal regulators
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to local governments and charities to offer the
phone services on those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, guardian of the scarce
three-digit phone numbers, set aside the new codes after
determining that quick, easy-to-remember access to those services
would greatly benefit the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our hope that 211 and 511 for these purposes will become
as ubiquitous as 911,'' said FCC Chairman William Kennard,
referring to the nationwide emergency number.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also mandated that phone companies adopt another
number -- 711 -- as a code to reach special operators who help the
deaf and speech-impaired make calls.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came despite worries by some public safety
officials that the addition of all these new -11 codes dilutes the
purpose of having one simple, easy-to-remember number for
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's difficult for the average person to keep in mind
what they are. You almost have to go to a directory to sort them
out,'' said Joe Hanna, president of the Association of
Public-Safety Communications Officials.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will re-evaluate the new codes in five years to
see if they are being used efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials who petitioned for the new
traffic-information code said they hope to consolidate the 300
separate numbers now dialed by people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities will be responsible for implementing the new
traffic phone code and deciding what information to include on
their area's prerecorded hot line. To nudge that process along,
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said his department will
grant selected states and local jurisdictions start-up funds of up
to $50,000 each to convert to the new single number.
</P>
<P>
   The code will enable people to access local updates on
accidents, construction and traffic in whatever city they're
passing through.
</P>
<P>
   In one demonstration, dialing 511 brought callers to a recorded
menu where they could enter the number of a route to find out its
current travel conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe that like existing traveler information
numbers, the new code could be funded in a variety of ways,
including subsidies by local agencies, partnership with private
groups or per-call charges.
</P>
<P>
   The 211 code will provide people with free access to health and
human services information, including referrals to food banks,
shelters, crisis intervention services and drug rehabilitation
providers. The number also could link people to groups offering
work opportunities and support for the elderly, disabled or
children.
</P>
<P>
   Given the range of organizations offering such services,
specialists fielding calls on the 211 line could direct people to
the best sources, working with a database of groups. Information
and referral services currently answer more than 50 million calls a
year nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   United Way of America and other groups had urged the commission
to set aside the code, citing success in areas where such
three-number referral service already exists. The Atlanta area and
the state of Connecticut experienced a 40 percent increase in calls
after they switched from a 10-digit system to 211.
</P>
<P>
   Local utility regulators will select who will be awarded the 211
number in each state. In the few places using it already, the
number is generally supported through funds from the government and
groups such as United Way.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also mandated Friday that broadcasters and cable
companies provide some voice narration of the action in TV shows
for visually impaired audiences in their biggest markets. They will
be required to describe about four hours per week of prime time
and-or children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   Only broadcasters affiliated with the big four networks in their
top 25 markets are affected.
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators and satellite companies with more than 50,000
subscribers would have to do the same for their five most popular
channels. The requirements take effect in April 2002.

<HEADLINE> Ex-con arrested in $10 million Brazilian bond swindle  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An ex-convict accused of running a phony
investment business was arrested Friday on charges of cheating
investors from a dozen countries out of more than $10 million in a
Brazilian treasury bond scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Whitehead of Branford, Conn., was arrested at Rikers
Island, where he was already jailed on a parole violation. A
17-count Manhattan indictment charges him with grand larceny,
scheming to defraud, and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead, 57, ran The Currency Group Inc., a business that
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said was devoted to luring the
unwary - some of whom were recruited on the Internet - into phony
investments with promised returns of up to 1,000 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said Whitehead bilked victims of amounts that ranged
from $100,000 to $2 million each by promising to put their money
into his ''High Yield Trading Program'' or ''Secured Trading
Program.'' These programs were supposed to buy Brazilian bonds at
discounts and sell them at huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1998 until this month, Morgenthau said, Whitehead made
no investments on behalf of his clients, recruited both via the
Internet and through intermediaries who are now under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he lived ''pretty large'' with investors' money, buying
pricey cars, personal luxuries and expensive gifts for friends,
donating $100,000 to the Metropolitan Opera within the past two
years, Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an opera fan,'' Morgenthau said, adding that during the
1980s Whitehead contributed more than $250,000 - apparently from
previous schemes - to the Met.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-Brazilian charity that built housing for poor students
invested in Whitehead's schemes and lost $500,000, Morgenthau said.
He said a computer programmer from New Jersey lost $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors are in countries that include Canada, England,
the United States, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France,
Luxembourg, Thailand and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said that when investors complained, Whitehead would
pay them something to pacify them. He said Whitehead was so
effective as a salesman that many investors still do not believe
that they have been swindled.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead has a record of fraud convictions as far back as the
1970s and through the 1980s, Morgenthau said. In 1987, he was
convicted in Manhattan in an ''advance fee'' racket in which
victims pay in advance for goods, services or opportunities that
they never receive.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for sentencing on March 5, 1987, he disappeared the
day before. After 11 days on the lam, mostly in Europe, Whitehead
was arrested in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead fought extradition for some 18 months, Morgenthau
said, even renouncing his American citizenship and becoming an
Irish citizen in his futile attempt to block his return to this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Sentenced to six to 18 years, Whitehead was released on parole
in 1994. He faces up to 25 years in prison if he is convicted on
the top charge in the alleged investment scheme, first-degree grand
larceny.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Hruska, the assistant district attorney prosecuting the
case, said a side-effect of Whitehead's change of citizenship is
that he could be deported in the future because of his criminal
activities.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 110; Nasdaq Drops 91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped Friday as investors took profits
and digested some corporate earnings disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 110.31 at 10,733.56, according to preliminary
calculations. For the week, the Dow lost 79.19.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 90.79 at 4,093.77 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down
15.28 at 1,480.19. For the week, the Nasdaq lost 152.41.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently were taking a breather after Thursday's
strong rally, sparked by encouraging remarks about the economy from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and strong IBM earnings.
The Dow on Thursday rose 147.79 to 10,843.87 and the Nasdaq gained
128.93 to close at 4,184.56.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a typical summer Friday with profit-taking and low
volume,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co.
The tone of the market will still be positive in the days ahead
because investors are confident the Fed is done raising interest
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few earnings disappointments added to Friday's selling,
particularly in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   One was from Agilent Technologies, the computer products maker
spinoff of Hewlett-Packard, which late Thursday said it expects
fiscal third-quarter earnings to fall short of expectations. Shares
of Agilent tumbled $25.625 to $47.375 and Dow component
Hewlett-Packard fell $4.625 to $123.375.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cell-phone and telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson
said third-quarter profits will fall below the first- and
second-quarter levels. Shares of Ericsson fell $2.75 to $19.813.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology losers on Friday included Intel, down $4.50 to
$138.188 and IBM, off $2.562 to $114.438.
</P>
<P>
   ''What today emphasizes is this market is still trading in a
range than taking an upleg that takes it sharply higher,'' said
Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   While investors have stopped worrying about the Fed raising
interest rates, traders instead are choosing to worry about how the
slower moving economy may be cutting into corporate profits.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Moynihan defends Clinton from anti-Semitic slur charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Daniel Patrick Moynihan defended the woman who
hopes to replace him in the U.S. Senate, saying charges accusing
Hillary Rodham Clinton of uttering an anti-Semitic slur 26 years
ago ''are ugly and patently false.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The campaign for Senate hit several unacceptable low points
this week,'' Moynihan said in a statement released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I commend Mrs. Clinton for staying focused on the important
issues that face our state and running a campaign of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has vehemently denied that she called campaign
worker Paul Fray a ''Jew b------'' after Bill Clinton lost a
congressional bid in Arkansas 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation is made in a new book, ''State of a Union: Inside
the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton,'' by former
National Enquirer reporter Jerry Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer quotes Fray and said his account was confirmed by
Fray's wife and another campaign worker who heard the argument
through a closed door
</P>
<P>
   ''The sources of this accusation have no credibility,'' Moynihan
said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's retiring senior senator called for an end to ''this
unprecedented level of personal attack and character
assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In doing so we might salvage a civilized discourse in our
political process,'' the Democrat said.

<HEADLINE> Reptile captured in suburban neighborhood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIDDLETOWN, N.J. (AP) - A bit far from its native habitat, a
yardlong reptile found in a suburban Monmouth County neighborhood
was snared Friday by a township animal control officer.
</P>
<P>
   The reptile is believed to be an alligator, said Richard
DeBenedetto, the township's animal control supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably only a year or two old, based on its size, about
3 feet long and 3 to 5 pounds, DeBenedetto said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks pretty healthy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ''I don't think anyone's going to own up to it,''
DeBenedetto said.
</P>
<P>
   The township is trying to find a home for the creature, probably
out of state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Male alligators grow to 12 feet and 500 pounds and are native to
the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   They pose a danger, so it is illegal in New Jersey to keep
alligators as pets, as well as similar creatures, such as
crocodiles and caimans, said Larry Herrighty, chief of the Bureau
of Wildlife Management.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get about a half-dozen of these a year. It's the most
common kind of illegal animal that shows up,'' Herrighty said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes most are freed when their owners learn the animals
are illegal pets.

<HEADLINE> Court Postpones Pinochet Decision  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's Supreme Court on Friday delayed a
decision on whether Gen. Augusto Pinochet will be tried on what
prosecutors charge was one of the most notorious human rights
abuses of his 17-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The court set no date for a ruling after three days of hearings,
but Chief Justice Hernan Alvarez said ''we hope everything will be
decided by next week or at least the following.''
</P>
<P>
   After closing the hearings, the court also postponed deciding on
a request by Pinochet's defense to have him undergo medical tests,
hoping to prove he is unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said the 20 justices will meet Tuesday ''to start
carefully examining'' arguments in the case, which involves eight
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The court was hearing Pinochet's appeal of a lower tribunal
ruling last month that stripped him of his congressional immunity.
If the Supreme Court upholds that ruling, Pinochet could be tried
in the case known as ''the caravan of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The caravan was a military squad that traveled several cities
shortly after the 1973 coup led by Pinochet, executing 72 jailed
dissidents. Nineteen of the victims have never been found.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers arguing against Pinochet Friday insisted that the
84-year-old former ruler was responsible for the actions of the
caravan, because its commander, Gen. Sergio Arellano, had been
appointed by him.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Pinochet's lawyer, Ricardo Rivadeneira, had
argued that Arellano didn't take orders from Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the plaintiffs replied that in addition to being
head of the ruling junta, Pinochet was commander of the army and
therefore Arellano's direct superior.
</P>
<P>
   Rivadeneira has insisted that Pinochet's health denies him a
fair trial because he can't properly organize his defense or even
meet with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The former dictator suffers from diabetes, carries a pacemaker
and sustained three mild strokes during his 16-month house arrest
in London.
</P>
<P>
   He was released last March after British doctors said he was
mentally and physically unfit to stand trial. He had been arrested
at the request of a Spanish judge wanting to try him.
</P>
<P>
   The case that may drag Pinochet to court is one of 146 criminal
complaints filed against him for deaths and disappearances blamed
on his 1973-90 regime.

<HEADLINE> Soldiers Sentenced in Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A military tribunal has sentenced 11
soldiers to prison terms up to 18 months for taking part in a
mutiny in this West African country, news reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven others were acquitted of disobeying orders, rebellion and
other charges at the hearing Thursday in the commercial capital,
Abidjan, newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers stationed in the western town of Daloa rebelled March
27 over salary increases they said were promised them for
participating in a Christmas Eve coup that brought junta leader
Gen. Robert Guei to power. One officer loyal to Guei was killed in
the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 35 soldiers who were arrested after a separate
mutiny July 4-5 are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December coup was initially popular among many
Ivorians, who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism
under ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, many have since become
disillusioned with the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum on a new constitution is scheduled Sunday, and Guei
has promised elections for Sept. 17. He has not said whether he
will run for president.

<HEADLINE> How American Is Puerto Rico?  </HEADLINE>
By DAN PERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A pair of provocative federal court
rulings have challenged Puerto Rico's peculiar relationship with
the United States and revived a century-old question: Just how
''American'' is this U.S. territory?
</P>
<P>
   One ruling says Puerto Rican residents -- who serve in the U.S.
military, receive billions in federal funds but have no vote in
Washington -- should be able to vote for U.S. president. The other
says the federal death penalty should not be permitted here as long
as Puerto Ricans cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both bolster the argument that things cannot stay as they are in
this island of 4 million Spanish speakers, a position apparently
held by President Clinton. They also come at a time of rising
Puerto Rican nationalism, evident in the movement to expel the U.S.
Navy from its Vieques island bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   In Gregorio Igartua de la Rosa vs. the United States of America,
U.S. District Court Judge Jaime Pieras called denying Puerto Ricans
the vote ''unconstitutional and unconscionable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inability to vote represents a form of slavery,'' he said
in his ruling Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Salvador Casellas ruled
that the death penalty for federal crimes does not apply in Puerto
Rico because its people have no vote in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shocks the conscience to impose the ultimate penalty,
death, upon American citizens who are denied the right to
participate directly or indirectly in the government that enacts
and authorizes the imposition of such punishment,'' Casellas said
in the case of Hector Oscar Acosta Martinez and Joel Rivera
Alejandro, who face murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both rulings were handed down in San Juan, and seized center
stage here.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. government has not executed anyone in Puerto
Rico since 1963, the punishment was reinstated by a 1994 federal
statute that included Puerto Rico even though local law forbids
executions. In January, the U.S. Justice Department authorized
prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Acosta and Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Charlie Rodriguez, who supports making Puerto
Rico the 51st U.S. state, called for a law allowing Puerto Rico to
vote for president in November and send ''eight or nine electoral
votes'' to Congress, regardless of whether they are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eudaldo Baez Galib, a statehood opponent, cautioned that it
would require a difficult-to-achieve U.S. constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Galib predicted that Pieras' decision would be overruled in the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. But he noted both
rulings have ''an intrinsic value, which is putting on the table
all these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues were on the White House table in June, when Clinton
convened Puerto Rico's pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello and the
heads of parties favoring independence and the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Clinton issued an Independence Day message to
Puerto Rico in which he made clear that he supports change:
</P>
<P>
   ''This holiday focuses attention on the fact that (Puerto
Ricans) do not have votes in our national government, although they
have lived under that government for more than a century and are
U.S. citizens. This fact is the primary reason I am working to
enable them to obtain a fully democratic government arrangement if
they want one.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States wrested Puerto Rico from Spain in the 1898
Spanish-American War and granted its residents citizenship in 1917.
The semiautonomous ''commonwealth'' status as a U.S. territory was
adopted in 1952, although Congress has insisted it retains ultimate
authority over Puerto Rico's political status.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans have held numerous referendums between U.S.
statehood, independence or the status quo -- the last in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Theater Head Wins British Prize  </HEADLINE>
By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- An actor who runs a troupe of performers
performing Shakespeare for farmers has won one of Britain's most
lucrative arts prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie Rutter, who won a $150,000 award as the No. 1 Creative
Briton of the year, doesn't take only the immortal bard to the
masses, but John Milton and John Dryden as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers at Skipton cattle market sell sheep on a Wednesday and
watch Shakespeare on a Thursday. We've had letters apologizing for
missing the show because of lambing,'' Rutter says.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Creative Britons award is sponsored by the savings
and investment company Prudential PLC. Six recipients get $30,000
each to use within their arts organizations, with the overall
winner picking up an extra $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rutter, 53, came to London to collect the award from the old
north England mill town of Halifax, where he serves as
actor-manager of the Northern Broadsides theater company, founded
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Among those nominating him for the award was Deputy Prime
Minister John Prescott, who compared Rutter's touring company to
John Wesley, the 18th-century founder of Methodism who spread the
Gospel along the highways of England.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barrie's factory-floor Shakespeare is as far from elitism as
can be, though it has never dumbed Shakespeare down,'' Prescott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rutter's company has performed in an indoor riding stable, a
yacht repair shed and a train station -- as well as the rebuilt
Shakespeare's Globe in London. It also has staged shows in New
York, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Germany, India and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's late poet laureate Ted Hughes bequeathed Rutter his
last work -- a translation of Euripides' ''Alcestis.'' Hughes said
he was giving the play to his ''tuning fork in the Calder Valley,''
where Halifax lies.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes work will premiere in September in Halifax, and then
go on a tour that includes Shakespeare's birthplace of
Stratford-upon-Avon and the market town of Penrith in Cumbria,
where the audience will be hill farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hughes was born 3 miles down the road from me,'' Rutter said.
''We got wonderfully drunk in York in 1995.''

<HEADLINE> Bolshoi Ballet Dancers Gleam  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Bolshoi Ballet, which has not performed in
New York City in a decade, is presenting dazzling dancers in mixed
bills at the annual Lincoln Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow company performed Thursday at the New York State
Theater in a program that turned George Balanchine's ''Symphony in
C'' from a pure dance work into theater.
</P>
<P>
   Svetlana Lunkina, 20, the acclaimed young ballerina scheduled to
dance ''Giselle'' over the weekend, made her New York debut in the
first movement of ''Symphony in C,'' partnered by Sergei Filin. She
was recovering from an ankle injury and danced carefully. It was
clear her technique was fine but it can't be said that she made a
strong impact.
</P>
<P>
   The impact came in the second movement, when Nina Ananiashvili,
who also is a member of American Ballet Theater, danced with Andrei
Uvarov. She was so delicate and ethereal she seemed to float.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Tsiskaridze, his hair flying and obviously enjoying
dancing, was more attentive to his flamboyant solo turns than to
partnering Maria Alexandrova in the third movement, though he did
lift her extraordinarily high at the finale. The last couple,
Galina Stepanenko and Dmitri Belogolovtsev, were elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine choreographed this ballet to Bizet's music in 1947
for the Paris Opera Ballet. The New York City Ballet, which dances
it frequently, makes it a pure dance work. Without changing steps,
the Bolshoi presents it as theater.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with three excerpts from full-length ballets.
''Appian Way'' from ''Spartacus,'' displayed male dancers who were
sturdy enough to look burly. Yuri Grigorovich choreographed it in
1968 to display company men as athletic and heroic. Dmitri
Belogolovtsev, as a slim Spartacus, spins and jumps high with
defiance and completely commands the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Ananiashvili, whose balances are breathtaking, and Filin danced
the finale pas de deux from ''Don Quixote with bravura. Filin is a
virtuoso, dancing faster than the eye can follow, doing double heel
beats in air and catching his partner when she jumps into his arms.
Both were dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanenko conveyed an appealing wistfulness in the ''Kingdom of
the Shades'' scene from ''La Bayadere.'' Uvarov was a bit stiff at
times as her partner. Natalia Malandina, Nina Speranskaya and Maria
Allash were all impressive in their solo turns.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Sotnikov conducted the New York City Opera Orchestra.

<HEADLINE> 1 killed, 2 hurt in crash; rescuer suffers heart attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - One person was killed in a car
accident Thursday night, and a firefighter suffered a heart attack
trying to free survivors from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Williams, 23, of Bridgewater died of injuries he
suffered in the 9:05 p.m. crash on Easton Avenue, Somerset County
Prosecutor Wayne Forrest said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was driving north in the right lane when the vehicle
swerved suddenly to the right, nearly striking the curb. It then
swerved back to the left and went into the southbound lanes, where
it struck a vehicle driven by Donna Sogliuzzo, 38, of North
Brunswick. Her car was then struck by a third vehicle, driven by
Judith Kovacs, 27, of Somerset.
</P>
<P>
   Sogliuzzo had to be extricated from the wreckage by the Somerset
Volunteer Fire Company.
</P>
<P>
   While he was attempting to remove her from her vehicle,
firefighter Frank Gianotto Sr., 50, suffered a heart attack,
Forrest said. He was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University
Hospital in New Brunswick, where he was listed in guarded condition
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two injured women also were taken to the same hospital,
where Sogliuzzo was listed in guarded condition, and Kovacs was
treated for multiple injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining the possibility that Williams car
might have swerved to avoid hitting a goose in the road. A dead
goose was found at the scene, Forrest said.

which was sparked by encouraging remarks about the economy from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Dow on Thursday rose
147.79 and the Nasdaq gained 128.93.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a typical summer Friday with profit-taking and low
volume,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co.
The tone of the market will still be positive in the days ahead
because investors are confident the Fed is done raising interest
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several earnings disappointments added to Friday's selling,
particularly in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   One was from Agilent Technologies, the computer products maker
spinoff of Hewlett-Packard, which late Thursday said it expects
third-quarter earnings to fall short of expectations. Shares of
Agilent tumbled $25.625 to $47.375 and Dow component
Hewlett-Packard fell $4.625 to $123.375.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cell-phone and telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson
said third-quarter profits will fall below the first- and
second-quarter levels. Shares of Ericsson fell $2.75 to $19.813.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology losers on Friday included Intel, down $4.50 to
$138.188 and IBM, off $2.562 to $114.438.
</P>
<P>
   ''What today emphasizes is this market is still trading in a
range, rather than showing signs of moving sharply higher,'' said
Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   While investors have stopped worrying about the Fed raising
interest rates, traders instead are now choosing to worry about how
the slowing economy is cutting into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking at an environment where earnings growth is
decelerating,'' Cripps said, noting the companies in the S&AMP;P are
seeing profits rise on average by 10 percent instead of the 20
percent in prior years.
</P>
<P>
   Some big names, though, produced upside surprises on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter earnings surged 75 percent at Sun Microsystems,
as it beat Wall Street expectations amid heavy demand for its
Internet hardware and software. Sun rose $5.937 to $104.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dow component Eastman Kodak met Wall Street's
earnings estimates and predicted it would beat third-quarter profit
estimates as well. Shares of Kodak slipped $1.875 cents to $58.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.17
billion shares, down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 12.05 at 522.70.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.01 percent,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.43 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 1.40 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.52 percent.

<HEADLINE> Navy Takes Vieques Offensive to Web  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The Battle of Vieques has escalated
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with what it calls ''untruths'' and ''outrageous
statements,'' the U.S. Navy launched a bilingual Internet site
Friday in an offensive to retain its 50-year-old Atlantic fleet
training ground on Puerto Rico's Vieques island.
</P>
<P>
   Activists are trying to stop the Navy's use the range, claiming
bombing practice harms residents, and Puerto Rico's government is
trying to persuade Vieques voters to kick the Navy out in a
referendum expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered the referendum in a deal to end a
standoff between protesters and the Navy, which has used Vieques
for battle-conditions practice before sending U.S. servicemen
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy hopes to convince Vieques' 9,400 residents that it can
be a good neighbor and will be 20 years down the road. Initial
reaction to the Web site has been mixed, said Navy spokesman Lt.
Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've done a great job of getting the facts out to the
public!'' raved one browser in an e-mail to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get the hell out of my country ... noooooooooooowwww!'' said
another.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been a lot of outrageous statements and untruths
made about the Navy,'' Gordon said. ''This is the first step to
correct the record.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Navy has been a political scapegoat for too long,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the site's ''Fact vs. Fiction'' page, the Navy notes that
there has never been a study of islander's health based on
empirical data. Critics often say Vieques residents have a much
higher incidence of cancer than other Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Kevin Green, commander of the Navy's Southern Command,
was posted to Puerto Rico to head the public relations effort,
which Navy officials acknowledge had been less than stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Green has spoken to civic groups and published columns in the
English-language San Juan Star. Spanish-language columns are
planned for other, more widely read newspapers, said Gordon, the
Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, where the average household income is $6,400, there
may not be many computers for residents to read the Navy's message.
Gordon said he hoped every resident would read its contents,
getting it from friends or from old-fashioned hard copies.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said more than 90 percent of the 200 demonstrators
arrested in anti-Navy protests during June bombing exercises were
not Vieques residents. He also noted that more than 6,000 Puerto
Ricans serve in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those arrested were charged with trespassing on the
Vieques range during the demonstrations. Exercises had been
suspended in April 1999 when a civilian security guard was killed
in an accidental bombing, sparking protests laced with
anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a U.S. judge sentenced 24 independence activists to
time already served in jail for trespassing. The activists,
arrested in the last two to three weeks, had refused to post bail,
saying they didn't recognize the U.S. court.
</P>
<P>
   ''To correct the record we obviously have a long way to go,''
Gordon said. The Web site ''is a 'holistic' approach to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials, however, were chagrined this week when San Juan
Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves send a letter of support to the
jailed activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Christ is with you in jail in a particularly dramatic fashion,
exactly as he was before Pontius Pilate, representative of a
colonial power that didn't respect the identity of the people,''
Gonzalez Nieves said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said they were ''disappointed'' by his remarks.

<HEADLINE> Farmers reporting better crops, still facing low prices  </HEADLINE>
By DERRICK HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey crops are doing better this
summer compared to last year's drought that ravaged an estimated
two-thirds of field corn and about 25 percent of the state's
soybean production.
</P>
<P>
   More rain has fallen this year, and farmers say that has eased
the need to irrigate some crops. However, growers also continue to
face continued low market prices for commodities, some of which are
approaching 30-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in better shape - if the trend continues and the
conditions continue,'' said Mark Hudson, deputy state statistician.
Hudson said state agriculture agents reported moisture has been
mostly adequate in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, weekly rainfall this time in 1999 averaged about
0.17 inches in northern New Jersey, 0.2 inches in the central part
of the state and about 0.64 inches in the south, according to a
1999 weekly crop progress report from the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The same progress report for this week shows rainfall averaged
1.69 inches in the north, 1.26 inches in the central New Jersey and
1.32 inches in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 numbers also show rain has fallen mostly above average
in southern New Jersey and a mix of above or below average in the
central and northern parts of the state. The progress reports
measure rainfall from March 1 through the growing season of both
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were having a little more timely rains, which were
helpful,'' said Chris Probasco, 55, who operates the 1,200-acre
Probasco Farms just outside of Chesterfield Township in Burlington
County. The farm grows field corn, soybeans and wheat, among other
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Probasco said that last year he had to irrigate from the end of
May until mid-August. But this year, he so far has irrigated only
three weeks - from the end of June into July.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers also reported their crops are looking better than last
year, when intense heat shriveled most crops, many farmers took
losses and farming officials estimated New Jersey growers needed
about $800 million in federal aid to help them recover.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, this season, the yields are very good. The farmers
are optimistic and are hoping for good prices,'' said Ray Samulis,
an agent of Rutgers Cooperative Extension of Burlington County.
</P>
<P>
   Crop progress reports, which are compiled through on-site visits
to growers, showed field corn crop condition being rated as 47
percent fair, 28 percent good and 25 percent excellent this week.
But a 1999 report from the same week shows field corn rated as only
good, fair and poor in various portions of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture data show New Jersey farms produced about 9 million
bushels of corn for grain in 1998. But last year's crop after the
summer sizzler was about only one-third that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the hay crop in 1998 totaled about 240,000 tons. Last
year's estimate was 204,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean production also was down about 14 percent from the 1998
total of 3.2 million bushels.
</P>
<P>
   But wheat production, which was expected to fall 17 percent from
1998's 2.3 million bushels, instead rebounded by 0.8 percent in
1999. There also was a record year for barely. Small grains such as
wheat and barley usually are harvested in during June and July and
so weren't affected by the length of the drought.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the better conditions, farmers still must deal with low
cash prices for their crops, especially for corn, soybeans and
wheat. Cash price are not adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary numbers from the United States Department of
Agriculture indicate the cash price received for a bushel of corn
in 1999 was $1.90. The cash price in 1971 was $1.08. That's
approaching a 30-year low, said Charles VanLahr, a USDA
statistician.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans, which in 1971 had a cash price of $3.03 per bushel,
had a cash price of $4.75 in 1999. That's the lowest since 1972's
$4.37 figure.
</P>
<P>
   And wheat, which in 1971 sold for a cash price of $1.34 a
bushel, last year sold for $2.55 a bushel, the lowest cash price
since the $2.42 level in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA earlier this month also said farmers likely would get
an average of $1.70 per bushel for their corn this year. That's 15
cents less than its June projection and 20 cents below what growers
got for last year's corn crop.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate for wheat also was down 15 cents from the June
forecast to $2.50 a bushel, 5 cents below the price growers
received for their 1999 crop. The projection for soybeans was off
10 cents from June's estimate, to $4.40 a bushel, and down 35 cents
from last year's average.
</P>
<P>
   Economists with the USDA also said they expected to see such low
prices for a few months more.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Tries To Remake Image  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- George Speight, the man who led Fiji's coup
and took the prime minister and dozens of legislators hostage for
two months, is trying to remake his image.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing at poolside with his closest supporters and advisers
between political meetings Friday, he told The Associated Press
that he no longer wants to be called a rebel, a terrorist, or a
thug -- even as he called on indigenous peoples to unite and join
forces with Australia's Aborigines to disrupt the Olympic Games in
Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
   Those labels are just some of the tags, some unprintable,
attached to him while he has been trumpeting the cause of
guaranteeing superiority for indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our desires and our objectives and our wishes for our future
in our country cannot be denied and must be respected, regardless
of how unconstitutional and undemocratic it might be to everyone
else,'' Speight said, unrepentant about throwing out Fiji's 1997
multiracial constitution and disenfranchising ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Though unwelcome in Australia and New Zealand, Speight has an
amnesty for his actions at home and claims he only reflects public
opinion. Therefore, he now wants to be known as a ''crusader for
Fijian rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's interview, he acted more like a rock star with a
posse, wearing sunglasses indoors for breakfast, then relaxing for
photographers and holding court on everything from his hopes of
spreading his message in the Pacific to how his golf game has
probably suffered after so much time away from the links.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's very appearance at the Centra Hotel, where most
foreign journalists have been staying, was something of a shock and
reflects efforts to transform his persona from dangerous man to
astute politico, with suggestions of legal action against those who
keep calling him a rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the media's influence in his battle for support,
Speight frequently had made himself available at parliament, which
he and his men stormed May 19 and grabbed hostages. He freed his
last 18 captives July 13 as part of a deal that will strip the
political power of ethnic Indians, who comprise 44 percent of
814,000 population but dominate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the coup, Britain on Friday joined Australia, New
Zealand and the United States in imposing sanctions on the Pacific
nation to force it to return to democracy. The Foreign Office in
London announced the cancellation of its assistance programs to
Fiji and planned military visits, as well as export licenses for
some military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his supporters moved out of parliament Thursday and
set up camp in a primary school complex seven miles away, but few
reporters were willing to make the trip to a place where security
looked even more dicey.
</P>
<P>
   So Speight stopped first Friday morning at a coffee shop, where
he quickly drew attention, then headed for the Centra, where the
militancy in his message seemed a little less strident, even if the
gist of it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to make a call to all ethnic people in the South
Pacific to stand up and exert their rights,'' Speight told the AP.
''It's quite possible we could disrupt the whole Olympic Games with
our aboriginal brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian police and Olympic authorities declined comment on
the threat, and an Aboriginal leader said she had not contacted
Speight on the matter and described his joining planned Aboriginal
protests as ''highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Speight has vowed to fade into the background once a
Fijian government acceptable to him is seated, his clear love of
the spotlight makes that too seem highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have been flying about what's going on behind the scenes
since new President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, the frail 80-year-old
tribal chief with Parkinson's disease, indefinitely postponed the
swearing in of a new Cabinet on Tuesday. Speight compared it to a
water polo match, where most of the action takes place unseen
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Iloilo went on national radio Friday to appeal for unity, amid
increasing turmoil in Fiji and prospects that rival governments
could emerge. The official reason for the delay was Iloilo's
illness, but it also appeared that Speight had managed to
orchestrate a boycott by some new ministers allied with him.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors include the possibility of a second coup -- there were two
in 1987 when many of the same issues came up -- with Speight
becoming the country's leader this time, as Sitiveni Rabuka -- one
of Speight's old golf partners, managed after his second takeover
13 years ago.

<HEADLINE> SIDS activists lobby for national attention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Advocates who succeeded in getting a new
law passed in New Jersey that improves research into sudden and
unexplained deaths of infants and toddlers want more states to pass
such laws.
</P>
<P>
   Parents whose children died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and
SIDS researchers Friday held a news conference here to lobby other
states to copy New Jersey's new law.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, signed by Gov. Christie Whitman in May, regulates
autopsies performed on children under the age of 3 who die
suddenly. It also directs the state medical examiner to develop
standardized protocols for those autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Results from standardized autopsies performed by expert
pediatric pathologists will add to the growing body of knowledge
about the mysterious cause of death, bill backers said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, some 2,500 children under the age of 1 die of SIDS
annually, and another 200 toddlers over 12 months of age also die
suddenly and without explanation, according to Laura Crandall of
Montclair, whose 15-month-old daughter Maria died suddenly in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   SIDS research would be jump-started considerably if expert
standardized autopsies were performed on all those children, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every one of our children deserves the right to tell us what
went wrong,'' she said. ''And they deserve the chance to prevent
other children from dying far too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Hinnen, director of the SIDS Center of New
Jersey at the Hackensack Medical Center, California has a law on
the books that provides for more thorough autopsies on infants, but
not toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   New York State is considering legislation as far reaching as New
Jersey's, he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Suggests Children in War Rules  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations outlined
recommendations Friday to better protect children caught in war,
saying they have increasingly become the ''innocent victims of the
persistent gap between law and practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The 55 proposals cover a range of issues confronting children in
war zones, including their recruitment into armies, their risk of
harm from land mines and their vulnerability to sanctions applied
in times of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that some 300,000 children have
been recruited, mostly by rebel groups, to fight wars from Sierra
Leone to Sri Lanka. UNICEF data indicates that between 1986 and
1996, wars killed 2 million children, injured 6 million and left 1
million orphaned.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a report to the Security
Council that a key starting point to reduce those numbers would be
if all governments ratified the core treaties and protocols on
protecting children and for rebel groups to also respect their
standards.
</P>
<P>
   He asked countries that support rebel factions -- with military,
political financial or other aid -- to condition their assistance on
compliance with those norms. And he suggested that corporations be
asked to develop voluntary codes of conduct concerning trade with
countries or other partners responsible for gross violations of
children's rights.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that people who commit genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity on children should not be offered amnesty
as part of peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His core recommendations are expected to be negotiated by the
Security Council and then translated into a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Annan also urged the council to take into
consideration the ''unintended consequences'' of sanctions on
children when it debates whether to place embargoes on countries.
He suggested the council deploy assessment missions to targeted
countries to determine how embargoes might affect the civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
   ''The potential long-term benefits of sanctions should be
weighed against the immediate and long-term costs to children,''
Annan said, citing the collapse of education and health
infrastructures and increase in infant mortality rates associated
with some sanctions regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suffering of Iraqi children, as reported by UNICEF, and of
children in the Balkans are troubling cases in point,'' Annan
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The report also addressed ways the Security Council could help
children recover from wars. Annan urged that their needs be taken
into account when designing peace agreements, ensuring that child
combatants are reintegrated back into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   Girls should be given particular attention to ensure that they
receive equal access to education and job training, Annan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He said children are disproportionately at risk from being
maimed or killed by land mines and urged more money for mine
clearance and education programs.

<HEADLINE> Homemade Gas Masks a Trend in Peru  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Recycling plastic bottles is the newest rage
in this Andean capital -- not to protect the environment, but to
protect against choking tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police have shown little hesitation to use noxious gas to
disperse frequent protests, large and small, since President
Alberto Fujimori claimed a third term victory May 28 in an election
marred by irregularities and fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
   This week, street vendors in the capital's historic center
started selling homemade gas masks fashioned from bottles, tape and
vinegar-soaked cushioning from old mattresses. The cost: the
equivalent of about 30 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sign of the times,'' said political scientist Fernando
Rospigliosi. ''It's been a long time since we've seen such forceful
protests in Lima and such a willingness by the police to respond by
lobbing gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition newspapers La Republica and Liberacion reported
Friday that police have stockpiled seven different types of tear
gas in preparation for a massive three-day protest planned for next
week to disrupt Fujimori's July 28 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate who boycotted the
runoff vote, alleging Fujimori was planning to rig the result, had
originally called for 4 million people to take part in the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   But march organizers say they now hope to see about 100,000
people converge on the city from Peru's Andes, northern and
southern coast and Amazon jungle, to augment some 200,000
protesters from inside the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has said he will not declare a state of emergency or
curfew to thwart the marchs.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I can say is the police will guarantee internal security
so long as the marches are conducted in a peaceful manner, without
effecting private property,'' Fujimori told reporters Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mental health report: More agency collaboration needed  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland says he will form a
permanent council to oversee the state's mental health care system,
following a recommendation from a panel assembled to examine the
treatment of the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Friday, the Blue Ribbon Commission on
Mental Health also recommended more collaboration among state
agencies that deal with the mentally ill, more emphasis on
community-based services and greater attention to individual
patient needs.
</P>
<P>
   In its 205-page report, the commission outlined the need for
better management and financing of mental health services, more
public mental health education and expanded access to care.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members said they are especially concerned with the
large numbers of people in Connecticut who need mental health
services but are not getting them.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that many general hospitals are reducing
psychiatric services. At the same time, thousands of people with
mental illness and substance abuse problems are living in homeless
shelters. Some children needing residential or outpatient care are
being treated instead in emergency rooms, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has asked the commission to get back to him by Oct. 15
with specific ideas on how to change the system.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said both the governor and
legislative leaders have agreed to make the issue a priority. He
said the governor is already considering appointments to a
permanent Mental Health Policy Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its an issue that's always been on the agenda,'' Pagani said.
''Now is the time to tackle this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Amour, president of the Connecticut chapter of the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill said the report ''cogently
presents what the problems are and what the solutions are.''
</P>
<P>
   Amour said she is ''cautiously hopeful'' that Connecticut's
mental health system now will be reformed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This can't be stuck in a box again,'' she said. ''We can't let
that happen. With our wealth, to have these kinds of deplorable
conditions for sick people, is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stone, the executive director of the Center for
Children's Advocacy at the University of Connecticut School of Law,
said she's heard promises of reform since 1989, and hopes this time
they will be realized.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been frustrating over the years to look at the land of
steady habits, task force report after task force report,'' said .
''But, I never give up hope so I don't want to say it's not going
to be this time around.''

<HEADLINE> Editor of 'Hacker Quarterly' defends his motives for publishing software </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A man accused by the motion picture industry of
trying to sabotage its efforts to prevent DVDs from being copied on
computers says he is a journalist, not a computer expert, and he
provides a public service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never taken a computer course or anything like that,''
Eric Corley told U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan during two
days of testimony that concluded Friday in a civil trial in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't consider myself a computer expert. I consider myself a
journalist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, hearing the case without a jury, must decide whether
the eight major movie studios can stop Corley from making software
available online or posting links to it so that people can copy
DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan already has issued a temporary restraining order which
forced Corley to remove the software from his site but links remain
which allow visitors to find the software elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Corley, 40, testified that he did not know if the program worked
but felt an obligation to provide it to the public as the editor
and publisher of the Web site 2600.com and the print publication
''2600: The Hacker Quarterly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Honestly, if someone had given me 20 random numbers and said,
'This is the program,' we would have printed the 20 random numbers,
if that's what everybody was talking about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corley said he has published the hacker magazine since 1984, two
years after graduating from the State University of New York with a
bachelor of arts in English. He established the online site in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he has attracted interest from CIA agents,
foreign intelligence experts and corporate executives, in part
because they want to know the weaknesses in security developed to
protect electronics and computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine has published articles on how electronic mail can
be spied upon and how cellular telephone calls can be intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   He said the magazine and Web site do not try to preach morality
but instead seek to print information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ''We don't print articles that espouse
destruction or immature acts or just various bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   The articles keep corporations and the government on their toes
and help to identify weaknesses in the security of various forms of
electronics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a big moral discussion about what is going to
happen with information we print because the information is already
out there,'' he said. ''We like to think by printing this
information, we wake people up.''
</P>
<P>
   On cross examination, Corley conceded to Leon P. Gold, the
lawyer for the movie studios, that he used his Web site to
encourage others to also publish the software that can descramble
the code meant to protect DVDs from being copied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was it described as a free DVD decoder that allows people to
copy DVDs?'' Gold asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Corley answered, though he added that the software
actually was much more complicated than he had made it seem in his
description of it on the Web site.

<HEADLINE> Talks break down between Screen Actors Guild and advertisers  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON L. CRENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Talks between two actors' unions and the
advertisers they've been on strike against since May broke down
Friday with no reported progress and no new sessions scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists announced the stalemate just a day
after federal mediators sought to jump-start the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''SAG and AFTRA brought their full 26-member negotiation team
back to New York in hopes that substantive discussion could begin
on the many issues between the unions and the ad industry in this
contract,'' John McGuire, SAG's chief negotiator said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unions significantly modified their key cable proposal.
The advertisers refused to make any changes in any of their
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Shepard, a top negotiator for the advertisers, did not
immediately return a telephone message left at his Washington, D.C.
office.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and AFTRA went on strike May 1 against the advertising
industry, seeking to protect residuals, or fees paid each time a
radio or television commercial is broadcast on a major network.
Advertisers want to replace residuals with flat-fee payments.
</P>
<P>
   The two unions have a combined membership of 135,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to us that the ad industry feels no remorse about
putting so many thousands of our members and so many thousands of
people in professions affiliated with commercial production - such
as camera operators, agents, casting directors and caterers - out
of work,'' said AFTRA President Shelby Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is the first major Hollywood walkout in 12 years. It
affects only radio and TV commercials, not movies or television
series.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have signed interim agreements with some
organizations making commercials during the strike, with the
businesses agreeing to pay actors on a ''pay-per-play'' basis.
Earlier this month, actors protested in dozens of cities and
targeted AT&AMP;T, one of the major firms that has made nonunion
commercials during the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also disrupted a shoot in Brooklyn, where Republican
presidential hopeful George W. Bush's campaign was taping an ad.

<HEADLINE> South Jersey Democrats voice support for Torricelli  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Ten prominent Democrats from southern New
Jersey said in a combined statement Friday they want U.S. Sen.
Robert Torricelli to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, who has a national reputation as a party
fund-raiser, said Wednesday he is considering the chance to succeed
Republican Gov. Christie Whitman, who is barred from seeking a
third term.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Democrats included several state legislators,
municipal officials, party leaders including retired Congressman
William J. Hughes and Atlantic City Mayor Jim Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our party needs a visionary, and I'm confident that Bob's
tremendous abilities assures us a victory in 2001,'' Hughes said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Until Torricelli's announcement, Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey
had been the party's likely nominee. McGreevey had been preparing
to run since his narrow 1997 loss to Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats say Torricelli can repair the rift between
party members, now split into factions from North and South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a governor who can produce for all regions of New
Jersey, urban, suburban and rural. Bob Torricelli will be that kind
of governor,'' Whelan said.

<HEADLINE> Sara Jane Olson Reflects on Life  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- By the time the FBI caught up with her, Sara
Jane Olson had stopped thinking about the fact that she had been a
wanted fugitive for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were times I thought about it, but not all the time. I
assumed if somebody stumbled across me,'' she said, her voice
trailing off in mid-sentence.'' ''Now it's all that I think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson's words often trail off or dissolve into nervous laughter
as she tries to express herself a year after her life as a
Minnesota housewife, mother, actress and community volunteer was
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ''FBI, Kathleen. It's over,'' said the agent who stopped her
minivan on a St. Paul street. He called her by her given name,
Kathleen Ann Soliah, a name she had not used for many years. She
was being arrested on 1976 conspiracy charges in a failed plot to
kill Los Angeles police officers by planting pipe bombs under
patrol cars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Her second life had ended and a third life had begun as a world
famous defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently released from a court gag order, Olson, 53, was
still reluctant to discuss much. She is scared, she said, that in
some Kafkaesque finale to her story she will be doomed to spend the
rest of her life in prison for a crime she didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thinking about where I'm going to be in 15 years,'' she
said Friday. ''I'm not interested in any celebrity status, and
media is to me a distraction. I don't want anyone to know anything
about me. ... Until I was thrust into this I was nobody and I
remain nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   But she knows that is a futile wish. Her story is of interest to
many people. She is a reminder of the '70s era of revolution around
San Francisco Bay and the Symbionese Liberation Army which became
famous with the Patty Hearst kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason this case is attracting attention is because
of the presence of Patricia Hearst,'' Olson said. She assumes that
Hearst, now a mother and actress, has no more desire than Olson
does to be embroiled in the long-ago saga of the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think she would come (to court) if she wasn't forced
to,'' said Olson. ''...This isn't a contest. This isn't a fight
between me and Patricia Hearst. We're both pawns. We're both being
used for somebody else's ends.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees no personal enmity between her and Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it became personal it would be a matter of survival.
Everybody has to survive,'' she said. ''But I can't think of any
reason she'd want to get me. And I don't want to get anybody. I
just want to get off, to be vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her arrest, she has tried to maintain a normal life with
her husband, Dr. Fred Peterson, and their three teen-age daughters.
But she said that is all but impossible. She frequently flies
between St. Paul and California where her lawyers are preparing for
her trial in January. And she has appeared at a number of benefits
to raise money for her defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a life in limbo,'' she said. ''I've never been on so many
airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   When she is at home, she said, she and her husband inevitably
return to one subject of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ''My 13-year-old said the other day, 'All you ever talk about is
this stupid case.'''
</P>
<P>
   What would she do if she was acquitted?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd go back to school, maybe get a master of fine arts
degree,'' she said. ''But we just don't plan.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, she said, ''I don't think I'll ever act
again. People would come for the wrong reasons.''

<HEADLINE> Princeton TB cases show suburbs aren't immune to the airborne disease </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two new tuberculosis cases in Princeton
show the airborne infection isn't limited to urban slums and prove
government must keep up efforts to control the world's most deadly
infectious disease, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''People shouldn't be surprised that tuberculosis is coming to
the suburbs. I'm surprised it hasn't happened before,'' Dr. Lee B.
Reichman, executive director of the New Jersey Medical School
National Tuberculosis Center in Newark, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials say the Princeton cases, both diagnosed
within the last couple months, are unrelated. One patient, a
Princeton Borough woman who emigrated within the last year from
Southeast Asia, is being treated for a tuberculosis strain
resistant to multiple antibiotics, which requires much longer and
more difficult and expensive care.
</P>
<P>
   The other patient, a Princeton man who emigrated from Southeast
Asia about 20 years ago, is being treated for a nonresistant
strain.
</P>
<P>
   Tests so far show neither has spread the bacterial infection,
which is transmitted by respiratory secretions that can linger in
the air for hours; catching it requires prolonged, close contact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, news of the cases in affluent suburbs has disapproved a
common stereotype - and stunned some local residents and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''People like to say, 'Well, that's not my problem because it
happens to people in Newark or Jersey City or Trenton,''' said
Reichman, one of the world's top tuberculosis experts. ''That's
such a wrong idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis, which generally targets the lungs, can ''hide''
there dormant for decades, but in about 10 percent of people it
eventually becomes active when something weakens their immune
system. Symptoms include night sweats, shortness of breath, and
coughing up green or yellow sputum, sometimes streaked with blood.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's biggest cities once had some of the highest TB
rates in the country, but rates statewide have dropped dramatically
for seven straight years. From a peak of 984 cases in 1992,
incidence dropped to 571 cases last year, including about a
half-dozen that were multidrug-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   That's due to nearly level government funding for programs to
treat patients and trace and test their contacts, and a highly
successful strategy called ''Directly Observed Therapy.'' Health
workers from about 10 hospitals and health departments around the
state visit patients daily for months to ensure they take their
medicine religiously and don't develop multidrug-resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton patients almost definitely were infected in Asia,
where crowded living conditions and poor health care make
tuberculosis much more common, and entered this country before the
infection became active, according to Ken Shilkret, manager of the
tuberculosis program at the New Jersey Department of Health and
Senior Services.
</P>
<P>
   Because TB still kills about 2 million people worldwide each
year, including about 1,100 in this country, efforts to control in
it in the developing world are one of the topics at this weekend's
''G-8'' summit of wealthy industrialized nations. Nearly one-third
of the world's population has been ''silently'' infected by TB.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you control TB in developing nations, you control TB in the
United States,'' Reichman said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients require daily treatment for 6 to 9 months with the best
antibiotics for tuberculosis, rifampin and isoniazid, along with a
couple other medications.
</P>
<P>
   But if a patient misses some pills or stops taking them
altogether when they start to feel better, as many patients do, the
bacteria can quickly mutate into resistant strains. Treatment then
requires an 18- to 24-month regimen of several other drugs that are
less effective but have much worse side effects, including possible
deafness, seizures and psychotic behavior, Reichman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, TB cases soared from 1985 to 1992, when
the federal government restored funding for TB control eliminated
in the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we look at history, when the disease is on the decline,
they eliminate the program before they eliminate the disease,''
Shilkret said. ''We need sustained funding over a long period of
time to not only deal with active cases but ensure'' people exposed
to the bacteria get preventive treatment.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Women Seek Respect  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Banging spoons against pots, hundreds of
women marched down a main boulevard in Mexico City on Friday to
demand men share domestic chores and to publicize a one-day
household work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters -- maids, farmers, housewives and professional
workers -- demanded the government ban sexist depictions of
''women's work'' from textbooks, and calculate the value of
household work into in official economic figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''No woman should lift a finger on July 22,'' said Dunia
Rodriguez Garcia, one of the organizers of the march and Saturday's
work stoppage. Rodriguez Garcia did not offer an estimate on how
many women would take part in the strike, first held in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   July 22 was designated International Housework Day by the 1995
U.N. international women's conference in Beijing
</P>
<P>
   A few men showed up at the march carrying placards reading ''I'm
ready to share the housework.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I help my girlfriend with the chores,'' said Luis Cela de la
Vega, a 30-year-old retail employee. ''This idea that men don't
have to work in the house is a very deep-rooted.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to work in the fields, work another job to make ends
meet, and then come home and do everything at home,'' said Blanca
Reina, who farms potatoes and alfalfa in Milpa Alta, one of Mexico
City's few rural precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our husbands only work one job, and they don't bring home much
money from it,'' said Reina. ''But they have the right to relax,
while we don't have the right to feel tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Mexico City's Program for Equal Participation of
Women have shown Mexican men are among the least likely to do
housework among Latin American countries, although an increasing
percentage of Mexican women work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   For the estimated 1.7 million maids who work in Mexico City
homes, respect for housework is also a class issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of disrespectful names used for maids, so we
consulted our members and decided they should be called 'home
employees','' said Gaudencia Valdez, of La Esperanza, a maids'
association.
</P>
<P>
   ''Home employees don't get health care, benefits, or vacation,''
Valdez said. ''Our work must be recognized as being equal to any
other kind of job.''

<HEADLINE> Scientology Papers Inquiry Begins  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Prosecutors opened an investigation Friday into the
disappearance of hundreds of documents that were to be used as
evidence in a case against Church of Scientology members, judicial
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were expected in the coming days to name a special
magistrate to carry out the investigation, the officials said,
speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The dossiers, which disappeared in 1998 from the Justice
Ministry, were part of a case opened in 1990 against 16 regional
Scientology leaders for alleged fraud, illegal practice of medicine
and premeditated violence.
</P>
<P>
   The case stemmed from a complaint by a former Scientologist,
Juan Esteban Cordero, who accused the Church of Scientology of
''progressive mental conditioning'' that led him to spend more than
$177,000 on Scientology-related courses.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the ministry said it had asked the judicial watchdog
organization to investigate Judge Marie-Paule Moracchini, who was
handling the Scientology case when certain records were lost and
others destroyed. She risks possible disciplinary sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou has said she believed fraud
was involved in the dossiers' disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Scientology's French headquarters could not be
reached for comment late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   France has long had a contentious relationship with the Los
Angeles-based Church of Scientology, which is seeking recognition
as a legitimate religion in Europe. In France, the Church of
Scientology figures on a list of 173 groups that should be tracked
to prevent cult activities.
</P>
<P>
   A Paris court decided in September to go ahead with the case
against the Scientologists despite the loss of the documents.

<HEADLINE> Kazak President Signs Bill for Self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- Kazakstan's president has signed a law
granting himself wide-ranging privileges once he leaves office,
including immunity from criminal prosecution, a spokesman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The law, initiated by his supporters in parliament, strengthens
Nursultan Nazarbayev's dominance of this Central Asian nation.
Parliament passed the bill last month, and Nazarbayev signed it
Thursday, his press service said.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev will have lifetime immunity for any crimes he might
commit while in office, except for high treason, spokesman Lev
Tarakov said. Nazarbayev's second and final term ends in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The law also provides immunity from search and seizure of
Nazarbayev's residence, office, cars, documents and communication
devices.
</P>
<P>
   He will have a permanent seat on Kazakstan's influential
Security Council and be able to address parliament and the Cabinet
when he desires, according to the law. It also guarantees lifetime
personal security protection and pensions for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev launched limited democratic reforms in the first
years after the 1991 Soviet collapse. But in 1995 he dissolved
parliament and pushed through a referendum expanding his powers,
and he has been accused of stifling the opposition and repressing
the free press.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev easily won a second, seven-year term in January 1999,
in an election that was criticized by international monitors and
opposition leaders as rife with fraud.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Improve Gay Policy  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military's much-criticized policy on
homosexuals in uniform is working, but training must be improved to
eliminate anti-gay behavior like the abuse that led to a soldier's
murder in Kentucky last year, the Defense Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we've got it right this time,'' Carol DiBattiste, the
undersecretary of the Air Force, told a news conference to
publicize a new Pentagon program to re-emphasize in training that
such behavior is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the same news conference, Bernard Rostker, the
undersecretary of defense, said he disagreed with President
Clinton's statement last year, after the beating death of Pfc.
Barry Winchell by a fellow soldier at Fort Campbell, Ky., that
implementation of his policy on gays was ''out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't agree with that characterization. I think the policy
is working reasonably well to provide a degree of safety'' for gays
in uniform, Rostker said. ''The days of witch hunts, the days of
stakeouts, are really gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rostker said, more needs to be done to ensure that
everyone in the military understands the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's policy on gays in the military is
derived from a law passed in 1993 after Clinton failed to persuade
Congress and the Pentagon to allow gays to serve openly. The
policy, known as ''don't ask, don't tell,'' holds that gays can
serve in uniform so long as they don't reveal their sexual
orientation. One problem, however, has been unwarranted
investigations of people suspected of being homosexual. There also
is a fear among discreetly gay service members that if they
complain about harassment, they will be discharged.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announced plan to eliminate anti-gay behavior was
created by a panel of civilian and military officials led by
DiBattiste of the Air Force. It was in response to a Pentagon
inspector general's report in March that found anti-gay behavior
was commonplace in the military.
</P>
<P>
   DiBattiste said the key to her panel's plan is adoption of an
''overarching principle'' meant to clarify to all in the military
that unacceptable behavior includes not just abuse of gays but also
''inappropriate comments or gestures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the high road that we need to take,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The DiBattiste panel's 13-point ''action plan'' is largely
reiteration of previous expressions of determination to stamp out
anti-gay behavior and to hold military commanders responsible for
policy infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Rostker's predecessor in the undersecretary's
post, Rudy de Leon, issued a statement that ''harassment of service
members for any reason, to include alleged or perceived
homosexuality, will not be tolerated,'' and commanders must take
prompt action against violators.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, an executive director of the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Fund, an advocate for gay rights in the military and
a frequent critic of Pentagon policy, called the DiBattiste panel's
report ''thoughtful and considered.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's recommendations, if implemented, would be a very good
start,'' Benecke said.
</P>
<P>
   The spark that caused the Pentagon to take a closer look at the
gay policy's implementation, and at the extent of anti-gay behavior
in the field, was the Winchell murder at Fort Campbell on July 5,
1999. Two of Winchell's fellow soldiers were convicted in the crime
and are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, released the Army
inspector general's report Friday on circumstances surrounding the
Winchell murder. The report concluded that some members of D
Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, Winchell's unit in
the 101st Airborne Division, violated the military's policy against
anti-gay behavior, but it exonerated all commanders at Fort
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The Army report also concluded no general climate of homophobia
existed at Fort Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions, ''It was determined that the command
climate at Fort Campbell before 5 July 1999 was a positive
environment,'' the inspector general's report said. It also said
the chain of command at Fort Campbell ''responded appropriately''
when confronted with situations that appeared to violate the
''don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., questioned these conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giving Fort Campbell a relatively clean bill of health doesn't
square with recent reports of prevalent anti-gay harassment
throughout the services,'' Meehan said.

<HEADLINE> 19 Die in Egypt Factory Collapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Emergency workers pulled more bodies Friday
from under the debris of a clothing factory in northern Egypt that
collapsed this week after a fire, bringing the death toll to at
least 19 people.
</P>
<P>
   Five bodies were found Friday in the wreckage of the factory in
in the low-income Alexandria suburb of Izbat Saad, but there were
conflicting reports of how high that brought the death toll.
</P>
<P>
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said 19 bodies had been recovered
since Wednesday's fire and the subsequent collapse of the six-story
clothing factory in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. The
ministry, however, provided names of 20 people said to have been
pulled from the debris. The spokesman could not explain the
discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials on Friday quoted rescue teams on the site as
saying 21 bodies had been retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Muwasa Hospital in Alexandria said Thursday
that at least 38 people were injured, with most of them treated for
smoke inhalation or back, shoulder and neck injuries sustained in
the collapse. Several had been released quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Senior civil defense official Omar el-Benawy said Thursday that
firefighters were investigating the cause of the fire when the
building collapsed. The dead included the commander of Alexandria's
fire brigade, Mohammed Ragaei, and another high-ranking fire
brigade official, Ibrahim Abdel Qader.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Lebanon Violations Checked  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOULA, Lebanon (AP) -- U.N. and Lebanese officers on Friday
wrapped up weeks of meticulous checks and measurements aiming to
verify an end to Israeli violations of the U.N.-drawn frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Amin Hoteit, head of the Lebanese team, said the
verification process had been completed, and that some violations
had been resolved. In past weeks, Israeli military has moved posts
back behind the border, stopped patrols and moved back its fence in
places along the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoteit refused to say if all Israeli violations of the
border line had been rectified, telling The Associated Press that
results would be announced later. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said
Friday that Israel had fixed all but two of those violations.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the mission -- which took weeks of surveying the
border line in scorching sun and amid minefields -- came ahead of an
expected visit Sunday to Beirut by U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen to
discuss the next step, deployment of U.N. peacekeepers along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has balked at consenting to the peacekeepers or
deploying its own forces in the area until Israel ends its
violations of the border.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. cartographers drew the border line last month after Israel
withdrew from the zone in southern Lebanon it had occupied for 18
years. Anti-Israeli guerrillas have taken effective control of the
vacated zone.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended the
Security Council extend the mandate for the peacekeepers, but only
on the understanding that the Lebanese government will strengthen
its forces there.
</P>
<P>
   Annan called for troop contributors to come forward with offers
to increase the current 5,075-strong force, who are currently
deployed outside the vacated zone.
</P>
<P>
   He also had praise for the Hezbollah guerrillas who took control
of the zone but have not since launched cross-border attacks, as
many in Israel had feared. ''The fighters of the Lebanese
resistance conducted themselves in a controlled manner that
deserves to be acknowledged,'' he said in a report to the council.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said Thursday it has notified the United Nations of 172
border violations by Lebanon since the pullback. The Israeli army
said it had filed 49 complaints this week alone for violations,
including stones and metal objects thrown at soldiers and at farm
workers in fields nearby.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, officers worked on both sides of the border.
Accompanied by officers from the Lebanese army, they set out Friday
on the Lebanese side, beginning in the border village of Houla,
which faces the Israeli settlement of Manara.
</P>
<P>
   An area of 430,400 square feet that faces Manara was restored to
Lebanon, a jubilant Hoteit told reporters after posting a Lebanese
flag on a barbed wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   Hoteit said about 193,680 square feet in the village of Honin
have been restored to Lebanon. He also pointed out territory on the
outskirts of the village of Aitaroun that Israel vacated and
returned to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Verification on the Israeli side ended last month. Brig. Gen.
Jim Sreenan, the Irish deputy commander of the U.N. peacekeepers,
said a U.N. team was working on the Israeli side Friday ''to check
some issues that were raised this week.'' He did not elaborate.

	   AMSTERDAM, N.Y. (AP) - Local and federal police raided a city
home Friday and seized heroin worth up to $750,000 on the street.

<P>
   Bako, 28, joined his third team of the season, having hit .239

candidate George W. Bush is seriously considering selecting as his running mate
Dick Cheney, the former Defense Secretary heading up Bush's vice presidential
search team, two highly placed Republican sources said today. One of the
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Cheney has changed his voter
registration from Texas to Wyoming to make him eligible to run with the two-term
Texas governor. Bush's decision is expected as early as Monday, the source said.

U.S. Pushes Israeli Proposal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The United States is promoting an Israeli-initiated
proposal to recognize Palestinian administrative control over Arab neighborhoods
of Jerusalem in a bid to clear the most stubborn obstacle to a Camp David peace
agreement. An Israeli Cabinet officer said in Jerusalem that the proposal
conveyed the ''characteristic'' of Palestinian sovereignty in the eastern area
of the contested city -- a long-cherished Palestinian goal. Hassan Abdel Rahman,
Washington representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said:
''Short of total Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem, there is not a
ground for an agreement.''

East Jerusalem Palestinians Hopeful
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- At the heart of the dispute that nearly scuttled the Camp
David talks, Palestinians in east Jerusalem want the best of both worlds:
Palestinian sovereignty and Israeli social benefits and civil freedoms. Israel
captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it,
extending -- on paper, at least -- almost all the rights of Israeli citizenship
to its residents. Now for the first time, Israeli leaders are publicly airing
their willingness to accept limited Palestinian autonomy over Arab areas of
Jerusalem outside the ancient walled city.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed a Republican bill today that would slash
income taxes for 50 million married couples. The bill invites a veto

prepares for its national convention to nominate George W. Bush. The vote was
60-34 to pass the ''marriage penalty'' bill, with seven Democrats joining all
but one Republican in support.

Danforth Clears Feds Regarding Waco
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The blame for the catastrophe at Waco that killed 80 people
rests solely with cult leader David Koresh, a former senator said today after a
10-month independent investigation. It was the second time in a week that the
government was exonerated. John Danforth concluded ''with 100 percent
certainty'' that federal agents did not start the fire or shoot at members of
the Branch Davidian cult during the 1993 inferno. The government also did not
improperly use the military, and did not engage in a major cover-up, Danforth
said.

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Federal authorities arrested 18 people today and

the terrorist group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Agents made the arrests in raids of

investigators were searching for evidence that the defendants were providing
resources to Hezbollah, but it did not specify how much money the alleged scheme
has funnelled to the group.

Mexican Women Seek Respect
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hundreds of women marched down a main boulevard in Mexico
City on today to demand men share domestic chores and to publicize a one-day
household work stoppage. The protesters -- maids, farmers, housewives and
professional workers -- demanded the government ban sexist depictions of
''women's work'' from textbooks, and calculate the value of household work into
in official economic figures. ''No woman should lift a finger on July 22,'' said
Dunia Rodriguez Garcia, one of the organizers of the march and Saturday's work
stoppage. Rodriguez Garcia did not offer an estimate on how many women would
take part in the strike, first held in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Mine Attack Kills Russian Troops  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NALCHIK, Russia (AP) -- A Russian military truck was blown up by
a land mine Friday, killing four soldiers, in the latest deadly
ambush by Chechen rebels in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Interior Ministry soldiers were injured when the
mine went off in the Shali region, between the capital Grozny and
the southern mountains were rebels are concentrated, the news
agency Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas also ambushed Russian troops in three attacks
Thursday and Friday in Grozny, which Russian forces have claimed to
control since February. Russian officials say many guerrillas have
melted into the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces were searching Grozny for what officials said was
500 or more guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Russian units on the border with the neighboring region of
Dagestan were put on alert because of the upsurge in attacks,
officials said. The last three days have seen a spate of ambushes
in which at least 10 Russian soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels, although outnumbered and outgunned, continue to
mount damaging small attacks on Russian forces. Russian officials
say that the rebels have increased their activity to embarrass
President Vladimir Putin during the Group of Eight summit in
Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Putin's envoy to the region said two warring
pro-Moscow Chechen officials had patched up a dispute that had led
one of them to call his armed followers into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The feud, which demonstrated the difficulties Russia faces in
exerting control over the rebel region, was between Akhmad Kadyrov,
the Kremlin's civilian administrator of Chechnya and his deputy,
Bislan Gantamirov. The two met Friday in the town of Nalchik in the
nearby region of Kabardino-Balkaria.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov had called armed supporters into the Chechen
administrative center of Gudermes on Tuesday and threatened to
search the administration of his boss Kadyrov for guerrilla
fighters seeking independence from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov backed down, but Kadyrov called the threat a
''mutiny.'' Gantamirov had objected to Kadyrov replacing
Gantamirov's supporters as administrators in several towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of today, the conflict between Kadyrov and Gantamirov is
over,'' Viktor Kazantsev, Putin's envoy, said. He said Gantamirov
had ''recognized his mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Gantamirov or Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has struggled to set up an effective pro-Russian Chechen
political force, with independence fighters still appearing to have
a strong following.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war with
independence fighters and Moscow lost control of the region. Troops
returned in September after militants based in Chechnya attacked
villages in Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in apartment
bombings the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   While the NFL sack champion considered a holdout, the
NFL career
sack leader is attempting a comeback.
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Louis' Kevin Carter, who had 17 sacks last year, debated
about holding out of training camp, which began Friday, without a
new deal before deciding to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reggie White, 38, agreed in principle Friday with the
Carolina Panthers to end his one-year retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is entering the final year of a six-year, $10 million
deal he signed as the Rams' first draft pick in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of went back and forth with it,'' Carter said. ''The
numbers didn't get done, but I'm not going to let the
organizational shortcomings come between me and what I've done
here. I would let my teammates down if I wasn't here.''
</P>
<P>
   White passed a physical in Charlotte, then traveled 80 miles to
training camp for a private workout -- his first official one since
1998 -- and a meeting with coach George Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a sense of excitement out there,'' White said. ''But
I told them if they went 10 minutes longer I think I might have
fainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Because White had one year left on his contract with the Packers
when he retired, they still hold his rights.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf was not immediately available
for comment Friday, but said the Packers will not seek compensation
for White.
</P>
<P>
   White said he took all of 1999 to rest, but was working out this
year in anticipation of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beginning of this year I thought about it, but when I
started working out my body said, 'You really don't feel like it,'
'' said White, who has 192&AMP;frac12; sacks in 14 seasons. ''But I'm in great
shape now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers agreed and offered him a five-year contract worth
about $20 million -- although White said he may only play one year --
with several performance incentives based on Carolina's defensive
improvement.
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Pryce, who led NFL defensive tackles with 13 sacks last
season, told Denver he believes he is underpaid and was absent as
the team opened training camp Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce, 24, is in the fourth-year of a five-year, $4.9 million
contract that will pay him $762,000 in base salary this season. He
played sparingly as a rookie in 1997, but blossomed into an All-Pro
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now Trevor is taking some time to determine what's in
his best interests,'' Pryce's agent, Peter Schaffer said. ''He's
got some serious issues with regard to his family and security.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got no problem with trying to redo Trevor's contract and
add a number of years to the contract and make him the highest paid
defensive player on our team,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ''But to
make him a franchise player and one of the top one or two at his
position with two years left on his contract I'd have to cut some
players, and I'm not willing to do that.''
Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona reached a four-year deal with first-round draft pick
Thomas Jones on Friday, just a day before the team will begin
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The running back was the last draft pick to sign with the
franchise, which has historically had trouble reaching terms with
players before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the seventh pick overall, was the first running back
chosen by Arizona in the first round since Garrison Hearst in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 205-pounder is Virginia's career rushing leader
with 4,108 yards. He set a single-season record with 1,908 yards
last year.
Steelers:
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after they slugged it out during minicamp,
Pittsburgh linebacker Earl Holmes and running back Richard Huntley
were together again Friday at St. Vincent College.
</P>
<P>
   The two were paired in the annual running test for veterans.
Afterward, Holmes and Huntley agreed to bury the hatchet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a misunderstanding that was blown out of
proportion,'' Holmes said. ''But that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes and Huntley tussled on the field and in the locker room
during the June minicamp at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pretty much upset with myself afterward, because I'm a
better player and a better person than that,'' Holmes said. ''To a
fan or whoever doesn't know me, they would think that I'm some kind
of barbarian or something like that.''
Saints:
</P>
<P>
   When Chad Morton was drafted by New Orleans in the fifth round,
it didn't seem he'd be around long, not with Heisman Trophy winner
Ricky Williams already on hand. What did they need with a 5-foot-8,
186-pound running back?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm used to that,'' Morton said. ''Nobody expected me to make
it in college. Everyone told me I was too small. Now, nobody
expects me to make it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton, the younger brother of Detroit receiver Johnnie Morton,
made it at Southern California, playing running back and wide
receiver on offense, safety and cornerback on defense, and
returning kicks and punts on special teams. He started every game
last season, leading the team with 262 carries for 1,114 yards -- a
4.4-yard average -- and 15 touchdowns.
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   New England receiver Vincent Brisby is off to a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in the driver's seat,'' Patriots coach Bill Belichick
said Friday. ''If he can perform to the level he could at one time,
then he's probably going to be able to hold that position. If he
can't, then the competition is going to be there to challenge
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been five years since Brisby held a full-time starting job
with the Patriots.

<HEADLINE> Mallon Still Leads Women's Open  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. (AP) -- Meg Mallon didn't need any trick shots.
</P>
<P>
   With the wind gusting and the thick, tangly rough holding tight
to any ball that strayed, Mallon shot an even-par 72 Friday and
held on to her one-stroke lead in the U.S. Women's Open. The
conditions made it nearly impossible for anyone to make a run at
Mallon, and most players struggled just to stay close to par.
</P>
<P>
   ''Par is your friend in the U.S. Open,'' said Karrie Webb, who
trails Mallon by one stroke. ''Anything better is just a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   There weren't many people getting bonuses Friday. Of the 78
players who teed off in the morning, only four managed to shoot
better than par. Dorothy Delasin, the 1999 U.S. Women's Amateur
champion, had the best round of the day, firing a 4-under 68 that
left her at even-par 144.
</P>
<P>
   Delasin had only one bogey, using the wrong club on the par-3
No. 7 and leaving herself short.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, I shot 4 over. I was like, 'Oh, great I'm going to
miss the cut,'' said Delasin, playing in her first Women's Open.
''I was surprised my name was up there. I wasn't expecting my name
to be up there, but it is. To play well here, it's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, the 1991 Women's Open champion, caused a stir Thursday
when she avoided water and sand on the 14th by playing the 13th
fairway. She played it straight Friday, narrowly missing the water
when her ball skirted the edge, but ended up with par.
</P>
<P>
   She salvaged par for the day with a birdie on 18 after chipping
from the back edge of the fringe within a couple feet of the hole.
She's at 4-under 140.
</P>
<P>
   Webb and Betsy King are a stroke back at 141. Webb shot a 72
while King, playing in her 25th Women's Open, had a 70. Cristie
Kerr is at 143, while defending champion Juli Inkster, Kathryn
Marshall, Laura Davies, Rosie Jones and Delasin are at 144.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez still has a chance at her first Women's Open title,
shooting a 2-over 74 to finish at 6-over 150, the cutoff to make
the weekend. Naree Wongluekiet, half of twin Thai sensation, also
made it with a 150.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's anybody's game right now,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a different tournament than last year, when
Inkster set a Women's Open record by finishing 16-under par. Her
272 tied Annika Sorenstam's record for low tournament score, though
Sorenstam did it on a par-71 course.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster took a four-stroke lead into the final day, and ended up
winning by five strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year was I wouldn't say easy, but it was not set up U.S.
Open-like as far as you prepare yourself coming in there to grind
it out for four rounds and then you end up having to reevaluate,''
Webb said. ''There are definitely some holes out here that your
heart is in your mouth when you're on the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   With no trees, the course doesn't look as if it would play as
tough as it has. But there's always wind, and some of the rough is
ankle-deep and filled with weeds, prickers and thistles. There are
patches of grass so thick a ball could be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   The wind shifted overnight and picked up speed, blowing out of
the northwest at up to 20 mph. Shots that felt good turned ugly in
a hurry with one little gust of wind, and most players spent plenty
of time hacking their way out of the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Add in some really tough pin positions, and it was no surprise
there were players shooting nine and 10 over for the day. Pat
Bradley, the 1981 Women's Open champion, shot a 14-over 86.
Conditions were so difficult that morning rounds took 5&AMP;frac12; hours and
afternoon tee times were pushed back a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still really happy with an even-par round,'' Webb said.
''Yesterday it was just a constant wind. Today, it's coming and
going and it's always a lot harder to pick clubs and to be positive
over the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I feel pretty good being at 3 under. I don't know if I'll
be leading at the end of the day, but I don't think I'll be too far
out of it.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Recall Mike Kindade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Mets purchased the contract of Mike
Kindade on Friday, promoting the Eastern League's leading hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Kindade, 27, was batting .366 with Binghamton, where he caught
in 63 games, played third base in 16 contests and appeared in the
outfield 11 times. He had 10 homers, 67 RBIs, 66 runs and 18 stolen
bases for the Mets' Double-A farm team.
</P>
<P>
   Kindade had three different stints with the Mets last season,
batting .196 with two homers and six RBIs in 46 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jim Mann was optioned to Norfolk of the International
League. The rookie right-hander was 0-0 with a 10.13 ERA in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Kindade on the 40-man roster, New York shifted
outfielder Darryl Hamilton from the 15-day to 60-day disabled list.
Hamilton went on the DL April 7 with a sprained left foot and
hasn't returned.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reserve Keisha Anderson hit a running layup in
the lane as time expired, capping a second-half comeback and
lifting the Washington Mystics to a 61-59 victory over the Orlando
Miracle on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, taking over at point guard when Andrea Nagy got into
first-half foul trouble, scored a career-high 13 points as the
Mystics won their second straight game. Washington improved to 2-1
under new coach Darrell Walker, who took over when Nancy Darsch
resigned on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Taj McWilliams, who scored 15 points, gave Orlando a 55-49 lead
with 4:33 left in the second half, but Washington turned up the
defensive pressure and went on a 10-2 run to take command.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Johnson led the Miracle with 16 points and eight
rebounds. Orlando has dropped two straight on the road and lost
twice to Washington this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw, coming off a career-high 30 points in the
Mystics' win over Indiana on Thursday, scored 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics started out 7-for-22 from the field, and Orlando
took advantage of the cold spell and Washington's 10 first-half
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Cintia dos Santos scored an easy basket 6:16 into the game,
beating Washington's feeble attempt at full-court pressure and
starting a 14-6 run that produced a 22-14 Orlando lead with 6:48
left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics got within 26-24 on a pair of Holdsclaw free throws
with 4:21 remaining in the half, but Orlando led 29-26 at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Washington opened the second half on a 9-4 burst, with Murriel
Page's three-point play at 4:29 giving the Mystics their first
lead, 35-33.

<HEADLINE> Toledo Still Leads B.C. Open  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENDICOTT, N.Y. (AP) -- Seeing his name atop the leaderboard is
something new for Esteban Toledo, and he likes the view.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo shot a 5-under-par 67 on Friday to stay in front of the
field after two rounds in the B.C. Open. Coupled with his opening
64, Toledo was at 13-under 131, three shots ahead of defending
champion Brad Faxon and Canada's Glen Hnatiuk.
</P>
<P>
   Another shot back were Brian Gay, Scott McCarron and Dick Mast,
who bogeyed his first hole of the day before rallying with two
eagles to finish with a sizzling 64.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising Bob Heintz was at 136 after a solid 65, tied with
Michael Allen and Grant Waite at 8 under. Heintz, a three-time Ivy
League champion at Yale who quit the game briefly four years ago to
pursue a career as a financial analyst, has made only four cuts in
20 tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kelly also stormed into contention with a 63 that included
eight birdies on the front nine. After his best round on tour,
Kelly was tied at 7 under with Carl Paulson and Richard Zokol.
</P>
<P>
   Play, which was delayed 3&AMP;frac12; hours by a midafternoon rainstorm,
was suspended at darkness with 30 players still on the course. They
will complete their rounds Saturday morning. Among those were Allen
with four holes to play, McCarron with three, Hnatiuk two, and
Waite one.
</P>
<P>
   The severe thunderstorm, with wind gusting to 40-45 mph, halted
play at 3 p.m. and threatened to force tournament officials to
suspend play. But the storm, which dropped a half-inch of rain on
the firm En-Joie Golf Club course, lasted a little less than an
hour and players were able to go back out about two hours before
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon was at 3 under for the day after 11 holes when the storm
hit and added three more birdies afterward en route to a 66. The
softer conditions proved a boon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This area hasn't gotten any rate lately, so it was pretty
nice. There was no wind, the greens were smoother,'' said Faxon,
whose 35-foot putt for birdie on No. 18 stopped at the lip of the
cup. ''We got a really nice break those last few holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the deluge, Toledo had made another strong showing after
faltering early in the cool morning air. Clear skies Thursday night
sent temperatures into the low 50s and the Mexican native had
trouble getting the stroke back that had produced nine birdies the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started kind of off this morning (on the back nine),'' he
said. ''It was a little chilly and I missed three putts the first
three holes and then I three-putted on No. 13. And then we were on
the clock (for slow play) that early, and that kind of got my
rhythm off.''
</P>
<P>
   A 10-foot par putt on No. 14 got him back on track. He followed
that with a birdie on the tough No. 15, a 432-yard par-4 that has
an elevated green that slopes toward the massive water hazard that
guards the frontside. That helped keep him in his uncustomary spot
atop the field for the second straight day and only the second time
in five full years on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''From then on, I just kind of relaxed a little more,'' he said.
''That putt (on 14) kind of got me going. On the front nine, I
started making putts, started making great shots. I was telling my
caddie, 'I just got to hang in there or else I'm going to fall
away.'
</P>
<P>
   ''He asked me if I had the butterflies on the first three holes,
and I told him no. I never felt nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Kelly, who had no reason to -- he was 2 over and 10
shots behind starting the day. That changed in a hurry as he began
his string of birdies, seven of them in a row after missing a
10-foot birdie putt on No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   When Kelly drove into the right trees on the par-5, 565-yard No.
5, played a bad shot out of the rough and still managed a 15-foot
birdie putt, he knew something good was afoot.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of let me know that things were going pretty well,''
said Kelly, whose 8-under effort on the front nine equaled a PGA
Tour record shared by several players. ''That was a very tough
birdie. I got myself way out of position.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a crucial mental error that seems to happen to every
player who gets close to the dream of breaking 60.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started the back side, and I said, 'Three birdies and I
shoot 59.' That's a mistake,'' said Kelly, who had two birdies and
a bogey on the back nine. ''I got ahead of myself. Anybody who
tells you they don't think about it is crazy. That's kind of one of
golf's ultimate milestones, and I had it easily within my reach.''

<HEADLINE> Former National Guardsman Grounded  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW TILGHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A former National Guardsman accused of breaking
into a Guard compound with two pipe bombs and scrawling ''Free
Kosova'' on a satellite dish was grounded from flying shortly
before resigning from the Guard, a spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 10 years in the Army National Guard as a pilot,
Milan Mititch, 35, was grounded several months before his Nov. 1
resignation, said Tim Donovan, a Guard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said Mititch was removed from flying duties in August,
but he declined to say why.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch, a commercial pilot for American Eagle, an American
Airlines' regional carrier, was charged Thursday with federal
explosives violations.
</P>
<P>
   An intruder dropped the bombs, contained in a shopping bag,
while being chased by security guards at the 128th Air Guard
Refueling Wing compound early Wednesday. The bombs did not explode.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch also is accused of spray-painting ''Free Kosova'' on the
satellite dish and scrawling vulgar remarks about ''KFOR,'' the
NATO-led force charged with maintaining peace between Serbs and
Albanians in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. Kosova is an
Albanian spelling for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, Mititch was arrested for painting
''USA=Satan'' on a Milwaukee storefront, but charges were
dismissed, police records show.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the 1998 arrest was why Mititch lost his flying
privileges, Donovan said only that the Guard took action after the
incident. He declined to say what action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch, the son of a Serbian immigrant, is a former chief
warrant officer who flew UH60 Blackhawk helicopters for a unit that
was not assigned to Kosovo and did not participate in the Gulf War,
Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Mititch, the suspect's mother, said she and her son
were at a resort about 140 miles north of Milwaukee at the time of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was not even here when it happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch's attorney, Nick Kostich, declined comment on the
mother's claim, except to say that ''the mother is obviously a
prospective witness.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Barry Babler said Friday federal agents were
looking into Mititch's alibi.
</P>
<P>
   Mititch was ordered held until a hearing Tuesday, when his
attorney said he will plead innocent.

   WAYNESBORO, Pa. (AP) -- Milton W. Garland, who was called ''Mr.
Refrigeration'' by his engineering peers for his pioneering work,
died Wednesday. He was 104.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- John Husar, a Chicago Tribune columnist who spent
the last year writing about his struggle with hepatitis C and his
need for a liver transplant, died Thursday. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   He died little more than a week after receiving part of a new
liver.
</P>
<P>
   Husar, an outdoor writer for the last 20 years, shared details
about his five near-misses with transplants -- times when he waited
in hospitals as a ''backup'' in case another recipient could not
accept an organ.
</P>
<P>
   Husar also was a Tribune sportswriter. He covered a variety of
sporting events, including eight Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, two daughters, four brothers, a
sister, and three grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Police: Kidnappers Targeted Friend  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, California (AP) -- Investigators said Friday they
believe the son of a well-known Mexican singer was kidnapped and
killed because he happened to be with the attacker's true target.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Leonardo Martinez Flores of Corona, Calif., and
his friend Aquiles Veljiz Hernandez were discovered Wednesday,
several days after they were kidnapped at Veljiz's house in
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators at the Baja California state attorney general's
office said they believe Veljiz was the target of the kidnapping.
Martinez, son of Mexican singer Beatriz Adriana Flores, was seized
because he was visiting Veljiz, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Francisco Javier Cossio said
investigators are looking into drug trafficking as a possible
angles in the case. The kidnappers reportedly demanded an $800,000
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Flores was a well-known Mexican actress and singer in the late
1970s and early 1980s and recently has revived her career. Her
21-year-old son, born in the United States, lived in Corona and was
visiting Mexico on vacation, according to officials here.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Ryan Leaf Welcomed Back  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ryan Leaf threw some crisp passes. The crowd
cheered each completion.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. That hasn't happened around here in some time.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, whose NFL career has been detoured by injury and attitude,
had an encouraging return to the San Diego Chargers, albeit as the
third-string quarterback, when the team opened training camp
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look good in this thing, don't I?'' Leaf said to reporters,
motioning to his uniform. ''It feels good to put the shoulder pads
on and keep going. Hopefully I can finally contribute in some
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers hope so, too, although Leaf currently sits behind
36-year-old Jim Harbaugh and Moses Moreno, who has made one NFL
start, on the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers held Leaf back a bit in the morning practice
because he's coming off surgery in January to clean out his right
shoulder, but gave him a full load in the afternoon. He got through
both workouts fine.
</P>
<P>
   That was a far cry from last year when, coming off a disastrous
rookie season, he hurt his right shoulder 20 minutes into the first
practice, requiring surgery. The injury, plus a four-week
suspension for cursing at then-general manager Bobby Beathard,
wiped out his second season, and he skipped most of the voluntary
offseason workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf admitted he was a little nervous, ''kind of like what you
should feel like coming into training camp. I've only played eight
games (10, actually), so it's pretty much still a fresh start for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, who claimed he'd been throwing 500 passes a day for the
last week, said throwing his first completion was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't get excited over throwing a hitch somewhere because
they drafted me No. 1. I've done that for a long time. It's a
normal thing. It's just people haven't seen it in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   One fan called Leaf a ''bum'' but the reception was otherwise
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, the second pick overall in the 1998 draft, last played on
Dec. 13 that year, in relief of an ineffective Craig Whelihan in a
38-17 loss at Seattle. Leaf threw the final two of his 15
interceptions and fumbled once. He threw only two touchdown passes
as a rookie and was benched after starting the first nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said he feels fine and will probably lobby coach Mike Riley
to loosen the reins a little during practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't want a setback. Neither do I,'' Leaf added.
</P>
<P>
   As for what will happen this year, ''it's up to the coaching
staff and up to me on how I develop,'' Leaf said. ''I don't want
them to put me out there when I'm not ready to play and not do
well. I want to be at the best I can and help this team out. I
think we're pretty good at the quarterback position. And if my
opportunity does come, I'm just going to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley wants to see Leaf play in exhibition games, and Leaf said
he'd probably be ready for the Chargers' second game, at home
against Minnesota on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Fred McCrary, who strained a ligament in his left knee
in the afternoon practice, was happy to see Leaf do well. During
offseason workouts, McCrary told Leaf he was ''fat and out of
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not to make it seem like it was all bad, I was just trying to
motivate him,'' McCrary said. ''He looks much better now. I'm not
saying it's because of me, but it's because he wanted it for
himself. That's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrary said the franchise is still counting on Leaf, just as it
was when it gave him that $11.25 million signing bonus in 1998 as
part of a deal potentially worth $31.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf had lost the respect of his teammates by the end of his
rookie season, but can get it back ''by being on the field, being
out there performing with us,'' McCrary said. ''I think he's going
on the right track. He throws the ball well. I was impressed with
him today.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley was impressed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since one year ago today when he got hurt, I think he's made
great progress in getting back to this point,'' Riley said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Mori Agree to Trade Talks  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa, Japan (AP) -- President Clinton and Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori agreed Saturday to extend, for a fourth year,
trade negotiations that the United States believes offer the best
hope for lowering America's huge deficit with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by the two leaders during a photo
opportunity following their 45-minute meeting prior to Saturday's
discussions at the Group of Eight economic summit here.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a deal had been struck on the contentious issue,
Clinton laughed and suggested that reporters direct the question to
Mori, who said: ''Yes, we agreed to continue the discussions for
another year.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very pleased about (the agreement to extend the talks),''
Clinton said. ''I think it has been very fruitful. It has been very
positive on the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks, first launched at the Denver economic summit in 1997,
cover a broad range of business sectors, ranging from
telecommunications to financial services and pharmaceuticals. The
administration has used the talks to press Japan to cut regulations
that American businesses believe are being used to shut their
products out of the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the discussions have been very
contentious because the Japanese government has accused the
administration of making extreme demands about its internal rules
of governing the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   It was through the talks, known as the enhanced structural
deregulation initiative, that the United States and Japan reached
an agreement earlier this week under which Japanese giant Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone would slash the prices it charges U.S. and
other foreign telecommunications companies to connect with its
local line.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that deal alone would save Americans and
other foreign companies $2 billion in connection fees over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators had been able to reach
the NPT deal, they had not been able to resolve the question of
whether to continue the deregulation talks, leaving that issue to
be discussed by Clinton and Mori.

<HEADLINE> Comets 76, Shock 74, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes' jumper with three
seconds left in overtime gave the Houston Comets a 76-74 victory
over the Detroit Shock on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time defending WNBA champion Comets (21-3) led by as
many as 21 points, but Detroit (10-12) rallied to tie it at 68 on
Anna DeForge's 3-pointer with nine seconds to play in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But Swoopes gave Houston its 12th win in 13 games, and fifth
straight over the Shock.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper led the Comets with a season-high 27 points, and
Swoopes added 21. Wendy Palmer had 22 points and 10 rebounds for
the Shock.
</P>
<P>
   Houston outrebounded Detroit 44-32, led by 15 from Tiffani
Johnson and 13 from Tina Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets took control with an early 25-4 run that put them
ahead 32-11 late in the first half. Cooper had eight of the points
and Swoopes six.
</P>
<P>
   Houston led 43-30 at intermission, and by as many as 16 early in
the second half. Claudia Maria das Neves pulled Detroit within nine
at 60-51 with 9:45 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock chipped away at the Comets' lead, and got four points
each from DeForge and Edwina Brown to pull within 68-65 with 90
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Houston turned the ball over, but Swoopes blocked Brown's jumper
that could have made it a one-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Arcain missed a jumper that could have clinched the game
with 17 seconds left, giving Detroit a last chance, and DeForge
rattled in a 3-pointer from the right wing to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Canty stole the ball from Swoopes, but her desperation
heave fell short at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson started overtime with two free throws, Palmer went
on a 6-2 run of her own to put Detroit up 74-72 with 2:19 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson drew Houston even, and Palmer missed on the next two
possessions, leaving the score tied at 74 with 45 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Each team turned the ball over on its next possession, leaving
Houston with five seconds to set up a game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes took an inbounds pass from Thompson, dribbled twice and
knocked down a baseline jumper.

<HEADLINE> Four Calif. People Stabbed to Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PICO RIVERA, Calif. (AP) -- An intruder apparently slipped into a
home while a family was sleeping and stabbed four people to death,
three of them children, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager who had been asleep in the house found her mother
suffering from stab wounds about 3 a.m. Friday and ran next door to
get help.
</P>
<P>
   Officers who arrived at the suburban Los Angeles home found the
bodies of a 42-year-old man, a 14-year-old girl and two boys, ages
10 and 17, sheriff's Lt. Marilyn Baker said. A 39-year-old woman
was hospitalized with stab wounds, and three other girls in the
house were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who knew the family identified those killed as Richard
Flores, 42; Sylvia Flores, 14; Matthew Flores, 10; and a
17-year-old also named Richard Flores. A woman, also named Sylvia
Flores, was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The adults were parents of four children and were raising two
nieces, neighbors said. Police did not release the identities of
the others.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the victims were apparently asleep when an intruder
slipped in. Deputy Carlos Lopez said that there were no signs of
forced entry but that no scenario had been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded woman described the intruder to deputies as a young
man in his 20s, Deputy David Cervantes said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings occurred during a heat spell, and neighbors worried
that the killer may have taken advantage of windows left open at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last time I'm sleeping with the windows open,''
said Mari Estrada, who lives a block away in the working-class
neighborhood, about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 9, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Rookie Jimmy Anderson allowed only three hits
in eight innings and Mike Benjamin drove in three runs as the
Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Philadelphia Phillies 9-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (3-5) walked three, hit a batter and struck out five in
his second straight solid start since making an adjustment in his
delivery. Anderson allowed three hits and one unearned run in 6 1-3
innings at Los Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, trying to solidify a spot in the rotation, has not
completed a game in 18 major league starts. He was pulled after
throwing 123 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Aven's two-run double highlighted a four-run first inning
against Paul Byrd (2-8). The first six batters reached against
Byrd, 1-6 in his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh loaded the bases when Warren Morris walked, Jason
Kendall was hit by a pitch and Wil Cordero singled. Brian Giles hit
an RBI single and Aven doubled down the left field line. The fourth
run scored on Benjamin's infield grounder.
</P>
<P>
   John Vander Wal led off the third with his 13th homer, an inning
after Kendall's single and errors by left fielder Ron Gant and
shortstop Desi Relaford led to an unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin doubled in two runs in the eighth and Kendall doubled
in Benjamin to make it 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia avoided being shut out for the third time this
season when Gary Bennett hit a two-run homer in the ninth -- his
first this season -- against Marc Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bennett caught his second game of the season for the
Phillies with Mike Lieberthal on the disabled list because of a
sprained ankle. His only other major league homer was Aug. 5, 1999,
at Florida. ... Byrd's only win in his last 10 starts came against
Pittsburgh on July 1 during the Phillies' three-game home sweep.
... The Pirates were two players short. 1B Kevin Young went home to
Arizona for a family medical emergency and shortstop Pat Meares
went home to Kansas, where his wife was due to deliver their second
child. Young might miss the entire weekend series. ... Pitching
coach Pete Vuckovich completed a two-game suspension he received
for making contact with umpire John Hirschbeck at New York on June
23.

<HEADLINE> Food Stamp Fraud Still Prevalent  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Criminals are still swindling $660 million a
year in food stamp benefits from the government, despite the
widespread use of electronic debit cards in place of the
traditional, easy-to-traffic paper coupons, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the amount of federal money stolen each year by criminals
has decreased 19 percent, from $815 million in 1993 to $660 million
annually from 1996-98, Agriculture Department officials say.
</P>
<P>
   And the trafficking rate -- which compares dollars trafficked to
benefits issued -- dropped 8 percent from 3.8 cents per dollar in
1993 to 3.5 cents in 1998, according to a new department report
released last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Food stamps are intended for food and we do not and we will
not tolerate fraud and abuse in the Food Stamp Program,'' said
Shirley Watkins, the Agriculture undersecretary of food, nutrition
and consumer services.
</P>
<P>
   Using electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards instead of paper
coupons was supposed to help fight food stamp fraud and cut down on
government paperwork. Currently, 37 states and the District of
Columbia are using EBT cards for their statewide systems. All
states have to be using the system by 2002, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But even though three-fourths of all American families using
food stamps now use a card instead of coupons, criminals are still
getting access to federal dollars, said Roger Viadero, the
Agriculture Department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did with the paper coupons, recipients are selling
their debit cards and personal identification numbers for drugs and
money to traffickers, he told the House Budget Committee's welfare
task force on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The street level traffickers may be having more difficulty using
the cards, but ''large-scale trafficking by retailers continues to
be widespread,'' Viadero said. ''Again, those involved often
traffic in immense quantities of benefits, have large organizations
and often use sophisticated schemes to carry out the crimes and
conceal their illegal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that storeowners who willingly
participate in fraud schemes are not being forced to pay the
financial penalties they were assessed for trafficking, said Larry
Dyckman, director of food and agricultural issues for the U.S.
General Accounting Office, Congress's watchdog arm.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993-98, stores were assessed $78 million in penalties but
only $11.5 million was collected, he said. He said $49 million was
written off as ''uncollectable'' and the rest was pending
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to agency officials, this small percentage of fines
collected reflects the difficulties involved in collecting this
kind of debt, such as problems in locating debtors as well as their
refusal to pay,'' he said. ''However, weaknesses in the agency's
debt collection procedures and practices also contributed to low
collections.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most states with EBT systems aren't analyzing the
data to find criminals, Dyckman said. As of last April, only
Florida, Missouri, South Carolina and Texas were independently
analyzing their electronic databases to identify suspect
recipients, and Agriculture's inspector general provided 34,000
suspects to Maryland as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''During 1998 and 1999, these five states were responsible for
disqualifying about 99 percent of the 6,873 individuals nationwide
who were removed from the Food Stamp Program for trafficking,''
Dyckman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has its own anti-fraud computer
system called ''ALERT'' which records EBT transactions and looks
for trafficking patterns, Watkins said.

<HEADLINE> Third Person Admits Torture in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- A third person has pleaded guilty to
torturing a mentally disabled man during a series of wild parties
in which he was taped to a chair, beaten and forced to perform
humiliating acts.
</P>
<P>
   Christol Lavary, 20, admitted Thursday that she helped shave the
head of 24-year-old Eric Krochmaluk of Middletown during a party in
Keansburg on Jan. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bias assault, and faces up
to 10 years in prison under a plea agreement in which other charges
are to be dismissed, including kidnapping, aggravated assault,
aggravated criminal sexual contact and making terroristic threats.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defendants, William MacKay, 23, and Daniel Vistad, 24,
already have pleaded guilty under the same arrangement. All three
are scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from her lawyer, Lavary testified that she
knew ''there was something not normal'' about the victim and that
she knew he didn't want to have his head shaved.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants also were accused of burning him with cigarettes,

<HEADLINE> Actors' Unions Talks Break Down  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON L. CRENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Talks between two actors' unions and the
advertisers they've been on strike against since May broke down
Friday with no reported progress and no new sessions scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists announced the stalemate just a day
after federal mediators sought to jump-start the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''SAG and AFTRA brought their full 26-member negotiation team
back to New York in hopes that substantive discussion could begin
on the many issues between the unions and the ad industry in this
contract,'' John McGuire, SAG's chief negotiator said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unions significantly modified their key cable proposal.
The advertisers refused to make any changes in any of their
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Shepard, a top negotiator for the advertisers, did not
immediately return a telephone message left at his Washington
office.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and AFTRA went on strike May 1 against the advertising
industry, seeking to protect residuals, or fees paid each time a
radio or television commercial is broadcast on a major network.
Advertisers want to replace residuals with flat-fee payments.
</P>
<P>
   The two unions have a combined membership of 135,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to us that the ad industry feels no remorse about
putting so many thousands of our members and so many thousands of
people ... out of work,'' said AFTRA President Shelby Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is the first major Hollywood walkout in 12 years. It
affects only radio and TV commercials, not movies or television
series.
</P>
<P>
   The unions have signed interim agreements with some
organizations making commercials during the strike, with the
businesses agreeing to pay actors on a ''pay-per-play'' basis.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Finishes First in 100 Meters  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Battling to come back after a one-year
ban, five-time Olympian Merlene Ottey finished fourth in the 100
meters Friday in Jamaica's final trials for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Still the 40-year-old Ottey, cleared July 3 of charges she used
steroids, is expected to make the Olympic team in the 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   She finished the 100 in 11:21 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Peta-Gaye Dowdie won in 11:19 seconds. Beverley McDonald was
second, followed by Tanya Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night in the preliminary, Ottey beat them all in
11.09 seconds. The four runners are expected to form Jamaica's 400
relay team in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey hinted that a lack of conditioning cost her the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two weeks ago I wasn't sure I'd be here,'' she said. ''It was
good for Jamaica to see me one more time even though I wasn't in
the best shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was rooting for her Friday. ''Come on, Merlene! Come
on!'' they screamed, as she struggled to keep the third place
needed to run individually in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey was making her first appearance at a local meet since she
was cleared by the International Amateur Athletics Association of
charges of using the steroid nandrolone after a positive test
during the World Championships in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Track and field's world governing body reinstated her after
concluding that a Swiss laboratory improperly tested the urine
sample.

<HEADLINE> Sol 76, Starzz 65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Sheri Sam scored 23 points and Marlies Askamp added
17 as the Miami Sol set a franchise points record Friday with a
76-65 victory over the Utah Starzz.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's layup with 7.2 seconds left gave the Sol a 76-63 lead,
matching Miami's biggest lead of the game. Twice previously, the
Sol scored 74 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol also had their best shooting percentage output this
season, connecting on 47.4 percent from the field. Miami (9-14)
entered the game shooting just 36.4 percent from the field, last in
the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers show how hard the team played,'' said Sam, who
nearly doubled her season scoring average of 11.8 points per game.
''This team doesn't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve forward Kristen Rasmussen added 10 points for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, led by Natalie Williams' 18 points, led early. But Askamp,
a 6-foot-5 center, sank a 3-pointer to give Miami an 18-16 lead at
11:55 of the first half. The Sol never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   Askamp, who was in a scoring slump, scored 13 points in the
first half. Scoreless in the Sol's last game, Askamp combined for
just 13 points in her previous three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol led by as much as seven points in the first half and
went into halftime ahead 33-30.
</P>
<P>
   Utah (12-12) pulled within 33-32 on a pair of free throws by
Korie Hlede, who had 15 points. But Miami went on a 15-3 run over
the next seven minutes and pulled comfortably ahead, 48-35 on
Askamp's layup.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Azzi added 16 points for Utah, held to just 39.6
percent shooting.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Leaders Fret About Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- World leaders joining President Clinton for
his final summit of wealthy industrial nations patted themselves on
the back Friday for the robust global economy but fretted that a
huge runup in oil prices could spoil the good times.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting on this island of semitropical beaches and coral reefs,
the leaders also signaled a willingness to open their checkbooks to
help underwrite any peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians. By some estimates, the cost could be upwards of $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was an upbeat farewell for Clinton, who with just six months
left in office, was the senior statesman among presidents and prime
ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Canada and
Italy. Several colleagues praised Clinton for hosting the Mideast
peace talks at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland.
French President Jacques Chirac saluted Clinton for ''his courage
and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, due to return Sunday evening to Washington, trimmed his
schedule to arrive home a few hours earlier. White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said Clinton would move up his scheduled meeting with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his speech to U.S. troops in
Okinawa to Saturday night, and was due to arrive back in Washington
around 6 p.m. EDT Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect him to get right back to work when he gets there,''
Lockhart said. He declined to characterize how the Camp David talks
have been going in Clinton's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
agreed Saturday to extend, for a fourth year, trade talks on a
broad range of business sectors, from telecommunications to
financial services and pharmaceuticals. And Clinton fielded fresh
objections from other leaders to U.S. plans for a missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin renewed Russia's strong
opposition. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said, ''I'm
skeptical about it.'' Chirac said the proposed missile shield is
technically unpredictable, would cost a lot of money and could lead
to a new nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that goes in the direction of proliferation is a
bad direction,'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders gathered at the seaside Bankoku Shinryo conference
hall, built for the summit and named after the inscription on a
15th century bell, which in Japanese means ''a bridge between
nations.'' Earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien sought
relief from the heat at Okinawa's only ice hockey rink. Schroeder
toured a small island where local residents saved the German crew
of a ship wrecked in 1873.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders took satisfaction about escaping a global recession
after the 1997-98 Asian currency crisis. With the notable exception
of Japan, many of the hardest-hit crisis countries are staging
strong recoveries. Since last year, they said, prospects for world
economic growth have improved.
</P>
<P>
   However, a summit statement said, ''We are concerned about the
adverse effect on world economic growth of recent developments in
world crude oil markets.'' It is a political problem as well, with
aftershocks in the U.S. presidential race. The leaders called for
greater stability of oil markets to help insure sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   They also promised to share global prosperity with poor
countries, speeding up the process of forgiving their heavy burden
of debt or at least rescheduling payments under more favorable
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The summit countries also were expected to offer increased help
to fight AIDS in poor nations and educate the estimated 100 million
poor children not in school.
</P>
<P>
   Lael Brainard, Clinton's deputy national economic advisor, said
several leaders voiced the need to get more poor countries to a
point where they will qualify under terms set by the rich nations
for debt relief. So far, only nine of the 40 nations have qualified
but Brainard said the G-8 countries strongly supported making sure
that countries are forced to devote any money saved on making
interest payments on the debt to increasing their spending in such
critical areas as education and health.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner, the leaders questioned Clinton about the Camp David
talks and quizzed the Russian leader about his visit this week to
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said they ''warmly welcome'' the North-South Korean
summit in June, adding that they encourage the dialogue to
continue. In a statement, the leaders said: ''We sincerely hope
that such a process, including the faithful implementation of the
South-North Joint Declaration, will usher in a new era in
inter-Korean relations and reduce the tensions in the Korean
Peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement also praised South Korea's open policy towards
North Korea and Pyongyang's ''constructive attitude.'' It said the
North's reconfirmation of its moratorium on missile launches was a
''positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking later about North Korea with reporters, Chretien said,
''We are all happy that their isolation seems to be going away, but
we have to approach it in a careful way. We have to terminate the
isolation of North Korea.''

Cheney Said To Be Bush's Top VP Pick
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is seriously considering former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as his Republican running mate, turning to a
respected Washington insider in the final days of his search for a vice
presidential candidate, two highly placed GOP officials said. The former
lawmaker, White House chief of staff and Defense Secretary -- the man heading up
Bush's search team -- thrust himself into the process by changing his voter
registration today from Texas to Wyoming. Cheney, who is considered the leading
candidate, made the move to ensure he is eligible for the job if the governor
decides to offer it, said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

U.S. Promotes Israeli Proposal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- In efforts to clear the most stubborn obstacle to a
Camp David peace agreement, the United States is promoting an Israeli-initiated
proposal to recognize Palestinian administrative control over Arab neighborhoods
of Jerusalem. An Israeli Cabinet officer said in Jerusalem that the proposal
conveyed the ''characteristic'' of Palestinian sovereignty in the eastern area
of the contested city -- a long-cherished Palestinian goal. Reacting coolly to
the ideas, Hassan Abdel Rahman, Washington representative of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, said: ''Short of total Palestinian sovereignty over
East Jerusalem, there is not a ground for an agreement.''

deficit with Japan. The announcement was made by the two leaders during a photo
opportunity following their 45-minute meeting prior to Saturday's discussions at
the Group of Eight economic summit here. Asked if a deal had been struck on the
contentious issue, Clinton laughed and suggested that reporters direct the
question to Mori, who said: ''Yes, we agreed to continue the discussions for
another year.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking a stronger commitment from labor, Al Gore tried to

''I'm on the side of the men and women who work hard physical jobs all their
lives...'' the vice president told a convention of the AFL-CIO. The meeting
brought together the federation's transportation trades workers, who include the
Teamsters, machinists and bus drivers who make up about a quarter of the
AFL-CIO's membership. Gore, a Democrat, reiterated his support for a raise in
the minimum wage and said that Bush's Social Security proposal would leave the
program with a $3 trillion shortfall.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Against Congress Pay Raises  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- Fending off charges of hypocrisy by
Democrats, Republican Senate candidiate Rick Lazio said Friday he
opposes salary increases for himself and his fellow House members --
despite his vote in favor of a measure that would raise
congressional pay.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he voted for a $29.1 billion spending bill financing
the Treasury Department and other agencies for next year -- and
raising members' annual pay by $3,800 -- because most of the bill
was worth supporting.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to vote down a bill that also deals with
Customs, deals with postal operations, the IRS. I mean, it's a
gigantic bill,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he voted for a procedural motion that would have
allowed debate on the cost-of-living increase for members of
Congress before the final vote on the appropriations measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''That failed and we moved on with the rest of the bill,'' the
four-term congressman said. ''I generally oppose cost-of-living
increases for House members. I don't recall that I ever voted for
one.''
</P>
<P>
   New York State Democratic Committee chairwoman Judith Hope
accused Lazio of inconsistency, pointing out he won his House seat
from incumbent Tom Downey on a platform of ''no perks, no
privileges and no pay raises.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1992, Rick Lazio tried to cast himself as Mr. Smith goes to
Washington,'' Hope said. ''Unfortunately, when Mr. Lazio got to
Washington, he forgot why voters sent him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign countered with a half-dozen faxes accusing
Hillary Rodham Clinton of opposing, by association, virtually
everything else in the appropriations bill -- from expanding
anti-drug efforts and child-care funding to imposing sanctions on
tormentors of Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also accused Clinton of ''legislative ignorance'' in
criticizing Lazio for voting for an appropriations bill similar to
bills signed by her husband in 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Hillary Clinton and her allies are so opposed to this bill
then why haven't they howled every time President Clinton signed a
bill with a similar cost-of-living adjustment into law?'' asked
Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved by a 216-202 vote Thursday, would also allow
unrestricted trade of U.S. food and medicine with Cuba and travel
by Americans there.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton signs the bill, it would deliver the third pay raise
in four years to members of Congress.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Keating's Plane Lands Safely  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- An airplane carrying Gov. Frank Keating and
six others made a safe landing at an airport Friday night after
worries that it had a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Almighty took care of us,'' Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   Keating said the twin engine King Air 350 shook violently just
after take off from Washington. The pilot determined the plane had
a landing gear problem and that it was safer to complete the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Press spokesman Dan Mahoney, who was on the plane, said
exhausting the plane's fuel supply by flying to Oklahoma City
reduced the risk of fire if the plane had to be crash landed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half dozen fire trucks followed the plane down the
runway as it landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   John Clabes, a spokesman for the FAA, said they initially
thought the plane had a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   After the plane landed, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said an
inspection determined the bearings might have been the problem. The
plane was towed toward the terminal at Wiley Post Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Keating was returning from a trip to Washington where the
governor spoke at the Heritage Foundation on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Keating has been mentioned as a possible running mate with
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush.

<HEADLINE> Expos 7, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Geoff Blum homered and had a career-high four RBIs,
and Mike Thurman, fresh off the disabled list, pitched six strong
innings as the Montreal Expos defeated the Florida Marlins 7-3
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Blum's two-run homer, off Vic Darensbourg in the fifth inning,
increased Montreal's lead to 6-1. One batter later, shortstop Tomas
De La Rosa hit a solo homer, his first major league hit.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman (2-1), disabled since May 25 because of right elbow
tendinitis, was activated just hours before allowing the Marlins
one run and five hits. He struck out six, walked three and worked
out of one-out, bases-loaded jams in the second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Santana relieved Thurman to start the seventh and promptly
walked the bases loaded before allowing Alex Gonzalez's two-out,
two-run single that pulled Florida within 7-3. Anthony Telford
relieved Santana and retired Ramon Castro to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Florida starter Chuck Smith (0-3) lasted just four innings. He
gave up four runs and five hits, struck out three and walked five.
</P>
<P>
   A day after 28,978 fans saw the Marlins split a doubleheader
against Atlanta, things were back to normal at Pro Player Stadium
where a crowd of 11,234 attended the series opener against the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger's two-run double helped Montreal take a 3-0 lead in
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bergeron and Milton Bradley walked and Andy Tracy singled
to load the bases with one out. After Joe Vidro hit into a
fielder's choice at the plate, Blum walked to force in Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Widger followed with a double down the third-base line that
scored Tracy and Vidro.
</P>
<P>
   Florida answered with a run in its half of the first. Luis
Castillo led off with a single -- extending his hitting streak to 13
games -- then stole second. He eventually scored on Preston Wilson's
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal built a 4-1 lead in the third when Tracy scored on
Blum's RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Castillo's 13-game hitting streak is a Marlins season high.
... Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero, who missed his first game of the
season Thursday because of a strained hip flexor, was not in the
lineup Friday night. ... Thurman has spent 104 days (two trips) on
the disabled list this season because of elbow tendinitis. ...
Florida had won 11 of the last 14 meetings with the Expos.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 11, Devil Rays 1  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter had four hits, Jorge Posada hit a
two-run homer and Dwight Gooden beat another of his former teams as
the New York Yankees defeated the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 11-1 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vizcaino added three hits, David Justice drove in three
runs, Bernie Williams scored three times and Tino Martinez had a
two-run double for the Yankees, who accumulated 17 hits -- two shy
of their season high -- in winning for the fifth time in seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden (4-3) allowed a home run to Gerald Williams on his second
pitch of the game and yielded six hits in the first three innings.
But he got better as the game moved along, repeatedly getting ahead
in the count as he retired nine of the final 10 batters he faced,
working his only 1-2-3 inning in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gooden's 96 pitches in six innings, 61 were strikes. He gave
up eight hits with one walk and one strikeout. It was exactly the
type of outing manager Joe Torre was looking for from the veteran
right-hander, making his second start since signing with the
Yankees. Gooden, who beat the New York Mets in his previous start,
also made one start for Houston and eight for Tampa Bay in April
and May.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was 4-for-4 with three runs scored -- all his hits were
singles -- before striking out on three pitches in the seventh. It
was the 12th four-hit game of his career and second this season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished 3-for-3 with two walks, and Vizcaino went
3-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay starter Esteban Yan (4-7) didn't make it out of the
fourth, facing 20 batters and allowing 10 hits and a walk. Tampa
Bay's relievers didn't fare much better as the Yankees turned it
into a rout and sent the Devil Rays to their fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays took a 1-0 lead when Williams hit his 14th homer
on Gooden's second pitch, but that was the end of Tampa Bay's
offensive highlights. Jeter and Paul O'Neill singled with one out
in the first, and Williams followed with a walk to load the bases
before Justice's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had an RBI double and Justice a run-scoring single in
the third, and Vizcaino and Jeter knocked Yan out of the game with
RBI singles in the fourth for a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Posada's homer, his 16th, came in the fifth against reliever
Doug Creek for an 8-1 lead. Martinez had a two-run single and Scott
Brosius added a run-scoring base hit in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In a trade announced before the game, the Yankees acquired
outfielder Glenallen Hill from the Cubs for minor league pitchers
Ben Ford and Ozwaldo Mairena. Hill will be used mostly as a
designated hitter and pinch-hitter. ... Not all the Yankees had
great offensive nights as Chuck Knoblauch went 0-for-5 with two
strikeouts. ... Tampa Bay catcher Mike DiFelice threw the ball 15
feet over the head of second baseman Miguel Cairo while attempting
to catch Vizcaino stealing. He was charged with an error.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Cardinals, Jones Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals reached a four-year
deal Friday with first-round draft pick Thomas Jones on the eve of
training camp in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' agent Tom Condon said his client will earn $1.85 million
per year and get a $5.7 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia running back was the last draft pick to sign with
the franchise, which has historically had trouble reaching terms
with its players before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who reportedly was seeking a five-year deal with a $6
million signing bonus, flew here Thursday with Condon to meet with
Cardinals officials in an attempt to hammer out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the seventh pick overall, was the first running back
chosen by Arizona in the first round since Garrison Hearst in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 205-pound Jones is the Cavaliers' career rushing
leader with 4,108 yards. He set a single-season record with 1,908
yards last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said veteran Michael Pittman would
arrive at camp as the No. 1 tailback, but that Jones would have a
chance to win the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals begin two-a-day workouts Saturday at Northern
Arizona University.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an excellent way to start the camp,'' Tobin said. ''It's
a positive for us, that's for sure. It's the first time since I've
been here that we've ever had our No. 1 draft pick signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was given a physical at the Cardinals' training facility
in Tempe and was to arrive in Flagstaff later Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good, positive note to start camp on,'' quarterback
Jake Plummer said. ''Thomas is a guy that can help this team
offensively. He brings a lot of energy and a lot of excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have just two players unsigned as camp begins --
defensive end Simeon Rice and safety Tommy Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the team's designated franchise player, is expected to
hold out for much of the preseason, while Bennett is coming off
anterior cruciate ligament surgery.
</P>
<P>
   There also are indications that defensive tackle Mark Smith, who
recently signed a one-year contract for $1.03 million, will hold
out of camp to renegotiate his deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defensive end Andre Wadsworth is out for eight weeks
after undergoing knee surgery.

<HEADLINE> Braves 6, Mets 3  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves jumped on Al Leiter in the
first inning once again. The New York Mets battled back again. And,
just like last year's NL Championship Series, the Braves came out
on top.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan drove in three runs and John Burkett pitched 4 1-3
innings of scoreless relief Friday night, leading Atlanta to a 6-3
victory over the Mets in the team's first meeting at Turner Field
since that memorable Game 6 of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves extended their NL East lead over New York to six
games, but the Mets could have help on the way. They have agreed to
a trade with Cincinnati for All-Star shortstop Barry Larkin, who
hasn't decided if he will accept the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (7-4), dropped from the rotation when Atlanta traded for
Andy Ashby during the All-Star game, came on in the third inning
after starter Terry Mulholland gave up four hits and three runs.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and two outs, Burkett got Melvin Mora on a
flyout to center. The Braves right-hander wound up facing the
minimum during his stint on the mound, giving up his lone hit to
Lenny Harris leading off the fourth. He was erased on a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger worked two innings for his eighth save as the
Braves' bullpen surrendered just two runners over the last 6 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter failed to retire a batter when he started Game 6 last
October, handing Atlanta a 5-0 lead. New York came back for a pair
of one-run leads before the Braves won 10-9 in the 11th inning,
sending them to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (10-4) ran into early trouble again Friday. Rafael Furcal
and Andruw Jones led off with back-to-back singles and moved up on
a double steal while Chipper Jones was striking out. Jordan
followed with a two-run single to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets bounced back for a 3-2 lead in the third. Joe McEwing
and Jay Payton had RBI singles against Mulholland, who surrendered
another run on a wild pitch that skipped in front of the plate
after bouncing off catcher Javy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves quickly reclaimed the lead in the bottom half. Andruw
Jones singled with one out and moved to third on Chipper Jones'
double. Jordan grounded to third baseman Harris, who threw home
wildly in a futile attempt to get Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The ball flew by catcher Mike Piazza, allowing Chipper Jones to
move over to third. He scored an unearned run on Andres Galarraga's
grounder to short, pushing the Braves to a 4-3 lead before a
towel-waving sellout crowd of 49,313.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter allowed only one more hit during his six-inning stint,
but it was costly. After striking out the first two hitters in the
sixth, he served up a chest-high pitch to Lopez that wound up in
the left-field stands for his 15th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones drove in Atlanta's final run with an eighth-inning
single against Rich Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta now holds the upper hand over the Mets in the season
series. The teams split four games during an emotional series at
Shea Stadium on June 29-July 2, which marked John Rocker's return
to New York after a magazine article in which he disparaged the
city, along with gays, minorities and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was warming up in the ninth but didn't pitch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Leiter dropped to 0-3 lifetime at Turner Field, where he
has a 6.06 ERA in three appearances. Overall, Leiter is 5-6 against
the Braves. ... In addition to having two hits, Chipper Jones made
a brilliant diving stop on a grounder by Todd Zeile, throwing out
the Mets hitter to end the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Evidence Listed for Wen Ho Lee Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Computer code manuals, documents from
Los Alamos National Laboratory and unspecified printouts are among
the items prosecutors want to introduce as evidence in the trial of
a fired lab scientist accused of security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   So are a telephone list of the Los Alamos Chinese Cultural
Association, a log book with newspaper clippings and a map of
China, a letter in Chinese, travel photos that appear to be of
China, alumni listings and business cards.
</P>
<P>
   The material was seized in an April 1999 raid on the home of Wen
Ho Lee, who is charged with 59 counts, most alleging that he
transferred restricted information from secure to unsecure
computers and computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal judge rejected defense arguments that
agents illegally searched Lee's home with a broad search warrant
that allowed them to seize virtually anything.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors late Thursday listed more than two dozen items they
intend to use at the trial of the 60-year-old scientist and told
the court they would return the others.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest development in the case, Lee's defense attorneys
have filed another request for a new bail hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been held without bail since December because of what
the court has called national security concerns. Prosecutors have
said the material at issue in the case included the ''crown
jewels'' of American nuclear science.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys that since the first bail hearing, the
prosecution has changed its theory that Lee intended to serve as a
spy for a foreign country. Court documents filed this month by
prosecutors suggested that Lee sought the use of the material in
question to enhance his job prospects in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque,
which is handling the case, did not immediately return phone calls
Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Reds 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Luis Gonzalez's eighth-inning double drove in
the go-ahead run as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat Cincinnati 5-4
Friday night after Reds captain Barry Larkin revealed a tentative
deal that would send him to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Several pro-Larkin banners fluttered around the stadium and he
got a louder than usual round of applause in his first at-bat -- his
first appearance since word of his contract impasse broke last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds informed Larkin last Tuesday in Detroit that they won't
meet his request for a three-year, $27.9 million extension. The
Reds and the New York Mets have worked out a trade that requires
Larkin's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, who repeated before the game that he'd like to finish
his career in Cincinnati, went 0-for-3 with two walks. The Mets are
waiting for permission from the commissioner's office to talk to
Larkin, who can veto the trade.
</P>
<P>
   After wasting leadoff triples in the sixth and seventh -- both
set up by Dante Bichette's misplays in right field -- the
Diamondbacks finally got a clutch hit and broke a 4-all tie in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   A walk and Jay Bell's two-out single off Scott Sullivan (1-4)
left runners on first and third. Gonzalez hit a ground-rule double
off Dennys Reyes for the go-ahead run, leaving him 3-for-3 career
off the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Swindell (2-3) retired both batters he faced in the
seventh, getting Ken Griffey Jr. on a groundout and Bichette on a
strikeout. Matt Mantei pitched the ninth for his sixth save in
eight chances.
</P>
<P>
   Neither starter could hold a lead or keep runners off base for
very long. Arizona's Mike Morgan, making his fourth start of the
season, gave up 10 hits in five innings and left with the score
tied at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris wasn't much better, giving up nine hits in six
innings while wasting a pair of leads. Sean Casey's two-run double
put the Reds ahead in the first and extended his hitting streak to
a career-high 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks loaded the bases with the help of an
intentional two-out walk in the second to bring up Morgan. His soft
single to center drove in a run that tied it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Parris matched Morgan by slapping an RBI single off a fake bunt
as the Reds went up 3-2 in the second, but let his self-fashioned
lead get away in the fourth. Steve Finley led off with his 27th
homer and Erubiel Durazo singled and came around on a pair of wild
pitches and Danny Bautista's groundout for a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young's two-out single in the bottom of the fifth tied it
once again.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Morgan extended his hitting streak to four games with his
two singles. He's 7-for-14 at the plate this season. ... Morgan
remained winless as a starter this season. He's 4-0 with five saves
in 31 relief appearances, 0-2 in four starts. ... Cincinnati's
Larry Luebbers, scheduled to start Saturday's game, was scratched
Friday night because of tightness in his forearm. The Reds hadn't
decided on his replacement. ... Bichette had a pair of hits,
extending his hitting streak to a season-high 15 games. ... 3B
Aaron Boone was fitted for a brace for his sprained left knee
Friday. He'll start testing the knee in the next 10 days, when the
Reds will decide whether to activate him or consider surgery. ... A
banner in center read: ''Our Ship Will Sink Without The Captain.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Continues in Florida  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A heat wave loosened its
hold on much
of the South on Friday but held on in Florida, prompting warnings
for the elderly to take cover and stay cool.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A persistent high-pressure system has baked most of the South
with 100-degree temperatures nearly all month. Thermometers in
Alabama reached triple digits Friday for the 17th straight day
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Department of Elder Affairs asked area agencies Friday
to assist the elderly population and encouraged senior centers to
extend their operating hours to give residents refuge from the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Other spots got relief from thunderstorms, many of them intense,
and the cold front trailing the storms.
</P>
<P>
   Weather service meteorologist Tom Bradshaw said cooler weather
would continue. ''Basically, the hundreds have been depressed to
the lower part of the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's storms, accompanied by winds as high as 60 mph and
lightning, downed trees and knocked out power statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Power, which serves 1.3 million customers in the
southern two-thirds of the state, saw 190,000 customers lose
service at the height of the storm, a spokesman said. About 83,000
were still without power Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, severe storms Thursday and Friday also brought rain
and cooler temperatures. But the storms, with winds up to 80 mph,
were responsible for one death and power outages to about 53,000
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, more than 70,000 homes and businesses lost power
early Friday due to thunderstorms and 85-mph winds.

<HEADLINE> Corsicans, French Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Corsican nationalists and French officials joined
in support of an offer to grant more autonomy to Corsica in an
effort to ease the island's often strained relations with the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Corsican lawmakers said they were likely to approve Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin's plan, while government ministers on Friday
called the measure ''balanced'' and ''exemplary.''
</P>
<P>
   France has governed Corsica since 1763. The Mediterranean island
has been shaken by sporadic violence for decades as nationalists
pressed demands for independence.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the government offered Corsican lawmakers the power
to adapt certain French laws, part of an effort to end the violence
that has troubled the island for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Corsica's assembly, Jose Rossi, predicted that
the island's lawmakers would reach a near-consensus in favor of the
proposal when they consider it on July 28 in Ajaccio. If they
approve it, a bill could go before the French National Assembly
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Guy Talamoni, head of the Corsica Nazione nationalist
group, thanked the French ministers for listening to demands.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Corsican lawmakers would have a trial period
during which they could adapt certain French laws for use on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   At first France's parliament would have to approve any changes
to legislation, but Corsican lawmakers could have the final say on
adapting laws as soon as 2004 if the trial period goes
successfully.

<HEADLINE> Lance Deal Wins Hammer Throw  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Lance Deal, the most prolific hammer
thrower in the United States over the past decade, is ending his
career in style.
</P>
<P>
   Deal's style was nearly immaculate Friday night as he won the
hammer throw for the second straight time in the U.S. Olympic
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the American record-holder win the competition at
258 feet, 9 inches, he had the five best throws among the 12
competitors. Runner-up Kevin McMahon was more than 18 feet back, at
240-6.
</P>
<P>
   The victory earned Deal a ticket to the Olympic Games, where he
won the silver medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Deal has said this is his final year of
competition, and he would like nothing better to cap his career
with a gold medal at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amount of energy it takes to throw far is too
substantial,'' Deal said of his decision to retire. ''I don't know
whether it's because I'm old, hurt or bored, but I'm ready to move
onto something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal didn't appear old, hurt or bored Friday night as he won his
eighth national title in his final appearance on American soil.
Only on the final throw of the competition, when Deal's Olympic
berth and victory were assured, did he foul.
</P>
<P>
   So what will Deal do when he's not throwing?
</P>
<P>
   Manufacture throwing wires and hammer cages, what else?
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila, the world record-holder in the women's pole
vault, is taking the event higher and higher. On Sunday, she plans
to reach another plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I'm at ease like I was going into today,'' Dragila said
Friday, after clearing 13-2&AMP;frac14;, during the preliminaries to reach the
final.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt fast, I felt light and quick. If I go into Sunday
feeling I did today, I think you're going to see another world
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragila began the year sharing the world outdoor record with
Australia's Emma George at 15-1. She became the sole owner of the
mark by soaring 15-1&AMP;frac34; in Phoenix on May 6. Dragila also cleared
15-5 in Santa Barbara, Calif., last month, but the mark was
unacceptable as a world record because the competition was held
over an illegal runway on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The acrobatic Dragila, a former rodeo performer and occasional
heptathlete, broke the world indoor record three times this year,
with a best of 15-1&AMP;frac34; at the USA Championships in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   She also has the distinction of having won the inaugural world
indoor title in 1997 and the inaugural world outdoor title last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila has made amazing progress in only six years, when she
cleared 10-0, an American record. At the beginning, she was scared
of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first couple trillion times trying to go over the bar were
frightening,'' Dragila said.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending U.S. champion Chris Huffins' lead in the
decathlon dropped to 18 points over 1999 NCAA champion Tom Pappas
after eight of the 10 events.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins, the 1999 world bronze medalist, began the day 112
points ahead of Pappas after Thursday's first five events. He lost
five points of that advantage in Friday's opening event, the
110-meter hurdles, running 14.31 seconds to Pappas' 14.27, padded
the lead with a discus throw of 164-11 to Pappas' 153-6, but saw it
nearly disappear in the pole vault when he cleared only 14-9 to
Pappas 16-8&AMP;frac34;.
</P>
<P>
   Still to go were the javelin and 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   The decathlon lost much of its lustre when Olympic gold medalist
Dan O'Brien withdrew with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Austin, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the men's high
jump, was among 11 jumpers who advanced to Sunday's final by
clearing 7-2&AMP;frac12;.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Hemingway, the U.S. indoor champion and world leader with
an indoor clearance of 7-9&AMP;frac34;, also made the final.
</P>
<P>
   Five finals were scheduled Friday night -- the men's decathlon,
5,000 and hammer throw, and the women's shot put and 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Economists Evaluate Embargo Impact  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Economist Jonathan Coleman nodded his head as a
Havana city historian explained how things would be different if
the 38-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist island no longer
existed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would see cruise ships full of American tourists arriving
here,'' the historian, Eusebio Leal, told him and another economist
hired by the U.S. government to evaluate the sanctions' impact on
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would be able to buy more cheaply the materials needed to
renovate these old buildings,'' Leal said, motioning at the
recently rehabilitated office and apartment buildings that were too
dangerous to occupy just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers in Washington voted this week to chip away at
sanctions and travel restrictions by Americans to Cuba, the
economists were in Havana quietly working on an independent
government investigation of the embargo that could guide future
American policy on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Findings from their field work, with testimony from public
hearings in September, will form the first government report of its
kind since the embargo was imposed during the Kennedy
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an
independent nonpartisan federal agency, will be released on Feb.
15, 2001, and will look at impacts on both the American and Cuban
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This study is substantially significant,'' said John Kavulich,
president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a
business-funded educational organization that studies the island's
economy. The organization takes no public stance on the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are starting from a blank slate, beginning from a level
playing field to produce for policy-makers a report that is
believable and objective,'' Kavulich said. ''This will produce the
first document of its kind in the public domain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich said the council projects that the value of
unrestricted annual U.S.-Cuba bilateral trade five years after
normalization of commercial, economic and political relations would
range from $3 billion to $5 billion, with perhaps 65 percent to 70
percent being exports from the United States to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That projection assumes no travel restrictions, he said. U.S.
citizens traveling annually to Cuba on an unrestricted basis could
reach 3 million to 5 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the exports from the United States to Cuba would be
directed toward tourism, agriculture, durables goods such as
vehicles and light industry, Kavulich said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a dearth of U.S. government information on the
embargo's impacts. Several recent attempts in Congress to set up
bipartisan commissions to study the issue have been shot down by
embargo supporters worried that they could help end the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he and his fellow trade analyst from the
commission, James Strong, would not provide recommendations to the
House Ways and Means Committee, which requested the study. He noted
that the commission does not set policy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the report will consist of facts gathered
during their weeklong meetings here with Cuban economic, trade and
banking officials, American diplomats, and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said they would also conduct a telephone survey of about
100 American businesses on how they are affected by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation comes amid growing moves in Congress to soften
the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The House late Thursday approved language in a Treasury
Department spending bill that would halt enforcement of
restrictions against travel to Cuba as well as sales of food and
drugs to the island, but not actually eliminate those restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Senate approved an agriculture spending bill
for the coming fiscal year with language requiring congressional
approval for food and drug embargoes against any country, including
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a House-backed compromise on sales of food and
medicine to Cuba was recently forged between Rep. George
Nethercutt, who supports such sales, and House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Farm and business groups have endorsed the House agreement, but
Democrats who oppose the Cuba embargo say the deal doesn't go far
enough.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Dan Reichert pitched a six-hitter for his first
career shutout as the Kansas City Royals beat the Detroit Tigers
4-0 Friday night for their fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon was 3-for-5 for his seventh multi-hit game in
Kansas City's nine games since the All-Star break. He's 15-for-22
(.682) during the Royals' winning streak, and his 15 hits in four
games tied an AL record.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Dropo was the last AL player to get 15 hits in four games,
doing it in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Joe Randa had three hits against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were shut out for the 11th time, most in the majors.
The Royals also blanked the Tigers 6-0 on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Reichert (4-6) won for the first time since May 27 and first
time in five starts since he was put into the rotation June 24.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old right-hander matched his career high with six
strikeouts, walked two and kept the Tigers off-balance all night,
causing several broken-bat grounders. It was his first career
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weaver (6-8) allowed four runs, three earned, and nine hits
in 8 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers committed three errors, including one by second
baseman Damion Easley that was his first in 100 games over the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney drew a two-out walk in the first and scored when
Jermaine Dye hit Weaver's next pitch to the flag pole in
left-center field for a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez's RBI groundout made it 2-0 in the third after Damon
beat out a bunt single and moved to third on throwing errors by
Weaver and right fielder Rich Becker.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dunwoody had a sacrifice fly and Gregg Zaun an RBI single
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers never had more than one runner on base before the
sixth, when Bobby Higginson and Dean Palmer hit one-out singles.
But Reichert struck out Luis Polonia before Deivi Cruz grounded out
to end the threat.
Notes: Damon is 24-for-41 (.595) in the Royals' nine games since
the All-Star break. ... The Tigers will hold their annual Negro
Leagues salute prior to the first game of Saturday's day-night
doubleheader with the Royals. The Tigers will wear replica uniforms
of the Detroit Stars and the Royals will dress as the Kansas City
Monarchs. ... Saturday's doubleheader is the first in Comerica Park
history and was necessitated by a May 9 rainout.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Rookie Mark Redman came within two outs of
his first professional shutout, pitching the Minnesota Twins past
the Cleveland Indians 2-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Redman (8-4) had not allowed a runner past first base until
Manny Ramirez hit his 19th home run with one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins then relieved and gave up a single to Travis
Fryman and a double to Richie Sexson. But Fryman was thrown out at
the plate by shortstop Cristian Guzman on a grounder by Alex
Ramirez,
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins struck out pinch-hitter Russell Branyan for his seventh
save.
</P>
<P>
   Bartolo Colon (9-7) gave up eight hits in a complete game. The
Indians lost their third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Redman gave up six hits, struck out six and walked one. The
left-hander won his third straight start and leads all AL rookie
pitchers in victories, strikeouts and innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   David Ortiz had two hits, drove in a run and scored one. His
streak of eight consecutive hits ended one short of the Twins
record when he grounded out in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, however, Ortiz started another streak with
a RBI single that drove home Matt Lawton, who had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz lined an one-out single in the sixth and scored on Corey
Koskie's double into the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, a Twins' first-round draft pick in 1995, kept the
Indians off-balance with an assortment of off-speed pitches. His
eight wins are the most by a Minnesota rookie since Brad Radke won
11 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His only trouble before Ramirez homered came in the third when
Jolbert Cabrera led off with a double and was sacrificed to third.
Redman struck out Omar Vizquel and Jim Thome to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel tied the AL record for shortstops by playing his 95th
straight game without an error. He matched the mark set by Cal
Ripken in 1990, while the major league record is 101 by Rey Ordonez
of the New York Mets.
Notes: Indians 2B Roberto Alomar has tendinitis in his left ankle
and did not accompany the team to Minneapolis. He is scheduled to
rejoin the team Tuesday in Toronto. ... Twins manager Tom Kelly
rejoined the team an hour prior to gametime, but did not manage the
game. Kelly had been in Fort Myers, Fla., since the All-Star break
tending to his ailing father. Third base coach Ron Gardenhire has
handled the team in Kelly's absence, posting a 5-4 won-loss record.

Cheney Said To Be Bush's Top VP Pick
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is seriously considering former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as his Republican running mate, turning to a
respected Washington insider in the final days of his search for a vice
presidential candidate, two highly placed GOP officials said. The former
lawmaker, White House chief of staff and Defense Secretary -- the man heading up
Bush's search team -- thrust himself into the process by changing his voter
registration today from Texas to Wyoming. Cheney, who is considered the leading
candidate, made the move to ensure he is eligible for the job if the governor
decides to offer it, said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- In a bid to clear the most stubborn obstacle to a Camp
David peace agreement, the United States is promoting an Israeli-initiated
proposal to recognize Palestinian administrative control over Arab neighborhoods
of Jerusalem. An Israeli Cabinet officer said in Jerusalem that the proposal
conveyed the ''characteristic'' of Palestinian sovereignty in the eastern area
of the contested city -- a long-cherished Palestinian goal. Reacting coolly to
the ideas, Hassan Abdel Rahman, Washington representative of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, said today: ''Short of total Palestinian sovereignty
over East Jerusalem, there is not a ground for an agreement.''

reported missing after it failed to return from a 35-minute tour of the rugged
West Maui mountains. The wreckage was found near the chopper's last known radar
fix, said Wil Absher of the Coast Guard's Joint Coordination Rescue Center in
Honolulu. Patti Chevalier, who owns the tour company with her husband, declined
to identify the passengers, but said they were all tourists. She said the pilot

USDA To Stop Stamping Imported Meat

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meat imported from other countries and inspected in the
United States will no longer carry USDA grade stamps, the Agriculture Department
announced today. Currently, all meat inspected in the United States, regardless
of where it is produced, gets a USDA stamp such as ''prime,'' ''choice'' or
''select.'' The USDA said it was changing the practice because of consumer
confusion over origin of meat products. U.S. ranchers had sought the change,
saying the USDA stamp serves as a form of advertising not meant for foreign
meats.

Missouri River Flow Battled Over

''spring pulse,'' or increase in the river's flow, to save endangered species
along its 2,341-mile-long waterway. To implement that, Senate Democrats want to
eliminate protections against increased springtime water releases now in place
for farmers, barge operators and other river users. At issue is legislation to
prohibit such a change inserted in the annual energy and water spending bill by
Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Fire Forces Evacuations  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- Fire crews called in
reinforcements Friday to battle a 1,500-acre wildfire that spread
quickly across tinder-dry mesas and canyons, forcing the evacuation
of about 1,000 tourists from Mesa Verde National Park.
</P>
<P>
   At least 300 firefighters, aided by slurry bombers, were
fighting flames in rugged, steep terrain on the eastern boundary of
the park, about 260 miles southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-whipped flames sent a gray curtain of smoke into the sky
Friday. ''Oh, my! It's grown,'' said Jane Anderson, who works for
the park and lives nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was not threatening any of the cliff dwellings and mesa
villages built by Pueblo Indians up to 1,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But 14 archaeologists traveling with fire crews discovered some
new archaeological sites -- mounds of rubble that once were walls --
that were exposed when the flames burned away vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, apparently caused by lightning, broke out on the
eastern boundary of the 52,000-acre park on Thursday. It raced
through juniper, pinon and oak brush, burning within a mile of the
single road through the area.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service officials said the park would probably
remain off-limits to tourists through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, firefighters conquered two wildfires that
blackened more than 100,000 acres of remote rangeland in
north-central Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   But their comrades remained busy on two other large fires -- a
blaze about 200 miles northeast of Reno that had grown to 10,000
acres and a fire exceeding 4,000 acres in central Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fire that burned more than 47,000 acres, leveled
more than 200 homes and burned portable buildings at New Mexico's
Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab was finally extinguished completely.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began with a prescribed burn set May 4 by the National
Park Service. The cost of fighting it has been pegged at $8.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 56,000 fires have burned 2.8 million acres across the
nation this season, according to the National Interagency Fire
Center in Idaho. That is the highest total since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Former 'King of Cocaine' Dies  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Roberto Suarez Gomez, a drug trafficker
who called himself the ''King of Cocaine'' and claimed to be the
model for a character in the movie ''Scarface,'' has died from a
heart attack, his family said. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez, who died in the city of Santa Cruz on Thursday
night, was released from prison in 1996 after serving almost nine
years for drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   By his death, most of his vast fortune had dissipated and the
one-time drug lord said he was repentant.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez played a major role in the expansion of cocaine
trafficking in Bolivia, and gained notoriety in 1983 when he
offered to pay the country's foreign debt of $3 billion with
proceeds from cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez was born into a prominent ranching family in the
tropical Beni region. He became involved in cocaine trafficking in
the mid-1970s and early-1980s -- a time when the cocaine trade in
Bolivia had taken off. In recent years, the government has made
significant inroads in destroying coca leaf, which is used to
produce the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez said he became a millionaire seven months after
going into the cocaine business, and the money kept pouring in. He
later said he had accumulated $40 million from cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez was also one of its main supporters of a military
regime that held power from 1980 to 1982, and he helped finance it.
</P>
<P>
   During a prison interview with The Associated Press in 1998, he
said one of his dreams was to become a Hollywood actor. He often
bragged that he had been the model for a drug trafficker in the
1983 film ''Scarface'' starring Al Pacino, the saga of a Cuban
refugee who becomes a cocaine kingpin in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez's downfall came in 1988 when he was sentenced to 15
years for drug crimes. He was released early, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, Jorge Roca Suarez, took over the drug business, and
was arrested several years ago in the United States, where he is
serving a long sentence for trafficking cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez claimed to have found faith in prison, and often
posed next to a poster of Jesus Christ that hung on his jail wall.
</P>
<P>
   In a TV interview weeks before his death, he expressed remorse
about his life of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst mistake I ever made in my life was to have gotten
involved in cocaine trafficking,'' Suarez Gomez told the local TV
station.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez Gomez's lawyer, Maria Teresa Montano, said he had 18
children from several different wives. His last wife deserted him
some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile-like
form of the encephalitis virus have been detected in Stamford, the
first such finding in Connecticut this season, officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection plans to spray
a two-mile radius of Stamford, Darien and New Canaan with
insecticide on Monday night in response to the finding.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also plan to step up testing and the spraying of
larvicide, said Stamford Health Director Anthony Iton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a particularly large risk,'' Iton said.
''But it's a real risk and we need to take prudent measures to
reduce that risk to a minimum. People should not become overly
alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The potentially deadly virus has never been found in humans in
Connecticut, but last summer killed seven people in the New York
area.
</P>
<P>
   Iton also expressed concern about a sharp increase in dead birds
in the past week in Stamford. Tests have not been completed on the
birds, but Iton said he suspects the virus is behind the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The positive test results released Friday were from a pool of
nine Culex Restuans mosquitoes trapped in Stamford on July 11 and
tested at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The Culex Restuan primarily bites birds, but has been known to
bite humans, Iton said.
</P>
<P>
   Iton said he was not surprised by the positive test results
after the virus was detected in New York in mosquitos and birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it was only a matter of time before it came to
Stamford and Connecticut,'' Iton said.
</P>
<P>
   The spray to be used Monday contains the pesticide Resmethrin.
The spray has a low toxicity and officials will be ''conservative''
in its use, said Jane Stahl, a deputy commissioner of the DEP.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize many residents may be concerned about the use of
pesticides, but we have carefully weighed those concerns against
the threat of West Nile virus on the health of our citizens,'' said
DEP Commissioner Arthur Rocque.
</P>
<P>
   During the spraying, residents are advised to stay indoors,
close their windows, cover pools, bring in pets and shut off air
conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   Iton said homeowners can reduce their risk of being bitten by an
infected mosquito specifically taking measures to eliminate
standing water where mosquitoes thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the measures we're taking and will be taking have
substantially reduced the risk of human transmission,'' Iton said.
''There's no magic bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said while the department believes the risk of mosquitoes
transmitting the virus to humans is low, officials also believe the
threat will not remain isolated in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the expectation is we will see more positive
isolations,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Former NBA Player Faces Drug Charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THIENSVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Paul Mokeski, the former NBA player who
recently became coach of the ABA's Kansas City Knights, has been
charged with misdemeanor possession of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Mokeski, 43, played at Kansas and spent 12 years in the NBA with
Houston, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee and Golden State. He
recently moved from California to Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the charge filed Wednesday in Ozaukee County
Circuit Court, police stopped Mokeski early June 9 on suspicion of
drunken driving, and he was booked into the jail at 4:05 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   While he was being searched, deputies found a folded paper with
''a white powdery substance which appeared to be cocaine,'' the
complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was confiscated from Mr. Mokeski and after advising him of
his rights, he indicated it was cocaine that was in the folded
paper and he had paid $100 for the cocaine,'' the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Mokeski told deputies ''he had snorted a couple of lines of the
cocaine about an hour before he was stopped by police,'' the
complaint says, and ''he also indicated that he uses cocaine on a
regular basis.''
</P>

<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles stopped their 20-game
losing streak in Canada, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 9-5 Friday
night behind Harold Baines' bat.
</P>
<P>
   Baines had four hits, including a home run, as the Orioles won
in Canada for the first time since defeating Toronto on June 13,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore had lost 14 in a row at SkyDome and had been swept in
both of its interleague series played at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista hit his 29th and 30th home runs for the Blue Jays.
Toronto has homered in 20 straight home games, one short of the
club record set previously this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp (6-6) won for just the third time in his last 16
starts. He gave up four earned runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Baines went 4-for-5 and drove in two runs. Delino DeShields and
Will Clark also homered for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields' homer off Roy Halladay (4-6) gave Baltimore a 1-0
lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles scored three times in the second. Charles Johnson
and Baines singled home runs and another scored on Ivanon Coffie's
double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart homered for Toronto in the third, but Baines
homered in the fourth to give Baltimore a 5-1 lead. Halladay gave
up five runs in just 3&AMP;frac12; innings, raising his to ERA 11.05.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored twice in the fifth. After Chris Woodward
singled, Stewart tripled and Raul Mondesi had an RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Coffie's RBI double in the sixth gave Baltimore a 6-3 lead. The
Orioles added two runs in the eighth on DeShields' sacrifice fly
and Albert Belle's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Batista hit solo homers off Rapp in the sixth and Buddy Groom in
the eighth. Clark homered in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Orioles' 14 defeats were one shy of the club record for
most consecutive road losses to one team. The Orioles lost 15
straight at Cleveland from April 30, 1955, through July 27, 1956.
... Friday was Olympic night at SkyDome as 25 Canadian Olympic
athletes were honored before the game. ... Toronto reliever Lance
Painter, who turned 33 on Friday, gave up one run on three hits in
2 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Fire Doubles in Size  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- Fire crews called in
reinforcements to battle a 3,500-acre wildfire that doubled in size
Friday, spreading quickly across tinder-dry mesas and canyons and
forcing the evacuation of 1,000 tourists from Mesa Verde National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 firefighters, aided by slurry bombers, were fighting
flames in rugged, steep terrain on the eastern boundary of the
park, about 260 miles southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-whipped flames sent a gray curtain of smoke into the sky
Friday. ''Oh, my! It's grown,'' said Jane Anderson, who works for
the park and lives nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was not threatening any of the cliff dwellings and mesa
villages built by Pueblo Indians up to 1,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But 14 archaeologists traveling with fire crews discovered some
new archaeological sites -- mounds of rubble that once were walls --
that were exposed when the flames burned away vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, apparently caused by lightning, broke out on the
eastern boundary of the 52,000-acre park on Thursday. It raced
through juniper, pinon and oak brush, burning within a mile of the
single road through the area.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service officials said the park would probably
remain off-limits to tourists through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The canyon walls are so steep that firefighters had difficulty
reaching the flames. Officials said the fire was so intense it was
creating powerful updrafts, in effect making its own weather rather
than being pushed by winds.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, firefighters conquered two wildfires that
blackened more than 100,000 acres of remote rangeland in
north-central Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   But their comrades remained busy on two other large fires -- a
blaze about 200 miles northeast of Reno that had grown to 10,000
acres and a fire exceeding 4,000 acres in central Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fire that burned more than 47,000 acres, leveled
more than 200 homes and burned portable buildings at New Mexico's
Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab was finally extinguished completely.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began with a prescribed burn set May 4 by the National
Park Service. The cost of fighting it has been pegged at $8.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 56,000 fires have burned 2.8 million acres across the
nation this season, according to the National Interagency Fire
Center in Idaho. That is the highest total since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Cop Cleared in Soccer Disaster  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEEDS, England (AP) -- A British court acquitted a former police
superintendent of manslaughter Friday in connection with a soccer
stadium disaster 11 years ago that left 96 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fans' groups have long argued that police caused the disaster at
Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, 150 miles north of London, by
herding spectators who arrived late into an overcrowded, fenced-off
area behind a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were crushed to death in Britain's worst
soccer disaster ever.
</P>
<P>
   A Leeds Crown Court jury acquitted Bernard Murray, 58, of two
manslaughter charges in the deaths of two victims. Murray had been
in the police control box overlooking the stands during a playoff
match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on April 15, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is also considering the same charges against the police
commander at the soccer match, former Chief Superintendent David
Duckenfield. Both men denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial Murray said he was ''haunted'' by the thought
that he could have saved some of the victims and said he understood
the feelings of the bereaved relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know how they feel and I know a lot of them blame me,'' he
said. ''I just hope they can be a little understanding because it
does affect me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I do feel a sense of responsibility, I always have had,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Edgar Renteria drove in four runs and rookie Rick
Ankiel struck out 11 Houston Astros in seven innings as the St.
Louis Cardinals stopped a three-game losing streak with a 12-1
victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel (7-5) allowed only three hits and tied his career
strikeout high to win for the first time in five outings. He had
two no-decisions and two losses and had not won since June 20.
Ankiel also went 2-for-3 and scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton (9-4) had a five-game winning streak snapped,
losing for the first time since June 16. Elarton allowed five runs,
only three earned, on seven hits and three walks with no strikeouts
in 3 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored first when Fernando Vina led off the game
with a single to right and scored on Thomas Howard's double to
left-center. Fernando Tatis' single drove in Howard for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit his 24th home run to make it 2-1 in the bottom
of the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals chased Elarton in the fourth when Edgar Renteria
drove in Ankiel, who reached on an error by second baseman Craig
Biggio, with a single. Jim Edmonds doubled to right to drive in
Vina.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Slusarski relieved and Renteria scored on an infield out by
Howard to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Ankiel's single off the left-field wall drove in
Eduardo Perez. One out later, Renteria's three-run homer, his
career-high 12th, made it 9-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Perez led off the seventh with a first-pitch home run, his third
of the year. After Wilkins walked and Ankiel singled, Vina doubled,
making it 11-1.Notes: Bill Spiers leads the Astros with eight pinch-hits and is
hitting .348 (8-for-23) as a pinch-hitter ... Friday's attendance
of 42,811 was the largest ever at Enron Field. It also was the
fourth consecutive home sellout and 19th this season ... Renteria,
who tied a career-high, also had four RBIs April 11 against
Houston. ... Ankiel also struck out 11 on May 25 against Florida
and June 4 against Cleveland. ... The loss was the most-lopsided
this season for the Astros.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Lisa Leslie hit two free throws with 27 seconds
remaining to snap a tie, and the Los Angeles Sparks went on to a
74-68 victory over the Phoenix Mercury on Friday night to clinch a
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie finished with 30 points and 16 rebounds. Brandy Reed
scored 21 to lead the Mercury (14-8).
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the fourth straight for the Sparks (20-3).
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's Jennifer Gillom hit a 3-pointer with 1:15 left to tie
it at 68 before Leslie broke the tie with her free throws. Tamecka
Dixon and DeLisha Milton each added two free throws in the final 12
seconds for the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring both inside and on long jumpers, Leslie shot 11-for-23
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Milton added 16 points and Dixon 12 for the Sparks. Lisa
Harrison scored 13 points and Gillom and Ranika Sarensac each had
12 for the Mercury.

<P>
   In the teams' previous meeting, the Sparks beat the Mercury by
21 in Los Angeles.
</P>

   Los Angeles twice built a 10-point lead in the first half. But a
three-point play by Reed with 39 seconds left gave the Mercury a
34-33 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury played for the second straight game without coach
Cheryl Miller, who is recuperating from knee surgery. The Sparks
played the final 11:40 without coach Michael Cooper after he was

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Discuss Military  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- Facing a pivotal decision about building a
U.S. missile defense shield, President Clinton expressed doubts
Saturday about North Korea's offer to abandon its missile program
in exchange for Western help in launching space satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said North Korea's proposal needs to be explored but
added, ''It's not clear to me exactly what the offer is and what is
being requested and the time for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think we heard enough so that there should be an attempt
to determine what the facts are here,'' the president said. ''But I
can't say that I'm clear enough on what the offer was to make a
final judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's suspected missile ambitions are a key factor in
the U.S. drive to develop a missile shield to protect all 50 states
from nuclear attack. Clinton is to decide in the next few months
whether to move ahead with the controversial program, heatedly
opposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the president discussed North Korea's offer with
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met this week with North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Clinton also talked about North Korea
Saturday with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori. The talks were
held on the sidelines of the annual summit of major industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
   If the North Korean missile threat disappeared, it could slow
the momentum for the U.S. program. Key American allies oppose the
proposed shield. French President Jacques Chirac said it could
trigger an arms race, and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
he was ''skeptical'' about it.
</P>
<P>
   James Steinberg, Clinton's deputy national security adviser,
said that only a handful of countries have the ability to launch
satellites into space. It is unclear whether North Korea wants
other countries to provide launch services, or to give North Korea
spare rockets. He said the United States would have concerns about
giving North Korea rockets ''because it would give them access to
the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, underscored U.S. skepticism about North Korea's
intentions. ''It's not entirely clear what is in Kim Jong Il's mind
with regard to this possible tradeoff,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   There is ''a very dangerous possibility'' that North Korea might
be trying to persuade other countries to provide launch capability
for supposedly peaceful purposes when, in fact, that is not their
intention, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who has been rallying worldwide opposition to Clinton's
plan, met with the president for 75 minutes. They issued a joint
statement pledging closer cooperation on curbing the spread of
missiles and missile technology. They also said they would set up a
joint U.S.-Russia center within a year for exchanging data from
systems that provide early warning in the event of a missile
launch.
</P>
<P>
   Putin paid the first-ever visit by a Russian president to
communist North Korea on Wednesday. Afterward, he said that North
Korea's program was meant for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Putin and Clinton
discussed Kim's reported offer to abandon his country's missile
program in exchange for help in putting peaceful satellites into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said the proposal did not mean that North Korea would
receive missiles or missile technology to independently launch its
satellites. Instead, he said, the North Koreans want other nations
to launch their satellites for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If such assistance is offered, North Korea is ready to stop
ballistic missile tests,'' Ivanov said. ''It's too early to discuss
specifics, such as whether such assistance would envisage providing
funds or carrying out launches.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior U.S. official said there would be followup
discussions about North Korea's offer over the next day or so. The
United States would be interested if North Korea would give up its
ballistic missile program in exchange for international help in
putting its satellites into orbit -- provided the launches were
outside North Korean territory and subject to international
technology controls, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said that Putin gave Clinton Russian proposals on deeper
weapons cuts under the prospective START III treaty, but he
wouldn't give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. missile shield would require an amendment to the 1972
Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which bans national missile defenses.
Russia already has refused to approve such a change, as proposed by
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Tour Copter Crashes, 7 Die  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- A tour helicopter on a sightseeing flight
crashed Friday on the island of Maui, killing all seven people
aboard, the company's owner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Hawaiian Helicopters AS355 twin-engine aircraft was
reported missing after it failed to return from a 35-minute tour of
the rugged west Maui mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was found in a valley near the chopper's last known
radar fix, said Wil Absher of the Coast Guard's Joint Coordination
Rescue Center in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're crushed, we're devastated, and our hearts go out to the
families,'' said Patti Chevalier, who owns the tour company with
her husband, Dave, a former Vietnam scout pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard spokeswoman Jacquelyn Zettles said there were low
clouds at the time of the crash. Those are normal conditions for
the lush, misty valley that is home to Iao Needle, a grassy, narrow
mountain that is a popular tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Chevalier would not identify the passengers, but said they were
all tourists. She said the pilot had more than 11,000 hours of
flying experience and had been with the company for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   This was Hawaii's third notable aircraft crash in 11 months. On
Sept. 25, a tour plane crashed on the slopes of Mauna Loa on the
Big Island, killing all 10 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, a private jet slammed into a hillside while
approaching an airport on Molokai, killing all six people on board.

Liberation Organization, said Friday: ''Short of total Palestinian sovereignty

Food Stamp Fraud Still Prevalent

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Criminals are still swindling $660 million a year in food
stamp benefits from the government, despite the widespread use of electronic
debit cards in place of the traditional, easy-to-traffic paper coupons, federal
officials say. Still, the amount of federal money stolen each year by criminals
has decreased 19 percent, from $815 million in 1993 to $660 million annually
from 1996-98, Agriculture Department officials say. And the trafficking rate --
which compares dollars trafficked to benefits issued -- dropped 8 percent from
3.8 cents per dollar in 1993 to 3.5 cents in 1998, according to a new department
