<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Suspension of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Wednesday reiterated Moscow's call for a suspension of
sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Moscow regards it "as an intermediate step that in its final
account should lead to their complete lifting," said Ivanov
following talks here with visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He said the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have
made a certain amount of progress in coordinating their positions
on the draft resolution on Iraq, but no complete understanding has
been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, for his part, described a draft resolution initiated by
Britain and the Netherlands on Iraq and being considered by the U.
N. Security Council as a "rotten document that imposes new terms
on Iraq and infringes on its sovereignty," the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has made the decision not to accept this document and"
urges our Russian friends to prevent its adoption," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived here Tuesday on a four-day working visit,
also met with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Contacts Underway with U.S. to Push Forward Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat said contacts are going on with the
United States to push forward the Middle East peace process and
implement the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference upon his arrival from a tour of Russia
and Egypt, Arafat described his talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak as "positive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak showed, as usual, readiness to play a role in
protecting the peace process and implementing the Sharm El-Sheikh
memo that was signed under Egypt's auspices in early September,
Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
On his talks with the Russian leaders, he said they were
"positive and substantial."
</P>
<P>
He added he had a phone conversation with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, who is being treated in a hospital, for 45 minutes
to apprise him of the developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat condemned the Israeli settlement activities
as "illegal acts that undermine the peace process, a fact that was
admitted to by the United States, Russia, the European Union and
the Arab states."

<HEADLINE> Sudan Opposes U.S. Provides Food Supply to SPLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has officially declared
its opposition to a U.S. decision to provide food aid to John
Garang-led rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
Sudan deemed the move as threatening its national security,
according to an official press release read by Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Ali Abdul-Rahman Numeiri on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The move shows U.S. administration's disrespect of the United
Nations Charter," Numeiri said, adding that it was a breach of the
internationally-accepted principles and rules.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, any mechanism on the humanitarian arena should
be channeled through the U.N., Sudan and the U.N. have agreed on
a definite mechanism, namely the "life line operation," for
offering food supplies to southern Sudan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has been locked in a 16-year-old civil war between
Sudanese government and the north opposition parties and the south
SPLA. The devastating war and ensuing famine have claimed nearly 2
million lives in the poor African country.
</P>
<P>
A Egyptian-Libyan initiative for Sudanese national
reconciliation is under discussion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision will create a food gap in Sudan and a
humanitarian crisis, so it is challenged by many human relief
organizations whether governmental or non-governmental, according
to the press release.
</P>
<P>
Some of the organizations declared their intention to stop
cooperation with the U.S. administration in its endeavor to supply
the SPLA with direct relief materials.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move is in line with the U.S. decision to bombard the
Shifa' Pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum and to use the weapon of
food supplies against Sudan as well as impose unjust sanctions on
Sudan for groundless accusations, Numeiri pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is contacting with various world organizations and
countries to explain the state of the affairs and being ready for
explaining the situation before international and regional
organizations as a prelude to pass a resolution against the
U.S. decision.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges to Break Conspiracy of Silence Around AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday urged the international community to break
the conspiracy of silence around AIDS so as to bring the epidemic
under control.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the occasion of the World's AIDS Day,
December 1, Annan said "on this last World's AIDS Day of the 20th
century, we still have no cure for AIDS."
</P>
<P>
"HIV has infected more than 50 million people so far. Of them,
16 million have died already. This year alone, the epidemic
claimed a record of 2.6 million lives. And in Africa, for the
first time, infected women aged 15 to 49 outnumbered infected men,
" the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Altogether, a staggering 11.2 million children have been
orphaned by AIDS since the start of the epidemic, As the number of
adult Aids grows, so will the number of orphans," said he.
</P>
<P>
Annan pointed out that lack of affection, close bonds,
education about healthy sexuality, and in addition, violence,
poverty and discrimination contributed to the high number of
children and young people infected with the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to battle the culture of shame. Hiding AIDS
behind a curtain of stigma helps to spread it. Speaking out about
AIDS helps slow it down," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> British PM On Beef Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said his Government is "101 percent behind" the beef
industry's bid to restore export markets after the BSE crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister told a Downing Street meeting of industry
leaders Wednesday that getting the EU beef ban lifted is only the
first step on the road to restoring a market once worth 350
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came less than 24 hours after Agriculture Minister
Nick Brown declared that the domestic ban on sales of beef-on-the
bone would be lifted on December 17.
</P>
<P>
"This lifting of the ban has been long awaited and I am
delighted that it can now go ahead," he said. "The announcement
will bring a welcome boost to the beef industry in what continue
to be difficult times."
</P>
<P>
Supermarket giant Safeway is reported putting beef-on-the-bone
on sale in at least one supermarket and plans to sell the banned
meat in other stores later.

<HEADLINE> 2400 Aids Cases Reported in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece has a total number of 2,
400 HIV infected patients, Greece's Deputy Health and Welfare
Minister Theodoros Kotsonis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the occasion of World Day
Against AIDS, he said that of the 2,400, 35 were children.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, figures presented by the University of Athens place
Greece around 10th of European countries in terms of the number of
new AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
Professor Angelos Hatzakis of the Athens University said that
intravenous drug users were most likely to contract AIDS, followed
by heterosexuals, and homosexual activity came further down the
list.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, the first AIDS case was reported in 1981.
</P>
<P>
HIV infection could significantly increase in the country due
to the growing number of drug users and the influx and mobility of
illegal immigrants and prostitutes from the Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to raise public awareness about AIDS and to reach
out to high-risk groups, various state-supported and private non-
governmental organizations around the country provide social and
psychological support.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework of a nationwide AIDS awareness campaign,
there is a free telephone helpline in Athens and the northern
Greek city of Thessaloniki.

<HEADLINE> Queen Elizabeth Approves Transferring Power to N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua ) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth
Wednesday formally approved the transfer of responsibilities from
London to Belfast, thus ending 27 years of direct rule of Northern
Ireland from London.
</P>
<P>
Uttering the single word "Approved" in a brief ceremony at
Buckingham Palace, the queen gave her backing to the legislation
transferring power to Northern Ireland after it was rushed through
parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the queen's approval completed the legal
formalities and power would be formally transferred at midnight.
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for key issues such as health, education,
finance and culture will now pass to the assembly and locally
elected politicians, for the first time in a generation.
</P>
<P>
The move to end 27 years of direct rule, is one of the key
parts of the Good Friday Agreement peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Peers in the House of Lords first passed the motion on Tuesday
afternoon, sending it to the main legislative chamber, the House
of Commons, which passed it shortly after midnight. The MPs voted
by 318 to 10 to back devolution.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed the setting up of a power-
sharing executive in Northern Ireland as "one huge giant step"
towards lasting peace, saying it was a significant breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irish Junior Foreign Minister Liz O'Donnell arrived
at Stormont in Belfast on Wednesday for the inaugural meeting of
the North South Ministerial Council.
</P>
<P>
She announced that the first meeting of the new body after
devolution will be on December 30.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Northern Ireland Executive is due to meet for
the first time and will begin to take political responsibility for
most of the departments currently dealt with by Northern Ireland
Office direct rule ministers.
</P>
<P>
But with devolution little more than hours away the IRA has
said it is unhappy with the decommissioning timetable, underlining
the fragility of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Protestant unionists and Catholic republicans agreed to set up
a partnership government on Monday to run the province, the first
time the bitterly divided parties will have shared power.
</P>
<P>
Centuries of suspicion will have to be buried but a carefully
planned step-by-step deal appears to have ended 20 months of
political wrangling that paralyzed the process.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Appeals for Peace in Burundi at Early Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Wednesday called for the restoration of peace in Burundi
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the regional summit in Arusha, northern Tanzania,
the president said that prolonging the peace process would in
effect prolong the suffering of the people of Burundi, according
to a press release issued by the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties involved in the conflict to address their
task urgently so that the region can attend to other urgent
problems.
</P>
<P>
Museveni cautioned Burundi about the indiscriminate violence
being meted out on combatants and civilians and all groups
involved in the conflict including the national army, saying all
regional leaders condemn this kind of violence.
</P>
<P>
The initiative on Burundi peace must succeed so that regional
problems are solved by homemade solutions, failure of which will
encourage outside intervention and it might lead to the
proliferation of conflicts in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, also chairman of the regional initiative on Burundi,
paid tribute to Julius Nyerere, late founding president of
Tanzania, praising him for bringing great dedication,
determination and vision to the regional efforts being pursued
today.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day summit, former South African President Nelson
Mandela was designated as the new mediator of the Burundi peace
process to continue the course pursued by Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in Burundi are characterized by ethnic hatred and
killing. Ethnic reconciliation between the Hutus and Tutsis has
been regarded as the sole everlasting solution to the problem in
the African country.

<HEADLINE> World AIDS Day Marked in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A march and then a rally were
held here Wednesday to mark the World AIDS Day with calls for
continued fight against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to fight this disaster vigorously," said
Zambian Minister of Sport, Youth and Child Development Abel
Chambeshi while addressing the rally.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the world AIDS campaign this year is "listen,
learn, live, world AIDS campaign with children and young people."
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "We must listen to the children and the
young people, hear their views and concerns and understand what is
vital to their lives."
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, we should learn from one another about respect,
participation, support and ways to prevent HIV infection," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should live in a community where rights of the children and
 young people are protected and where those living with HIV/AIDS
are cared for. We must see that they do not suffer from
discrimination," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the young people are in fact living in a world of
paradox: they are told to abstain, but at the same time they are
exposed to a barrage of advertisements using sex symbolism to sell
goods, so temptation grows in abundance.
</P>
<P>
"Our battle has to remain on and on until we eliminate this
infection from our midst," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants were representatives from the United
Nations agencies, bilateral agencies, non-government and
community-based organizations.
</P>
<P>
Placards were held high inscribed with slogans: Be wise, learn
about AIDS and survive; Abstain, be faithful character.
</P>
<P>
According to Zambian Health Ministry, an estimated 19.7 percent
of the entire adult population of the country aged 15-49 is
currently infected with HIV/AIDS and the majority of the
infections are transmitted through heterosexual contact.

<HEADLINE> Russia: No Plans to "Unfreeze" Ties With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian military
official said Wednesday that Moscow has no plans to unfreeze" ties
with NATO, an alliance that participated in the aggression against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian leadership has not given the Defense Ministry any
instructions to fully restore relations with NATO," said Colonel
General Leonid Ivashov, head of the ministry's Department for
International Military Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, neither Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, nor
Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin will go to Brussels on December 2
and 3, when a meeting of the Russia-NATO Permanent Council and a
session of the Council of Euro-Atlantic Partnership are to be held.
</P>
<P>
Moscow froze its relations with NATO after the transatlantic
military bloc started its 78-day air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At present, contacts between the Russian Defense Ministry and
NATO are maintained exclusively within the framework of the
peacekeeping operation in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Ivashov
said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax, citing diplomatic sources, said Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov also does not plan to attend a session of the
Russia-NATO Permanent Council at the level of foreign ministers,
scheduled for mid-December in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
NATO has repeatedly expressed its wish to resume full ties with
Russia, but Moscow remains adamant, especially amid mounting
pressure from NATO countries over its military campaign against
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General George Robertson, in an interview with
Interfax Wednesday, again urged for full resumption of its
relations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"I see no strategic alternative to developing the NATO-Russia
partnership. It is an indispensable pillar of a new European
security architecture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must, at the turn of the millennium, bring NATO-Russian
relations back to a level commensurate with the challenges that we
face together. I am personally committed to this vital endeavor ,"
Robertson said.

<HEADLINE> 4,500 Iranians Visit Holy Shrines in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,500 Iranian pilgrims,
or five batches, have arrived in Iraq in the past week to
visit the holy shrines in this country, the Iraqi News Agency
INA reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These are the first batches of Iranian pilgrims who visit
Iraq since last year's fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities provided all the necessary facilities
including transportation and accommodation for the visiting
Iranian pilgrims, said INA.
</P>
<P>
INA said that President Saddam Hussein has issued directives
allowing Iranian civilians to perform religious rituals at holy
shrines inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As the annual fasting month of Ramadan is drawing near,
Iranians begin to visit holy shrines for Shiite Muslims in Iraq's
Najaf, Kerbela, Samara, Barbylon and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a bitter war between 1980 and 1988, during
which Iranian pilgrims were forbidden to enter Iraq to perform
religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the two countries have started taking
measures to normalize ties. Iraq agreed to allow limited number
of Iranian pilgrims to visit the holy shrines inside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF, UNAIDS issue New Report On AIDS Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AIDS orphans are defined as children who, before the age of 15,
have lost either their mother or both parents to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The figures are staggering: by the end of this year the world
will have seen 11.2 million children orphaned by AIDS, 95 percent
of them in sub-Sahara Africa, and by the end of the year 2000, the
number will rise to 13 million, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Within Africa, eastern and southern African nations account
for 48 percent of the world's HIV-positive population, although
only 4.8 percent of the world's people live in this region, and
infection rates are expected to rise even further because of poor
health systems, poverty and limited resources to halt the spread
of the virus, said the report.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has killed 16 million people around the world and
infected 33 million more , the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Orphans, the report said, run greater risks of being
malnourished and stunted than children with parents, and they are
more likely to be denied education by overburdened extended
families and often denied health care under the assumption they
are already infected.
</P>
<P>
Consequently they run a higher risk of abuse, homelessness and
sexual exploitation than children orphaned by other causes, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
To address the situation, UNICEF and UNAIDS issued a "Call to
Action" which urged governments to "break the conspiracy of
silence" surrounding the epidemic and instead to act with "
openness and urgency" to fight the discrimination and ostracism
that too often accompany by AIDS.

<HEADLINE> 55 More Bodies Recovered From Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-five more bodies of
Dashun shipwreck victims were salvaged by 18:00 hours today as
recovery operations continued at the accident site near the coast
city of Yantai in Shandong Province for the fourth day.
</P>
<P>
The naval force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
dispatched more than 100 officers and men in today's rescue
operation. The Yantai Garrison Command sent 200 people, including
60 retiring soldiers, to transport salvaged bodies.
</P>
<P>
Diver Gong Shoujie alone picked up 21 bodies.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of calm sea tonight, the leading group in
charge of the salvage operation has decided to send more divers
for underwater searching room by room on the wrecked ship.
</P>
<P>
With 262 passengers and 40 crew members on board, the Dashun,
owned by the Yantai Yanda Automobile Ferry Company, caught fire on
the afternoon of November 24 and was forced to turn back from its
course to the port of Dalian in Liaoning Province, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The vessel sent out distress signals after flames were
discovered at 4:30 p.m. The ship sank at about midnight the same
day.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people have been involved in the rescue effort.
Sources confirmed that 22 people have been rescued alive so far.

<HEADLINE> Indian, Vietnamese Leaders Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Vietnamese President
Tran Duc Luong and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee held
a 75-minute meeting here on Wednesday with both sides emphasizing
the historical and cultural linkages between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders voiced their determination to add a "new
content" to the close and long-standing political relations and
agreed that special focus on enhancing cooperation was needed in
the fields of information technology, human resource development,
science and technology, energy and pharmaceuticals, official
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Luong, who arrived here earlier in the day for a five-day
visit, also met with Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan,
who told his guest that the prospects of economical and technical
cooperation between the two countries were "bright and immense."
</P>
<P>
Hanoi has expressed a strong desire to enter into "long-term
cooperation" with New Delhi in the fields of defense, trade and
science and technology while India has offered to collaborate with
Vietnam in setting up software centers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
city.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed four agreements Wednesday involving a
credit worth 13.95-million-U.S. dollars to Vietnam on concessional
terms and the setting up of two software development and training
centers in the two Vietnamese cities.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by senior Indian and Vietnamese
officials in the presence of Luong and Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to exchange instruments of
ratification of the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection
Agreement signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement between the foreign service institutes of the
two countries was to enhance exchanges of students, professors,
experts and research scholars.
</P>
<P>
Luong is the first Vietnamese president to visit India since
the late Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh's historic trip to India in
1958.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is keen to improve the trade balance which is heavily
in India's favor at a time when Hanoi was simplifying its
procedures for imports and exports and encouraging direct contact
with businessmen and industrialists.
</P>
<P>
India's exports to Vietnam, including medicines and
pharmaceutical goods, chemicals, spare parts for railways, sugar
factories, defense equipment and machinery, stood at 130 million
dollars this year while imports from that country were valued at a
mere 20 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- There was little doubt
that the AIDS crisis was the single greatest concern in the new
millennium, South African acting president Mangosuthu Buthelezi
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the keynote address at the World AIDS Day
partnership festival, Buthelezi said President Thabo Mbeki would
on his return from Tanzania would announce the establishment of a
national AIDS council, recently approved by the cabinet, to lead
the national AIDS program.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was supposed to have delivered the address, but had to go
to Tanzania to attend the Burundi peace summit, Buthelezi said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech Buthelezi said that the solution for the AIDS
problem was not one that could come from government or political
leaders alone. It was a very real, threatening disease that had to
be beaten.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi condemned those who intentionally or ignorantly
spread the disease. "There is nothing more repulsive or abominable
than a person who intentionally spreads AIDS, out of revenge,
selfishness or total disrespect, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Cooperation Among SAARC Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- About 160 politicians,
economists and diplomats from South Asia gathered here Wednesday
to discuss cooperation among the SAARC (South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation) countries.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is focusing on issues like sequential
steps towards a South Asian Economic Community, social cohesion in
the region, environmentally sustainable development, cooperation
on culture and in the field of energy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss the role of parliamentarians and
political leaders in social and economic development and the
improvement of political understanding through comprehensive and
regular consultations among the SAARC countries.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the meeting, Prime Minister Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai stressed the need for the South Asian countries to
strengthen cooperation to face the challenges of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said that as the people of the South Asia are weighed
down by economic and social difficulties, group cooperation is
needed for bringing about peace and prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Describing SAARC as a common forum for regional cooperation
among the peoples of South Asia, Bhattarai said SAPTA (South Asian
Preferential Trading Arrangements) is functioning to promote
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
SAPTA came into operation in 1995 as a first step for SAARC to
realize free trade among its member countries. Under SAPTA, 5,700
products enjoy tariff concessions ranging from 7.5 to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1985 to promote economic cooperation and social
progress in South Asia, SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's export has
shot up to a historic high of 14.946 billion rand (2.491 billion
U.S. dollars) in October, with a 911-million-rand (152 million
U.S. dollars) trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
Import has also staged a substantial recovery compared with
previous months, South African Standard Bank said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Imports in October amounted to 14.034 billion rand (2.3 billion
dollars), the highest level so far this year and 2.237 billion
rand above the monthly average for the year through to September.
</P>
<P>
The rise in imports was largely attributed to increased
machinery and mineral product imports. The rise in machinery
imports suggested improved business confidence, while the
continued rise in global crude oil prices was having a material
impact on the import bill.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Ushers in New Equity, Derivatives Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore announced Wednesday
the inauguration of Singapore Exchange (SGX), a new equity and
derivatives market, to prepare its capital market for future
cut-throat competition.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the SGX formally declared the merger or
demutualization of the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) and the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX).
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) unveiled in November,
1998 the plan to merge the SES and SIMEX into a single integrated
privately-held stock company.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the new exchange only meant at the moment a
nominal merger rather than the actual mix of operations which
still stay out of sight.
</P>
<P>
In launching the SGX, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong also announced sweeping measures to enhance the
competitiveness of the capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Those included revising capital requirements, broadening
brokerage scope and improving risk management.
</P>
<P>
Lee, also chairman of MAS, also announced the speeding up of
the liberalization of broking commissions in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said these measures were part of a "bold but coordinated
plan to phase in competition, while ensuring that proper risk
management systems are in place."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need to open up market access decisively over the
next 12 months, Lee noted that a larger number of trading parties
transacting freely will increase the liquidity and depth of the
market.
</P>
<P>
To allow market forces to determine rates, commissions on
trades will also be made freely negotiable by January 1, 2001, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
SGX's strategies aim to produce a Singapore-based, world-class
capital markets infrastructure, promoting a free flow of capital
across markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The infrastructure will provide multiple instruments, serving
issuers, investors and intermediaries across time-zones," he
added.

LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- English first division football

The club wants compensation after referee Jeff Winter refused

defeat by premier league Wimbledon.

Town chairman Ian Eyre said: "We are considering asking for
compensation for loses for not being in the next round. We would
like to be reinstated in the competition but we are too long in
the tooth to expect that to happen.
</P>
<P>
"The Football League has been carrying a flag for this
competition and yet possibly the most entertaining game of the Cup
ends in a club being cheated out of quarter-final place due to the
inability of a referee to implement the rules," he said.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Calls for Globalization in Favor of Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- South African deputy
president Jacob Zuma said on Wednesday that the globalization
should help narrow the gap between the developing and developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Southern African Trade and Investment Summit in
 Mozambican capital Maputo, he said that it is unacceptable that
while poverty is globalizing at an alarming pace for the majority,
wealth is being accumulated into fewer and fewer hands, according
to a press report reaching here..
</P>
<P>
"This does not augur well for sustainable economic development.
As the gap between the rich and the poor grows, we need to be
aware of, and establish, the extent to which globalization has the
potential to generate instability and suffering among our people,"
Zuma was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was clear that in the global village, it was not feasible
for any single country or sub-region to prosper as an island in a
sea of poverty and misery, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The economic development of South Africa, of the Southern
African Development Community and of the whole Africa continent
will therefore not benefit us alone, but Europe and the world, as
it will foster social stability, peace and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"It is important at this point in time to stress that what our
countries need is direct foreign investment, to create sustainable
development, rather than speculative investment that could
potentially harm our economies," Zuma added.

<P>
DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 126 AIDS patients have been
detected in Bangladesh so far, Health and Family Welfare Minister
Salahuddin Yusuf said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed the figure at a function marking the
World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
He said more emphasis should be laid on prevention than on cure
of the deadly epidemic as no medication could be developed for
AIDS so far.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion, President Shahabuddin Ahmed said
people must be aware about the deadly scourge of AIDS, adding that
the theme of the day "listen, learn, live" would create mass
awareness among the people.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of AIDS depends on human behavior that could be
regulated, and disciplined life and avoidance of bad habits could
protect people from being infected with the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate message, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said
adequate precautionary measures must be taken immediately to save
the country's people from AIDS, adding that the government has
made efforts to implement the coordinated health and family
welfare plan to prevent the disease.

<HEADLINE> Swiss President Calls for Efforts to Help Developing World in AIDS Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss
has called on the international community to improve AIDS
prevention programs in developing countries where millions of
people are under threat from HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"We must not accept a divide between rich countries, where HIV-
infected people receive the latest medical treatment, and a
majority of people in the world who do not have adequate access to
medical care," Dreifuss said Wednesday in a statement marking
World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
She said that education and improving the standing of women in
society should be key elements in such a prevention campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss president also warned the Swiss against complacency
and urged them not to underestimate the dangers of AIDS, even
though much progress had been made and AIDS infections were on the
decline domestically.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report by the World Health Organization
and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, there are a
total of 33.6 million people living with HIV/AIDS around the world,
among whom 32.4 million are adults and 1.2 million children under
15 years of age.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, 2.6 million people died of AIDS and 470,000 of
them were children under 15, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 11.2 million children have been orphaned
by AIDS by the end of 1999, according to a new report by the
United Nations Children's Fund and the UNAIDS published here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that by the end of the year 2000, the
number of AIDS orphans will rise to more than 13 million.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Calls for Raising Govt's Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen announced Wednesday that the government will take measures to
raise its efficiency to attract more foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on the government's development strategy and
policy, Hun Sen rapped some government officials for corruption
and inefficiency, especially those in the Council for Development
of Cambodia (CDC).
</P>
<P>
"The corrupt dealings severely hindered the foreign investment
and the economic development of the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the inefficient and trivial formalities of
examination and approval caused the decrease in foreign
investment," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the government has decided, from now on,
to simplify the formalities of investment project approval, and
put the departments concerned together in the CDC to save time for
investors.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that the time allowed to examine and approve
investment projects will be reduced from 45 to 28 days.
</P>
<P>
According to the CDC's statistics, the government approved 739
projects worth about 5,350 million U.S. dollars from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the approved investment projects declined sharply
in 1999, down from 143 projects in 1998 to 80 through November
this year.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged more and more foreign companies and
businessmen to invest in Cambodia's agriculture, communication,
electricity and energy as well as other areas.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Discuss Palestinian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Wednesday held talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
the latest developments in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before leaving Cairo for Gaza, Arafat
said the talks focused on the land handover dispute between the
Palestinians and Israel, which has delayed for the last two weeks
Israeli troops withdrawal from another 5 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side proposed some changes for the maps of
withdrawal submitted by Israel, but Israel has failed to respond,
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of trying to avoid giving a reply.
</P>
<P>
Prior to each of the previous withdrawals, the two sides would
give their own suggestions and demands and sign the maps after
discussions, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
But this time, Israel decided the areas itself without
consulting with the Palestinians, he said, stressing that it is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum signed in September, the
withdrawal should take place on November 15. But the Palestinians
rejected the Israeli maps, saying the areas are too thinly
populated and not contiguous.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will visit Washington in the coming few days for talks
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on the latest developments of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, Palestinian Minister of
Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath said before
leaving Cairo for Paris on a visit.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said he will discuss with French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine ways of advancing the peace process. He added that France
is playing a vital role in the process.
</P>
<P>
France has been seeking to play a greater role in the Mideast
peace process, but Israel shows little enthusiasm for France's
participation.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, arrived in Cairo Tuesday, met with Egyptian Prime
Minister Atef Obeid Tuesday night to discuss ways of promoting
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Obeid said after the meeting that the two sides hoped to
increase the trade volume to 500 million U.S. dollars in the
coming years.

<HEADLINE> Number of HIV Carriers Increases in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV carriers in
Vietnam would increase to between 135,000 and 160,000 by the end
of 2000, of whom 21,000 will develop full-blown AIDS and
10,000-15,000 will die, Vietnam News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Chung A, vice-chairman of Vietnam's National
AIDS Committee, as saying that over the past three years, an
average of 10 HIV cases have been detected and three people have
died of AIDS daily.
</P>
<P>
On the present HIV/AIDS situation, Chung A said that by October
29 this year, Vietnam had detected 16,193 HIV carriers. Of the
figure, 2,907 have developed full-blown AIDS and 1,512 have died.
</P>
<P>
To ease the situation, the committee is devising a HIV/AIDS
control strategy for the 2000-2005 period and will submit it to
the government for approval by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The strategy aims to mobilize the participation of society as
well as assistance from international organizations and foreign
countries in checking the spread of HIV/AIDS among the community
and its harmful effect on the country's socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has made great efforts to control HIV/AIDS in recent
years, Chung A said, adding that all branches, mass organizations
and other social forces have participated in HIV/AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
In particular, since early this year
information-education-communication programs on HIV/AIDS have
targeted communes and city wards, thus raising public awareness of
the disease.

<HEADLINE> 'Serious Doubts' about Viability for Athletics at New Wembley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- An independent sports
architecture report "raises serious doubts about the viability" of
athletics events for the proposed new national stadium at Wembley,
British Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Chris Smith said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Smith told the House of Commons he had reached the "reluctant
conclusion" the present design "cannot readily provide the central
venue for an Olympic Games bid for London".
</P>
<P>
It was unlikely the stadium, as designed, could provide an
appropriate venue for the World Athletics Championships which
Britain hoped to host in 2005. Wembley National Stadium Ltd and
Sport England had been asked to report by December 15 with any
solutions they were able to propose.
</P>
<P>
A "cost-effective solution" might be found, Smith said, but
added that funding arrangements might need to be modified if the
new stadium was to concentrate simply on its primary role as a
venue for football and rugby.
</P>
<P>
Shadow culture, media and sport secretary Peter Ainsworth said
the announcement left Smith in an "invidious position entirely of
his own Government's making".
</P>
<P>
Ainsworth said further delay would undermine England's 2006
World Cup bid but pressing ahead with a stadium incapable of
holding the Olympics would be a missed opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Fifteen-Minute Delay for One Third European Flights in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that more than one flight in three in Europe have been
delayed over 15 minutes so far this year which caused serious
concerns by the European Union and its 15 member states.
</P>
<P>
Even if some of the delays are due to airports operating at the
limits of their capacity or to the airlines themselves, more than
half are a direct result of Europe's airspace reaching saturation
point, said the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The economic cost is reckoned to be over 5 billion euros (about
5.25 billion U.S. dollars), while the impact on passengers, though
hard to gauge, is probably the same, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the EU executive, the main
causes of delay cover four factors:
</P>
<P>
- The steps taken have not been sufficient to cope with the
exponential growth in air traffic;
</P>
<P>
- Air traffic management methods are reaching the limits of
their possibilities;
</P>
<P>
- The organizational structures for air traffic management are
proving ineffective and insufficiently transparent.
</P>
<P>
- The problem is aggravated by the fact that Europe's airspace
is divided between 15 sovereign states which, for various reasons -
above all military - reject any closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a fresh crisis next summer, the European Commission
stressed the urgent need for appropriate technical and operational
measures, calling for more radical action on the underlying cause
of the delays by setting up collective management of Europe's
airspace.
</P>
<P>
"Europe cannot keep the frontiers in the sky that it has
managed to eliminate on the ground," the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Now the European Union is determined to tackle the severe
delays that have built up in recent years and calls for a major
political move by all member states. The 15-nation European bloc
wants to see in the future "a single European sky".

<HEADLINE> French Officials Ask Australians to Undergo Drugs Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- French government officials,
based on their new anti-doping powers, on Wednesday demanded that
Australian tennis players take a drugs test just 48 hours before
the start of the Davis Cup final in the southern French city of
Nice.
</P>
<P>
Unaware of current French law, Australian captain John Newcombe
initially asked for clarification, but finally agreed to allow his
players to be tested.
</P>
<P>
The International Tennis Federation appeared not quite familiar
with the regulations passed in November 1998, which allow the
Ministry of Sports to order athletes, including those from abroad,
to be doping tested.
</P>
<P>
Newcombe said he would prefer sports federations, and not
governments, to be responsible for anti-doping control.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Postal Service Department Hooked to Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
decided to convert the Postal Service Department into a public
company in tandem with more liberalized market.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken by the Council of Ministers in its
meeting Tuesday under President Glafcos Clerides,the Cyprus News
Agency (CNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An official announcement said that the state will be the
company's sole shareholder and its employees will be allowed to
become shareholders if they so wish.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also said that the decision was taken in view
of the "de facto liberalization of the postal services market in
Cyprus as some 30 companies are already operating in the field
gaining a substantial part of the market."
</P>
<P>
The move was taken also with an eye on the liberalization in
the field to be adopted by the European Union by the year 2003,
that will lead to more competition for Cypriot state postal
services.
</P>
<P>
It also cites a study by the Cyprus Development Bank, which
warned that if the Postal Service Department is not made
autonomous, "in a few years the Cyprus post offices will be
converted from profit-making to loss-making."

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Millennium Rites Kicked off Marking Filipinos' Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The lighting of the giant
lantern dubbed "Millennium Filipino" here at the Rizal Park
Wednesday evening hopefully foresees a bright future for the
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Everybody gathered at the park to witness the historical event
seemed excited as the lantern was lighted by Philippine President
Joseph Estrada at around 6:30 p.m., as if they were the first to
hear the steps of the highly expected new century and new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The beautiful songs, in typical Christmas rhythm, flew out the
heart of the naive school children, praying for peace and
prosperity, while youngsters danced for harvest and happiness in
their very national costumes and traditional way.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony which lasted for more than half an
hour, Estrada elaborated the double symbolic meanings of the
Millennium Lantern: Since Christmas is drawing near, it is fitting
that the Yuletide lantern be their beacon in charting a new path
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The lantern that hangs in every home is a mirror of hope and
symbol of light from our Lord Almighty that will guide our path,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The significance indicated by the countdown clock on the top of
the 30-foot high lantern, however, is obviously far beyond the
forthcoming Christmas.
</P>
<P>
While it is reminding each passer-by the days left before the
coming of the year 2000, it also embodies the Filipinos' longing
for happiness and wealth in the future.
</P>
<P>
The coming of the new millennium, Estrada said, "should serve
as an inspiration to us Filipinos for these signals -- the
worldwide dawning of economic prosperity and hope with the
changing faces in business, commerce and technology."
</P>
<P>
"Here in our country, the new millennium means new challenges
for us to face the problems that come our way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting the country's culture will enable peoples everywhere
in the world to see the real Philippine picture, while science and
technology will transform the nation's industries for the benefit
of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the majority of the Filipinos, especially the
disadvantaged sector in the rural areas, are farmers, the
president said all these developments will depend on successful
implementation of their agriculture programs.
</P>
<P>
"If we can unify and enhance these forces, the new millennium
will bring us more opportunities and prosperity," Estrada
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Cemma Cruz-Araneta, who chairs the Committee
on the Turn-of-the-Century Celebration, also said the Millennium
Filipino marker symbolizes hopes and joy in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Turn-of-the-Century Committee is part of the Presidential
Commission on the New Century and the Millennium, now headed by
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara.
</P>
<P>
The New Century Commission was set up by President Estrada in
July in a bid to plan and oversee all activities aimed at greeting
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The millennium celebration will be further highlighted in
activities in the week starting from December 26 and culminate on
the New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
According Angara, a "Millennium Village" will also rise at the
Rizal Park, where agricultural products and achievements in arts,
culture, science and technology, along with indigenous and
adaptive handicrafts and tropical flora, will be exhibited.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here warmly lauded the marriage between agriculture
and tourism, saying the villagers will be encouraged to use
"cultural marketing" in selling their products.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in October, the government also declared the production
of special edition stamps, bills and coins to commemorate the
country's celebration of the coming of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Angara said this activity aims to give a lasting legacy for the
new generation by depicting in the commemorative items the
government's pro-poor initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that if the government sticks to carrying out
its pro-poor plans, including agriculture modernization, the food
security program, the affordable mass housing project and more
educational access to children in poor rural areas, the country
will be sure on the right way to poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Others said the president's emphasis on promoting agriculture,
science and technology and culture gives them a new hope that
their country will be propelled into more prosperity in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
These lovely hopes have not only blossomed in the fireworks
skyrocketing at the end of the ceremony, but also in the heart of
the friendly and good-willed Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> CCB Transfers Debt Asset to Cinda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 2 (Xinhua)-- The Shanghai branch of the
China Construction Bank (CCB) signed an agreement today to
transfer its debt asset worth some two billion yuan (nearly 230
million U.S.dollars) to Cinda Asset Management Corporation.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's biggest State-owned commercial banks,
China Construction bank started the debt-equity conversion effort
in Shanghai to manage its non-performing assets.
</P>
<P>
Cinda corporation was the first in China to handle bad loans of
the China Construction Bank. Since then, three more companies have
been set up to manage bad loans of the Bank of China, the
Agricultural Bank of China, and the China Industrial and
Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai subsidiary bank of CCB now is taking all possible
measures to reduce the bank's asset loss to a minimum, including
debt-to-equity swap and asset reorganization.
</P>
<P>
The specialized commercial firms are a step taken by the
Chinese government to prevent risks in the banking sector brought
on by the increasing number of bad loans to state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The corporations can both handle the banks' bad loans and
reduce their bad assets, thus improving asset quality,
profitability and also reducing operation risks of banks.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Manila Tightens Security After Attack on Oil Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Following the bombing of an oil
company, the Philippine National Police (PNP) has doubled the
security on all the installations in Metro Manila that provide
vital services such as communications, water, electricity and
gasoline depots.
</P>
<P>
The bombing took place on Thursday morning when three
unidentified heavily armed men attacked a gasoline company in
Metro Manila by spraying it with bullets and firing a rifle
grenade at it.
</P>
<P>
A security guard posted at the Shell House building in Makati
city of Metro Manila was injured when the armed men attacked the
oil company at about 4:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The security guard was hit with glass splinters and suffered
injuries in the back. Fortunately, aside from the security guard,
there were no other casualties.
</P>
<P>
The explosion also shattered the glass panels on the second,
third and fourth floors of the building, with the third floor
being heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
The explosion dug a crater 15 inches in diameter and three
inches deep on the third floor of the said building.
</P>
<P>
Police said a group of eight men and two women flagged down a
mega taxi driven by Elmer Rosalin at about 3:45 a.m. local time in
Quezon City of Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Immediately thereafter, they took over the wheel and
blindfolded the driver. Then, Rosalin said he heard a loud
explosion followed by successive shots.
</P>
<P>
Rosalin, still blindfolded, was dumped shortly after the
attack. He immediately proceeded to the police to report the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The police said the suspects also strafed with automatic
gunfire a British-owned business establishment in Makati.
</P>
<P>
Responding policemen recovered one empty shell of a rifle
grenade and 11 empty bullet shells in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB) of the rebel New People's Army
(NPA) has assumed responsibility over the bombing, the government
said.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said police authorities
have yet to verify the claim, adding that the ABB may have only
claimed responsibility to convince the public it has the
capability to launch such terrorist attacks against the
government.
</P>
<P>
Barican said President Joseph Estrada has ordered the PNP to go
after and prosecute those responsible for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed concern over the incident, noting that
a misfiring of the rifle grenade could have led to greater
casualties since the bombing site is not only a commercial area,
but also a residential one, according to Barican.
</P>
<P>
Police probers were still conducting a thorough investigation
of the case to identify the attackers and their motive in
assaulting the building.
</P>
<P>
PNP chief Panfilo Lacson has given a 48-hour deadline for three
concerned top police officials to arrest the 10 suspects in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
Police artists have started sketching the suspects' images
based on Rasalin's description of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police offered a 200,000-peso (5000 U.S.
dollars) reward for anyone who could inform the police on the
whereabouts of the suspected members of the NPA-ABB who attacked
the building.

<HEADLINE> Social Stability Continues as China's Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, one of China's
top seven policy makers, called on all Party committees and
governments at all levels to spare no effort to maintain social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing ceremony of a two-day political and law
conference, Wei, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Chinese
Communist Party, praised the achievements in politics and the
legal field over the past year, especially the crack-down on
terrorism by overseas and domestic hostile forces and various
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Next year will bring the change of a century and is the last
year of China's ninth Five-Year plan period. Therefore, it is of
great importance to ably handle tasks in the political and law
field, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Though China enjoys economic and social progress, political
stability and national unity, there still exist factors
jeopardizing national safety and social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to crack down on terrorism by hostile forces at
home and abroad, be on guard against activities of Falun Gong cult
and other sects, and help the majority of Falun Gong practitioners
to mend their ways while attacking illegal activities of key
members, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue the fight against all kinds of criminal and
economic activities with the stress on violent and organized
crimes and major cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei call for effective measures to prevent juvenile delinquency
and create a favorable social environment for the growth of
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Referring to problems among law enforcement officials, Wei said
that political and law departments should clean their own houses,
be honest, and improve the practice of law enforcement. Those who
have violated the law will be punished according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, urged all participants to fully understand the
importance of stability and prepare for safe celebrations for

HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special

Thursday passed the Provision of Municipal Services (
Reorganization) Bill, which provides a legal framework for
delivery of municipal services.

<P>
A spokesman for the Constitutional Affairs Bureau welcomed the
passage of the bill, which marked the beginning of a new era in
the delivery of food and environmental hygiene services under a
revised structure which has pledged to provide more coordinated
and effective services.

<HEADLINE> BNR Governor Slams IMF's Policy on Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Romanian National Bank (BNR)
Governor Mugur Isarescu slammed Thursday the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) for making public the amount of Romania's
private loans, as a precondition for the payment of the second
tranche of a stand-by loan approved by the organization last
August.
</P>
<P>
The IMF announcement that Romania needed to draw 100 million U.
S. dollars from international private capital market has created
difficulties for the BNR in attracting loans, since the foreign
banks are regarding Romania as a high-risk country, Isarescu said.
</P>
<P>
Romania's very willingness to contract such high interest rate
loans, which is deemed a confirmation that the country is in
financial trouble, further prompted suspicion on the international
private capital market, said the BNR chief.
</P>
<P>
Romania successfully passed the repayment peak of its foreign
debt this year and has taken precautionary measures for next
year's repayment of the foreign debt. It at the same time plans to
contract more than 400 million dollars in loans on the
international private capital market.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these efforts, the IMF required Romania to contract
another 100 million dollars from private international lenders, as
a guarantee of its future solvency.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu and Transport Minister Traian Basescu are the only two
Romanian officials to have criticized IMF's policy towards Romania.
Basescu said recently that the IMF was placing Romania in "
formulas drawn up in a laboratory", which are not suitable for
Romania's economic conditions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Rise Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of new claims for
jobless benefits increased last week after declines in the two
previous weeks, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that 291,000 people in the country
filed new claims for unemployment benefits for the week ending Nov.
27, up by 15,000 from the previous week. That was the highest
level since Nov. 6, when claims were at 292,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the four-week moving average for claims, which
smoothes out week-to-week volatility, fell down slightly last week
to 286,500. That was the lowest level since Sept. 18, when claims
were at 286,000.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider jobless claims levels below 300,000 an
indication of an extremely tight labor market, meaning it's
difficult for some employers to find workers.
</P>
<P>
The Department will release November's employment report on
Friday. The nation's unemployment rate is now at 4.1 percent, a 30-
year low. Many economists believe it will stay at that rate but
some think it will tick down a notch to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's report said that for the week ending November 20, 48
states and territories reported increases in new jobless claims
applications, while 4 reported decreases. The state data lag one
week behind the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest increase was Indiana, up 4,472,
while Puerto Rico posted the biggest decrease in first-times
claims, which fell by 676.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) Thursday released four Lebanese prisoners from its
jail in south Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
All four prisoners, detained for collaborating with Lebanese
guerrillas to fight Israeli forces, were freed on humanitarian
reasons, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The freed prisoners were taken by the SLA from its notorious
Khiam jail to their homes inside the Israeli occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement, spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been fighting
to oust Israeli forces and its ally SLA.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Lebanese are still held without trial in the jail
run by the pro-Israeli militia, under Israeli supervision. A
recently released report indicated Israeli complicity in serious
human rights violations in the jail.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban Ozone-Damaging Chemical in Auto Air Conditioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China announced today it will
ban the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in new auto air
conditioners from January 1, 2002 as part of its effort to
protect the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration of China (
SEPA) said auto plants and auto air conditioner producers were
notified last week about the matter in a circular jointly issued
by the administration and the State Administration of Machinery
Industry.
</P>
<P>
"New auto air conditioners using chlorofluorocarbons-12 (CFC-12)
as refrigerants will not be allowed to be marketed and installed
in autos from January 1, 2000," said the circular.
</P>
<P>
SEPA said the target is achievable.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of the auto air conditioners installed in new
cars in China during the first six months of this year contained
no CFC-12, SEPA said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Technical innovation projects are well underway in some auto
air conditioner plants to prepare themselves for production of air
conditioners with ozone-friendly CFC-12 substitutes as
refrigerants, it said.
</P>
<P>
China has reduced ODS consumption by 50,000 tons over the past
few years, and its ODS and other ozone-damaging gas emissions
remain at the average 1995-1997 levels, SEPA said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite developments in
the peace process in both Burundi and the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) , the influxes of refugees to Tanzania are likely
to continue, a UN report said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report issued by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), from January to November 1999,
a total of 75,358 Congolese and 43,874 Burundian refugees arrived
in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from Burundi were particularly high in October and
November due to the prevailing insecurity.
</P>
<P>
After over 35 years of providing refuge to those fleeing from
crisis in the Great Lakes Region and other countries in Africa,
Tanzania currently hosts 399,474 refugees from the neighboring
countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Refugees predominantly from Burundi (289,843), the DRC
(97,401), Rwanda (7,707) and Somalia (3,300) are now staying in 12
designated locations in the country's northern Kagera, western
Kigoma and eastern Tanga regions.
</P>
<P>
With the naming of former South African president Nelson
Mandela as the new facilitator in Burundi peace talks, it is hoped
that repatriation of refugees to Burundi will resume.

WUHAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Meng Qingping, former vice-
governor of Hubei, a central China province, has been sentenced to
ten years in prison for accepting bribes of 140,000 yuan and 100,
000 Hong Kong dollars while he was vice governor of Hainan
Province and later Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Meng was in charge of land use approvals in China's

<HEADLINE> Russia Threatens to Withdraw From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia threatened Thursday to
consider pulling its troops out of Kosovo if the U.N. mission and
the leadership of the multinational peacekeeping force in the
Yugoslav province do not observe their commitments as stipulated
by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The threat came after Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused the
West of conniving with genocide against non-Albanian residents in
Kosovo, where some 200,000 ethnic minorities have recently fled
the region.
</P>
<P>
Russia "may withdraw its military contingent from Kosovo if
further moves that violate Resolution 1244, which recognizes the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, are made in
Kosovo," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ordzhonikidze said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,600 Russian troops stationed in Kosovo as
part of the 40,000-strong multinational force known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has already sent a letter to U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan, urging him "to call head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo
Bernard Kouchner and KFOR Commander Klaus Reinhardt to New York to
give an account of their work," the Interfax news agency quoted
Ordzhonikidze as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Kouchner and Reinhardt must be brought to account for the
killing on connivance and also the disturbances in Kosovo on
November 30 when the so-called Day of the Albanian Flag was marked,
" Ordzhonikidze said.
</P>
<P>
"In front of representatives of the U.N. and KFOR, real
bloodshed and pogroms were unleashed" on that day, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The peacekeeping forces were supposed to have taken effective
measures in advance to prevent this outrage," he added, noting
that the U.N. is likely to discuss the situation in Kosovo in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not make any categorical demands. But we would
like to hear clear-cut explanations of the developments in Kosovo,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Five Killed in Somali Clan Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Five gunmen were killed and
at least three others wounded when rival militiamen exchanged
heavy gunfire outside Lego Village, about 40 km northeast of
Ballidogleh airport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports received from eyewitnesses contacted on
the VHF field radios in Lego Village, the contending subclans,
Elay subclan of Rahanwein and Ayr subclan of Habar Gidir, belong
to the supporters of faction leader IIussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The Elay and Ayr militiamen under the leadership of the
Ballidogleh security commander, Abdukarim Farabadan, have been
defending the only tarmac airport of Ballidgoleh against possible
attacks from the Ethiopian- backed Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA)
who ousted Hussein Aidid's militiamen out of Baidoa town in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not stated officially, however
independent sources confirmed that the clashes began after the Ayr
subclan militiamen had disarmed units from the Elay militiamen
whom they allegedly suspected of trying to escape with the weapons
to Bur Hakaba town controlled by the RRA fighters.
</P>
<P>
Elay militiamen annoyed by the disarmament have then attacked
the Ayr militia positions. Independent sources said the Elay
militiamen have been pushed backward with some fatalities. Three
of those wounded during the exchange of fire have been brought to
Mogadishu for treatment.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf will pay an official visit to Iran in the
very near future, said Pakistani ambassador Javid Hussain on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government of Pakistan attaches "the highest level of
importance" to its relations with Iran, the ambassador said,
quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Musharraf, after assuming power in Pakistan last
October following a military coup which ousted former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, has expressed his desire and the desire of
Pakistani people for closer ties with Iran.

<P>
So Musharraf's visit to Iran "will be in a very near future,"
the ambassador said, "I am sure we will have this important visit
from the Pakistan side at the level of the Chief Executive to Iran
at a certainly very near future."
</P>
<P>
He said the visit would provide an opportunity for leaders of
the two countries to exchange views on important bilateral issues,
on how to strengthen bilateral cooperation, on regional issues, so
that the two countries can adopt a common approach to those
regional issues particularly the issue of promoting peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Islamabad-Tehran relations are deeply rooted in "our
history, in our cultural affinity and geographical proximity and
common strategic interests and in similarity of other national
interests."

<HEADLINE> OIC Chief Urges Political Solution to Chechen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Ezzidine Laraki on
Thursday called for political solution to the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth
Conference of Islamic Information Ministers which opened here on
Wednesday, Laraki expressed concern over the situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops have closed in on the separatist Chechen capital
Grozny in an effort to root out the rebels, who were accused of
intruding into neighboring Dagestan for two times and plotting a
series of apartment bombings across Russia.
</P>
<P>
Laraki said that the OIC has contacted Russian officials to
convey the world Muslims' anxiety toward the bloodshed in Chechnya
and the OIC assistant secretary general would visit Moscow soon to
evaluate the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian military action in Chechnya is an internal
matter, but I think that the Russians should find a political
solution to the crisis," said the OIC chief.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the upcoming visit by an OIC delegation to
Moscow and Chechnya would enable the OIC to present specified
proposals to the Russian government to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced on Wednesday
that he would lead the OIC delegation to Moscow on Monday to
discuss Chechen issue with Russian officials. Iran is now chairman
of the OIC.
</P>
<P>
However, Kharrazi said that the objective of the visit was not
mediating but fact-finding, and his delegation has no plan on
mediation.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov informed Kharrazi on
Monday night that Russian cabinet had accepted the proposal by
Kharrazi on a visit by an Iran-led Islamic delegation to Moscow
for talks on the Chechen issue.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Dismisses Burundi Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has dismissed accusations that his government
allows refugees in the country to train, equip and launch attacks
on Burundi, the Daily News newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Wednesday that his government is "fed up with
endless but baseless accusations that we allow refugees in
Tanzania to attack Burundi", and "that has never been our policy".
</P>
<P>
The strained relationship between the two countries came to
boil in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha Wednesday when Mkapa
was speaking at the opening session of the Eighth Great Lakes
Summit on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The recent escalation of violence in Burundi after the death of
the late chief mediator Julius Nyerere had sparked a refugee
influx into Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The influx of refugees into Tanzania has more than doubled.
With already more than 800,000 refugees, Tanzania finds it
difficult to cope with this new development," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
"We earnestly ask those countries that generate refugees to get
their act together quickly, taking advantage the tremendous
support for peaceful negotiations that the region is ready to
offer, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president further urged the countries to "create
that political dispensation and those security guarantees that
will stop their citizens from looking for sanctuary and succor in
other countries."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Tanzania was the most interested in seeing
that the conflict in Burundi be resolved quickly and successfully,
and that the tiny central African country becomes democratic,
stable and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
"This ultimate goal can only be agreed upon by the Burundians
themselves and should not be imposed upon them," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to be the scapegoat for procrastination in the
negotiations, and we abhor even the perception that Tanzania is an
obstacle to the speedy resolution of the Burundi conflict," Mkapa
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some diplomats say that ties between Tanzania and
Burundi are so strained that the two countries are on the verge of
becoming hostile to one another.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts also observe that Tanzania is likely to be sucked
in the war within Burundi if the relations between the two nations
do not improve in the foreseeable future.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Take AIDS Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's National AIDS
Advisory Council has urged Tanzanians to voluntarily screen
themselves against AIDS disease as a way to prevent the spread of
the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
It is high time every responsible citizen knows his health
status as far as HIV is concerned, chairman of the AIDS advisory
council and former Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi told the
nation in the World AIDS Day commemoration in Dar es Salaam
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi said voluntary screening will help people keep a
watchful eye on their health status and allow the government to
draw strategies on how to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health in collaboration with other institutions
has already made arrangements to ensure that such exercise be
carried on smoothly, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
The former president challenged all Tanzanians to desist from
promiscuous sexual life that causes 80 percent of AIDS infections.
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi also urged parents to be more open in talks with
children to prevent them from becoming victims of the killer
disease.
</P>
<P>
He warned that failure to prevent the spread of the AIDS
disease will erode the cherished peace, tranquility and solidarity
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"A household with a patient does not enjoy any peace nor does a
nation with many AIDS patients," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Exports More in COMESA Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's annual export to other
member countries of the Common Market for East and Southern Africa
(COMESA) increased to 228 million U.S. dollars last year compared
with 69 million dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's total annual trade volume in intra-COMESA market rose
to 384 million dollars from 205 million dollars during the same
period last year, according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Thursday quoted Zambia Association of
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) chief economist Ernest
Mwape as saying that with the coming of the Free Trade Area
arrangement one year away local goods will have a greater chance
of penetrating into the regional market.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from all the other likely benefits, Zambia manufactured
products will also stand a better chance of gaining outside
markets. This is good for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
But some Zambian business leaders have warned that the
country's poor competitive edge over major trading partners will
further worsen its weak agricultural and industrial bases.

<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
decided to resume the suspended 439-million-U.S. dollars financial
aid to Nigeria following improved human rights records in the
country, EU office in Lagos has said.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a statement that officials of the union
would soon visit the west African country to facilitate the
resumption of the aid, the Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement lauded the Nigerian government's efforts to boost
the economy in the area of privatization and open market
operations to stimulate foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
With the recent efforts made by the President Olusegun
Obasanjo, EU would continue to assist the government to meet its
needs, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The prevailing circumstances in Nigeria have made it possible
for EU to resume further talks with Abuja in order to strengthen
their closer relations, it added.
</P>
<P>
EU imposed various sanctions, ranging from financial aid to
technical assistance as well as sports, on the most populous
African country during the military regime of the late General
Sani Abacha to protest its human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were relaxed when EU drew up a plan to assist
Nigeria after the inauguration of Obasanjo's civilian government
in May this year.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Interview 3 Filipino Generals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Three Filipino generals
nominated to lead the United Nations peacekeeping force to East
Timor will leave for New York shortly for interview with U.N.
Secretary General Koffi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Armed Forces spokesman Rafael Romero confirmed
Thursday that Maj. Gen. Diomedio Villanueva, Maj. Gen. Gregorio
Camiling, and Maj. Gen. Jaime de los Santos have been nominated as
commanders of the soon to be formed U.N. Transitional
Administration on East Timor (UNTAET).
</P>
<P>
The UNTAET will replace the International Force to East Timor
(INTERFET) presently deployed at the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The three are all Army officers and seasoned combat officers.
They are all graduates of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA),
the country's premier military school.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva is the most senior being a 1968 PMA graduate. Both
Camiling and de los Santos belong to PMA class 1969.
</P>
<P>
According to Romero, Annan will be the one to select from among
the three Filipino generals who will head the UNTAET when the
INTERFET will be pulled out during the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which has annexed East Timor more than 20 years
until the residents voted in a referendum for an independent
state, wanted a fellow member of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations to head the U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Philippines has a 600-man contingent force
deployed in East Timor engaged in civic action work such as
medical and dental mission, construction of roads, bridges and

<HEADLINE> Japan's Mobile Phone Giant Becomes Partner of HK Hutchison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Hutchison Whampoa Limited (
HWL), Motorola Inc. and NTT Mobile Communications Network, Inc. (
NTT DoCoMo) announced Thursday that NTT DoCoMo has agreed to
acquire a 19 percent strategic equity interest in Hutchison
Telephone Company Limited.
</P>
<P>
Motorola also currently holds a 30 Percent equity interest in
the HWL-controlled Hong Kong mobile operator in which NTT DoCoMo
will acquire from HWL a 19 percent interest for a cash
consideration of about 3.175 billion HK dollars (410 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
This transaction places an enterprise value of approximately 20
billion HK dollars (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) on HWL, the largest
mobile operator in Hong Kong with over 1.2 million subscribers
representing a market share of 33 percent, HWL Group Managing
Director Canning Fok told a press conference Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
As part of this transaction, HWL will convert into equity
certain shareholder loans it had made to the company in the past,
Fok said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that HWL's interest in the company will rise from
70 percent to 74 percent as a result of this debt to equity
conversion, resulting in a reduction in Motorola's interest in the
company from 30 percent to 25.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that NTT DoCoMo's technology and vision, combined
with Hutchison's local market presence and Motorola's strength in
mobile communications technology, put Hutchison in an excellent
position to drive the Hong Kong mobile communications industry
forward," Fok said.
</P>
<P>
NTT DoCoMo is currently the largest mobile operator in Japan
with about 27 million subscribers representing a market share of
57 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is in this context that Hutchison, with input from NTT
DoCoMo, plans to expand its portfolio of value-added service
offerings with a view to increasing mobile phone usage for non-
voice applications in Hong Kong, Fok added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Stage New Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
on Thursday announced a two-day hartal (destructive strike) for
December 5 and 6 to press home its demand for the immediate
resignation of the ruling Awami League-led government to pave way
for early parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first countrywide shutdown since the summit
meeting of the four parties on Tuesday, and the 17th of its kind
this year.
</P>
<P>
The strike call was announced by the major opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islamic Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity
Front) -- the four components of the alliance -- at different
public rallies in the capital city Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parities also organized processions across the
country Thursday to observe the "Demonstration Day."
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance has been staging a series of campaigns
this year to force the government to resign, calling for early
parliamentary elections which are now scheduled for 2001.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of the four opposition parties met on Tuesday evening
for the first time since the alliance came into being early this
year, vowing to "oust the government" and forming a patriotic and
strong government on a "broad-based unity."
</P>
<P>
Hartal is very common in Bangladesh, where opposition parties
call strikes to oppose the ruling party while the latter adopts
anti-strike activities, often resulting in clashes and causing
heavy economic losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's industry and labor
leaders have suggested the government give priority to poverty
alleviation aided by job creation, the Guardian newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The economic decline of the military rule still persisted and
the only way out is such programs as poverty alleviation, job
creation, infra- structure improvement and adoption of a realistic
fiscal and monetary policies, the leaders said at a workshop in
capital Abuja Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit is staggering at 250 billion naira (2.63 billion
U.S. dollars), or eight percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) in the first five months of the year, Chairman of the
Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission Kola Daisi said.
</P>
<P>
Worsening poverty situation accentuated by rising unemployment
population and parlous state of infrastructure facilities hindered
the recovery of the economy even after the inauguration of
President Olusegun Obasanjo's civilian government, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in clashes between communities in Niger Delta is
said to be a direct reflection of a preponderance of unemployed
youths.
</P>
<P>
Lagos-based management consultant, Chief Jusho Ologunde, also
said that not much had been done by the new government to redress
the inherited economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
"The country has not experienced any improvement in standard of
living," he said, adding that a lot of people are crying and
complaining bitterly daily.
</P>
<P>
Executive secretary of Food, Beverage and Tobacco Senior Staff
 Association, Sola Iji, expressed reservation over early recovery
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the current exchange rate of the naira is
unrealistic and lacks potency in moving the economy forward.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to deregulate fuel prices would aggravate poverty,
 stressing that privatization, as being proposed, would further
alienate a majority of Nigerians from the mainstream of economic
resources, to the advantage of the rich few.

BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese environmental
protection official has said China is expected to ban the
production and consumption of leaded motor gasoline by July 1,
2000, according to the schedule set in mid-1998.

Beijing, which took the lead in banning leaded gasoline this
year, has seen a marked drop of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide
in its air pollutants in the past few months, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua)-- The adoption of a UN resolution
concerning the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty on December 1
demonstrates that the international community is virtually
unanimous in its opposition to amending the ABM Treaty, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at today's press conference
here.
</P>
<P>
On December 1, the United Nations General Assembly adopted by
an overwhelming majority the Resolution on Preservation of and
Compliance with the ABM Treaty, which was co-sponsored by Russia,
China and Belarus, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the resolution demonstrates that the
international community is virtually unanimous in its opposition
to and disapproval of the attempts by a certain country to amend
the ABM Treaty, to develop and deploy anti-missile systems,
according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
"As one of the co-sponsors of the resolution, China wishes to
express its sincere thanks to the countries that have supported
the resolution," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country in question has in recent years made
an all-out effort to develop NMD and worked with a few other
countries to develop advanced TMD systems in pursuit of what it
calls absolute security as well as its strategic and military
superiority.

In a bid to remove the legal barrier to its plans, the country
has proposed the amendment of the ABM Treaty and has even
threatened to withdraw from the Treaty, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a move, should it be taken, will undoubtedly disrupt the
strategic balance and stability, undermine the nuclear disarmament
process, and weaken the basis of nuclear non-proliferation, and
still worse, it will give rise to a new round of nuclear arms race,
including arms race in the outer space," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The attempted move is detrimental to international peace and
security, and is naturally widely opposed by the international
community, Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the old Chinese saying "a just cause enjoys abundant
support, while an unjust one finds little" in describing the
situation, saying that the attempt to develop and deploy anti-
missile systems is against the popular will and will end up "doing
harms to others while bringing no good to oneself."
</P>
<P>
China urges the country in question to heed in real earnest the
strong appeal of the international community, think twice before
it acts and abandon the above-mentioned plans.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to join all other peace-loving countries in a
continued effort to safeguard international peace and security,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Washington's hands were
not completely clean in pushing the European Union (EU) to
eliminate export subsidies for its farmers, South African Trade
and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said in Seattle Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has its own support measures for farmers, so they are
not angels in this matter," Erwin said in an interview with the
South African Broadcasting Company.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and its partners are pressing the United States
and the EU to make concessions on the subsidies, the single most
contentious issue at the World Trade Organization (WTO)
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Erwin also blamed the U.S. for Tuesday's disruption, which he
saw as endangering the chances of developing countries' getting a
better deal in the new trade round.
</P>
<P>
Many developing countries fear that U.S.- and European-backed
attempts to place labor standard and environmental issues on the
table for the next trade round are aimed at raising new
protectionist barriers to their exports as tariffs and other
restraints come down.
</P>
<P>
Among the concrete issue South Africa and its partners wanted
to address was "the precise working of the rules for anti-dumping
and countervailing duties".

<HEADLINE> Compensation for Arab Victims of Terror Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Several Israeli Knesset
(Parliament) Members had successfully sent a bill, calling for
equal compensation for victims of Arab and Jewish terror, through
the first legislation procedure, local newspaper Ha'aretz
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, proposed by lawmaker Husseina Jabarra of Meretz
party, was discussed in Wednesday's Knesset session. Thirty-two
Knesset members voted in favor of sending the bill for first
reading to a committee and fourteen voted against.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper reports, although there are more and
more cases of terror attacks by Jews against Arabs, the current
Compensation Law for Victims of Hostilities still does not
compensate Arab victims of hostile acts motivated by
nationalistic or political reasons.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the bill, said Jabarra, is to give equal
treatment to all victims of terrorism, regardless of their race,
religion and creed.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister Nissim Dahan, of the religious Shas
party, said the government had no objection to the bill.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Marks Peace Agreement Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- On this day two years ago, the
Bangladeshi government and the tribal rebels signed a historic
document -- the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) peace agreement,
ending the two-decade-long armed conflict in the country's
southeastern hill region.
</P>
<P>
Two years later, the nation is celebrating the treaty's second
anniversary with mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
While the accord has been hailed by many as a "historic event"
and earned Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina the UNESCO peace prize for
ending the insurgency in the three hill districts, it has aroused
mixed reactions among the Bangladeshi people, particularly people
from the hill region.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami League is celebrating the occasion, the
opposition is still opposed to it, and tribal leaders have voiced
dissatisfaction over the slow implementation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Describing the agreement as "a glorious chapter in our national
history" in a message on the eve of the anniversary, the prime
minister said: "It (the agreement) has opened up the opportunities
for peace, stability and development replacing the two-decade-long
bloodshed and war-like situation in the hilly region."
</P>
<P>
She said her government had adopted extensive programs to
implement the CHT under short-, medium- and long-term plans.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Parbatya Chhattagram Jana Sanghati Samity
(Chittagong Hill Tracts People's Solidarity Association, PCJSS)
Shantu Larma, however, has expressed dissatisfaction over the slow
implementation of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"This historic peace accord was signed two years ago, but it is
yet to change living condition of the people of the region because
of the slow pace of its implementation," he was quoted as saying
on Wednesday in Bandarban, one of the three hill districts.
</P>
<P>
Larma, who is also chairman of the CHT Regional Council which
was established in May this year in accordance with the peace
accord, also expressed concern over the law and order situation in
the hill districts of Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban.
</P>
<P>
"The civil administration is yet to start functioning
effectively in the region ... There is politicization everywhere
and its bad impact is spreading day by day," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 rebels laid down their arms in early 1998 and
thousands of refugees returned from neighboring India following
the signing of the treaty on December 2, 1997 after a protracted
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
But relations between the government and the PCJSS remain
strained over the procedural delay in carrying out the accord.
</P>
<P>
The CHT Regional Council was formed only in May this year,
nearly one and half years after the signing of the treaty, the
Land Commission which was formed under the agreement to carry out
land survey in the region is not functioning because of the death
of its chairman, and the CHT Treaty Implementation Committee has
not held any meeting since November last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there have been clashes in the region within the
PCJSS, the political wing of the armed rebels which turned into a
"regional democratic party" early November this year.
</P>
<P>
The PCJSS suffered a split on the issue of the peace accord,
The Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people have been killed in clashes between the
erstwhile comrades, and at least on one occasion, a home-made bomb
was hurled on the way of a motorcade carrying Shantu Larma to
Rangamati, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Software Piracy Rampant in Arab Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The software piracy level in
the Arab countries is among the highest in the world, the Daily
Star newspaper Thursday quoted an official of Business Software
Alliance (BSA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The piracy rate in Jordan is 85 percent, in Kuwait 80 percent
and in Lebanon 93 percent, said Nasser Ali Khasawneh, BSA's vice
president for the Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Despite improved legislation in the Arab world, losses due to
piracy are still high, said Khasawneh at the ongoing Arab Regional
Conference on intellectual property rights held in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, the figure stood at 40 million U.S. dollars
last year and in Egypt at 10 million dollars, according to BSA
statistics.
</P>
<P>
"Those figures only represent income loss to companies. The
true losses would be higher,"the official added.
</P>
<P>
The actual losses in Egypt were estimated at 35 million
dollars, not 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Every job in the software industry creates nine jobs in
related fields,"said Khasawneh, adding cutting the piracy rate in
Egypt from its current level of 85 percent to 50 percent would
create 27,300 jobs in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arab countries to pay more attention to
combating piracy and play an active and positive role in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The BSA is an independent organization that looks after the
interest of software companies around the world. Its members
include Microsoft, Novell and Adobe.

China is currently exploring a path of sustainable development
that suits its special situation, and has accumulated valuable
practical experience, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
China takes a responsible attitude towards global environmental
protection, and has been making persistent efforts to tackle
domestic environmental problems, particularly the abatement of
harmful gas emissions, which has not only improved the
environmental quality of China but also contributed to global
environmental protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has been actively participating in global environmental
affairs, has signed a number of international environmental
conventions and agreements, conducted extensive exchange and
cooperation with various countries in the field of environmental
construction, and thus played an active role in promoting
international environmental protection, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"The earth, on which human beings co-exist, and the sky, under
which we live, are an integral whole that can not be divided. The
protection of them requires the concerted action of all countries,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
In the process of international environmental cooperation,
Jiang said, "we need to take full account of the long history of
unbalanced economic development among various nations and the
special situations of different countries. We should plan
comprehensively, strengthen cooperation, coordinate actions, and
work in a practical way."

Jiang called on developed countries to fully recognize the
historical impact that their development in the past had exerted
on the global environment, saying that they "therefore should take
on more responsibilities and utilize their economic, scientific
and technological advantages to assist developing countries
actively in tackling environmental problems."

During the past century, Jiang said, mankind has created
unprecedented material and spiritual wealth, and the world has
undergone significant transformation, which will provide
historical opportunities for all to make greater progress in the
new century.

"People of different nations should join hands, take concerted
actions, and work hard in order to achieve permanent peace of the

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has appointed 14 district administrators to coordinate and
harmonize government functions at district level.
</P>
<P>
There is need to have administrators at district level to
explain and implement government policy at grass root levels, the
president said at a press briefing in Lusaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces are vast and huge and the provincial deputy
ministers are unable to deliver services hence the need for the
appointment of district administrators, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The administrators will help the provincial deputy ministers
and permanent secretaries in their work, he said.
</P>
<P>
The administrators will also coordinate developmental resources
for political and social mobilization, he added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this month, all the remaining 58 districts will
have their administrators, the president said, promising to
appoint more women as administrators.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged all those appointed to take their job seriously
as their performance will make government fail or succeed in
policy implementation at district level.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China's four asset management
corporations today signed a framework agreement with the China No.
1 Automotive Group and 10 subsidiaries of the Shanghai Electronics
(Group) Company, involving a debt of 12.45 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China began to implement debt-to-equity swap plan since the

risks and cut debt burden of State-owned enterprises by swapping
non-performing loans of banks to their equity in enterprises.

<P>
According to the agreement signed today, the four AMCs led by
the China Huarong AMC and the China Development Bank will jointly
organize new limited companies together with the 11 enterprises,
and Huarong will become a major shareholder of the new companies
by holding shares worth 3.2 billion yuan in No.1 Automotive Group
and shares worth 3.45 billion yuan in the 10 companies under the
Shanghai Electronics Group.
</P>
<P>
The other three AMCs and the CDB will also hold shares in these
new companies.

<HEADLINE> Genghis Khan's Offspring Face New Challenges In the New Millennium (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- For Zhaorigetu, a 26 year old
Mongolian, his biggest dream is to become a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
Zhaorigetu lives in a house made of bricks and tiles, instead
of roaming on horseback like his ancestors. His place of birth,
the Banner of Hexigten of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was
the hereditary estate of Genghis Khan's father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
Bloodlines link the young Mongol with the family of Genghis
Khan. An oxhide portrait of Genghis Khan (1167-1227) hangs on the
wall in his house. Yet he knows little about the Great Khan except
that the Mongolian hero had led a military expedition as far as to
the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
Zhaorigetu is busy everyday taking care of his 200-hectare
grasslands and 300 sheep. With an annual income of 80,000 yuan (
nearly 10,000 U.S. dollars), he is much richer than many urban Han
Chinese residents. The average annual income for an urban resident
last year was about 650 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Not all Mongolians share Zhaorigetu's dream of striking it rich.
Gurizhabu, for instance, is a 38th generation offspring of Borshu,
a brave general of Genghis Khan. He still looks after the
Mausoleum of Genghis Khan in the Il Yu League which was built in
1956.
</P>
<P>
"This is a holy mission that must be passed on from generation
to generation," the 58-year-old Gurizhabu said. However, according
to Bilige, his eldest son, taking care of the mausoleum is not
only a mission but "a way of making a living". Bilige receives 500
to 600 yuan (about 60 to 72 U.S. dollars) a month for looking
after the Mausoleum. His dream is to become an actor or go to
college.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for Consolidation of Sino-Vietnamese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji said here Thursday that a good-neighborly and all-round
cooperative relationship between China and Vietnam is conducive to
peace, stability and development in the region and the whole world
at large.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement distributed upon his arrival here, Zhu
recalled the traditional friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Since the normalization of the bilateral relations eight years
ago, Zhu said, the Sino-Vietnamese ties have been further
tightened as marked by frequent high-level exchanges and the
increase in contacts and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
In the context of the current world situation, a constant
consolidation and development of good-neighborliness and all-round
cooperation between the two countries confirms to the common
aspirations and fundamental interests of the two peoples, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin
and his Vietnamese counterpart Le Kha Phieu agreed in Beijing last
February on the establishment of a future-oriented relationship of
long-term stability, good-neighborliness and all-round
cooperation. This means that the bilateral relations have entered
a new phase of development, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment
of diplomatic relations between the two countries as well as the
start of a new millennium, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"At this important historical occasion, I am looking forward to
having in-depth exchange of views with Vietnamese leaders with an
aim to further promote the development of the relations between
the two (communist) parties and the two countries," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have similar national conditions and thus
they have a lot of experience to share with each other, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu is on the second day of his four-day Vietnam visit which
has brought him to Ho Chi Minh city.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Hanoi, the Chinese premier will meet Le Kha
Phieu, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and Chairman of the National
Assembly Nong Duc Manh.

Maintaining traditions, national identity and language will be

"By melding the past with the present, the offspring of Genghis
Khan will have no regrets in making new achievements," said

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- More foreign experts in
swimming will be invited to give lectures to Chinese coaches, a
senior Chinese swimming official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will offer Chinese coaches more exposure to international
expertise as we invite experts from world powerhouses as the
United States and Australia," said Zhang Qiuping, assistant
director of the Chinese Swimming Association (CSA) after the 10-
day training program for Chinese coaches.
</P>
<P>
Over 140 coaches from the Chinese national team, provincial
squads and sports schools were happy about the American experts
who gave their advice and advanced training theories.
</P>
<P>
John Leonard, director of the American Swimming Coaches
Association, said: "It is a good start. Perhaps in the future we
can have different programs for the Chinese national team coaches
and the provincial coaches."
</P>
<P>
Leonard also suggested Chinese coaches at all levels need much
more outside contact.
</P>
<P>
"They need to contact with others. It is a learning curve that
can be rapidly accelerate the level of the coaches and swimmers."
</P>
<P>
Kenyon College head coach James Steen and Joel Stager, director
of the human performance in Indiana University, both agreed that
the prospect of Chinese swimming was promising with the efforts of
the fast-learning coaches and physically fit young swimmers.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese swimming is now the world power which has made a good
strike in the last 20 years. They have very bright future," said
Steen.
</P>
<P>
Though a few Chinese swimmers had involved in drug
controversies in recent years, the American experts maintained
doping was a global problem in all the sports.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate in China that some athletes are taking drugs
like any other country. But I knew the efforts the CSA paid to
remove drugs from the sport. And I really admired their
determination," Leonard said.

<HEADLINE> Boom in U.S. Steam Coal Demand Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. steam coal demand will
grow during the next 10 to 15 years, surpassing 1.2 billion tons
around 2010 under existing environmental rules, said a report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report from U.S. management
consulting firm Hill &AMP; Associates, coal's growth is not as fast as
the overall demand for electricity, and coal's share of generation
therefore falls somewhat even as the tonnage continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, new ozone and fine particle rules proposed by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency form a caveat, the report said.
Should those rules take effect, coal use would be restricted by 70
million to 80 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The industrial market for coal will continue to fade, said the
report, forecasting that the future will see more industrial
companies switch to natural gas for environmental reasons.
</P>
<P>
Domestic coal producers will continue their struggle to tap

coal exports will continue to decline as foreign coal producers
continue to cut their costs at a rate faster than U.S. producers.

<HEADLINE> China Further Cuts Down Coal Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China had closed down 30,500
coal mines and reduced the output by 202.18 million tons by the
end of October this year, according to the State Administration of
Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 31,000 coal mines will be shut down this year,
bringing down the country's coal output by 250 million tons, said
an administration official.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months this year, China produced 829.06
million tons of coal, a drop of 113.87 million tons, or 12 percent,
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, demand has also been descending. In the past 22 months,
China saw a decrease of 180 million tons in the demand for coal,
said the official, adding that there are 170 million tons of coal
in stockpile at present.
</P>
<P>
The administration will do everything possible to fulfill the
task of producing no more than 900 million tons of coal for next
year, said the official.
</P>
<P>
China has been closing down small coal mines and those that
cause waste of resources and serious pollution while producing low
quality coal with outdated technology.

<HEADLINE> Common Tariff May Help End GCC-EU Aluminium Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The latest move by Gulf Arab
countries toward establishing a customs union could help end an
aluminium tax row between the European Union (EU) and the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
At their annual summit in Riyadh last Sunday, GCC leaders
agreed to a common customs tariff of 5.5-7.5 percent and decided
to establish the long-awaited customs union by March 2005.
</P>
<P>
This initiative could lead to some give-and-take on the part of
both the EU and the GCC on the aluminium issue, which involves
Europe's 6 percent duty on primary aluminium imports from the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The GCC and the EU may find a mutually agreeable solution even
before the actual creation of the GCC customs union by 2005, said
Gert Adomeit, who heads the German Industry and Commerce Office in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), quoted by the Gulf News newspaper
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EU currently imposes a blanket 6 percent duty on all
aluminium imports from the GCC, which comprises the UAE, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Being the leading Gulf exporters of aluminum to the EU, the UAE
and Bahrain are the worst affected by the duty.
</P>
<P>
A recent foreign ministerial level meeting of the GCC and the
EU failed to resolve the issue. And the UAE is currently leading a
coalition against the tariff at the on-going ministerial
conference of the World Trade Organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Aluminium formed the major component of UAE's 1998 exports to
Germany, which amounted to 660.6 million dirhams (about 180.5
million U.S. dollars). Other exports included textiles and crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Germany exported 6.97 billion dirhams (about
1.9 billion dollars) worth of goods to the UAE, with cars and
trucks accounting for a third of the total. Chemicals and
pharmaceutical products formed the other major export categories.
</P>
<P>
The UAE-Germany trade volume for 1999 is expected to rise by
over 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Russia has reduced its natural gas supplies to pressure
Ukraine to repay its debts to Russia and this has caused the
problem of gas shortage in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has asked his Turkish
counterpart Suleyman Demirel to help negotiate a solution to the
row with Russia.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve the power shortage problem, Turkey started to
use diesel oil in power plants in some areas. The Energy Ministry
also decided to double the amount of electricity imported from
neighboring Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that it was
not right to link the Helsinki summit of the European Union (EU)
with the Turko-Greek problems.
</P>
<P>
"Our expectations and hope are that Turkey's candidacy is
officially confirmed in Helsinki. This is our demand, not what
Greece says," said the spokesman at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The partners of Turkish coalition government held an
emergency meeting late Monday to discuss the suspension of
execution against outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party leader Abdullah
Ocalan as requested by the European Court of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
It seems that they have reached a consensus to wait until the
European Court makes a final decision concerning Ocalan's case.
</P>
<P>
The agreement might be shaky, however, as several members of
Deputy Prime Minister Devlet Bahceli's Nationalist Action Party
and Tansu Ciller's True Path Party are pressing for the immediate
execution of Ocalan's death sentence.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Grant Thai King TeleFood Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (U.N.) will present the
TeleFood Medal to King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej on his
birthday on December 5 in recognition of his efforts for rural
people.
</P>
<P>
The medal, the first since the TeleFood project was established
by the U.N. agency three years ago, is being awarded for the
king's contribution to food security through the initiation of
more than 100 agricultural and irrigation projects, a press
release of the Public Relations Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the front side of the bronze medal is a portrait of the
king, wearing his usual inspection outfit and with a camera and a
pencil in his hands.
</P>
<P>
On the reverse side are four pictures of Thai farmers from four
sectors -- fruit and vegetables, rice, household livestock and
fishery. The pictures are circled with the legend "Food Security
in Recognition of Invaluable Support of Telefood."
</P>
<P>
The design demonstrates the king's new farming theory, which
advocates an integrated approach and self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
The TeleFood project was set up at the 1996 World Food summit
in Rome, Italy. The event brought together 176 member countries to
join forces in a bid to reduce the number of hungry people by half
from 800 million by 2015.

<HEADLINE> Israel Allows Some Palestinian Refugees Back to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel will allow several
thousand Palestinian refugees to return to the Palestinian
self-rule areas in the Gaza Strip, the Ha'aretz newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Israeli security sources as saying that the
move was made under an old agreement, which dealt specially with a
refugee camp in the town of Rafah on the Israeli-Egyptian border.
</P>
<P>
During the 1967 Middle East war, many Palestinian refugees were
forced to leave their homes and they built the Rafah refugee camp
along the Israeli-Egyptian border.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the Camp David agreement between
Israel and Egypt in 1978, the camp was split into two and
thousands of refugees remained in the area.
</P>
<P>
According to a refugee return plan reached by Israel, the
Palestinians and Egypt shortly after the Oslo accord in 1993, 640
Palestinian households were permitted to return and make their
homes again in the Gaza Strip till the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Tuesday in Gaza, Israel, Egypt and the
Palestinians agreed to accelerate the return of those refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper reports said, the permit of these
refugees' return is a single case and has nothing to do with the
debate over the right of return of Palestinian refugees or the
absorption of refugees in the Palestinian National Authority
territory.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday that Israel will
not allow "a single Palestinian refugee" to return to Israel and the
Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Palestinians were displaced and forced to find
shelters in neighboring Arab countries in the Arab-Israeli
conflicts in the past half century. The Palestinians insist that
the refugees have the right to go back to their homeland while
Israel disagrees.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Exports Grow from January to October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- From January to October 1999,
the Philippines posted an export revenue of 29.016 billion U.S.
dollars, 19 percent higher than the 24.387 billion dollars a year
earlier, the National Statistics Office said in a report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, for the month of October alone, total
receipts rose by 36 percent to 3.458 billion dollars from 2.542
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase rate of October is the highest figure since the
39.5-percent gain posted in April 1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that for October, manufactured goods went up
by 37.9 percent as sales reached 3.156 billion dollars, up from
2.289 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
This major export group accounted for 91.3 percent of the total
receipts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, income from agro-based products amounted to 157.16
million dollars or 4.5 percent of the total. Aggregate revenue for
these commodity groups grew by 13 percent from 139.08 million
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for 24.7 percent of the aggregate receipt for the
month, the value of exports to the United States was placed at
854.43 million dollars, inching up by 0.9 percent from 846.83
million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan followed with a 13.8-percent share while the country's
third biggest market, Japan, accounted for 12.8 percent of total
exports for October, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Cub Gets Name at Zoo Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A baby panda, the first born
in the Western Hemisphere since 1990, was named Hua Mei, meaning "
China USA", at a ceremony held at the San Diego Zoo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cub's name was selected and decided by the Chinese State
Forestry Administration after consulting with many other parties
concerned. More than 200 people were present at the ceremony at
the zoo, where the lovely creature was born on August 21, 1999.
According to the Chinese tradition, a baby gets its name on the
100th day after birth.
</P>
<P>
"Hua Mei" in Chinese also means "splendid" and "beautiful."
</P>
<P>
Introducing the baby panda, Chinese consul general in Los
Angeles An Wenbin said that Hua Mei is the youngest Chinese
goodwill ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The name symbolizes the close partnership forged between China
and the United States in the effort to pull pandas back from the
brink of extinction, said Don Lindburg, the zoo's panda team
leader.
</P>
<P>
Hua Mei, now in her fourth month, has gained about 11 pounds
since she was born with a weight of just about four ounces.
During the past months she has been gradually teething,
vocalizing and sitting up by herself. She has got her first
vaccination against canine distemper.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of local volunteers participated in the daily duties of
monitoring the panda baby and her mother. Children have sent them
letters and pictures. In November, four and half million people
from some 40 countries visited the zoo's giant panda Web site,
said Lindburg.
</P>
<P>
Being the first ever to survive past four days in the United
States, Hua Mei has been cared for by her mother since her birth.
Researchers have monitored the two closely, but never intended to
bother them other than to take a weekly health check on the cub,
according to Lindburg.
</P>
<P>
Hua Mei's parents came to the San Diego Zoo in 1996. Under an
agreement between the zoo and China, they would stay here for 12
years. Panda experts in China and the U.S. have been
collaborating year-round on extensive studies conducted at the San
Diego Zoo's Pacific Bell Foundation Giant Panda Research Station
and China's Wolong Giant Panda Research Center.

<HEADLINE> Study Sees Explosive Growth in U.S. Business Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 1 (Xinhua) -- An explosive growth in the
U.S. business Internet access market will be fueled by the demand
for higher bandwidth technologies, according to a report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to grow by nearly 70 percent to an
annual rate of almost 17 billion U.S. dollars in 2003, said the
report from the Strategies Group, a U.S. telecommunications market
research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
"Small and medium-sized businesses are the growth engine of the
U.S. economy," the report said. "For most of these companies, new
technologies that offer cost-efficient bandwidth will be the only
way to leverage the Internet potential. Technologies like digital
subscriber line have not yet reached widespread adoption, but will
grow tremendously over the next two years."
</P>
<P>
Internet access has become essential for the majority of U.S.
businesses. The report finds Internet penetration increasing in
line with business size: 60 percent of small businesses now have
Internet access, with medium-sized businesses at 80 percent, and
large ones at 90 percent to 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Strategies Group's forecast, U.S. small
business (with one to 19 employees) Web hosting revenues will
reach 1.67 billion dollars in 1999, 3 billion dollars in 2001 and
3.9 billion dollars in 2003.

<HEADLINE> EU to Narrow Agenda of Next Inter-Governmental Meeting: Finnish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) members
have agreed to cut short the agenda of the bloc's next inter-
governmental meeting in order to focus on the settlement of
problems blocking its eastward expansion, visiting Finnish Prime
Minister Paavo Lipponen said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that consensus has been reached on streamlining the
agenda for next year's inter-governmental meeting of the European
bloc in the hope to conclude the meeting by the end of next year
so that the expansion process would not be delayed.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, who has already visited most of the EU's 15 members,
made the announcement at a press conference after briefing his
Swedish counterpart Goran Persson on Finland's preparations for
the group's Helsinki summit next week.
</P>
<P>
He said that high on the agenda of the Helsinki summit is to
work out the schedule of the EU's next inter-governmental meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish prime minister expressed his country's hope that EU
members would concentrate on unsettled issues left from the last
summit in Amsterdam: the formation of the Commission of the
European Union, the distribution of voting share among member
countries and the implementation of the majority voting system in
the EU's Council of the Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, whose country currently serves the EU's rotating
president, stressed that the group must solve these problems if it
wants to overcome troubles caused by the upcoming accession of new
members.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Helsinki summit meeting will discuss the EU's
eastward enlargement and hammer out the list of new candidate
countries for the expansion.
</P>
<P>
He added that some EU members hoped the summit would also cover
issues on the bloc's further institutional reform after the inter-
governmental meeting, such as canceling its members' right of veto,
extending the power of the EU parliament, and drafting an EU
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen will travel to Greece on Thursday to wrap up his tour
of EU countries ahead of the EU's Helsinki summit.

<HEADLINE> Latest Crop of NZ MPs Older, Better Educated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The new crop of MPs elected
last weekend in New Zealand are older and wiser, according to an
analysis by the Wellington-based government and public relations
firm
Saunders and Unsworth.
</P>
<P>
The general election has brought 28 new MPs to the house if its

final results will not change the provisional ones after the
special
votes are counted by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysis published Thursday, the average age
of
an MP has risen to 48 years and eight months, up from 47 years in
the
last parliament. Most of the increase resulted from a rise in the
average age of the MPs from the Labor Party, which was the major
winner of last Saturday's election, up to 49 years and six months
from 46 years and six months.
</P>
<P>
The MPs of the new parliament are also better educated with 79
percent of them now having some form of tertiary qualification,
compared with 70 percent in the last parliament.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one percent of the MPs have a university degree, with 33
percent having a master's or honors degree or higher, and 16
percent
of them have a law degree.
</P>
<P>
The most common occupation among the MPs of the new parliament
is
business (14 percent), followed by farmer (12 percent), teacher
(10
percent), local government-public sector (9 percent) and lawyer (8

percent).
</P>
<P>
The number of women MPs has dropped from 35 to 32.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday urged the developed countries to give the least
developed countries greater access to global markets.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is committed to a comprehensive program to
help the poorest nations become full partners in the world trading
system," he told the trade ministers attending the third
ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) here.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he is working on this initiative with the European
Union, Japan and Canada and "we have to do more."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out to recent collaboration with Senegal, Lesotho,
Zambia, Bangladesh and Nigeria, saying that "we would also
intensify our efforts to help developing countries build the
domestic institutions they need to make the most of trade
opportunities and to implement WTO obligations."
</P>
<P>
He stressed more technical assistance to the developing
countries, which he said is necessary to really play a part in the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Another way to help these countries, Clinton believes, is to
supply technologies to avert the health and pollution costs of
industrial age.
</P>
<P>
"We have to help them use clean technologies that improve the
economy, the environment and health care at the same time," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the developed countries have to acknowledge a
responsibility, particularly those of us in the wealthier
countries, to make sure that "we are working harder to see that
the benefits of the global economy are more widely shared among
and within countries -- that it truly works for ordinary people
who are doing the work for the rest of us."
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 135 WTO members are debating on the future
of the world trade inside the Washington State Convention and
Trade Center, and holding bilateral talks on related matters in

<HEADLINE> Two Chinese Firms To Sell State-Owned Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) today announced the names of two publicly-listed
firms to be placed on China's state-owned shares placement plan.
</P>
<P>
The two firms are the Guizhou Tyre Co., Ltd. and the China
Jialing Industrial Co., Ltd., listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai
stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou Tyre has a total equity of 250 million shares, 58
percent of them being non-circulating state-owned shares. China
Jialing has an equity of 470 million shares, 75 percent being
state-owned shares.
</P>
<P>
Owners of the circulating shares of the these two firms will be
given priority in buying state-owned shares. The remaining part of
the shares,if any, will be sold to securities investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The price of the placement will be above the net asset value
per share and not higher than a 10 price-earning ratio.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned shares bought by circulating share owners can
be sold in the secondary market immediately, while those bought by
the securities investment funds can only be sold gradually on the
same market within two years.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC earlier announced a list of 10 firms as possible
candidates. It said the eight other firms will be given priority
in choosing candidates for the next year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that selling part of the state-owned shares will
improve the equity structure of target firms and force them to
improve their management and efficiency, as firms become more
exposed to public investors.
</P>
<P>
Many have hailed the plan as a positive move in realizing the
government's goal in resructuring the state-owned sector in China'
s national economy.

<HEADLINE> Snoring May Be Sign of Many Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Snoring is not only a nuisance
to roommates, but also a sign of cerebrovascular disease, high
blood pressure, coronary heart disease and asthma, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
During a recent academic conference held by the Chinese
Association for Science and Technology, Guo Xiheng, a doctor from
a hospital affiliated to the Capital Medical Sciences University,
said that snoring is intimately linked to many diseases.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that people with chronic snoring are ten times
easier to have cerebral infarction. Male snoring patients have
more risks of suffering from angina and myocardial infarction.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicates that 25 percent of males and 15 percent of
females in the United States habitually snore during sleep. About
60 to 70 percent of obese people snore habitually. The incidence
of snoring among those indulged in excessive drinking is five to
eight times higher than ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
"Medical scientists have found 84 diseases related to snoring.
Many of the diseases need to be examined carefully," said Huang
Xizhen, a chief physician of sleep breath related diseases in the
Peking Union Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yawen, a psychiatric specialist with the Shenzhen Kangning
Hospital in Guangdong province, reported his latest research
findings at the conference. A sample survey among 500 families in
the city of Shenzhen found that 23 percent of the residents
suffered from snoring-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Medical scientists say irregular breathing during sleep will
cause drowsiness in daytime, lack of concentration and thus reduce
working efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Guo Xiheng said that doctors can diagnose diseases according to
the frequency and sound of snores. He warned snorers to stop
smoking and drinking and adjust their sleeping posture.

<HEADLINE> Tim Hardaway on Injured List with Jammed Right Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Miami Heat star guard Tim
Hardaway, who had missed the last three games with a jammed right
knee, today was placed on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
The move was made prior to tonight's home game against the
Philadelphia 76ers. Rookie Anthony Carter started as point guard
for the fourth straight game and figures to make at least four
more starts as Hardaway will be out a minimum of five games.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway has been sidelined since playing 33 minutes in a 113-
106 loss at Atlanta on November 23. Ironically, the Heat have won
all three games without Hardaway, who is averaging 17.2 points and
7.7 assists in 11 games this season.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway, 33, has had knee trouble throughout his career. Last
season, he was slowed by a hyperextended right knee and had
postseason surgery to repair cartilage damage in his left knee.
Early in his career, he suffered a torn ACL.
</P>
<P>
During the offseason, Hardaway played for Team USA in the
Tournament of the Americas, helping the United States claim an
Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot Hardaway is in his 11th NBA season and fifth with
the Heat. He has one of the best crossover dribble moves in the
league and owned career averages of 19.4 points and 8.9 assists in
660 games entering this season.
</P>
<P>
The Heat also activated forward Harold Jamison from the injured
list. The undrafted rookie free agent has not played this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Biman, the country's
national airlines, had to cancel five flights on Wednesday as its
pilots refused to fly overtime in addition to their normal duties,
press reports here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several international flights while some others were delayed.
</P>
<P>
Domestic flights for Jessore, Sylhet and Khulna were also
canceled.
</P>
<P>
Pilots were quoted as saying they were often forced to take off
without "mandatory rest" of two days beyond their charter of
agreement with the Biman due to shortage of pilots.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Airlines Pilots Association (BAPA) decided not
to perform any additional duty beyond the contract.
</P>
<P>
Flights were resumed late Wednesday night after a memorandum of
understanding was signed between Biman management and the BAPA.

<HEADLINE> Bryant Says He Will Debut Wednesday Against Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Kobe Bryant, considered one
of the players to take the NBA into the new millennium, announced
his return to action today via the communication avenue of the new
millennium -- his own Web site.
</P>
<P>
"I'm back and ready to go!" the star guard of the Los Angeles
Lakers declared on his Web site, www.kobebryant.com. "I just got
back from the doctor, and he finally gave me the green light to
play (Wednesday night). It's been a long time coming, but
definitely worth the wait."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers host the Golden State Warriors tonight and have made
no official announcement regarding the status of Bryant, who
missed the first 15 games of the season with a broken bone in his
right hand. If Bryant is activated from the injured list before
the game, the Lakers would have to make a roster move.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is 6-2 in its last eight games and 11-4 this season
without Bryant, who is expected to join Shaquille O'Neal and Glen
Rice in new coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
Bryant suffered the injury in Los Angeles' first exhibition
game and has missed seven weeks. He was forced to wear a cast to
protect the fractured fourth metacarpal bone in the hand.
</P>
<P>
"How did my injury happen? Well, preseason can be pretty rough
and tumble," Bryant added on his Web site. "Everyone's trying to
establish himself in a new system, and many are just trying to
make the team. Somehow I got elbowed in my hand as I went up for
a rebound. And that's how it was broken, though I didn't know
immediately that it was broken."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the cast was removed and Bryant is putting it up
for bid on eBay, a public auction Web site.
</P>
<P>
Just 21 and in his fourth season directly out of high school,
Bryant played in all 50 games last season and registered 19.9
points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. He became the
youngest All-Star in NBA history in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Find 1,300-Year-Old Grotto in Xinjiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists believe
that a newly-discovered Buddhist grotto in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was inhabited by Muslims under
China's reign some 1,300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The grotto on a 60-meter-high cliff in Kuqa County, the site of
the Kingdom of Qiuchi, contains frescos similar to those found in
grottoes in Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
About 20 kilometers north of the Buddhist grotto are the
remains of a ruined castle and iron and copper workshops which
archeologists believe to be a military garrison for Tang dynasty
soldiers. Archeologists surmise that these soldiers and craftsmen
and their families from the central part of China built the grotto
and castle during the 7th century.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that we find a significant presence of
Han culture discovered in an area essentially inhabited by Uygur
Muslims and other ethnic minorities," said Chen Shiliang, a
research fellow at the Xinjiang Grotto Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
These findings verify historical records that state that the
Tang Dynasty set up a prefectural government in Qiuchi to manage
defense and administrative affairs of the western region. Some 30,
000 soldiers were dispatched to the region as well as Han monks,
craftsmen and their families.

There are 260 lifelike figures on these murals. Archaeologists
believe that the cave was built by people of different
nationalities. Inscriptions clearly show nine Han surnames. Some
specific names indicate that Han and local ethnic people may have
married.
</P>
<P>
The discovery testifies to a close relationship between Xiyu (
the ancient name for Xinjiang and parts of central Asia) and China
's central government in Chang'an (present-day Xi'an, capital of
Shaanxi Province). "The grottoes provide important clues to the
study of people who populated the western region, including Han
and Muslims," said Chen.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Communist Leader Chosen to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Petr
Luchinsky on Wednesday appointed Vladimir Voronin, chairman of the
Moldovan Party of Communists, to form a new government, after
Valeriu Bobutac failed to do so last week.
</P>
<P>
Bobutac had to quit after his cabinet list and policy report
were rejected by the communist-controlled parliament on November
22.
</P>
<P>
Voronin told reporters after accepting the appointment that the
new government would maintain the basic policies of the former
government led by Ion Sturza, with economic development and fight
against crime and corruption as its priorities.
</P>
<P>
Voronin has 15 days to submit his cabinet list and policy
report for parliament approval.
</P>
<P>
He said his party would consult all the parties in parliament
on the issue of naming a cabinet and indicated that his party
might not necessarily take the majority of the cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
President Luchinsky said communist Voronin's appointment does
not mean that Moldova, a former Soviet republic, would return to a
planned economy. Reform and speedy integration with the rest of
Europe remain Moldova's strategic task.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the communists would work with
other parties in parliament to ensure the smooth running of the
new government.
</P>
<P>
Sturza's government resigned on November 8 after failing a
confidence vote in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Voronin's communist party became the most powerful party in
parliament after the collapse of the three-party ruling coalition
following Sturza's resignation.

YANGON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar, an agricultural
country, is taking measures and using a step-by-step approach to
turn itself into an agro-based industrial country and has made
achievements to some extent.
</P>
<P>
The country established the Myanmar Industrial Development
Committee in 1995 to formulate industrial policy and provide
guidance for industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of industrial zones is the second important
measure taken by Myanmar for the expedition of its
industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, Myanmar has set up
 18 industrial zones across the country, of which four lie in the
capital city of Yangon and two in Mandalay division in the eastern
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The third measure is to privatize state-owned industrial
enterprises (SIEs). Myanmar introduced its privatization plan in
January 1995, according to which SIEs are to be transferred to
financially strong and technically manageable private enterprises
for further operation by way of auctioning, leasing and joint
ventures with local and foreign entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The SIEs privatized include those nationalized in the 1960s
when the Myanmar Revolutionary Council government was in power.
</P>
<P>
A major move signifying Myanmar's privatization process is the
leasing out of the largest state-owned Ywama Steel Mill in Yangon
in September 1998 to national entrepreneurs for continued
operation.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 100 SIEs have gone through the privatization
process.
</P>
<P>
The fourth measure is to increase disbursement of loans to
industrial enterprises, fixing the annual interest rate for such
loans as low as 15 percent, only 3 percent higher than that for
saving deposits which is 12 percent. At the same time, it also
cuts the rate of revenues payable by industrial entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there is a total of 53,338
industrial enterprises in Myanmar, of which 1,600 are state-owned,
accounting for 3 percent, while 637 are cooperative-run,
representing 1.2 percent and 51,101 are private-operated, taking
up 95.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of Myanmar's industrial sector is valued at
over 1 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Said to Be Able to Control AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is able to take
necessary control measures against AIDS as projected as the
country has known the situation on the infection of the disease,
said a high-ranking Myanmar health official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony here Wednesday marking the World AIDS
Day, Myanmar Health Minister Major-General Ket Sein said, "The
nation is able to control the dreadful disease to a certain
extent," official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of Myanmar's national AIDS control project is to
disseminate the knowledge on the infection of HIV and AIDS among
the people to enable them to enjoy a healthy life, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not disclose the up-to-date number of
 HIV-effected people and AIDS patients in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar launched the anti-AIDS program 10 years ago when a
central committee was formed under the leadership of the National
Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with U.N. agencies such as the World Health
Organization, the U.N. Development Program and the U.N, children's
Fund, local and international non-governmental organizations and
the private sector, Myanmar has successfully carried out these
AIDS control activities with certain success.
</P>
<P>
The annual government fund allocation is about 13 million kyats
(43,000 U.S. dollars) for implementing such programs identified in
the country's National Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics released in 1997, there were
17,846 HIV positive cases and 2,337 AIDS cases in Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> IFC Invests 14 Million Dollars in China's Port Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced Wednesday that it will invest 14
million U.S. dollars to finance the construction and operation of
a new container and general cargo terminal at Zhapu Port in
Zhejiang Province, eastern China.
</P>
<P>
The IFC has signed an agreement for an equity investment of 3
million dollars in China Infrastructure Group Holdings PLC (CIGPLC)
and approved loans totaling 11 million dollars to CIG Zhapu
International Terminal Two Company Limited. The new port will be
built adjacent to an existing petrochemical and general cargo
terminal on the northern half of Hangzhou Bay.
</P>
<P>
The project will mitigate congestion in many of the ports in
this region caused by the growing number of containers, said the
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, by December 2001, annual design
capacity will be 225,000 twenty-foot units of containers and 600,
000 tons of general cargo.
</P>
<P>
The project supports the government's efforts to improve the
efficiency of port operation in China through increased private
sector participation, said Declan Duff, director of the IFC's
Telecommunications, Transportation, and Utilities Department.
</P>
<P>
The CIGPLC, the flagship company of the China Infrastructure
Group (the Group), is planning to list its shares on the Growth
Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Group is
principally engaged in the development, operation, and management
of infrastructure projects in China, particularly transportation
and logistics.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's investment will be its second port project with the
Group. The IFC earlier made an equity investment of 1.5 million
dollars in CIGPLC and signed a loan agreement to provide 10
million dollars to the Wuhan International Container Trans-
shipment Company Limited, which is a subsidiary of the CIGPLC.

TIANJIN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The National Economic Research
Institution of Spain (NERIS) and the Tianjin Institute of Finance
and Economics have set up an international training center in
north China's Tianjin to train managing staffs for small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The center offers scientific research, training, and
consultation and services for foreign investors and Chinese firms,
said local officials.
</P>
<P>
The center, financed by the Spanish government, will recruit

Union and China. The establishment of the training center will
also support European enterprises in expanding their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises account for more than 90
percent of enterprises in the European Union and China. According

<HEADLINE> EU Wants Comprehensive New Round of WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) worked
toward seeking broad support during the third ministerial
conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Wednesday in
an appeal for a comprehensive new round of global trade talks.
</P>
<P>
Amid massive street protests against global trade
liberalization, representatives from 135 WTO member countries have
gathered in Seattle in a bid to work out a common ground for the
launch of a new round of global trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Pascal Lamy, EU trade commissioner and head of the EU
delegation, held separate talks with U.S. trade representative
Charlene Barshefsky, trade ministers from Canada, Japan and other
countries, as well as representatives from non-governmental
organizations, in an effort to secure support for the EU stance,
said sources close to the EU delegation.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU circulated a text, which called for the new
round to address a wide range of issues including agriculture,
services, industrial tariffs, anti-dumping, investment and
competition rules -- topics that exist or could potentially arise
during the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The EU also proposes to include non-trade concerns such as
environment and labor in the agenda, which were strongly opposed
by poorer countries fearing wealthier nations would use them as a
new form of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"We want environmental considerations integrated throughout the
negotiations in the new round," Lamy said, adding that WTO members
should think about where they need to be in not just one or two
years, but 20 years from now.
</P>
<P>
On the link between trade and labor, Lamy said the EU proposal
was carefully designed to be able to avert the possibility of
unfair protectionist sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The EU document has won support from Japan, South Korea,
Switzerland, Hungary and Turkey. But many other WTO members,
including the United States, want a narrower agenda for the trade
talks to be launched by WTO ministers conference starting Tuesday
here.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other leading agricultural producers
intend to keep the focus on the EU's farm subsidies, trying to get
a commitment from the EU to phase out its financial support for
farm products.

<HEADLINE> Expert: World's Largest Underground Funnel in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The largest underground
funnel area in the world is located in Shijiazhuang, capital of
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The total area of the underground funnel is 50,000 km. Ying
Ruozhi, general engineer at No.2 Reconnaissance Institute of
Hebei Province said that the underground funnel is caused by
excessive use of groundwater. More than ten major underground
funnels have been connected. The water level at the center drops
every year.
</P>
<P>
A main underground funnel at Cangzhou, close to the port city
of Tianjin, has exceeded 10,000 km. Another underground funnel in
southeastern part of Hebei Province has expanded by 305 km each
year and now is about 10,000 km long.
</P>
<P>
North China is one of the most arid regions in the country. The
available water resources in the province of Hebei are no more
than 17 billion cubic meters while the annual water consumption is
20 billion.
</P>
<P>
Ground sinking ranging from 200 to 1,000 millimeters affects an
area of 70,000 meters in Hebei. About 200 ground splits were found
in 35 counties. The deepest ground split had a visible depth of 10
meters.
</P>
<P>
Ying said that water resources in north China will not meet the
demand of social and economic development in the next decade
unless effective measures are taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
A project of diverting water from parts of southern China to
the north is being planned by the central government. Relevant
departments are making preparations to start the project as soon
as possible.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Football Association Boss Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- President of the Football
Association of Zambia (FAZ) Teddy Mulonga resigned Wednesday
following a directive from Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Mulonga has been at loggerheads with the government over the
alleged misuse of the money given to FAZ by the government for
1998 African Cup of Nations in Burkinafaso in which Zambia was
eliminated in the early stages of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
FAZ was given 577 million Kwacha (about 380,000 U.S. dollars at
exchange rate then) for the African Cup finals but failed to
account for the money.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said here Wednesday that he had asked Mulonga to resign.
</P>
<P>
Mulong's exective has been under government squeeze since April
last year when his executive was dissolved by Sports Council of
Zambia (SCZ) over allegations that it had misapplied 577 million
kwacha
</P>
<P>
FIFA, reacting to what it saw as government interference in the
running of soccer, was on the verge of banning Zambia from
international football activities when the government reluctantly
restored in office the FAZ executive led by Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
The government allowed in September in 1998 Mulonga and his
team back in office but it imposed a financial squeeze on the
association in a bid to force the current executive out.
</P>
<P>
In March this year the government said that it was waiting for
a new FAZ executive to be elected before it could once again begin
to provide the financial, moral and logistical support it withdrew
from the FAZ last year.

MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Steel production in Latin
America is estimated to total 50 million tons by the end of this
year, a 3.1 percent drop over 1998, a steel institute said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The International Iron and Steel Institute attributed the fall
to the economic recession in the region since last year.
</P>
<P>
Steel consumption will decrease by 45 percent in Venezuela at
the end of 1999, followed by Argentina with 35 percent, Peru 24
percent and Chile 16 percent. But the institute predicted that,
with the economic recovery, there will be a greater demand for
steel next year in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Launches National AIDS Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Wednesday officially launched the National AIDS Policy to
guide present and future responses to the killer disease in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In the commemoration of the World AIDS Day, Mugabe said it has
taken three and a half years for the government and the Ministry
of Health and Child Welfare to develop the policy through
consultations with the civil society and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
A legislative framework for the establishment of a broadly
based National AIDS Council that would coordinate, promote and
guide an appropriate multi-sectoral response to HIV/AIDS is going
through the parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the task ahead is to ensure that the policy would be
disseminated widely through a medium easily understood by all the
people.
</P>
<P>
The president defended the proposed AIDS levy in the country,
saying this move has won the praise of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The pandemic is not a problem of the Ministry of Health and
Child Welfare and the government alone, he said, stressing
everyone should participate in the fight against the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
It is greatly distressing to note that in spite of having been
exposed to HIV/AIDS education and information, people still
continue to ignore the existence of the infection, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He called for the expansion and close monitoring of educational
programs in schools to make sure that children and the youth get
much information on the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The president lamented that the premature deaths of young and
middle aged adults are adversely affecting the socio-economic base
of the planned development, further creating challenges for the
nation.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, it is estimated that the total number of
full-blown AIDS cases stands at more than 400,000.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the number of children orphaned through
HIV/AIDS would reach 600,000 by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
The official made the appeal at the function organized by the
UAC in the northern district of Masindi on Wednesday to mark the
World AIDS Day, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwomushana, the function is designed to highlight
the dangers of the pandemic and urge the young people to establish
healthy habits of behavior.
</P>
<P>
He promised to do more to curb the spread of AIDS in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is among the few countries in the world where great
progress has been made in the combat against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The HIV infection rate in the country has dropped from over 30
percent five years ago to the present level of 12 percent. Among
those aged 15-19, HIV prevalence has declined from 32.2 percent in
1991 to the present 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although Uganda has achieved a lot in this field, the young
people are still the most vulnerable to the disease, Rwomushana
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the multi-sectoral campaign against AIDS is the right
solution to the problem and the young people should cooperate with
the government and other agencies to help bring down the infection
rate further.

<HEADLINE> World AIDS Day Marked in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A march and then a rally were
held here Wednesday to mark the World AIDS Day with calls for
continued fight against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to fight this disaster vigorously," said
Zambian Minister of Sport, Youth and Child Development Abel
Chambeshi while addressing the rally.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the world AIDS campaign this year is "listen,
learn, live, world AIDS campaign with children and young people."
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "We must listen to the children and the
young people, hear their views and concerns and understand what is
vital to their lives."
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, we should learn from one another about respect,
participation, support and ways to prevent HIV infection," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should live in a community where rights of the children and
 young people are protected and where those living with HIV/AIDS
are cared for. We must see that they do not suffer from
discrimination," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the young people are in fact living in a world of
paradox: they are told to abstain, but at the same time they are
exposed to a barrage of advertisements using sex symbolism to sell
goods, so temptation grows in abundance.
</P>
<P>
"Our battle has to remain on and on until we eliminate this
infection from our midst," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants were representatives from the United
Nations agencies, bilateral agencies, non-government and
community-based organizations.
</P>
<P>
Placards were held high inscribed with slogans: Be wise, learn
about AIDS and survive; Abstain, be faithful character.
</P>
<P>
According to Zambian Health Ministry, an estimated 19.7 percent
of the entire adult population of the country aged 15-49 is
currently infected with HIV/AIDS and the majority of the
infections are transmitted through heterosexual contact.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Open First Chapter of The Book of Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- An international team of
researchers has reached a scientific milestone by deciphering the
complete genetic sequence of chromosome 22, marking the first time
that the whole genetic code of a human chromosome has been
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Writing down all the 34 million "letters" that make up the
entire sequence of chromosome 22 is akin to opening "first chapter
of the book of life", scientists told a news conference Wednesday
in London.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from Britain's Sanger Center, Keio University
in Japan and the University of Oklahoma and Washington University,
in the United States, have identified 679 genes on chromosone 22,
of which 55 percent were previously unknown in humans.
</P>
<P>
This information will provide new insights into the way genes
are arranged along a strand of DNA and how they might be
controlled, paving the way for huge advances in medical diagnosis
and treatment, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in the human genome. Among
them chromosome 22 is the second smallest.
</P>
<P>
Each human chromosome consists of a single linear molecule of
DNA,which is composed of four chemical bases represented by the
letters A(adenine), T(thymine), G (guanine) and C(cytosine).
</P>
<P>
It is the order, or "sequence", and context of these letters
which determines how our bodies are made, and our predisposition
to certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
Previous research has already revealed that chromosome 22 is
implicated in the workings of the immune system, congenital heart
disease, schizophrenia, mental retardation and several cancers
including leukaemia.
</P>
<P>
The availability of the complete DNA sequence will
revolutionize the future of research on these diseases, and the
function of other genes on chromosome 22.
</P>
<P>
The work on chromosome 22, to be published Thursday in the
science journal Nature, is the first step in the Human Genome
Project, an international collaboration with the aim to decode the
3 billion letters that make up the whole human genome.
</P>
<P>
One third of the genome has already been completed and
scientists estimate that with a first working draft to be ready by
spring 2000, the highly accurate, finished form of human genome
will be available before 2003.

sovereignty and territorial integrity despite mounting external
pressures imposed on the country, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Wednesday quoted Deputy Foreign
Minister Tekeda Alemu as saying that Ethiopians from all corners

However, Tekeda said, the decisions made by the Security
Council of the United Nations and others with regard to the
Ethio-Eritrean conflict lacked commitment to the international
conventions and failed to condemn aggression.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the Organization of African Unity has been
acting alone to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict based on
the principles of its charter.

Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war since May 1998. Hundreds
of thousands of people were reportedly killed and wounded in the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Security Council Calls for More Effective Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from 38 countries, together with U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, have voiced their respective opinions on "the
role of the Security Council in the prevention of armed conflict"
at the two-end open debate, which began Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Most of the representatives agreed that the Security Council

guidance in efforts to prevent armed conflicts and work
effectively to address the root cause of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"There are various kinds of measures that can be taken to
prevent armed conflicts, but there is one general principle all of
them must abide by, that is, actions must be taken in accordance
with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations," said Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Delegation maintains that all preventive measures
should only be taken under the prerequisite of respect for the
political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
all countries and the will of the government and people of the
country concerned," Qin said. "The principle of non-interference
in internal affairs is the primary principle guiding U.N. actions
in conflict prevention. Preventive measures can only be taken upon
request or with the consent and cooperation by the country
concerned."
</P>
<P>
Qin's statement was echoed by Gennady Gatilov, representative
from the Russian Mission to the United Nations, who said that the
preventive measures "must be done on a voluntary basis, and only
with the unequivocally expressed support of the host country, to
be legal and effective."
</P>
<P>
"Any United Nations action -- including situations with
humanitarian profile -- must be undertaken in accordance with the
Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, representative of Egypt, said, "
The Security Council must respect territorial integrity and non-
intervention in the internal affairs of States. It must obtain the
approval of States that would be affected by its decisions, before
adopting such measures."
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Brazil also agreed upon the viewpoint. Gelson
Fonseca, Brazilian representative, told the Security Council
debate that "conflict prevention measures must be predicted on the
consent of the Government -- or Governments -- concerned, in full
respect of their sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council shoulders the
primary responsibility for the maintenance of world peace and
security. It is also the major institution that the international
community relies on for settling conflict and crisis and realizing
peace.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from such countries as Sudan, Iraq, Namibia and
Belrus also agreed to the observation that nowadays, with
prevention of armed conflict becoming an important means of ending
disputes peacefully, it is only natural that the Security Council
should bear major responsibilities in this area.
</P>
<P>
However, there seems to be a tendency in the current work of
the 15-nation Security Council of putting much emphasis on
intervention while neglecting effective prevention. All too often,
there is heated debate on intervention but no serious study into
the root cause of conflicts is given adequate attention.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that prevention is one of the main tasks of this
Organization," Annan said. "And yet, far too often, we find
ourselves dealing with the effects of conflict rather than its
roots."
</P>
<P>
Fernando Petrella, representative of Argentina, also argued
that the root cause of conflicts must be confronted.
</P>
<P>
Over the decade between 1989 and 1999 alone, there have been
more than 100 armed conflicts in the world, the majority of which
occurred in developing countries. In reality, this is no
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
For too long, the unreasonable old international political and
economic order has seriously hindered the economic development and
social progress of developing countries, putting them at a
disadvantageous position in the new globalization wave.
</P>
<P>
"This is undoubtedly the major cause of the turbulence and
frequent conflicts in some developing countries," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"In the longer term it is even more important to address the
deep-rooted causes of conflicts, which often lies in the social
and economic sphere," Annan said. "Poverty, repressive and
undemocratic government, endemic underdevelopment, weak or non-
existent institutions, political and economic discrimination
between ethnic or religious communities: there are the long-term
causes of many conflicts."
</P>
<P>
"While war is the worst enemy of development, healthy and
balanced development is the best form of long-term conflict
prevention," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Start Agricultural Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Agricultural and Rural
Affairs Minister Husnu Gokalp said on Wednesday that agricultural
reform would be launched in Turkey and the government would
encourage producers.
</P>
<P>
Gokalp said that the reform aims to support producers and
ensure consumers to buy products in good condition. " We will
extend a number of subsidies to farmers," according to a report of
Turkish Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was committed to fulfilling the criteria of its
agreement with the World Trade Organization (WTO), he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, however, that Turkey should be careful not to
damage its own producers' welfare when importing produce.
</P>
<P>
He said that nobody is opposed to free trade, but we must use
it to our producer's benefit.
</P>
<P>
"Our agricultural producers should be cared for and subsidized
by the government. The big problem Turkish producers face is
finding markets. We must find markets for our producers. The
products must be bought on time, and the money must be paid on
time. In this way we can overcome the problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
All the details of the agricultural reform bill have been
approved by the cabinet, and now it is waiting for
parliament's approval, he disclosed.

<HEADLINE> France Holds Solemn Funeral for Well-known Sinologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- France held a Solomon quasi-state
funeral on Wednesday for the well-known Sinologist, life-long
friend of China, writer and former Gaullist minister Alain
Peyrefitte, who died of cancer last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, Senate President Christian
Poncelet, former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, former Prime
Minister Alain Juppe and hundreds of other French personalities,
mainly from the Gaullist Rally for the Republic and centrist Union
for French Democracy, as well those from the cultural and press
circles, attended the funeral held at the Invalides military
museum.
</P>
<P>
The square in front of the Saint-Louis Church of Invalides was
covered with wreaths and flowers, and a military honor was given
to Peyrefitte after a religious ceremony in front of the coffin of
the dead which was covered with the tri-color national flag of
France, with the slow and solemn melody of ``March of Funeral'' of
Frederic Chopin in the air.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to France, Wu Jianmin, represented China at
the funeral, standing in the front-line of the attendants.
</P>
<P>
Two French Academicians and close friends of Peyrefitte's, Jean-
Francois Deniau and Jean d'Ormesson, paid homage to the sinologist
in their speeches at the funeral, calling Peyrefitte ``a fighter
of spirit'' and one who sought truth throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
``Under the cover of a political person, we are among those who
have seen a warm-hearted man, a man who sought truth, a
conscientious worker and a man devoted to the good of the public,
'' said Deniau.
</P>
<P>
``He is a man of faith and intelligence, a man of culture and
statesmanship, a man of passion and of reason,'' said d'Ormesson.
</P>
<P>
The funeral ended in the church bell ringing for the dead and
the French national anthem, ``la Marseillaise.''

<HEADLINE> Roundup: More Effective Prevention of Armed Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from 38 countries, together with U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, have voiced their respective opinions on "the
role of the Security Council in the prevention of armed conflict"
at the two-end open debate, which began Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Most of the representatives agreed that the Security Council
should refer to the U.N. Charter and international law as its
guidance in efforts to prevent armed conflicts and work
effectively to address the root cause of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"There are various kinds of measures that can be taken to
prevent armed conflicts, but there is one general principle all of
them must abide by, that is, actions must be taken in accordance
with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations," said Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Delegation maintains that all preventive measures
should only be taken under the prerequisite of respect for the
political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
all countries and the will of the government and people of the
country concerned," Qin said. "The principle of non-interference
in internal affairs is the primary principle guiding U.N. actions
in conflict prevention. Preventive measures can only be taken upon
request or with the consent and cooperation by the country
concerned."
</P>

with the unequivocally expressed support of the host country, to
be legal and effective."

"Any United Nations action -- including situations with
humanitarian profile -- must be undertaken in accordance with the
Charter," he said.

the United States, on August 21.
</P>
<P>
The name of this special panda cub, given by China's State

<P>
On the other hand, many representatives said that the Security
Council, which has been playing an important role in conflict
prevention, also has its limits. In fact, it is not a panacea.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, the root cause of the conflicts is the
unreasonable old international political and economic order.
Changes to this situation would only be realized by concerted
efforts by the Security Council, the whole U.N. system and the
entire international community, including regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
Olusegun Apata, representative from Nigeria, said, "The United
Nations' best efforts to resolve conflicts are hindered by the
lack of financial resources, and limited knowledge and familiarity
with the local situations."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Security Council should recognize the importance
of the cooperation between the world body and regional and sub-
regional organizations, such as the Organization of African Unity
and the Economic Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
Martin Andjaba, Namibian permanent representative to the United
Nations, said, "Regional arrangements could contribute to the
maintenance of peace only if their actions are consistent with
Chapter VIII of the Charter."
</P>
<P>
Many representatives called upon the Security Council to be
fair and even-handed in addressing armed conflicts in all areas
worldwide, rather than adopting double standard or on a selective
basis.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in different regions of the world is an indivisible and
related whole. In deliberating the issue of armed conflict
prevention, the Security Council should treat all regions in the
world equally, especially Africa," Qin said. "There should be no
preferential treatment to one and neglect of another."
</P>
<P>
Peter Kasanda, representative of Zambia, said, "Africa
continues to be one of the greatest challenges to the Security
Council, and that would continue to be the case in the foreseeable
future, if the international community fails to assist in
addressing the causes of conflict."
</P>
<P>
Africa has generated more than 8 million refugees, in addition
to millions of internally displaced.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council should give equal treatment to all
conflicts, and should be fair in its execution of its peace and
security responsibilities," he said. "Its authorizing of 6,000
military personnel for Sierra Leone, but 9,100 for East Timor,
made it difficult to escape the perception that a double standard
was being employed."
</P>
<P>
A lot of representatives called for a revision of the tendency
in the United Nations of paying only lip service to Africa, saying
that the world body should put more human and financial resources
to preventive diplomacy in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Hasan, the Iraqi permanent representative to the United
Nations, said, "Due to United States influence in the Security
Council, the Council's credibility had seriously deteriorated over
the past 10 years."
</P>
<P>
"The Council should work for all Member States," he said. "
Decision-making should fully respect the principles and goals of
the U.N. Charter and the General Assembly should fully respect the
principles and responsible for resolutions that violated the
Charter, as well as the Council impassively when it should act."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Consider Extraditing Former Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will only
consider extraditing former Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam
once it receives a formal legal application from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Essop Pahad, minister in the President's Office, made the
remarks in reply to a question at a news briefing on a cabinet
meeting in Pretoria on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Pahad said as far as he knew no such application had
been made yet.
</P>
<P>
Mengistu came to South Africa from Zimbabwe on November 18 to
receive medical treatment for an undisclosed illness at a private
clinic.
</P>
<P>
He was tried in absentee for crimes against humanity and
genocide which occurred during his 17-year rule from 1974 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
He fled to Zimbabwe in 1991 and has been living there in an
exclusive Harare suburb under heavy protection.
</P>
<P>
According to Pahad, Mengistu came to South Africa for medical
treatment and he would go back to Zimbabwe once the treatment is
completed.
</P>
<P>
South Africa does not have a formal extradition treaty with
Ethiopia and the government could not act on a newspaper report
stating that Ethiopia wanted South Africa to extradite Mengistu,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, if Ethiopia made a formal request in this regard,
South Africa would consider it, he said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Reiterates Dialog As Way to Solve Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) on Wednesday reiterated that the dispute with non-Arab Iran
over three strategic Gulf islands should be resolved through
bilateral dialog.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs should
be resolved through unconditional bilateral negotiations within a
set time frame, said President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan
on the eve of his country's 28th national day, which falls on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If dialog fails, the issue should be tackled through
international arbitration, Zayed added.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, located near key shipping lanes in the
Gulf, are claimed by both the UAE and Iran, but have been
controlled by Tehran since 1971, when British forces retreated
from the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said that it hopes to solve the "misunderstanding"
through dialog. But the UAE accuses its powerful neighbor of
lacking sincerity.
</P>
<P>
Zayed expressed hope that the tripartite committee established
by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) last July would devise a
mechanism for the commencement of negotiations between the UAE
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprises the foreign ministers of Qatar, Oman
and Saudi Arabia as well as GCC Secretary General Sheikh Jamil
Ibrahim Al Hujailan.
</P>
<P>
"We have great hope that the efforts of this committee will be
rewarded with success," Zayed said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has complained about the slow pace of the committee,
which is expected to submit its first formal report by next June,
when GCC leaders hold a mid-year consultative meeting.
</P>
<P>
The GCC is a region political and economic alliance, grouping
the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Vows to Strengthen Sino-Omani Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUSCAT, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting top Chinese legislator
Li Peng expressed his hope here Wednesday that the friendly and
cooperative relations between China and Oman will be further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet in honor of him given by Omani State Council
President Hamoud al-Harthy, the top Chinese legislator said he was
delighted to have the opportunity to meet so many members of the
royal family, of the State Council and of the Consultative
Assembly as well as government ministers of the Arab state.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), is the first Chinese top legislator to
visit Oman since the two countries established bilateral ties in
1978.
</P>
<P>
Al-Harthy called Li's visit to Oman an important event in
Sino-Omani relations, saying the bilateral relations are very good
at present and the State Council of Oman is willing to increase
friendly exchanges with the National People's Congress of China.
</P>
<P>
Omani officials who attended the banquet included Consultative
Assembly President Abdullah al-Qatabi, Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah, Commerce and
Industry Minister Maqbool Bin Ali Sultan, Water Resources Minister
Hamed bin Said Aufi, Communications Minister Salem Abudllah,
Higher Education Minister Yahya bin Mahfudh as well as two royal
family members.
</P>
<P>
Li is expected to hold formal talks with Hamoud al-Harthy on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Omani relations developed smoothly during the past 21
years. In 1987, foreign ministry officials of the two countries
launched an annual consultative mechanism and bilateral trade
reached 746 million U.S. dollars in 1998 as China became the
fourth largest oil buyer of Oman. That year, China imported 5.8
million tons of oil from Oman.
</P>
<P>
Oman is the last leg of Li's six nation Africa and Asia tour
which he said is designed to "deepen understanding, enhance trust,
promote friendship and expand co-operation."
</P>
<P>
The tour has taken Li to Mauritius, South Africa, Kenya,
Palestine and Israel.

final-status talks at the Neve Ilan Hotel outside Jerusalem
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Avi Ben-Bassat, director-general of the Israeli Finance
Ministry, put three proposals for economic ties on the negotiation
table, but there was still no detailed news about the content of
these proposals, Israeli Radio reported.

<P>
The Palestinians asked to clarify several points on the
economic issues and requested further debate, according to the
radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo
reiterated his concerns about the settlement issue during
Wednesday's session. He said that the continuing settlement
activities would endanger the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo handed over a letter to his Israeli counterpart Oded
Eran in the six session of final-status talks on Monday,
complaining Israeli plans to build 1,026 new homes in the Efrat

</P>
<P>
However, Rabbo said, there has been no response from the
Israeli side so far. Eran refused to comment on this issue after

<HEADLINE> Panda Cub in San Diego Named Huamei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The female panda cub born on
August 21 in San Diego Zoo has been named Huamei, meaning in
Chinese "China and the America," Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese characters, Hua and Mei, also mean beautiful,
Li explained to reporters at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Huamei's parents, Shishi and Baiyun, have been living in San
Diego Zoo as a 12-year panda reproductive research project between
China's Wildlife Conservation Society and the U.S. Zoological
Society of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
An artificial insemination on Baiyun, the female, has led to
the birth of Huamei, a female panda cub. China's State Forestry
Administration was given the job of finding a name for the cub.
</P>
<P>
"The name of this special panda cub should convey a sense of
joy for the successful partnership of Chinese and American
scientists, a sense of importance of China-U.S. relationship and a
sense of beauty of this marvelous animal," Li told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Huamei is the first giant panda ever born in San Diego, the
first born in the Western Hemisphere since 1990, and the fifth
born on American soil. Previous ones were all born at the National
Zoo in Washington surviving just for a few days.
</P>
<P>
Panda was designed as class-A protected wildlife in 1962 by the
Chinese government. There are more than 1000 giant pandas in the
world.
</P>
<P>
There are only 123 giant pandas living in captivity worldwide,
five of them in the United States including three at San Diego Zoo
and two at Zoo Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economy Expected to Grow Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economy will grow
between 2 and 2.5 percent next year, the country's Central Bank
Governor Micah Cheserem said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy will grow by 1.4 percent this year, against
1.8 percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent in 1997, Cheserem said, adding
this projection is based on how fast the government moves to
reform the civil service and the judiciary, and improve the
country's poor infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the government takes prompt actions to carry
out economic, judiciary and civil service reforms, especially if
the road network, telecommunication and services at the Mombasa
Port are improved quickly, the growth rate might be even higher
than 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's economy would also be boosted next year
by the resumption of aid from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended its 2.05 million U.S. dollar loans to Kenya
in July, 1997 accusing the country of poor governance and official
corruption.
</P>
<P>
In September, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi appointed a team
of technocrats to key civil service positions, cut the number of
ministries in nearly half and introduced new rules on the
government's procurement of goods and services in a bid to tackle
corruption.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rises in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending
increased 0.3 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 699.3 billion dollars, the Commerce Department reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
October's gain followed a revised 0.1 percent decline in total
construction spending in September, far off government
expectations of a 0.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that spending on all government projects led
the increase in total spending, rising a sizable 2.5 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 161.6 billion dollars. Spending
on government housing and redevelopment, schools and other public
buildings all showed gains.
</P>
<P>
Spending on all residential projects also picked up in October,
growing by 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 319.
9 billion dollars. Spending on single-family homes rose by a tiny
amount, while spending on apartment construction fell, reflecting
the impact of rising mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the value of all private construction projects dropped
0.4 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 537.
6 billion dollars. Spending on industrial buildings, office
buildings, motels and hotels and educational projects all showed
declines.
</P>
<P>
It marked the fourth consecutive monthly decrease in spending
on private construction projects, something that hasn't happened
since March-June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Builders in some parts of the country have experienced
shortages of skilled workers and some building materials, which
can delay or disrupt construction schedules.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Banking Sector to Recover Next Year: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Central Bank Governor
Micah Cheserem Wednesday predicted that the flagging banking
sector in the country will recover next year.
</P>
<P>
"The scale of justice is balanced, it is no longer in favour of
the debtors,'' he said in response to the recent court rulings
allowing commercial banks to auction the property of debtors.
</P>
<P>
A huge portfolio of bad loans forced the Central Bank to close
five small banks among over 50 banks in the country last year and
tarnished the image of the whole sector.
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed debtors backed by government officials for the
bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem earlier this year criticized the courts for favouring
the debtors and moving too slowly to clear up the debts.
</P>
<P>
However, after rulings were made recently allowing commercial
banks to auction property belonging to several government
ministers with unpaid debts, Cheserem said he now has more
confidence in the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Public confidence in the banking sector will be further boosted
next year if yields on government paper fall, forcing banks to
compete more fiercely to deliver good customer service, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said most small banks have improved their
financial status this year, with 90 percent of them having managed
to increase their minimal capital to 200 million shillings (about
2.7 million U.S. dollars) before December 31, a deadline set by
the Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Adieu, Alain Peyrefitte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- One week ago, if one was asked
who were the top 10 Western personalities who really loved and
understood China, one could not forget Alain Peyrefitte, the
French Academician who has devoted the latter half of his life to
increasing the mutual understanding between France and China.
</P>
<P>
Besides his numerous high-quality books on China, Peyrefitte
was personally engaged in action for China, being a rare voice
speaking for China in his newspaper, Le Figaro, on television and
radio, until the last days of his life.
</P>
<P>
As ``a great friend of China's,'' as Chinese Ambassador to
France Wu Jianmin called him in his message of condolences upon
his death last Saturday, Peyrefitte was one of the people in the
West who stood up for the truth in defending China's achievement
in social and economic development in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolences sent to the widow of Peyrefitte,
four former Chinese ambassadors to France said that the
academician had played ``an irreplaceable role'' in developing
Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
``What is especially unforgettable is that whenever the
relations between France and China met with difficulties, he
always did not best to help remove the obstacles,'' said the four
former heads of the Chinese mission in Paris.
</P>
<P>
As a political personality, a scholar, a man with a cold
appearance but a warm heart, and a Sinologist, Peyrefitte also
represented a generation of French statesmen around General
Charles de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
``It is a great loss for us, we don't have this kind of
political genius any more,'' said Joel Henri-Fiori, a veteran
French journalist in a telephone interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
``It is a loss for China, because Peyrefitte loves China and
this is special,'' said Bettina Jannink, a free lance journalist
and writer.
</P>
<P>
In his book ``When China Awakes'' published in 1973, Peyrefitte
predicted that China would play a very important role in the world
in the next century and the world should be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
Like the outstanding French statesman and writer Andre Malraux,
Peyrefitte was among the first French political leaders to have
traveled to New China and met with the first generation of Chinese
leaders, including Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
For many times, Peyrefitte expressed his admiration for the
social and economic achievement made by China since 1949,
especially since China adopted the open and reform policy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
For several times, he stood up in public to dispute those ``
human rights advocates'' who could not but appear ill-read and
badly informed in front of the knowledge and eloquent rhetoric of
the academician.
</P>
<P>
With impeccable dress, manner and respectfulness, Peyrefitte
also drew great admiration from many Chinese diplomats and
journalists working in France.
</P>
<P>
In his monumental work ``Immobile Empire,'' which was inspired
by the trip in the late 18th century by a British mission to
Peking and the only one of his works translated into Chinese,
Peyrefitte showed his great sensibility to the humiliations China
suffered since 1840.
</P>
<P>
Peyrefitte liked to quote in his works Lu Xun, the greatest
Chinese writer of 20th century, who devoted his life for the
modernization of his country.
</P>
<P>
Unlike numerous so-called ``China experts'' in the West, when
writing about China, the academician also showed a great respect
for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Peyrefitte used to ask his Chinese friends in Paris to check
his works, in order to avoid the slightest mistakes which could
harm the feeling of the Chinese people, said Zhang Hanjun, a
journalist working for the Paris-base Chinese language newspaper ``
Nouvelles d'Europe.''
</P>
<P>
One overseas Chinese poet who lives in Paris published a poem
in memory of Peyrefitte, in which she wrote, ``You are a bridge to
shoulder friendship, and you are a river to let the water of
understanding flow.''
</P>
<P>
Adieu, Alain Peyrefitte.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Urges Israel to Resume Peace Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly Wednesday urged Israel to resume peace talks with
Syria and Lebanon and withdraw completely from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly Wednesday morning adopted six resolutions,
two of which are on the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
One of the resolutions on the Middle East determined that "the
continued occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights and its de factor
annexation constitute a stumbling block in the way of achieving a
just, comprehensive and lasting peace " in the region.
</P>
<P>
It called on Israel to resume negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon and to respect the commitments reached in previous talks.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demanded that Israel withdraw from all the
occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the line of June 4, 1967, the
border on the eve of Israel's war with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The second Middle East resolution deplored the transfer by some
states of their diplomatic mission to Jerusalem in violation of a
1980 Security Council resolution and said Israel's decision to
impose its laws and jurisdiction over Jerusalem was illegal.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Jerusalem as its undivided capital while
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future
Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Back EU Voting Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain Wednesday offered to
give up one of its two European Commissioners in return for a new
voting system handing more power to member states' ministers,
according to reports here.
</P>
<P>
As the European Union prepares to start the process of
considering allowing up to 12 further nations to join at next week
's Helsinki summit, the British Foreign Office confirmed a change
in procedure would be needed.
</P>
<P>
This could mean reducing the number of commissioners allocated
to larger countries such as Britain, France and Germany, provided
they received a guaranteed larger share of the vote in the Council
of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report said that Britain would be prepared to back
qualified-majority voting on some issues, such as transport.
</P>
<P>
But in a speech to the House of Commons Wednesday, Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook made it clear that Britain intended to keep
its right of veto on areas such as taxation, social security and
defense.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain would demand a greater voting weight in the
EU's Council of Ministers, which he said was currently skewed
against larger nations and would get more unfavorable for them as
more countries joined.
</P>
<P>
In his speech setting out government policy ahead of next week'
s EU summit in Finland, Cook said Britain would also consider
expanding majority voting in areas "outside key matters of
national interest."
</P>
<P>
"Britain recognizes the importance each member state, however
small, attaches to retaining a seat on the European Commission,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why all the larger member states are willing to
concede their right to a second seat on the Commission," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also insisted that Britain would not concede its second
seat unless it won agreement to increase its voting strength in
the council.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Mandela's Appointment as Mediator for Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday welcomed the designation by the Eighth Arusha
Regional Summit on Burundi of former South African President
Nelson Mandela as the new facilitator of the Burundi peace process,
a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told a press conference that
Annan "hopes that the prestige and authority of Mr. Mandela will
reinvigorate the process in Arusha after the death of Mwalimu
Julius Nyerere."
</P>
<P>
"In view of the current political and security situation
prevailing in Burundi, the Secretary-General viewed the
designation of Mandela as a timely decision on the part of the
regional leaders," the spokesman said. "He joined in their call on
all the Burundi parties to extend maximum cooperation to the new
Facilitator towards the successful and urged conclusion of the
peace negotiation."
</P>
<P>
Annan also reiterated his view that "there is no alternative to
a negotiated settlement to the Burundi conflict," and pledged the
United Nation's full support for the new Facilitator, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 81, replaced Nyerere, the former Tanzanian president
who died in October after trying painstaking effort to promote the
peace process in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in six years
of civil war in Burundi between Hutu rebels and the government led
by minority ethnic Tutsis. Burundi's civil war began in 1993 when
Tutsi troops murdered the first democratically elected Hutu
president, sparking a series of massacres of both Hutus and Tutsis
in a precursor to the Rwandan genocide.

<HEADLINE> Five Million Nigerians to be Infected by AIDS in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- As Nigerians joined the rest of
the world to mark the 12th World AIDS Day on Wednesday, they were
startled by the fact that the killer disease was spreading at a
rate of one person per minute in their country.
</P>
<P>
Drawing a dismal picture, the country's Health Minister Tim
Menakaya said at a special event to mark the day in the country's
capital Abuja that by the end of 1999, "over half a million new
infections would have occurred, " while some 4.9 million people
are expected to be afflicted with the virus by 2003.
</P>
<P>
From an unknown disease a few years ago, AIDS has risen right
to the top of Nigerian health agenda, the minister said. A recent
survey shows that the first AIDS patient in the country was found
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Nigeria, the country with the largest
population in Africa, is also said to have more than 600,000 AIDS
orphans, a quarter of whom have died for lack of care.
</P>
<P>
The overall national average of prevalence increased from 1.8
percent in 1990 to 3.8 percent in 1993, 4.5 percent in 1995 and
5.4 percent in 1999, with women in their early 20's having the
highest level of infection.
</P>
<P>
Although Nigeria is still less severely affected by the
epidemic than eastern and southern African countries, its
population of more than 108 million means that it already has more
people infected with the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
"This is bound to have a major socio-economic impact on
Nigerian society, including reduced life expectancy, increased
burden of medical care, increase in the number of orphans and
decline in economic growth," according to a report on the
country's AIDS situation.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still hope if relevant intervention programs
could be strengthened through a strong national commitment,
political will and the support of development partners, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Dwelling on a worldwide theme of the World AIDS Day "learn and
live! World AIDS campaign with children and young people," the
Nigerian government called on its citizens Wednesday to join the
fight against the pandemic with renewed focus on the fate of
children, the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo and his administration have pledged
more support for an anti-AIDS drive for which the government has
increased its budgetary allocation for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The president has promised to make the fight against AIDS a
priority despite his other challenges in ending murderous ethnic
conflicts and reviving a moribund economy.
</P>
<P>
"President Obasanjo said that he was determined to personally
lead the national war against the scourge," a statement from the
presidency said on Wednesday, adding that a comprehensive program
would soon be put in place.
</P>
<P>
A report from the United Nations, used as a global index of the
disease, estimated that a cumulative total of 13 million children,
most of them in Africa, would have lost their mothers or both
parents to AIDS by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The disease has reportedly killed more than 16 million people
worldwide, 2.2 million of them in Africa.

<P>
NEW YORK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Index of
Leading Economic Indicators in the United States remained flat in
October, The Conference Board, the prominent research group, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a report that the index was 107.9

"The flatness in the leading economic series is especially

activity," said Conference Board Economist Ken Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
"It was thought that with trade conditions improving, the
manufacturing sector would finally start strengthening. Weak trade
conditions had been a milestone around the manufacturing sector
ever since the 'Asia Flu' developed. But foreign economies now
seem to be recovering. The October decline in orders may not be
the result of lags between foreign recoveries and nay subsequent
ordering."
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said "if this is the case, more orders early in 2000
may strengthen the leading economic indicators in the same way
that declines flattened the series in September and October."
</P>
<P>
The report said, five of the ten indicators that make up the
leading index rose in October. The most significant increases are
building permits and interest rate spread. The most significant
negative contributors to the composite leading index in October
are manufacturers' new orders of consumer goods and materials and
consumer expectations, it added.
</P>
<P>
The indicator serves as a barometer of U.S. economic trends up
to six months in the future.

<HEADLINE> EU Gives Green Light to PVC Toy Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) member
states unanimously gave the green light Wednesday to a precedent
setting EU-wide emergency ban on soft PVC teething toys.
</P>
<P>
The EU emergency ban, proposed by the European Commission,
includes new products ordered by retailers. The Commission, the EU
executive branch, said that the products on the shelves are "
liable to present a serious and immediate risk to health."
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Product Safety Emergencies, comprised of
officials from all 15 EU member states, unanimously supported the
Commission's proposal to ban six toxic softeners found in soft PVC
toys marketed for teething.
</P>
<P>
The ban, first debated in May 1998, is the first emergency
product ban in the European Union. Now the European Commission can
formally adopt the decision at its meeting next week. Then the EU
member states have to take all necessary measures to implement the
decision within less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greenpeace warned consumers that shopkeepers are not
obliged to remove banned products from the shelves, and that the
ban does not cover all soft PVC toys for children under three.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency ban confirms what Greepeace has been saying for
more than two years - that soft PVC toys are dangerous to the
health of small children," said Axel Singhofen, Greenpeace EU
Adviser, in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"But as a result of the narrow scope of this ban, and the lack
of a mandatory market withdrawal of banned toys, consumers are now
faced with chaos, unable to tell whether the toys they are buying
are PVC with toxic softeners or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
"An immediate market withdrawal of all soft PVC toys and
childcare articles for children under three is the only way that
babies in Europe can be protected from a new round of hazardous
Christmas presents," Singhofen said. "And it is the only way that
retailers can regain their reputation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Announces Sovereign Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua President Arnold
Aleman on Wednesday announced that his country will apply a 30
percent sovereign tax on imports from Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua made the decision to protest the ratification of a
maritime treaty singed between Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Honduras congress on Tuesday night unanimously ratified the
treaty signed with Colombia in 1986. Honduras also announced it
was moving 2,000 troops to areas near the Nicaraguan border to
prevent timber smuggling. Honduras denied the two moves were
related.
</P>
<P>
In the treaty, Bogota recognizes that Honduras' sea border with
Nicaragua is parallel 15, while Managua considers that its limits
in this zone are on parallel 17.
</P>
<P>
Between these two parallels are about 30,000 square kilometers
Nicaragua holds it will loss under the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua also claims rights over islands east to the 78th
meridian. Colombia claims its own rights extend west to the 82nd
meridian, based on a 1928 treaty which Nicaragua claims was forced
upon it by a U.S. occupation force at the time.
</P>
<P>
"The treaty in question damages Nicaragua and intends to
deliver or recognize Nicaraguan territory to third counties", said
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre on Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Aleman also ordered to close border to Honduras' Port
Cortes, where has been used many Nicaraguan firms as export exits.
</P>
<P>
But Aleman ruled out the possibility of military actions in the
case.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeking Support for U.N. Draft Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said Wednesday that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would be
trying to muster support for a U.N. draft resolution aimed at
getting weapons inspectors into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect that Secretary Albright will have a number of
conversations in the coming days on this resolution, including
with the French foreign minister, the Russian foreign minister,
the British foreign minister and others," spokesman James Rubin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has stopped any weapons
inspections in his country since the United States and Britain
launched air strikes against his country last December.
</P>
<P>
Washington has tried many ways in vain to re-enter the country
under the name of weapons inspections, and the draft resolution is
the latest.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz repeated Iraq's objections to
the draft resolution during his visit to Russia recently.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated Iraq's objections to a short extension of a U.
N. oil-for-food program meant as an interim measure until a
broader resolution on lifting sanctions against Iraq is agreed.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise On Slower Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
Wednesday as the latest reports indicated that the U.S. economic
growth is continuing at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 120.58 at 10,998.39,
diminishing its losses of 130.36 points in the previous three
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index rose 8.81 at 1,397.72 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 17.55 at 3,353.71.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose as the Conference Board reported that its
Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators remained flat in
October, staying at 107.9, the same as in the previous, while the
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of
manufacturing activity dropped from 56.6 in October to 56.2 in
November.
</P>
<P>
The two reports showed signs that the tightening monetary
policy of the Federal Reserve may be working. The Federal Reserve
has raised interest rates three times this year in an effort to
cool off the economy.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.59 at 634.77 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 1.77 at 834.58. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 0.41 at 453.67.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,708 down, 1,407 up and 427
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 881.52 million shares from 966.56
