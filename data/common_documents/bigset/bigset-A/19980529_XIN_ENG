<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Confident of Overcoming Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Thursday stated that Russia's financial potential is strong enough
to prevent the country's economy from crashing.
</P>
<P>
The ITAR-TASS news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying the Central
Bank of Russia and the Finance Ministry "have enough reserve
means" to keep control the currency markets.
</P>
<P>
The president met with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin
in the Kremlin on Thursday to discuss the state of the domestic
financial market.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin emphasized that the government must rigidly cutback in
budget spending and improve tax collection from individuals and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Russia's rich, in particular, were not used
to paying taxes, and they must be forced to do so.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Kiriyenko said that Yeltsin fully supported
the program of action to stabilize the situation in the financial
market.
</P>
<P>
The premier believed that the main cause of the current crisis
was the failure to limit the expenditure of the state within
revenues. "This results in debts to the budget and 'a debt of
confidence'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dubinin said after the meeting that the Central Bank was
confident of its grip on the troubled market.
</P>
<P>
In Zadornov's opinion, the key result of the meeting had been a
"political backing" to the cabinet's moves to boost tax collection
and trim spending.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Urges Clinton to Press Sinn Fein on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Protestant
Unionist leader David Trimble said Thursday that he has urged U.S.
President Bill Clinton to pressure Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
over IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"There is no support or justification for Sinn Fein/IRA
retaining their weaponry," said Trimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party, the largest pro-British party in the province.
</P>
<P>
He said he asked Clinton to raise the issue with Adams when the
two men meet in Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
Adams flew to the United States Wednesday to raise funds for
his Sinn Fein party, the political wing of the IRA (Irish
Republican Army), and meet Clinton on the Northern Irish peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said it was time for Sinn Fein to declare the 30-year
conflict over and for the IRA to hand in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
"There is no mandate for violence from any quarter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he held a telephone conversation with Clinton last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I drew this (disarmament) issue to his attention by saying
that the time has come for Mr Adams to deliver," he told reporters
in Belfast, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
"I specifically asked the president to raise this issue with Mr
Adams and he has undertaken to do so. The pressure will be
maintained on Sinn Fein/IRA," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the recently endorsed peace agreement, all the
paramilitary groups in the province must start to hand over
weapons next month and complete decommissioning by May 2000.

<HEADLINE> Canada Approves Three-Minute HIV Test Kit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada has approved a new high-speed
HIV test which could change the way people find out if they have
the virus, said reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The test, announced Wednesday by the Halifax-based developer
MediMira Laboratories, has received approval for use only in
Canadian laboratories.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, it can't be sold over the counter at pharmacies
or be used in clinics or doctors' offices in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the procedure, which produces results in less than three
minutes, could be expanded to clinics across the country in the
near future, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The test works by placing a small amount of blood or blood
serum on a tray and waiting about two minutes to see whether it
produces a red dot, indicating a positive reading, or a clear
circle, a negative result.
</P>
<P>
It will "become an extremely useful tool in the struggle to
arrest the HIV epidemic," Doug Simpson of MediMira was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The test, smaller and a quarter of the cost of the current
ones, is expected to make the most difference in developing
countries, where people have to travel long distances to get
tested.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Begins Manufacturing Aircraft Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Hyundai Group Thursday
inaugurated an aircraft and parts manufacturing complex in Sosan.
</P>
<P>
The 777,640 square-meter Hyundai Space &AMP; Aircraft complex
consists of an assembly plant for wings, an aircraft parts
fabrication plant and a transmission plant.
</P>
<P>
The complex was completed two years and three months after
construction started in 1994, at a cost of 600 billion won (428
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The assembly plant for wings, the largest in Asia, will produce
parts for military planes and gas turbine engines, as well as for
civilian airplanes.
</P>
<P>
"Bearing in mind that our country's competitiveness depends
entirely on its high-tech industries, we have been investing in
the aerospace industry since 1994," Hyundai Group Chairman Chung
Mong-koo said at the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Acting Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, Commerce,
Industry and Energy Minister Park Tae-young and Boeing Company's
Vice-President J. Phillips attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Chung said it was an honor to take the first step into the
high-technology aerospace industry in partnership with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
To highlight the complex's inauguration, Hyundai delivered a
wing for a Boeing 717-200 airplane to the U.S.-based Boeing Co.,
the world's largest airplane manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The 6,196-kilogram wing, which was 28.44 meters long, was
developed jointly by Hyundai and Boeing under a contract signed in
1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Records 4.8 Pct Growth in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy expanded at a
robust 4.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year,
the Commerce Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted growth in the gross domestic product
during the first quarter was even better than last month's advance
estimate of 4.2 percent, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the GDP growth was a record increase in the
inventories of unsold goods held on shelves and backlog. Without
it, the economy would have grown at a still strong 3.4 percent
rate during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The inventory increase could be a sign of trouble for the
current quarter and beyond, particularly if consumer spending
moderates from the first quarter's 6.1 percent rate, strongest in
six years, and imports of foreign goods continue their rapid
advance.
</P>
<P>
Corporate profits, after taxes, fell 2.2 percent from the
previous quarter. That came on top of a 2.3 percent drop in the
fourth quarter, worst in nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to consumer spending, growth in the first quarter
was driven by a 27.5 percent rise in business investment in new
equipment, much of it computers. That was the largest gain in
nearly 14 years.
</P>
<P>
A housing boom, spurred by low mortgage rates, also contributed
to the growth. Spending on residential construction soared at a
16.1 percent annual rate, best in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
However, there were a deterioration in the trade balance during
the quarter, a decline in government spending, particularly for
military goods and a drop in commercial construction.
</P>
<P>
Imports surged at a 17.7 percent annual rate in the first
quarter while exports fell at a 3 percent rate, the worst in less
than three years.
</P>
<P>
Some economists expect this Asia-linked deterioration in trade
will moderate U.S. economic growth to a level that can be
sustained without inflation. They expect the GDP to advance at
around a 2.3 percent annual rate for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
That's because computers and other efficiency-enhancing
equipment have helped businesses keep a lid on prices even though
labor shortages have forced them to increase wages at a faster
rate than before. A price measure linked to the GDP rose at a
scant 1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the smallest in
35 years.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Labor Department said Thursday the number of
applications for unemployment benefits declined by 2,000 last week
to 312,000. That's a level signaling strong demand for labor.

KATHMANDU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were detained
Thursday for protesting against the visit by Indian President K.R.
Narayanan, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The activists of the Human Rights and Peace Society and the
United People's Front were detained by the police when they
demonstrated along some parts of the route where the Indian
president was driven toward the Royal Palace, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
President Narayanan arrived here Thursday for a three-day state
visit at the invitation of Nepali King Birendra.

western Nepal, the encroachment of the Nepalese land be stopped,
and the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Nepal and
India be reviewed in the changed context.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Romania to Relaunch Dwellings Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The relaunch of dwellings
construction is considered to be extremely necessary due to the
crisis in the field, but it will become a reality only after the
National Agency for Dwellings begins functioning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works and Territorial Planning Nicolae Noica
has made the statement, reported the local daily Nine O'Clock
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Agency for Dwellings, set up last week according
to a law project adopted by the government, is to provide
financial resources and a series of facilities to those who want
to build dwellings.
</P>
<P>
The main financial resource for dwellings constructions will be
issuing state guaranteed bonds which shall be transacted on the
secondary market. At the same time, the agency will grant low
interest credits, affordable to most Romanians.
</P>
<P>
The facilities granted by the agency for dwellings construction
include credits with interest lower that the interbanking rate,
access to construction sites and tax exemption for young people
who want to build a dwelling.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement made by the minister, the National
Agency for Dwellings will start functioning only in 1999 and will
make available the first dwellings in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
Noica also stated that the agency has opened offers related to
the international auction organized for obtaining a 340 million
dollar fund guaranteed by the government. The agency has received
so far offers from companies in Israel, Italy, Spain and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Over Clinton's Report on Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has made representations to
the U.S. regarding a report U.S. President Bill Clinton had
submitted to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the five U.S. citizens missing since the 1974
Turkish invasion in Cyprus, Clinton expressed the wish that "this
report will serve as a catalyst for progress on other cases of
Greek and Turkish Cypriot persons missing as a result of
intercommunal strife."
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said Thursday at his
press briefing that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had made
representations, especially regarding the phrase "intercommunal
strife."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has said that a total of 1,619 Greek
Cypriots including five U.S. citizens of Greek descent, were
listed as missing persons as a result of Turkish invasion in
1974.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks were taken as echoing the Turkish Cypriot
claims that it was since the intercommunal clashes in 1963 that
there have been many persons missing including around 800 Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's report also presumed that "all five are dead." The
remains of one of the five have been identified via a DNA method,
but the location of the other four has not yet been established.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said Monday that "we do not accept to consider any
missing person dead unless scientific convincing evidence is
provided about his identity."
</P>
<P>
Hopes to resolve the island's humanitarian issue were revived
last July when President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash agreed to exchange information on graves,
exhume remains and establish their identity through scientific
means.
</P>
<P>
Files relating to the whereabouts of some 400 Greek Cypriots of
the 1,619 missing and 200 of the 803 Turkish Cypriots missing were
exchanged between the two sides at a meeting in January in line
with the July agreement.

JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the Slovak
Republic Thursday signed an agreement on the avoidance of double
taxation as well as an agreement on arts and culture, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo and his Slovak counterpart, Zdenka Kramplova.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said that he had discussed a number of issues with

<P>
Kramplova said that the two had very close views on the reform
of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is trying to secure a permanent seat on a
reformed U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
South Africa recently closed its mission in the Slovak
Republic, one of 10 to be shut down as a result of budget cuts,
and its ambassador to Vienna has since become accredited there.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said that his move had no bearing on the relationship
between the two countries, which was very good.

<P>
BORDEAUX, FRANCE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met here Thursday with former
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Juppe, who served as prime minister from May 1995 to June 1997
under President Jacques Chirac, is the mayor of the southwest
French port city.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he was happy to visit Bordeaux and meet with Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled that Juppe, whom he called an old friend of the
Chinese people, had visited China twice in 1991 and 1994 as leader
of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Li praised Juppe for having made active efforts in pushing
forward friendly relations between the two countries, as well as
in cooperation in the political, economic, trade, culture, and
scientific and technological fields.
</P>
<P>
Li said that as Bordeaux was competitive in many industrial
sectors, it had a big potential for cooperation with Chinese
cities and provinces.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that mutual efforts and cooperation
between Chinese enterprises and those of Bordeaux could bear more
fruit.
</P>
<P>
Juppe welcomed Li and said that Bordeaux has many cooperative
programs with the Chinese city Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said that he personally attached great importance to
developing relations with China and that he would like to continue
to make efforts in pushing forward bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Bordeaux by train Wednesday evening after ending
a four-day visit to Paris.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians' Support for Peace Process Declines: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians who are
optimistic about or support the Middle East peace process have
decreased, an opinion poll conducted by a Palestinian media
service said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll carried out by the Jerusalem-based JMCC
on May 21-22, although most of the Palestinians surveyed remain
optimists of the peace process, the proportion has dropped to 65.6
percent from 72.4 percent in JMCC's another poll in November.
</P>
<P>
The number of Palestinians who support the peace process fell
by 10.5 percentage points to 63.7 percent from the November poll,
the latest poll said.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has
suffered a setback in the approval rate with 38.7 percent of the
surveyed being confident in him, 7.7 percentage points lower than
that in the November poll.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who trust the Fatah, the most popular
movement among the Palestinians, and the Hamas also declined
respectively by 8 and 4 percentage points compared to those in the
November poll.
</P>
<P>
In the recent poll, some 32.9 percent of the surveyed had
confidence in the Fatah, and 13.3 percent in the Hamas.
</P>
<P>
This has reflected that the Palestinians do not trust any
political or religious factions or figures, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,208 Palestinians over 18 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
were surveyed in the opinion poll.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Strike Heavy Blow to S.Korea's Ailing Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide labor strike to protest
against mass lay-offs, which began Wednesday with an estimated
120,000 workers, is likely to deal a heavy blow to South Korea's
ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai Motor Co. and 54 other manufacturers, whose workers
joined the strike, are facing daily losses of around 250 billion
won (about 178.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The industrial action comes on top of a sharp drop in the
nation's credit standing in the international financial market and
other invisible losses.
</P>
<P>
To add to the government's worries, the strike will possibly
scare away foreign investment, thus delaying economic
restructuring, a condition tied to the International Monetary
Fund's 57 billion dollar loan after the country plunged into
financial crisis late last year.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign banks have reportedly notified their South Korean
borrowers that they will call in all maturing debts due to the
growing economic instability caused by labor walkouts.
</P>
<P>
"The current strike shows the beginning of more
labor-management troubles," said Seoul-based Canadian business
representative Frances Lee Smith. "Far more worrisome to
foreigners are expected delays in the restructuring of (South)
Korea's debt-ridden conglomerates. As a result of delayed
restructuring, foreign investors will stop heading to (South)
Korea."
</P>
<P>
Despite rising fears at home and abroad over the strike, the
Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, sponsor of the strike, has
said the walkout will proceed on Friday, and nationwide strikes
will continue from June 3 through 10 until mass layoffs are
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Kim Dae-jung and business leaders fear a
further blow will be dealt by the devaluation of the Japanese yen,
which comes at a time when South Korea concentrates on exporting
its way out of the financial woes.
</P>
<P>
The yen plunged to 137 against the dollar in Tokyo on Monday
for the first time since August 1991.
</P>
<P>
The country's major exports, such as electronics,
semiconductors, steel, automobiles and petrochemical products,
face fierce competition of Japanese goods.
</P>
<P>
A devalued Japanese yen will inevitably lead to weakened price
competitiveness of South Korean products in global markets.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea said the nation would see a loss of 1.5
billion dollars in trade annually with the Japanese yen
maintaining 140 against the Greenback.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Speaker on Palestinian-Israeli Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Parliament Speaker Ahmed
Fathi Sorour said that the conflict between Palestine and Israel
is not a regional one because any explosion in the region would
destabilize the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here Thursday before wrapping up a
several-day visit, Sorour said that this was the reason for
concern for many countries outside the region over the tense
situation caused by Israel's uncompromising policies and its
disrespect for the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the European efforts to push forward the
Middle East peace process emanate originally from the desire of
the European countries to serve their own interests through
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of holding an Arab summit to
discuss the peace process the Egyptian parliament speaker said the
matter was subject to further consultation among the Arab leaders
on various conditions.

<HEADLINE> CompuServe Manager Convicted in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Top manager of a German on-line
computer service company on Thursday received a suspended two-year
jail sentence by a local court in Munich for failing to block its
customers from reaching illegal contents on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
After a controversial trial that last more than two years, the
Munich district court ruled Thursday that Felix Somm, general
manager of the CompuServe Deutschland, was found guilty of
collaborating in the distribution of child pornography and
neo-Nazi material.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was unprecedented because it was the first time that a
commercial on-line service provider such as CompuServe was held
responsible for illegal information provided over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors had backed down from their earlier charges
and called on the judge to acquit Somm because they believed that
CompuServe had no practical ways to filter the illegal information
out of its services in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Somm's own attorney, Ulrich Sieber, also accused the court of
ignoring the fact that it was impossible to censor Internet material
that was also illegal under German law.
</P>
<P>
The more sensible way to deal with the issue would be the
international coordination to track down those who posted the
material, he said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: China, U.S. Share Common Intersets in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States share
common interests in wide-ranging areas, and should increase
dialogues, reduce differences and broaden cooperation between
them, a renowned U.S. scholar said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Ezra F. Vogel, director
of the Fairbank Center for East Asian Rearch in Harvard
University, said there had been ups and downs in the development
of the Sino-U.S. relations since the early 1970s, but they were
generally moving forward.
</P>
<P>
Vogel, who organized and chaired the lecture given by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at Harvard University last October during
Jiang's state visit to the United States, has devoted himself to
the research on East Asia and China since the early 1950s and is
highly respected by the U.S. Administration and many American
think-tanks for his research.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed at his home at Harvard University, Vogel said China
and the United States were the major nations in the world with
different political, social and economic systems as well as
different values.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have witnessed difficulties in developing
their relations, said Vogel. History showed that to improve the
relations, the two countries still had a long way to go, and the
existing issues could only be solved by gradual, patient and
persistent efforts by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Vogel said U.S. President Bill Clinton's forthcoming visit to
China would be the first by a U.S. president in nine years, a move
seen as a substantive step towards improving the
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States formally announced the
establishment of the constructive strategic partnership to face
the 21st century when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the
United Nations last October. It determined the framework for
developing bilateral relations, said Vogel, adding that what was
essential was to invigorate the framework.
</P>
<P>
Looking at Sino-U.S. relations in the next century, Vogel said
the two countries shared numerous common interests in many areas,
including creating a permanent secure atmosphere in East Asia,
maintaining peace and stability on Korean Peninsular, opposing the
revival of Japan's militarism, preventing the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, maintaining the normal world trade
pattern, promoting world peace and security, and cracking down on
drug-related crimes and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Vogel pointed out there had been many groundless and one-sided
predictions about China's future, one of which said China would
become a superpower that could match with the United States in 30
to 40 years, thus posing a threat to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Vogel said any predictions about China should be objective and
reflect the current development of China's economy, technology and
industry, which are still weak compared with those of the
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
While China enjoys rapid development in these areas, other
countries, including the United States, Japan and the Western
European countries were also progressing, Vogel added.
</P>
<P>
There will inevitably be competition between China and the
United States or among other countries in terms of development,
which unnecessarily leads conflict, Vogel said.
</P>
<P>
With China's continuing opening to the outside world, the
United States and China shared considerable common interests,
which contribute not only to the promotion of the Sino-U.S.
relations, but also to the development of relations between China
and other countries as well as peace and prosperity throughout the
world, Vogel stressed.
</P>
<P>
After years of policy adjustments, the Clinton administration's
policy towards China has almost formed, leading to a significant
change in Americans' views about China, said Vogel.
</P>
<P>
Although the Clinton Administration may come across
difficulties and resistance in handling issues concerning
bilateral relations, its basic policy towards China would remain
unchanged, Vogel predicted.
</P>
<P>
Vogel said that Clinton's forthcoming visit to China would set
the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations and the promotion of
cooperation between the two countries as priorities of America's
foreign policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain Richard
will pay an official visit to Chile Friday, which is mainly aimed
at persuading Chile to buy the French Mirage 2000-5 combat
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the French Defense Ministry said Thursday that this
is the first visit by a French defense minister to Chile since the
return of democracy in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
But more importantly, France is competing with the United
States and Sweden in trying to sign a 600 million U.S. dollar
contract on a combat aircraft deal with Chile's air force.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be raised by Richard during his talks with
Chilean President Eduardo Frei and Defense Minister Raul Troncoso
Castillo.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government will choose among the F-16 and F/A-18
combat aircraft of the United States, the Mirage 2000-5 of France
and the JAS 39 of Sweden to rearm its air force.
</P>
<P>
The French aircraft-maker Dassault presented its newest Mirage
war planes at the air show in Santiago last March, while a
squadron of the French air force went to Chile to have a joint
military exercise with the Chilean air force.

UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations Thursday called upon the parties in Georgia to show
political will and try to solve differences between them through
dialogues.

ATHENS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Greeks begin smoking at the average
age of 13.5, but most of them still agree with a ban on tobacco
advertising, according to a survey released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Greek Cardiology Center

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Nuke Tests Draw International Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Some countries or international
organizations expressed concerns after Pakistan exploded five
nuclear devices on Thursday in response to the nuclear tests
carried out by India on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday
he deplores both the Indian and the Pakistani nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"They (India and Pakistan) exacerbate tension in an already
difficult relations," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Annan's statement came after Pakistan announced it has
conducted five nuclear explosions at 3:30 pm. local time (1030
GMT) Thursday in Chagai area in the southwestern province of
Baluchistan.
</P>

Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and a no-first-use pledge
with each other.
</P>
<P>

Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), said the alliance would urge
India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint and to respect
the international non-proliferation norms and the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Solana said the NATO does not consider sanctions against the
nuclear testers.

Pakistan would not "dramatically" affect the thinking of the new
strategic concept of the alliance.

televised statement Thursday that the United States would impose
sanctions on Pakistan as it did on India.
</P>

<HEADLINE> FSA Issues Guidance on Investment Advertisements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Services Authority
(FSA) Thursday issued guidance on investment advertisements on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The guidance concerns advertisements from overseas on Internet
sites which may be accessed by UK investors even though the
advertisements are not targeted at them.
</P>
<P>
The FSA hopes that the guidance will enable financial services
companies overseas to comply with UK regulation, and therefore
minimize the likelihood of FSA enforcement action in this area.
</P>
<P>
The Internet enables UK investors to access investment
advertisements put onto the World Wide Web from anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that while this increases the amount of
information available to UK investors, it also carries the risk
that the provisions in the Financial Services Act (FS Act), which
are designed to protect investors from misleading or inaccurate
information, might be evaded.
</P>
<P>
The protection is the requirement that an investment
advertisement in the UK is issued by an authorized person or
approved by such a person. Breach of this provision is a criminal
offense.
</P>
<P>
The FSA does not have the power to amend the FS Act but does
have discretion as to when and how it uses its enforcement powers.
</P>
<P>
The guidance expands on the FSA's enforecement approach towards
possible breaches of this provision in the FS Act.

<HEADLINE> MCI Sells Internet Unit to British Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- MCI Communications Inc., the
second largest telecommunication provider in the U.S., announced
Thursday that it is selling its Internet business to Britain's
Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC for 625 million U.S. dollars in a cash deal.
</P>
<P>
This move is made to clear the way for its pending merger to
WorldCom Inc. of the U.S., analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The sale comes amid intense scrutiny of the proposed 37 billion
U.S. dollar merger between MCI and WorldCom. European and U.S.
officials fear that the merger would concentrate too much control
of the Internet in the combined company's hands. The two companies
hope to complete their merger sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
WorldCom's UUNet Technologies division is the top provider of
high-speed Internet hook-ups through a global computer that makes
up the "backbone" of Internet communication. MCI, an early entrant
into the Internet business, is number two. Selling MCI's Internet
backbone would eliminate an overlap with WorldCom's Internet
business, thus making it easier to get the approval of the
government.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, Cable &AMP; Wireless will take
control of MCI's contracts with Internet Service Providers, but
MCI's residential and non-ISP customers are not affected.

NATO and Russia Thursday issued a joint statement condemning
the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan. The statement
urged the two countries "to refrain from further tests and the
deployment of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles, in order to
prevent the escalation of tensions and a nuclear arms race."
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia considered it an increasingly urgent matter
that India and Pakistan should adhere unconditionally to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and
enter into negotiations on a global treaty to stop the production
of fissile material for nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Air France Cancels Most Flights in Early June Due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- France's national carrier Air France
Thursday decided to cancel 75-90 percent of its flights in early
June because of a threat by the company's pilots unions to stage
a strike at that time.
</P>
<P>
If the management of Air France and unions of pilots fail to
reach a compromise this weekend, the country's air traffic during
the France 1998 Football World Cup finals, which will be held from
June 10 to July 12 in 10 French cities, will be greatly disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot has been trying to
mediate a deal between the leadership of Air France and its
employees, engaged in a dispute over a 15 percent reduction of
salaries in exchange for the company's stocks, and a 500 million
franc (80 million U.S. dollar) cut in the payroll.
</P>
<P>
He called on both sides of the dispute to take up
responsibility to avoid a stoppage of the flights, only two weeks
from the opening of the World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Set Up Ad Hoc Group on Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday decided to set up an ad hoc working group to review all
recommendations by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on peace and
reconstruction in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously, the council also expressed
its intention to convene at the ministerial level on a biennial
basis, beginning September 1998 to assess progress in promoting
peace in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Comprising all 15 members of the council, the group would work
for a period of six months with tasks to prepare a framework for
the implementation of Annan's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief submitted a report to the council on April 13,
in which he dealt with the causes of African conflict and the ways
to promote durable peace and sustainable development in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Issues such as arms and arms trafficking, refugees, structural
adjustment, development assistance, debt and trade are tackled.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged that international donors provide new funding
resources for Africa, and that creditors convert into grants all
remaining official bilateral debt of the poorest African nations
and consider clearing their entire debt stock.
</P>
<P>
He also asked African governments to reduce arms purchases to
1.5 percent of the grass domestic product and maintain zero growth
of defense budgets for the next decade.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Nullifies Nazi Court Rulings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament Thursday adopted
a law to nullify all Nazi-era court rulings that were based on
political, military, racial or religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, up to 500,000 rulings made by German courts
during the 1933-1945 Nazi era would be quashed without individual
examinations.
</P>
<P>
"These are sham trials which only served to impose the will of
the Nazis," said Norbert Geis, a legal expert of German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.
</P>
<P>
According to Geis, German Nazis had imposed about 2,000 laws
alone aimed at discriminating against Jews. The number of crimes
that could face death penalty had also been raised by Nazis from
two in 1933 to 46 by 1945.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denounces Turkish Violation of Territorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Thursday strongly denounced
Turkey for its military incursion into northern Iraq and violation
of Iraq's airspace and territorial integration, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said on customary condition
of anonymity that Iraq categorically rejects the pretexts of
Turkey to justify its military operations in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Turkey has repeatly taken military actions in
northern Iraq in a bid to wipe out the rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party seeking shelters there after Iraqi
government was rendered ineffective in controlling the area in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish group has been fighting a war against the Turkish
government since 1984 for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that Turkey's claim to crack down on
opposition elements does not warrant its violation of Iraq's
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman criticized Turkey for allowing the United States
and Britain to use its territory as a base to enforce a no-fly
zone in northern Iraq, blocking the reinstatement of Iraq's
national authority.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and France imposed a no-fly zone in northern
Iraq to protect the Kurdish people in the region from the
government's suppression after the 1991 Gulf War which drove Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait. France later withdrew from the operation.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish policy has inflicted harm not only upon the Iraqi
people in the north, but rather upon Turkey as well, having
aggravated the Kurdish problem inside Turkey itself," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Turkey to immediately withdraw its troops from northern
Iraq and stop such acts, which he described as contradictory to
the United Nations Charter and principles of international law as
well as good neighborliness.

JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Lewotho's Deputy Premier
Pakalitha Mosisili was approved as new prime minister by
parliament Thursday after ailing Premier Ntsu Mokhehle resigned
at the same day, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili, head of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy
(LCD), was unanimously elected prime minister by the party caucus
in the capital of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Mokhehle's special advisor, Thom Thabane, as
saying that Mokhehle had notified King Letsie III of his
resignation in a letter. The king was informed of Mosisili's
election and had accepted it.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle's resignation paved the way for the swearing-in of
Mosisili Friday.
</P>
<P>
The LCD swept up 78 of the 79 parliamentary seats contested.
The remaining seat, a mountain constituency, was won by the
strong opposition Basotho National Party.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Most Popular politician in S. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is still the most popular politician in the
country, a major opinion poll agency in South Africa said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leader of the Democratic Party (DP), a white-base
opposition party, Tony Leon, leads the popularity stakes among
white South Africans, the latest Markinor poll showed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who previously was considered the most popular
politician by white South Africans, was outrun by Leon, who was
included in the survey for the first time, Markinor said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, United Democratic
Movement (UDM) co-leader Bantu Holomisa and Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) leader Stanley Mogoba, all black politicians, were
the top four in the popularity poll in May, as they did in last
November's poll.
</P>
<P>
They were followed by UDM co-leader Roelf Meyer, Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosothu Buthelezi and Leon.
</P>
<P>
Marthinus van Schalkwyk,, leader of the National Party (NP),
the biggest opposition party, was ranked the eighth popular
politician.
</P>
<P>
The NP leader has come under fire from within the party for
his "weak leadership" after the party suffered a string of
humiliating by-election defeats this month.
</P>
<P>
Among black South Africans, Leon was rated second to the last,
with Van Schalkwyk and Meyer to be more popular. Freedom Front
(FF) leader Constand Viljoen was the least popular.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Troops to Participate in Military Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 250 soldiers will
leave for Kenya Saturday to participate in a month-long joint
military exercise, a top Tanzanian army officer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of the Tanzania People's Defense Forces
Lieutenant General Gideon Sayore told the soldiers during a
send-off briefing Thursday that they should display high
discipline and behave like the true envoys of the country.
</P>
<P>
The military games, which will also involve a contingent of
Ugandan troops, will be the first since the collapse of the East
African Community in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Talking to them at the Nadosoito Preparatory Camp, Lieutenant
General Sayore said that the joint exercise is an important step
toward regional integration, according to a news dispatch from
north Tanzania's Arusha town Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The army is crucial to east African integration and
development and the joint exercise heralds a new chapter in the
East African Cooperation," Sayore said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint exercise is geared toward consolidating
solidarity and trust and maintaining peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the presidents of Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda met in Arusha to ask donors to assist in building a
multi-billion-U.S.-Dollar road network for regional integration.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urged Not to Sell Missiles to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
urged Italy Thursday not to sell Aspide missiles to Cyprus, saying
this would increase tensions in the island country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Italian weekly Borghese in northern
Cyprus, Denktash said that the escalation of tension in the
eastern Mediterranean island would also harm the interests of
Italy itself, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal signed in 1996 between Cyprus and Italian company
Alenia, Aspide missiles will be delivered to the Cypriot
government in the upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government, however, has reportedly suspended the
delivery of the missiles until an undetermined date for fear of
angering Turkish Cypriots and its supporter Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Denktash stressed that Rome should take measures to block the
implementation of the missile deal in order not to make the
situation on the divided island more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a so-called
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was only recognized
by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
At present, Turkey and Greece, two rival neighbors, station
massive troops on the tiny Mediterranean island.

<P>
Stressing that a chain is as strong as its weakest link,

responsibility to solidify their relations if the continent is to
move into the next millenium with confidence and hope.
</P>
<P>
Abacha made the comment Wednesday in Abuja while receiving

problems, but also a veritable medium to plan for the development
and growth of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Shawki, who brought a message from President Liamine Zeroual,
commended the leadership role of Abacha in African affairs,
citing Nigeria's role in restoring peace in Liberia and democracy
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Shawki said Algeria is looking forward to the forthcoming OAU
summit in Burkina Faso, which is the last but one in this
millenium.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Announces Plan under Oil-for-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Thursday it is to
increase food imports by nearly 40 percent under the fourth phase
of the oil-for-food program to 1.26 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mahdi Saleh
at a press conference on the distribution plan for the next
six-month period of the Iraqi-U.N. deal starting early June.
</P>
<P>
The money allocated for food imports accounts for more than one
third of the expected total of 3 billion dollars in oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
In the previous three phases of the program that takes
exception of the U.N. sanctions imposed for Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, Baghdad was allowed to sell 2 billion dollars
worth of oil to buy food and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
In February, the U.N. Security Council voted to raise Iraq's
oil export ceiling to 5.2 billion dollars in six months. Baghdad,
however, said it was unable to produce that amount because of its
dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
It finally settled for 3 billion dollars of oil sale to buy
more food, medicine and other goods for its 22 million people
suffering from the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said the 1.26 billion allocation is expected to bring
protein for the first time in eight years to people's food
rations.
</P>
<P>
The health sector will get a boost with 300 million dollars
being earmarked, an increase of 50 percent. Other items are: 210
million for water and sanitation, 250 million for agriculture, 100
million for education and 153.5 million for transport and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 3 billion dollars will go to funds for the Gulf
War compensation and the costs of U.N. arms inspections and other
humanitarian projects in Iraq, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
He addressed U.N. concerns over the big allocation for
transport and telecommunications, saying that the sector needs
more funding to meet people's demand and alleviate their
sufferings. He hoped the distribution plan will be approved.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iraq's firm position in rejecting an American
proposal to expand the period of the oil-for-food deal to 18
months from the present six month.
</P>
<P>
He said there are still un-implemented contracts in previous
three phases of program because U.S. representative in the
Sanctions Committee has been blocking their approval.

WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky went to a FBI office in Los Angeles on Thursday to give
handwriting, fingerprint and voice samples for the investigation
into her alleged affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, 24, spent nearly three hours inside and had no
comment as she left.
</P>
<P>
She entered the building holding hands with her father, Dr.
Bernard Lewinsky, who lashed out at Whitewater investigator
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
"My daughter is a pawn. Kenneth Starr is trying to use her as a
pawn to get the presidency. It is unfair. It is totally
un-American," media reports quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Starr, originally appointed to investigate
Clinton's Whitewater business dealings in Arkansas, has been
investigating allegations that Clinton had an affair with Ms.
Lewinsky and asked her to lie about it to lawyers in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The president has denied the affair and cover-up and has turned
down repeated invitations to testify in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, William Ginsburg, told reporters to
"back off" when they asked about his open letter that was
published in a legal magazine -- California Lawyer.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Ginsburg accused Starr of ruining the lives of
Ms. Lewinsky and members of her family.

<HEADLINE> aaa052837 UN Envoy Actively Mediates for Peace in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations envoy to
Angola,Blondin Beye,Thursday left for Zambia to brief Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba about the implementation of the
"crisis resolving initiative" in the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is the first stop of Beye's trip to Africa.  The U.N.
special represtative to Angola will also visit Namibia and
Zimbabwe in a bid to get the peace process out of the existing
standstill.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Beye will brief the heads of state of the
three countries about the current situation of the Angolan peace
process and try to win their support for his "crisis resolving
initiative" to push the two warring sides to make efforts so that
the peace process in crisis be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process fell into stalemate on March 16 when
the reestablishment of local governments in such "sensitive
areas" as central cities of Bailundo and Andulo met obstruction
from the opposition National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA). UNITA should have transferred its headquarters in
Bailundo to the capital city of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Later, the remnants of the rebel group launched rampant
sabotage, attacking the newly-established local governments,
ambushing the vehicles running normally on the roads, replanting
landmines, looting and putting a spoke in the wheel of the U.N.
observer mission.
</P>
<P>
The destabilizing military activities of the UNITA remnants
have aggravated the crisis facing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his "crisis resolving initiative," Beye urged UNITA to take
actions, creating conditions for the reestablishment of local
governments in four sensitive areas including Bailundo by May 31
and helping the U.N. peacekeeping force commander inspect the
demilitarization of the UNITA armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Beye's initiative urged the Angolan government to stop its
antagonist propaganda. Now, the government has fully stopped its
publicity unfavorable for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In order to put the peace process in its right track, Beye to
be accompanied by the representatives of three observers, namely
the United States, Russia and Portugal, will hold talks with
President of UNITA Jonas Savimbi in Andulo by May 30 after his
three-state trip.

LUANDA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- United Nations envoy to Angola

</P>
<P>
Zambia is the first stop of Beye's trip to Africa. The U.N.

During his trip, Beye will brief the heads of state of the

peace process in crisis would be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process hit snags on March 16 when the
re-establishment of local administrations in such "sensitive
areas" as the central cities of Bailundo and Andulo met
"obstruction" from the opposition National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
UNITA should have transferred its headquarters in Bailundo to
the capital city of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Recently, remnants of the former rebel group mounted "random
attacks" on the newly-established local administrations,
ambushing vehicles on the road, planting mines, looting and
putting a spoke in the wheel of the U.N. observer mission, thus
aggravating the crisis facing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his initiative, Beye urged UNITA to act and create
conditions for the re-establishment of local administrations in
four sensitive areas including Bailundo by May 31 and help the
commander of the U.N. peace-keeping force look into the de facto
demilitarization of the UNITA armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Beye also urged the Angolan government to stop its propaganda
against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
In order to put the peace process on its right track, Beye, in
the company of representatives of the three observers -- the U.
S., Russia and Portugal, will go to Andulo to meet President of
UNITA Jonas Savimbi before May 30 after his trip to the three
countries.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Army Kills 20 Hutu Militiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army killed over 20
"Interahamwe" militiamen Wednesday in clashes with armed Hutu
militia at Busasamana in Rwerere commune, in Gisenyi prefecture,
official sources told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 villagers were also wounded in the attack that
has been blamed on armed Hutu insurgents causing insecurity in
the area, the RNA said in a special dispatch sent to Xinhua based
in Nairobi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the wounded were taken to Gisenyi hospital
where they are being treated.
</P>
<P>
Government officials in Gisenyi in the northwest claim that
the number of the assailants killed is expected to rise as more
bodies continue to be found in surrounding bushes and forests.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen armed with guns and traditional weapons are
said to have raided the small transit camp in Rwerere in a bid to
kill Hutu villagers who had just escaped from their hideouts in
the volcano mountain area.
</P>
<P>
"The militiamen are not pleased to see the villagers turning
their backs against them," the governor of Gisenyi, Jean Baptiste
Muhirwa told Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In less than a month, over 20,000 villagers who had been
forced to join the armed insurgency, had dissociated themselves
from the militia and are settling on their homes, said the
dispatch.
</P>
<P>
The Rwerere attack was reportedly foiled by an army detachment
that repelled the assailants, killing a good number of them,
military sources in Gisenyi said.
</P>
<P>
The attack on Rwerere occurred in the wake of three-day
operations in Kanama and Nyamyumba communes, jointly carried out
by government troops and local residents.
</P>
<P>
The number of militiamen killed has not been disclosed, but
hospital sources in Gisenyi told RNA early Wednesday that some
civilians were wounded in the operations.
</P>
<P>
The areas of Kanama and Nyamyumba communes have so far been
characterized by intolerable insecurity caused by the armed
insurgents.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Engineers Urged to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian former
vice-president Joseph Warioba Thursday urged engineers to join in
the campaign against corruption, which is widespread in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
"Billions and millions of Shillings are lost through
corruption in the construction of roads, buildings, factories and
other infrastructures," Warioba said to a group of engineers in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"The award of contracts, the selection of construction
consultants and the general procedure for public procurement of
goods and services is a fertile ground for corruption," Warioba,
who is on the forefront of anti-corruption war in Tanzania, told
a seminar for the Institution of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old judge of International Tribunal for the Law of
the Sea, said engineers should exercise self-discipline rather
than point fingers at others, such as the police and the
judiciary who are on the top lists of corruption in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Deterring corruption is the duty of everyone, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Warioba, who was also the prime minister during 1985-1990,
said Tanzania has a long way to go in the struggle against
corruption because of the general weak state of the economy which
resulted in low productivity and inadequate earnings.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who receives remuneration which cannot meet basic
needs will fall into the temptation of corruption," he said,
citing typical examples in health and education sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said in Tanzania, bribes are demanded for the initial
registration of a patient, consultations with the doctor,
laboratory examination, provision of drugs, dressing of wounds,
admission of in-patients and general treatment including food
service.
</P>
<P>
The corruption situation in education sector is also alarming.
Leakage of exam papers has become a commercial enterprise.
Invigilators are bribed to allow cheating in exam rooms,
including showing answers to students.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has flexed its muscle in combating
corruption since President Benjamin Mkapa came to power in 1995.
The president repeatedly warned that all corrupt elements should
be flushed out and made to pay heavily for their evil deeds.
</P>
<P>
In late 1997, the Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB), in
collaboration with other authoritative bodies, sacked a number of
officials in connection with corruption and recovered 1.5 billion
Shillings (about 2.4 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements, Warioba said the government action
against corruption still needs more transparency and the
participation of the public.
</P>
<P>
The road to eliminating corruption is long and tough, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Concerned About Pakistani Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is deeply
concerned about the reported nuclear tests carried out by
Pakistan Thursday morning, the Foreign Affairs Department said in
a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government has noted with deep concern the
two reported nuclear tests carried out by Pakistan this morning,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had appealed for restraint from Pakistan
following the recent tests by India, Pakistan's arch-rival in the
subcontinent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of principle, South Africa opposes all nuclear
tests since they do not contribute to promoting world peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa believes that security is provided by nuclear
disarmament rather than by nuclear proliferation," said the
statement. "South Africa repeats the hope that these tests do not
result in an arms race in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
South Africa has close political and economic relations with
India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced that his
country has successfully conducted five nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's move followed India's nuclear testing two weeks ago
which triggered worldwide condemnation.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since both countries
obtained independence from Britain in 1947, two of those wars
were over Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> BSEC Summit to Take Place in Yalta, Ukraine, Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The summit of the Black Sea
Economic Cooperation (BSEC) is to take place on June 4-5 in Yalta,
Ukraine, with the Charter of the organization expected to be
adopted.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here that the heads of state or government of
the organisation's 11 member-countries, including Romania, are
expected to take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The document already initialed at the ministerial meeting held
in Yerevan last April, will transform BSEC into a genuine regional
organization, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The principles and goals laid down in the Charter are: to act
in a spirit of friendship and good neighborliness and enhance
mutual respect and confidence, dialogue and cooperation among the
member states; to further develop and diversify bilateral and
multilateral cooperation on the basis of the principles and rules
of international law; to act for improving the business
environment and promoting the individual and collective initiative
of the enterprises and companies directly involved in economic
cooperation; to develop collaboration in a manner not contravening
the international obligations of the member states; to further
encourage the participation in the BSEC process of other
international and regional institutions.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC process is aimed at multi-sized economic objectives in
such areas as trade, banking and finance, transport,
communications, energy, agriculture, health, protection of the
environment, tourism, science and technology statistics.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming adoption of the Charter will equip BSEC with a
clear juridical status and international identity, a significant
advantage besides other ones that will enhance the BSEC role in
the promotion of sub-regional cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges National Protection for Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- State regulations are not
sufficient to protect HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)
patients, and U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday called for
national protections even if at the price of a little inflation.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, while wishing to pass some version of the
president's proposed "bill of rights" for protecting patients and
ridding it as an election-year issue, stressed their opposition to
driving up health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
A Republican task force of House committee and subcommittee
chairmen is expected to finish writing legislation early next
month. Ways and Means Committee spokesman Ari Fleischer said
lawmakers want to pass something acceptable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Insurers and the businesses that buy coverage for their workers
have resisted Clinton's plan, which they say amounts to
over-regulation that will spike prices.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration also released a state-by-state
report on Thursday meant to show that national regulations are
necessary because the patchwork of protections in state law is
inadequate -- and many are pre-empted by ERISA, the 1974 Employee
Retirement Income Security Act.
</P>
<P>
About 125 million Americans are in ERISA-covered plans, to
which state laws do not apply. ERISA also does not guarantee
patients full medical information or adequate means of redress
when treatment is wrongly denied, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's patient "bill of rights" would place curbs on health
plans that limit patient choices to save money. Proposed
protections include an outside review when care is denied, better
access to specialists and coverage of emergency-room care even if
reasonable fears of medical crisis turn out to be unfounded.

WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Phoenix Mercury coach-general
manager Cheryl Miller found her apartment was robbed by
cool-minded thieves and all her four championship basketball rings
and some other property lost while she was at the WNBA team's
practice on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping when they find the person that it isn't someone who
had knowledge of my schedule," a disconsolate Miller said
Thursday. "I'm very lucky no one was there when I got home."
</P>
<P>
The total loss of the theft is valued at about 9,000
U.S. dollars. Wednesday was a bad day for the Hall of Fame
basketball player, whose car blew a tire on the way home and her
brother Reggie's team, the Indiana Pacers, was rolled over by the
Chicago Bulls 106-87 in Game 5 of the NBA's Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
The thieves took an easy time at her home, drinking three of
her beers before taking money and other things.
</P>
<P>
"So not only did they take my rings and my VCR and the remote,
but they were toasting it up," she said sadly.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they could return the rings, that's more important to
me."
</P>

LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A magistrate in London ruled Friday
that a British resident should stand trial on crimes charges for
merdering Jews in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Chief stipendiary magistrate Graham Parkinson decided that the
77-year-old Anthony Sawoniuk living in southeast London would face
four counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
This will be Britain's first war crimes trial on Nazi murderers
under the War Crimes Act passed by the British parliament in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Sawoniuk is charged with killing four Jews in late 1942 in his
hometown of Domachevo, which was then in German-occupied
Byelorussia (now Belarus).
</P>
<P>
Sawoniuk, a former railway worker, looked strained and anxious
at Friday's hearing in a central London court. He was granted bail
and is due to appear at London's Central Criminal Court to make
his plea on July 24. He has denied the charges against him.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Incomes Record 0.4 Pct Increase in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Americans' personal incomes
picked up a healthy 0.4 percent in April but not enough to offset
spending growth, the Commerce Department reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in personal income, to a seasonally adjusted 7.18
trillion U.S. dollars, reflected gains in all categories,
including wages and salaries. It followed a moderate 0.3 percent
gain in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, personal consumption expenditures rose 0.5 percent
in both March and April to a seasonally adjusted 5.72 trillion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
People's disposable, or after-tax, income rose 0.4 percent last
month. Real, or inflation-adjusted, after-tax income edged just
0.2 percent, the smallest increase in nine months.
</P>
<P>
The fact that spending grew faster than incomes produced the
fourth drop in the national savings rate in five months.
</P>
<P>
The April savings rate was a nine-month low of 3.5 percent,
down from 3.6 percent a month earlier and 4.1 percent five months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries increased 0.4 percent in April. Gains also
were recorded for business owners' income, farmers' income,
transfer payments such as Social Security and welfare, interest,
dividends and rental income.
</P>
<P>
Spending was strongest for durable goods, big-ticket items such
as autos and appliances expected to last three or more years. They
rose 0.7 percent. Nondurable-goods purchases increased 0.6 percent
and spending on services rose 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Malone to Have a Baby during Bulls-Pacers Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Karl Malone, the hero of the
Utah Jazz, said he will focus his attention on his wife instead of
watching the important game between the Bulls and Pacers tonight.
</P>
<P>
"My wife's having a baby today!" said the giant center who led
Jazz to complete an easy 4-0 triumph over the Los Angeles Lakers
in the NBA Western Conference playoffs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Malone's wife, Kay, will give birth to the couple's fourth
child, a girl they've already named Karlee, sometime today,
probably during the sixth game of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz's 10-day break between games couldn't have arrived at
a better time for the Malones.
</P>
<P>
"I realize the NBA Finals are a high point of my career, but
being a father is a high point of my life," Malone said.
</P>
<P>
"Everything Karl Malone does, I plan it," Malone said proudly.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Malone took his children to a trout pond
and a petting zoo, and Jeff Hornacek spent Thursday at one of his
son's baseball games. Greg Foster just stayed home. renting
action movies and children's fare from video store.
</P>
<P>
"Don't you know we're the family team?" foster grinned.
</P>
<P>
After concluding Thursday's training for the NBA Finals, Malone
said:"Today was better than yesterday, and tomorrow will be better
than today. We just have to build toward next Wednesday and have
that one goal in mind."
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of not pushing it," Hornacek said. "If we
can keep our focus and build toward the finals. we'll be ready."
</P>
<P>
But the finals is still five days away, and the Jazz don't even
know who they will have to face. "It's very difficult to stay
ready all the time, because there's not a goal...that you can jump
on right away," Hornacek said. "Until we know who we're playing,
there's only so much we can do."

<HEADLINE> British Police Probe Fire Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- British police began investigating
the cause of a fire Friday in which four children and a man died.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out early in the day on the top floor of a
tenement flat in Renfrew, south of Glasgow in Scotland. The
victims were believed to be three-year-old twins, two children
aged six and nine and their father.
</P>
<P>
Two women, thought to be the mother and grandmother of the
children, were also taken to hospital suffering from shock and
smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
The fire service had tried to rescue the family. Assistant
Firemaster John Martin said, "We were told by neighbors and the
children's mother that people were still in the flat when we
arrived. Six officers attempted a rescue but the smoke logging was
particularly bad."
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- More members of the international
community joined on Friday in condemning the recent nuclear tests
by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the 44-nation Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council (EAPC) on Friday expressed deep concern and dismay at the
tests which, they claimed, would increase tensions in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, who met in Luxembourg to celebrate the

tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Ukrainian foreign ministers, who met in Luxembourg on

nuclear weapons and their delivery means.
</P>
<P>
They also called on both countries to adhere unconditionally to
the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said in a
statement on Friday that the nuclear tests violated the NPT and
increased tensions, not only in South Asia, but also around the
world.
</P>
<P>
The British government announced Friday morning that it would
recall the country's High Commissioner from Islamabad for
consultations after Pakistan carried out five nuclear tests
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Libya Calls for Tenders to Build Railways Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan official said Friday that
his country has called for international tenders for a
multi-billion-U.S.-dollar railway project to be completed by the
year 2002.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Mohamed Abdul Samad Ali, director of the
Libyan Authority for Railways Projects, said the project is for
the construction of a 3,170 kilometer-long railways network across
the country.
</P>
<P>
That will be 2,178 kilometers of railway that extends from east
to west Libya, and 992 kilometers of rails from the north to the
south, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan official is in Tunisia to attend a conference on
railways in North African countries. He said the tenders have been
addressed to railway construction companies, and that the deadline
for tenders was set at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Ali indicated that the first phase of the project extends from
Ras Jadeer along the border with Tunisia up to the city of Sirt, a
Libyan north coastal city, covering a distance of 700 kilometers;
the second phase extends from Sirt to Musa'id along the
Libyan-Egyptian border.
</P>
<P>
He said that the construction work has actually started to
build sections of the railway, and a 20-million-dollar contract
will shortly be signed with a French company to establish a
factory for the production of some 6.8 million cement bars that
support the rails.
</P>
<P>
The conference on railway transport networks in North Africa
opened Thursday in the Tunisian capital and is attended by
companies from Arab world, European countries and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the conference is to exchange expertise in the field
of railway transport which has a large role in promoting economic
and social development in the region.

LUXEMBOURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- NATO decided Friday to open its
Tirana liaison next Monday as part of its effort to help the
Balkan country to fend off possible spillover of unrest from
neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The liaison, to be manned by a civilian, an officer and a

<HEADLINE> China's Top Scientists Talk About IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's major scientific research
organization says it will use intellectual property rights
protection to improve efficiency and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has asked legal and
scientific experts and senior officials in Beijing to discuss
guidelines for science and technology, unfair competition, and
copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
This is like increasing input in science and technology,
says Xu Yulin, a senior official with the State Council's
Legislative Affairs Office, which drafts laws, and IPR protection
should go hand in hand with economic development.
</P>
<P>
CAS should place more importance on IPR protection, he
says. CAS has had a special regulation on IPR protection since
1993, but it does not suit the present situation.
</P>
<P>
Duan Ruichun, a senior Science and Technology Ministry
official, says that most research institutions lack IPR protection
awareness even though China has a fairly complete set of laws.
</P>
<P>
CAS embraces 123 institutions and more than 50,000
researchers. In the past five years, it has applied for 3,100
patents, or 24 percent of China's total, but experts say that
this is still too small.
</P>
<P>
So, CAS employees need to cultivate a sense of IPR protection,
or China's scientific and technological development won't be able
to keep up with that of developed countries," says Li Xianqing, a
CAS official in charge of patent affairs.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Willing to Expand Ties With China: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said here Friday that Turkey is ready to further
enhance economic and trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Beijing on an official visit, Ecevit told
Xinhua that Turkey attaches great importance to increasing
economic relations with China and he will discuss with Chinese
officials ways of furthering bilateral cooperation to that effect.
</P>
<P>
"The current trade volume of Turkey and China is much lower
than the potential that exists between the two countries, and we
are determined to encourage our businessmen to expand economic
and trade cooperation with China," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
The annual trade volume of the two countries has been around
600 million U.S. dollars in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister noted that the visits to China by
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and State Minister in charge
of economic affairs Isin Celebi, early this year proved Turkey's
sincere wishes to develop friendly ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic cooperation, Turkey is also interested in
further expanding its political relations with China, Ecevit added.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit is expected to exchange views with Chinese leaders
regional and international issues of mutual concern during the
visit from May 30 to June 5.

NEW DELHI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the opposition
condemned the Indian government Friday of violating basic
principles the country has always espoused and urged the
government to accept Pakistan's offer for talks following its
nuclear tests Thursday.
</P>
<P>
P. A. Sangma, former speaker of Lok Sabha, the Lower House of
Parliament, said in the debate on India's recent nuclear tests in
Lok Sabha that no convincing answers have been given by the
government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party with regard to the
reason and timing of the tests.
</P>
<P>
Successive Indian prime ministers had worked with restraint on
exercising the nuclear option, which he said was a much more
difficult task than indulging in bizarre adventurism.
</P>
<P>
He said security and national integrity did not lie in the bomb
alone and could be strengthened by making India economically
strong, creating more employment and eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
In Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Parliament, Congress leader
Manmohan Singh called on the government "to deal with the emerging
scenario with responsibility, maturity and restraint", following
the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Singh said his party was willing to cooperate with the
government in defusing the tension and in creating a conducive
atmosphere but the initiative should come from the government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Unions Say Layoffs Need Assistance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese trade union officials today
criticized some enterprises for violating the rights of workers
and said the government needs to improve its labor controls with
the help of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers are a new group that has emerged in the 1990s,
and there are now nearly 10 million of them. Most are former
employees of money-losing state enterprises, which are now trying
to improve efficiency by sharply reducing the number of workers.
</P>
<P>
But, one major problem, according to Feng Lei, an official with
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Protection Department,
is that some managers are laying off employees randomly, instead
of giving them a good reason for being dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Some workers, Feng said, have lost their jobs just because
their employers think that they are too old, and some small
enterprises have laid off urban workers and found cheaper labor in
the form of migrant workers from the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has repeatedly told state-owned
enterprise managers that they must submit their reform plans to
Workers' Congresses, which are made up of employee
representatives, for arbitration and approval.
</P>
<P>
However, Feng said, it is also important that the government
increases supervisory work and be sure that justice is served in
labor disputes involving large-scale layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Min, of ACFTU's Law Department, said that some enterprises
are taking advantage of laid-off workers' eagerness to find a new
job, and making a profit from the surplus value of workers after
they are laid off.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Unions Say Layoffs Need Assistance (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Some enterprises refuse to give equal pay to their original
employees or to laid-off workers, even though they do equal work,"
she said, and, "some require the former laid-off workers to work
overtime."
</P>
<P>
A fundamental cause of this problems is the fact that some
managers discriminate against laid-off workers, Feng said, and
some are even bold enough to try to fool the government, which has
preferential policies like tax breaks for businesses that hire
unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
First, they recruit laid-off workers to take advantage of the
preferential treatment and then fire them within several months,
giving various excuses, she explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, a large proportion of the workers who were
laid off by state companies, have looked for work in the private
sector, where, unfortunately, the trade union system is fairly
weak and the managers' power is unchecked.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, many laid-off workers lack legal
information and often neglect to sign a contract with their new
employer and don't know how to get help from local labor
arbitration offices when their rights have been violated, she said.
</P>
<P>
Feng said the government needs to act immediately to
standardize employment procedure across the country and press all
enterprises to sign contracts with every unemployed worker they
hire.
</P>
<P>
"We must take a stand against any kind of discrimination
against laid-off workers," she concluded.

<HEADLINE> Concern Voiced in Asia-Pacific Over Pakistani N-Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Four countries in the
Asia-Pacific region voiced their concern over Pakistan's nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines Friday expressed its "deep concern and utmost
dismay" over the series of nuclear tests conducted Thursday by
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said in a statement that "the Philippines
urges Pakistan and India to refrain from any action that could
further exacerbate the tense situation in the Asian sub-continent
and to adhere to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and the
non-proliferation treaty."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia Friday deplored Pakistan's underground nuclear tests
and called on the country to cease immediately developing its
capability to produce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that
"Malaysia is deeply concerned over recent developments in the
South Asian region which would lead to a dangerous competition for
nuclear superiority."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia urged all countries concerned to refrain from such a
competition, exercise maximum restraint and prevent the further
escalation of tension, the foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer Friday
expressed concern over the risk of a conflict between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"It's profoundly irresponsible to have adopted this nuclear
option as both India and Pakistan have done because it does lead
to a heightening of tension," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee presided over an
emergency cabinet meeting Thursday to discuss the fallout of
Pakistan's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
India conducted the nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, and
Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests Thursday in the Chaghi
desert of the southwestern province of Balochistan.

<HEADLINE> Nine People Killed In Northwestern Chinese Coal Mine Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nine farmer-miners were killed
and one was injured on Wednesday evening when an underground
explosion occurred in a coal mine in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, officials report.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses say that a pack of cigarettes and the remains of a
lighter that were found at the site of the explosion have led
investigators to believe that the explosion was caused by gas that
ignited when the miners had a smoke break.
</P>
<P>
The gas in the mine was exceedingly thick because of poor
ventilation underground, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred in the town of Changle, where there are
13 small mines, most of which are leased to individuals who have
been lax in seeing to it that they have adequate ventilation and
safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
A similar explosion killed one miner in the town in February
and local people have asked for better controls on the small coal
mines.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Customs Office has
recognized 25 Chinese international shipping vessels as "credited
vessels" that will have customs preference in clearance and
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The 25 vessels belong to 9 Chinese companies, which include
COSCO Shanghai and the China Marine Shipping Group.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 16 local vessels were criticized for poor
management or smuggling and were ordered to correct their behavior
within a certain amount of time.
</P>
<P>
This is the first move by Chinese customs to improve controls
over local vessels, which are increasingly involved in the
international shipping business.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the largest foreign trade and shipping hub in China
and has been doing business with more than 500 ports and over 600
companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Shanghai Customs handled at least 15,300 vessels.

<HEADLINE> Chinese CPPCC Chairman Visits Marseille </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, FRANCE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), began a visit to the southern
French metropolis, Marseille, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the Mayor of Marseille Jean-Claude
Gaudin, Li said that the exchanges between Marseille and Chinese
cities have increased against the background of an overall good
relationship between China and France.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Gaudin for his welcome, saying it expressed the
friendly feeling of the people of Marseille toward the Chinese
people and showed the importance attached to developing relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
He invited Gaudin and other leading Marseille people to visit
China to increase mutual understanding and friendship, and expand
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Gaudin said that Marseille began its exchanges with China
in the later half of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges and cooperation between Marseille and China have
increased in economic, cultural and technological fields since
China adopted the policy of reforms and opening up, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he believed that the visit by Li would help push
forward relations between China and France, as well as Marseille
and Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the department of Bouche-sur-Rhone Jean-Paul
Proust also hosted a dinner here in honor of Li Thursday evening.

JINAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2000, exporters in this
part of China will have to submit an application for an export

This news comes from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, whose representatives were here today to examine the

China is attempting to administer its foreign trade and keep it
in line with international standards and conventions by more
scientific means, meaning via the network, the Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The electronic connection could improve efficiency and
application procedures, reduce the cost of making application, and
increase government management of the export business, it said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Facilitate Entry of Taiwan Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Immigration Department of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China announced
Friday that two new arrangements would be introduced to facilitate
Taiwan residents passing through Hong Kong in transit to or from
China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
A fast track service will also be added for Taiwan residents
applying for Hong Kong Entry Permits.
</P>
<P>
With effect from June 1, 1998, Taiwan residents holding a valid
'Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents' (commonly known as
"Tai Bao Zheng") and a valid entry/exit endorsement for China's
inland areas may be allowed to stay for seven days when they pass
through Hong Kong in transit to or from China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
There is no need for them to apply separately to the
Immigration Department for a Hong Kong Entry Permit.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan residents who wish to visit only Hong Kong will still
need to apply for a Hong Kong Entry Permit as at present, a
spokesman for the Immigration Department said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan residents living outside the region of Taiwan who wish
to transit Hong Kong to or from other countries or territories
will need to obtain a transit entry permit from the Chinese
diplomatic and consular missions as at present, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
With effect from June 5, 1998, the Immigration Department will
provide a fast track service for Taiwan residents applying for
multiple journey Hong Kong Entry Permits valid for three years.
The normal processing time will be reduced from the present five
working days to two.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Hong Kong Tourist Association said it
welcomed the new immigration measures to make it easier for Taiwan
residents to visit Hong Kong and to increase the quota of tours
from the Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> Intensive Arab Contacts Underway for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Intensive contacts are under way
here through diplomatic channels to pave the ground for an Arab
summit to forge a unified Arab stance on the Middle East peace
process, which has remained deadlocked for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Sources here indicated that many Arab states have already
agreed to the convocation of an extraordinary Arab summit to work
out an Arab strategy in the face of the stalled process.
</P>
<P>
They are to launch an international drive to save the process,
in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz is
expected here early next week for consultations in this
respect. Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, on the other hand, is to
visit Cairo shortly to examine with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak the latest developments and the prospects of convening a
mini or expanded Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an Arab summit is now favored by more Arab states,
which deem it necessary to work out unified Arab measures against
the hardline and intransigent Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Measures under consideration include freezing of relations with
Israel and an Arab economic boycott. The Arab states will urge big
powers, especially the United States, to put more pressure on
Israel to change its hardline policy and honor signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
They will also try to awake world public opinion to pressure
Israel to establish peace and avert war.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the measures are needed with regard to the
growing possibility that the stalemate on the Israeli-Palestinian
track might turn towards explosion and lead to the rise of
extremist and fundamentalist activities in both Arab and Israeli
sides.

HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China said
here Friday that he has "every confidence" that Hong Kong will
pull out of the economic difficulty and regain competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks shortly after SAR's Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang announced the first quarter economic data, which
showed a 2 percent drop of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Admitting the figures are "disappointing" and "worse than
expected," Tung said "we are going through a rather painful period
 of economic adjustment - a necessary period of economic
adjustment" in order to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
The government understands the pain these adjustments cause to
the citizens of Hong Kong, Tung said, adding "We have been working
very hard to formulate measures to reduce the pain."
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the measures the financial secretary just
announced are aimed at easing credit squeeze, stabilizing property
 prices and promoting tourism, all of which are very important at
this moment.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive urged the entire community "not to be
depressed, not to be pessimistic about the figures today... and
after this economic adjustment, I know we will regain our
competitiveness quickly."

<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Total deposits as well as loans
and advances in Hong Kong both registered a modest fall in April
1998, according to statistics published Friday by the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
Having risen by 0.1 percent in March, total deposits declined
by 0.4 percent in April. The fall in deposits was attributable to
a 1.1 percent decrease in foreign currency deposits, which more
than offset a rise of 0.2 percent in HK dollar deposits.
</P>
<P>
Total loans and advances declined by 0.1 percent in April. The
fall was attributable to a contraction in offshore lending, which
dropped by a modest 0.3 percent, following a sharp decline of 14.2
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local credit demand continued to be subdued, with
loans for trade financing falling by 1.2 percent and other loans
rising by a meager 0.1 percent, as domestic economic activity
remained slow.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Announces Bold Initiatives To Stimulate Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government on
Friday voiced concern over the negative GDP growth recorded in the
first quarter of 1998 and put forward several measures to
stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the continuing adverse impact of the regional financial
turmoil, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could have fallen by
around 2 percent in real terms in the quarter over a year earlier,
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told a press conference Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This represented a further marked deceleration from the 2.7
percent growth in the fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the sluggish economic performance so far, the
earlier forecast of a 3.5 percent GDP growth for 1998 looks
unattainable," Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
And an appropriate updated GDP growth forecast is particularly
difficult to determine at this moment with regards to still highly
volatile regional and local situation, the top Hong Kong financial
official pointed out, but he added that an update of the forecast
will be made in August.
</P>
<P>
In order to counter the abrupt adjustment, seven specific
measures were set out "to ease the credit crunch faced by the
business community, boost in-bound tourism and to achieve a soft
landing in the property market," Tsang noted.

<HEADLINE> Bhutto Backs Pakistan Nuclear Tests, Denounces India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Opposition Leader
Benazir Bhutto has backed her country's nuclear tests and
blamed the move on India's breach of the non-proliferation regime
in the region, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices Thursday in response to
the same number of tests by rival India on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests were forced upon Pakistan by India's testing
and the Pakistani leadership took the right decision at the right
time, said Bhutto, head of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
But she feared such acts would lead to nuclear arms race in
South Asia and called on the international community to mediate in
the growing tension between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European countries could take a lead
in mediation, thus halting a nuclear arms race threatening the new
world order, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, the Commonwealth and the European countries
can play a role seeking a solution to the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute about which the Security Council has passed resolutions
calling for its settlement," she said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three wars that the two nations fought in the past
50 years were over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Announces Bold Initiatives To Stimulate Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For improved liquidity in the money market, the newly
established Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (HKMC) will shortly
announce new facilities which will streamline the purchase program
for residential mortgages and would provide banks with greater
certainty on the amount of loans they can sell to the HKMC within
a specified period.
</P>
<P>
"This should provide banks with greater assurance about the
availability of liquidity and help them plan their new loan
business more effectively," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the liquidity of the banking system, the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority is working closely with the major
market participants to consider ways to kick-start the development
of the HK dollar repo market.
</P>
<P>
The banking system is sitting on 138 billion HK dollars (17.7
billion U.S. dollars) worth of liquid assets and the considerable
amount of assets should be "put into good use," Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
To revive the tourism industry, entry requirements will be
simplified to facilitate Taiwan travelers to visit Hong Kong. With
 effect from June 1, Taiwan residents holding "Mainland Travel
Permit for Taiwan Residents" may stay in Hong Kong for seven days
in transit to or from the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will also expand by 30 percent the quota for the
Chinese mainland residents to visit Hong Kong for sight-seeing
under the "Hong Kong Travel" Group Tour Scheme. With effect from
July, the daily quota will be increased from 1,142 to 1,500.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Announces Bold Initiatives To Stimulate Economy (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a soft landing in the property market, the government will
extend the pre-sale period of uncompleted flats from the present
15 months to 20 months before the estimated date of completion of
the development project, and a series of earlier adopted
administrative measures are to be suspended.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary said that the measures will give
necessary stimulus to the economy, and the biggest ever tax
reduction package and the massive investment plans he announced
earlier in the 1998 budget will bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, local consumer spending
slackened considerably, while overall investment spending also
slowed down sharply. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rate moved
higher to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods grew by only about 1 percent in real terms in
the quarter, representing a marked moderation from the 6 percent
increase in 1997, due to the sustained strength of the U.S. dollar
and reduced import demand in those east Asian economies affected
by the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"With the public sector expenditure constituting less than 20
percent of the total GDP, the revival of the economy will clearly
have to be private sector-led. But the government stands ready to
support any community-wide effort to ride out the storm," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Tsang pledged that the government will continue to work hard
with the newly elected legislative Council, the business
community, the media, and the local community to turn our economy
around for the better.
</P>
<P>
He believed that "once the regional situation stabilizes, Hong
Kong will be the first economy to turn around."

destruction.

<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian met with Gen. Henryk Szumski, chief of the General Staff
of the Polish armed forces, and his party today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Waiting for New Development of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said on Friday that he was waiting
for announcement from the U.S. on the new development of the
mideast peace process, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Israeli opposition Labor Party member
Yossi Beilin in Ramallah, West Bank, Arafat reiterated that he
supported the U.S. initiative to revive the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that he hoped that the U.S. would convince the
Israeli government to accept the U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
He also talked with Beilin about the ways to prevent the
deterioration of the political situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly proposed that Israel hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the PNA during the second redeployment
in return for the fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has formally accepted the proposal. But Israel rejected
such a scope of withdrawal, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, senior Palestinian officials said
Friday that a Palestinian state will be declared next year
despite the U.S. misgivings about such a move.
</P>
<P>
They responded to U.S. White House spokesman Michael McCurry
who said Thursday that the Palestinian declaration of statehood
would constitute a violation of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeatedly said that he would declare an
independent Palestinian state in May, 1999, at the end of a
five-year period of "interim" arrangements between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israel said that if Arafat took such an
unilateral move, it would take measures of its own -- a statement
widely seen as a veiled threat to annex parts of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> China Again Takes Exception To Japanese Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Assistant Foreign Minister
Wang Yi met with the Japanese ambassador to China, Tanino
Sakutaro, on Thursday and again took exception to remarks made by
Japanese officials on Japanese-U.S. security cooperation that
damaged China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
After restating China's stance on the matter, Wang asked the
Japanese to abandon their "Cold War" mentality in
Japanese-U.S. security operations and to go along with the
China-Japan Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Japanese should confine
Japanese-U.S. security cooperation to bilateral relations and
should not allow it to have anything to do with Taiwan or do
anything to harm China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Japanese to immediately clarify what their
officials said and explain why and take steps to see that it
doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
Tanino said that Japan paid close attention to China's
objection and provided the following explanation on behalf of
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto:
</P>
<P>
First, The explanation by Japanese leaders on the new
Japan-U.S. defence guidelines remain unchanged. The revised
guidelines are not targeted at any third country like China.
</P>
<P>
Second, the "surrounding situation" refers to any possible
situation around Japan that may have a grave impact on Japanese
security and is not a geographical reference.
</P>
<P>
Third, the Japanese government will continue to handle the
Taiwan issue in accordance with the Japan-China Joint Declaration
and Japan-China Peace and Friendship Treaty and all the
commitments made by the Japanese leaders.

<HEADLINE> No New Sino-U.S. Taiwan Communique, Says China's FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States do not
have any plan to issue a new joint communique or joint statement
on the Taiwan issue during President Clinton's visit to China,
according to Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese and U.S. leaders will certainly discuss
the Taiwan issue during President Clinton's visit to China. The
Taiwan issue is the most sensitive and core issue in the Sino-US
relations and that the principles of correctly handling the issue
have been defined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is clearly committed to the "one China"
policy, the principles set in the three joint communiques, to
opposing the idea of "one China, one Taiwan", "two Chinas", Taiwan
independence, or Taiwan's accession to the United Nations or other
international organizations formed by sovereign states, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The key now is that the principles set in the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques and the Sino-U.S. joint statement must be
honestly observed and the U.S. commitments on the Taiwan issue
must be earnestly honored to ensure the healthy and stable
development of the Sino-U.S. relations, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> ADP Proposes to Implement 30 Projects in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian development Bank (ADB) has
proposed to implement 30 projects with a total cost of 1.064
billion U.S. dollars in Bangladesh's northwestern region against
the backdrop of opening the Bangabandhu Bridge for traffic on June
23, the national news agency BSS reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount, about 558 million dollars for five
projects had been earmarked for the transport sector, BSS quoted
official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining amount, 258 million dollars will be used in
industry and finance, 126 million dollars in urban development, 98
million dollars in fisheries and 24 million dollars in the
agricultural sector, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The 30 projects were selected as priority ones from among 100
projects which were discussed at a regional workshop held in the
region last year.
</P>
<P>
The ADB had provided 200 million dollars to the 900 million
dollar-bridge project, they said.
</P>
<P>
The timing and duration of most of the projects had been fixed
between 1999 and 2005 although implementation of the projects in
the urban development sector might extend to the year 2014, the

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Contract Put into Effect in Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) and the Taiwan-based CPC oil company today formally
put into effect a contract of oil exploration signed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior CNOOC official, it is the largest-ever
cooperation project between both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Located 150 km south of Guangdong province's Shantou City and
250 km west of Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, the contract area covers
15,400 square kilometers bordering the waters of the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the contract signals a major breakthrough
in economic cooperation between both sides of the Taiwan Straits,
the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the contract, signed in July, 1996, has finally
got approval by higher administrative authorities of both sides
after removing a series of barriers.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the two sides will jointly accomplish a
total of 1,500 kilometers of seismic lines and examine the seismic
data for possible oil exploitation in a 3,000-km stretch.
</P>
<P>
First-phase investment for the seismic survey is expected to be
one million US dollars, which will come from both sides on a
fifty-fifty basis, with each of them holding a 50-percent stake in
the venture.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the CNOOC and the CPC will set up a
joint administrative group to carry out the contract, and all
decisions will be made through friendly consultation.
</P>
<P>
If evidence of oil-bearing structures is found, the two sides
will sign agreements on oil exploitation in the area.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts say that the contract area has good prospects,
since seven oilfields with a combined annual production of 10
million tons have already been discovered in the Pearl River Basin
to the north and west of the Chaoshan Basin in the contract area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CPC has found natural gas resources in the
Tainan Basin.
</P>
<P>
Geologists with the CNOOC and the CPC have high hopes for the
exploratory work in the contract area. They are showing increasing
interest in launching more cooperative oil projects.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the Taiwan Straits and the neighboring
South China Sea and East China Sea are rich in oil and gas
resources, which provides huge potential for oil cooperation on
both sides.

PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Pakistan Thursday retaliated against the five nuclear tests
conducted by India earlier this month, making a demonstration of
strength which allows a mobilization of opinion at home against
its all-time number one enemy. The nuclear tests by Pakistan also
signaled a troubling escalation of nuclear tension which the
great powers thought had been eliminated since the end of the
Cold War. Islamabad had also imposed a state of emergency while
raising the threat of "an exterior aggression."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Pakistan Thursday conducted five underground nuclear tests in
response to an identical number of tests recently made by India. The
nuclear tests were condemned by the United States, Russia, France
and NATO, while the United Nations Security Council strongly
deplored the tests.
</P>
<P>
The United States President Bill Clinton announced that
Washington would impose sanctions on Pakistan, but France and Russia
oppose the measure of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
-- The conflict between the management of Air France and its
pilots over salary reduction is threatening the normal functioning
of the air company. Despite the proposal formulated on Thursday by
the Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot, all the unions of
pilots maintained their call for a strike from Monday.

<HEADLINE> Namibian C. Bank Increases Lending Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Namibia has
increased its official lending interest rate to 18 percent from
16 percent in response to a similar hike by the South African
Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meschack Tjirongo, head of research in Bank of Namibia, was
quoted as saying that the central bank had no option but to
increase the bank rate to 18 percent, the Business Day daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since a free flow of funds existed between Namibia and its
neighboring country South Africa, the differentials in rates
could have led to an outflow of capital causing a depletion of
Nambia's international reserves, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between Namibia Dollar and Rand, the
national currency of South Africa, has remained one to one.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian central bank also decided to stay consistent with
South Africa and introduce a 28 marginal lending rate -- the
penalty rate for excessive borrowing of cash from the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commercial banks in Namibia said they would not
raise their interest rates yet because they view the increase as
temporary.
</P>
<P>
Referring to this, Tjirongo claimed that it would be
difficult, under the circumstances, for commercial banks in the
country to keep their rates down for long because they would soon
experience pressure on their margins.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Urged to Run Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's powerful traditional
rulers have repeated their call on the Head of State, General
Sani Abacha to run in the August 1 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The traditional rulers, under the umbrella of the Traditional
Rulers Forum, made their position known in an 11-point communique
issued Thursday at the end of their two-day meeting in Enugu, in
southeast Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The traditional rulers said only Abacha's transformation into
civilian presidency could bring about lasting democracy in the
West African country, troubled by one military government after
another in the past decades, a report reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
They congratulated the government over the successful conduct
of the April 25 national assembly election, saying that it was
peaceful throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The rulers, however, expressed serious concern about the
lingering scarcity of petroleum products in a country that ranks
among the top oil producers in the world.
</P>
<P>
They were also worried over the report by the Internal Affairs
Minister, Alhaji Bashir Dalhatu, which said that about 65 percent
of the prisoners in Nigeria are awaiting trials, thereby making
congestions in cells worse.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to speed up the prisons reform and
improve the decaying infrastructure of prisons, most of which
were built during the colonial era.

China itself has been struck by floods in several provinces over
the past weeks.

The Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner, Yusuf Makamba,
expressed thanks to the ambassador and promised to send all the
rice to the hands of the flood victims. "Our children will have
food to eat," he said.

The regional planning officer, Migetto, said the floods in
early May have killed 16 people and affected 4,608 others, most
of whom were living in a valley area. He also said the floods
washed away 968 houses.

He told Xinhua that the 10 tons of rice will be delivered to
728 flood victims who are taking shelter in tents.

People in the valley have already moved out of the area, the
regional commissioner said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Not to Change Policy on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- In reaction to Pakistan's
nuclear tests, Israel said Friday it was concerned about the
danger of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East but it would
not change its policy on non-conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as saying that Israel would not be
the first country to introduce non-conventional weapons to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former prime minister Shimon Peres said Friday that
Pakistan's nuclear capability would not present a threat to
Israel, but the risk of nuclear proliferation makes the revival
of the deadlocked Mideast peace process more urgent.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu "is making a big mistake" by thinking that the time
is in the side of Israel, Peres said, warning that more and more
armies in the region are equipped with non-conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan announced Thursday afternoon that it had carried out
five nuclear tests in response to those by India two weeks ago.

ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Silvio Berlsconi, the owner of Italian
soccer giants AC Milan, was on Thursday charged with allegedly
transfer fee misconducts, the ANSA news agency reported.

Milan Judge Guglielmo Leo accused the former Italian Premier of

In addition to the official 18 billion lire (10.5 million U.S.

it has been alleged that the former European champions paid an
extra 10 billion lire (6 million US dollars) under the table,
deposited in a bank in Switzerland, ANSA reported.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi denied any wrongdoing by him or the Milan team.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Growth Rates Predicted for African States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
said Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Uganda would continue their
robust growth this year while South Africa, Morocco and Nigeria
were set to record "more moderate" growth.
</P>
<P>
In its African Development Report, the bank said it cautiously
estimated that gross domestic product would expand by between
four and five percent, suggesting the strengthening of economic
growth in Africa, Business Day daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not say when the report was released.
</P>
<P>
The annual report said South Africa, Morocco and Nigeria were
likely to have their growth slowed by modest oil prices and the
contagion effects of the recent financial turmoil in Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Growth rate of Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Uganda was
about four percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank urged African countries to intensify their efforts to
diversify and expand their exports in the face of competition,
especially in primary exports such as cocoa, beans, timber,
coffee and cotton.
</P>
<P>
Drought, low savings (about 17 percent of GDP), social
conflicts and moody commodity prices conspired to put the brakes
on African economic growth last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also urged African countries to invest in human
capital which was crucial to economic growth and poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of stressing investment in human capital
emanates from the irreversible effects of failing to make such
investments," it said.
</P>
<P>
Once a generation was exposed to life without adequate health
care and schooling, "there is little that can be done during
their adulthood to reverse the damage."
</P>
<P>
Africa's challenges could be measured against the goals of the
development assistance committee of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
These include: cutting by half the number of people living in
poverty by 2005; reducing infant mortality rates by two-thirds;
and providing universal primary education in all countries by
2015.
</P>
<P>
The report said these goals could be pursued through growth
policies that promoted private sector development, built human
capital through efficient delivery of social services and
enhanced the magnitude and productivity of investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Water supply will be 500 million to
one billion cubic meters short of demand in next three years in
Beijing, China's capital city, and experts warned of a possible
water crisis around year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the city's water conservation office said water
resources in Beijing is between 3.6 billion to 4 billion cubic
meters, or less than 300 cubic meters per head. That is one eighth
of the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
The reserve of underground water, Beijing's main water
resource, is rapidly shrinking. For example, by the end of May
1997, underground water reserve was 768 million cubic meters less
than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, water consumption is increasing at a faster rate,
from 1.54 percent in 1995 to 4.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
If there should be droughts in next couple of years, Beijing
will probably meet with another water crisis, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's water conservation office is calling on residents to
save water and increase recycling of industrial waste
water. Currently, 84.7 percent of industrial waste water in
Beijing is recycled.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Simplifies Procedures to Lure Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Friday
announced that it has simplified procedures on the approval of
investment projects in a bid to lure back foreign and domestic
investment to the country.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Investment hamzah Haz, following meeting
with President B.J. Habibie, said foreign investment projects
worth less than 100 million U.S. dollars will only need the
approval of his office and not of the president as before.
</P>
<P>
Only those that are worth more than 100 million U.S. dollars
will be approved by the president, Hamzah said.
</P>
<P>
He said that domestic investment projects worth less than 10
billion rupiah (about one million U.S. dollars) will only need the
approval of the provincial office of Coordinating Body for
Investment, although his office will continue to handle those that
are worth more than 10 billion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
He said the move aims to draw back both foreign and domestic
investment, noting that foreign investment this month only reached
 200 million U.S. dollars, compared to 900 million U.S. dollars in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said, "the government hopes that
domestic capital would come back because much had been taken
abroad," following the political crisis which caused president
Soeharto to resign on May 21 as well as the riots in Jakarta from
May 13 to 15 during which more than 500 people were killed and
about 5,000 buildings destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends on Somber Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished the
week on a somber but mildly positive note after finding some
support Friday.
</P>
<P>
On its last trading day for the month, the currency closed at
62.34 U.S. cents, up a bit from 62.28 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The unit has dropped 2 U.S. cents since the end of April, and
earlier this week bottomed out at a new near-12 year low of 61.65
U.S. cents during offshore overnight trading.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank foreign exchange manager Peter Whitley said
the Australian dollar continued to be plagued by the Asian
contagion and would continue to be so for some time.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody perceives that this problem can be fixed up in weeks or
even months," Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
"In these circumstances, topside for the Australian dollar is
limited and there is no reason for it to suddenly turn around and
strengthen."
</P>
<P>
Whitley said the Australian dollar had held its ground in local
trade Friday despite being hampered by a surging U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"But upside is limited with the yen so weak."
</P>
<P>
At the close here the U.S. dollar was trading at 138.64 yen,
against 137.14 yen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts remain bearish on the outlook for the local currency
despite comments this week by Federal Treasurer Peter Costello
attempting to distance Australia from the economic problems in
Asia, ruling out further cuts to economic growth forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 86.41 yen at the close of the
day from 85.43 and 1.1108 German marks from 1.1090.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Crack Down on Islamic Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's police command has ordered
a massive crackdown on suspected militant Islamic groups after
Wednesday's bloody crash between police and the Maitaisine sect
in Lagos which left at least 12 dead and many wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Police Commissioner Alhaji Abubakar Tsav told
newsmen Thursday that the order from Inspector-General Alhaji
Ibrahim Coomassie is meant to avoid another violent clash at
Abule Taylor area on the outskirts of the Lagos metropolis.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Police Criminal Intelligence Bureau has
been directed to give details of the presence of hostile Islamic
groups in Lagos to enable the police to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
Tsav said an all out man-hunt is now out for Malam Mohammed
Adamu, the leader of the Maitaisine sect who is believed to be
wounded during Wednesday's shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Yakubu Uba, a deputy commissioner of police in charge
of the Lagos State Criminal Investigation Department, said they
are working to establish links between Adamu and other Maitaisine
sect groups in the north.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, though normalcy began to return to the Abule Taylor
area Thursday, some residents expressed fear of attacks by the
Maitaisine groups, which they said are scattered over all Lagos
and neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The National League of Christians, however, has praised the
police for curtailing the excesses of the fundamentalists and
urged all Christians to be law abiding and remain calm.

<HEADLINE> Total Suspended Particles Called Major Air Pollution Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Total Suspended Particles are still
the major air pollution problem in most Chinese cities, according
to the latest weekly air quality report released today by the
China Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
In the May 22-28 period, the country's major cities had better
air quality than the week before, according to the center, which
reported that total suspended particles remains a serious problem
in a large number of cities.
</P>
<P>
Total suspended particles are mainly caused by construction and
sandstorms, the center stated in the report.
</P>
<P>
China's weekly air report gives the air quality atmospheric
pollution index (API) of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide
(NOX) and total suspended particles (TSP).
</P>
<P>
Air quality is listed on five levels by the State Environmental
Protection Administration. An API from 0 to 50 is level I, meaning
excellent air quality; 51 to 100 is level II, or good quality; 101
to 200 is level III, or slight pollution; 201 to 300 is level IV,
or medium pollution; and above 300 is level V, or heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
This week's report shows that the north China city of Taiyuan
was the only city with medium air pollution, and the biggest
problem was with TSP.
</P>
<P>
Yinchuan, Hohhot, Guangzhou and Changchun had APIs exceeding
100, showing slight air pollution. Except Guangzhou, whose major
problem was NOX, the other three cities all suffered from TSP.
</P>
<P>
Beijing showed remarkable improvement in air quality, with its
API dropping to 92, ranking as good air quality together with
another 25 cities.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Beihai, Zhanjiang and Xiamen qualified
for excellent air quality in the period.

<P>
TOKYO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in Tokyo
Friday on increasingly gloomy prospects of the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues on the First Section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 125.77 points or 0.88 percent from
Thursday's close to finish at 15,670.78.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 2.24 points 0.18 percent to 1,221.49.

Turnover on the major section remained thin at an estimated 320
million shares, unchanged from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nikko Securities was Friday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the Nikkei index lost nearly 200 points at one
stage, discouraged by further deterioration of the Japanese economy,

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Retreats on Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus stock market took a
dive of 3.4 percent since last Thursday due to the uncertainty
looming on the political front, following the failure of the
U.S. peace mission early this month.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly market review prepared by the Cyprus
Investment and Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO), the CISCO
All-Share Index closed Thursday at 420.4 points, with weekly
losses of 14.8 points.
</P>
<P>
The retreat is attributed to an across the board decline, but
most importantly in the banking stocks. Bank of Cyprus and
Popular Bank are now back at the levels attained at the end of
March compared to their peak on April 30.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions this week amounted to 7.9
million Cyprus pounds (about 15.8 million U.S. dollars), from 8.2
million pounds (about 16.4 million dollars) the week
before.
</P>
<P>
U.S. presidential emissary Richard Holbrooke failed to bring
the two communities leaders back to the negotiating table during
his three-day diplomatic efforts early this month.

<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Raikal (Radical)
</P>
<P>
-- Addressing an international energy conference in Istanbul,
the largest city in Turkey, on Thursday, President of American
Eximbank James Harmon announced that the bank was ready to
provide financial support to the planned Baku-Ceyhan pipeline
project.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- A delegation composed of businessmen from Britain's largest
companies will come to Ankara next week to discuss economic
cooperation with Turkish government officials and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Yeni Yuzyil (New Century)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told his German
counterpart Klaus Kinkel Thursday in Luxembourg, where a foreign
ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was
held, that there won't be any change in Ankara's position toward
the European Union (EU) if the latter does not give up its
"discriminative attitude toward Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-EU relationship has been tense since the Muslim
country was expelled from the ranks of prospective candidates for

<HEADLINE> China's TV Giants Marching into Telecommunications Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Following the example of Hisense
and Panda, another color TV giant in China -- TCL Group Co. -- has
shown its interest in entering the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
By teaming up with Taiwan's GVC Co. Ltd., TCL recently set up
its first computer company, the TCL-GVC Computer Co. with a
first-phase investment of 125 million yuan. The new company will
be capable of producing PCs, main boards, monitors, laptops and
servers. It will also be involved in wireless telecommunications,
computer networks and semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
Economists observed that TCL's move has made it clear that
major Chinese home-appliance producers can grab a share of the
lucrative telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
Li Dongsheng, TCL president, was quoted as
saying: "Spearheading digital technology is driving up the
replacement rate of TV products. More crucially, the merging of
electrical, computer and telecom technologies has been loading
pressures on TV producers to consider their outcome."
</P>
<P>
The computer industry, which is growing at an annual rate of
more than 50 percent in China, has been chosen as a footboard to
enter the market.
</P>
<P>
TCL's cooperation with GVC, the world's second largest modem
supplier, is expected to put it among China's top five computer
companies in three years and the top three in five years,
according to Yang Weiqiang, chief executive of the new company.
</P>
<P>
He said the company will be capable of producing 400,000 PCs
annually. The first batch of TCL computers will enter the market
at the end of June.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Proclaimed Philippine President-Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress here Friday
proclaimed Vice President Joseph Estrada and senator Gloria
Macapagal Arroyo as the president-elect and the vice
president-elect, respectively, in the May 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Neptali Gonzales made the proclamation while
House Speaker Jose de Venecia congratulated the two winners in the
presidential and vice presidential races at a bicameral conference
at Congress.
</P>
<P>
The final official results released by a joint committee of
Congress showed that Estrada, the presidential candidate of the
main opposition the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of
Patriotic Filipino Masses), garnered 10,722,295 votes, about 39.8
percent of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
He led his nearest rival de Venecia with 6.43 million votes. De
Venecia, anointed by President Fidel Ramos as the standard bearer
of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party, conceded defeat to Estrada on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the vice presidential race, senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo
of the ruling party won 12,667,252 votes, 7.25 million votes ahead
of her closest rival, Estrada's running mate senator Edgardo
Angara.
</P>
<P>
According to the electoral procedure, Congress is responsible
for canvassing the certificates of canvass from 102 provinces and
cities and proclaiming the winners in the presidential and vice
presidential races while the Commission on Elections announces the
official results of the congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Elections is expected to proclaim the 12
winning senatorial candidates Friday despite having incomplete
results of the 102 certificates of canvass. The uncounted
certificates are believed not to affect the 12 candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines held its national and local elections on May 11
to choose a new president, a new vice president, 12 out of 24
senators, all 260 members of the House of Representatives, 78
governors and thousands of local officials and councilors.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 candidates ran for the presidency. Former first
lady Imelda Marcos quit a couple of days before the voting day and
called her supporters to vote for Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was banned by law to seek a second term and would step
down when his term ends on June 30. He has vowed to ensure the
smooth transition between the outgoing and the incoming
governments and agreed to form "a government of national unity"
with Estrada.

LOS ANGELES, May 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,500 scientists from

</P>
<P>
Attending the first annual meeting of the American Society of
Gene Therapy, 87 scientists from the United States, Canada, Europe
and Japan will speak at or chair scientific symposia and workshops.

The four-day conference will showcase a variety of projects

been slow and many projects remained at the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers, the discussions will center on
"vectors". The organisms, usually viruses, used to carry corrected
genes into defective cells. Other sessions will focus on AIDS and
immunology, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, genetic diseases,
cystic fibrosis and lung diseases, neurological disorders and stem
cells.

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs to Meet in Beirut for Common Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of nine Arab
countries along the Mediterranean are expected to meet here
Monday to devise a common strategy for next week's
European-Mediterranean Partnership summit in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries to attend the two-day meeting in Beirut are
Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco
and the Palestinian National Authority, the Daily Star newspaper
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab ministers will forge a common plan to thwart the
would-be attempts by Israel, which will also attend the
summit in Palermo, Italy, to separate regional politics from
economics.
</P>
<P>
"In Palermo there will be a confrontation with Israel, which
always wants economic profits and economic support from Europe but
refuses to allow the EU (European Union) to take part in the
(Mideast) peace process," Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz
said in a meeting with Lebanon's Journalists Union President
Melhem Karam on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Palermo, Israel will try to disconnect
political and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
But the Arab countries will ask the Palermo summit to use the
economic benefits of the program as a weapon to force Israel to
respect the principles of the peace process, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries have called for a more active EU role in the
Middle East peace process. They also call on the EU to force
Israel to make necessary compromises in its negotiations with them
and push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The European-Mediterranean Partnership consists of the 15
member states of the EU and 12 countries in the Mediterranean
basin which include the nine Arab countries, Mauritania, Israel
and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is aimed at fostering economic, political
and cultural ties and eventually creating a free-trade zone, was
launched in Barcelona, Spain in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Unemployment Rate Hits Record High in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's jobless rate continued rising
in April and hit another record of 4.1 percent since the end of
World War II, the Japanese Management and Coordination Agency said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage points from March
when the previous record of 3.9 percent was set, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The number of the jobless people increased 25.5 percent from a
year earlier to a record 2.90 million in April, with 1.72 million
men and 1.18 million women without job.
</P>
<P>
Noting that April is usually a month when employment increases
because many new graduates are entering companies for the first
time, an agency official called the results "very severe."
</P>
<P>
Underlining the bleak prospects, the Japanese Labor Ministry
said separately that the ratio of job offers to job seekers fell
to a seasonally adjusted 0.55 in April from 0.58 in March.
</P>
<P>
The ratio, an indicator of demand for labor, means only 55 jobs
were being offered for every 100 job seekers in the month. The
ratio stood 0.64 in January and 0.61 in February.

<HEADLINE> China's Disease-Hit Prawn Cultivation Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Prawn farming in China, which
suffered from severe epidemics six years ago, has been recovering
because of a newly developed technology.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, local researchers determined the
source and mechanism of the diseases, and have found ways to make
fast check-ups and diagnoses of cultivated prawns to prevent
future outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
Using the newly developed technology, a type of crab has been
raised by prawn farmers to prevent the infection.
</P>
<P>
The technology has played a big role in the revival of the
country's prawn industry, experts said. In 1997, the country
turned out 100,000 tons of prawns.
</P>
<P>
Since the '70s, China's coastal areas had invested more than 10
billion yuan in building 16 million hectares of prawn farming
ponds. In the peak years, the annual prawn output was more than
200,000 tons, valued at 700 million U.S. dollars, which made China
the largest prawn producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, however, devastating epidemics affected the coastal
areas. By 1996, the country's prawn production had dropped to an
historic low of 60,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Germ Bomb Made By Japan's Unit 731 on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The shell of a germ bomb,
manufactured by Unit 731 of the wartime Japanese army, has been on
display in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, found in Heilongjiang during an investigation of the
remains of Unit 731, was sent to the Northeast Martyrs Museum in
1959. It is the first time the museum has displayed the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The 8,750-gram bomb, made of light yellow ceramics, is 68
centimeters (cm) tall. Notches were cut into the shell to install
powder.
</P>
<P>
According to curator Liu Zhongyi, the bomb, once loaded with
fleas infected with bubonic plague, would explode in the air after
being thrown out of a flying plane, allowing the fleas to spread
the plague over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
Sources said thousands of Chinese people died from bubonic
plagues spread by Unit 731 in 1941.
</P>
<P>
Unit 731 belonged to the Japanese aggressor troop's Kwantung
Army, with its headquarters based in Harbin, during World War
II. The unit won a bad reputation for manufacturing germ weapons
based on experiments with living people.

<HEADLINE> LRA Rebels Escape UPDF Trap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The rebels of Joseph Kony's Lord
Resistance Army, who reportedly entered Uganda from Sudan in
April, have escaped the trap of Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) and are to converge in the northern district of Kitgum.
</P>
<P>
Friday's New Vision daily quoted military and security sources
as saying that Kony is likely to meet his top LRA commanders
Friday after their Muslim Juma prayers.
</P>
<P>
The regional police commander, Mr. Marshal Odur, said the
rebels, estimated at 800 in all, are possible to unite in Atut
for a long time hideout.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, Atut is their convergence point and the army
needs to check and protect that," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, in desperate shortage of food and medicines,
infiltrated the northern districts of Uganda to loot foodstuffs.
They ambushed vehicles along the Kitgum-Lira road by using
landmines.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF shelled and bombed the suspected rebel hideouts from
Wednesday to Thursday morning, but surrendering rebels said their
leader Kony narrowly escaped the intensive gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The police commander said due to the current mounting UPDF
pressure, the rebels have broken into small groups which evade
direct contact with the army.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent sharp turn this time, the rebels have refrained
from abducting and tergeting civilians as they have done in the
past, the report said.
</P>
<P>
To end the threat posed to the security in the north by the
12-year-long rebel activities, president Yoweri Museveni went
there recently to encourage the army and army units from other
districts have been deployed in Gulu and Kitgum in a massive
campaign agaist the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The overseer in the Ministry of Defense Salim Saleh moved his
office there in April to guide the decisive campaign in person.

<P>
GUIYANG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Work on a landslide and mud-rock
flow warning system has recently been completed along the Yangtze
River, China's longest.
</P>
<P>
The warning system took eight years to complete. It comprises
the headquarters and 12 stations run by provincial, municipal and
county levels with 59 warning centers. The first station went into
operation in 1990. They locate at the lower reaches of the Jinsha
River and the upper reaches of Jialing and Wujiang rivers, which
are major tributaries of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
So far, operational warning stations and centers have
successfully predicted 73 mud-rock flows and landslips, avoiding
an estimated 18,000 casualties and 170 million yuan in losses,
said Wang Yusheng, a water conservation expert.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 warning centers will be added to the warning system in
the near future, Wang added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Fall at This Week's Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices continued
to fall at this week's auction sales, Australian exporters said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
But prices did not plunge as deeply as last week's significant
falls, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said in its
weekly market review.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator ended the week at 600 Australian
cents (372 U.S. cents) a kg of clean wool, down six Australian
cents.
</P>
<P>
Although the western market indicator dropped 26 Australian
cents to close at 549 Australian cents (340 U.S. cents) a kg,
there were no sales at Fremantle near western Australia's coastal
city of Perth to support prices.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) national indicator slid 13
Australian cents to finish at 622 Australian cents (385 U.S.
cents) a kg.
</P>
<P>
About 27.7 percent of the 81,060 bales offered were passed in.
</P>
<P>
"The market environment essentially remains unchanged with
buyers finding it increasingly difficult to write new business,
particularly with European customers who had provided strength in
the market earlier in the season," the review said.
</P>
<P>
"The quietness in Europe is now compounding the ongoing
difficulties arising from the subdued demand situation in our
major Asian markets."
</P>
<P>
About 67,600 bales are rostered for sale in Sydney and
Melbourne next week.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Economy on Steady Rise: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's economy is now on a
steady rise as a positive result of the International Monetary
Fund's (IMF) financial aid to the country, Kazakh Premier Nurlan
Balgimbaev said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting IMF Managing Director Michael
Camdessus, Balgimbaev said Kazakhstan's gross industrial product
in the first quarter of 1998 increased three percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was declining notably, while the average wage
increased by 20 percent, and investments also rose sharply, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Balgimbaev noted problems still existed in the economy, in
particular laws on tax levying were yet to be perfected.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus spoke highly of the progress made by Kazakhstan in
achieving economic development and curbing inflation. But he
hoped Kazakhstan could lower its import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
However, Balgimbaev said he believed it was not a simple
question of lowering tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan must protect its manufacturers as well as safeguard
the country's export interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev met
Camdessus. The president thanked Camdessus for IMF's financial aid
to further help Kazakhstan's market economy reform.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus was on his third visit to Kazakhstan following his
visit to Kyrgyzstan.

<HEADLINE> Half of U.S. Population Overweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 28 (Xinhua) -- More than half of American
citizens are overweight and one out of four is obese, according to
the latest issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
"The prevalence of overweight has risen dramatically over the
past two decades and, if this trend persists, the entire
U.S. adult population could be overweight within a few
generations," reported Dr. James Hill, director of the Colorado
Clinical Nutrition Research Unit, and Dr. John Peters of the
Procter and Gamble Company in Cincinnati, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
They said the root cause is a sedentary lifestyle combined with
the ready availability of tasty, calorie-and-fat-rich food. "This
is especially evident in the so-called fast food restaurants where
super sizing of menu items is commonplace," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that genetic factors are not to blame for
oversized Americans, saying that genes can not have changed
substantially in the last two generations.
</P>
<P>
They offered several options to prevent obesity.
</P>
<P>
First, obesity must be recognized as the serious public health
problem.
</P>
<P>
Second, consumers must be educated to eat foods low in fat,
such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains in restaurants and
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
Third, schools need to schedule more activity for youngsters,
and children need to be encouraged to eat low-calorie, low-fat
foods too.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Nairobi Downpour Rises to 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people have been
confirmed dead in the mid-week torrential rains and flash floods
from Nairobi River in the Kenyan capital, shooting up the toll
from originally estimated 3.
</P>
<P>
Five workers were hit by lightning during the rains which
lasted almost eight hours from Wednesday evening, latest local
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The five victims -- one woman and four men -- died in a car in
Nairobi's Industrial Area. They were found seated in their car
after the storm subsided.
</P>
<P>
"We suspect they were struck by lightning," said police.
</P>
<P>
At least 200 homes were destroyed at that night. Trucks and
cars were swept away by floods. Flights cancelled or delayed and
thousands of people left stranded by the sudden downpour.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi Thursday sent messages of condolence
to the families of the people who perished.
</P>
<P>
So far the police are combing the Nairobi River which burst
its banks during the storm. It was said at least two matatus
(buses) full of passengers and another vehicle was swept away by
the river. Several bodies have been fished out of the Nairobi
Dam.
</P>
<P>
The city was paralyzed for hours in the reportedly historic
downpour which began at 5:30 p.m. local time at the height of the
evening rush hour and continued unabated until 10:30 p.m.. Roads
were blocked or washed away, power lines crashed, causing
blackouts and telephone links were cut.
</P>
<P>
Even Moi was caught up in the traffic jam Wednesday evening.
He surpriseed staff and guests at the New Stanley Hotel in
downtown when he popped in and took shelter.
</P>
<P>
The downpour, which was accompanied by thunderstorm, threw
evening traffic into chaos and left many commuters stranded and
drenched with rain at many bus stops. Hundreds of workers walked
home after a futile wait for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Bars and restaurants experienced an upsurge in business as
hundreds of residents poured in, waiting for traffic to clear.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, a hailstorm hit the city, causing a lot of
damage.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- World champion Maurice Greene
of the United States and Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago have
set their sights firmly on the men's 100-meter world record in
Sunday's Prefontaine Classic Grand Prix athletics meet in Eugene,
Oregon of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based training partners Greene and Boldon, who
have clocked an all time thrid-fastest time of 9.86 seconds each,
are threatening to beat Donovan Bailey's 100 meters world record
of 9.84 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"The record can go at any time," Greene said. "We're so close
to it right now. All we have to do is to run the perfect race,
and the record is gone."
</P>
<P>
"If Ato and I run like we're supposed to, we will both go
under the world record at Prefontaine," Greene predicted.
</P>
<P>
The women's 100 meters world record of 10.49 is also
vulnerable at the meet.
</P>
<P>
Florence Griffith-Joyner's mark set 10 years ago is no longer
an unmovable figure for American sprint queen Marion Jones, who
shocked the world early this month in the fastest women
challenge race in China's Chengdu with a fabulous time of 10.71.
</P>
<P>
The Carl Lewis styled girl has promised to shatter the
incredible record sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
"The coopetation we need is from the Oregon weather, and the
wind," Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
World and Olympic champion Allen Johnson leads the 110-meter
hurdles field with an eye always firmly on Briton Colin Jackson's
1993 world record of 12.91 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"My training every year is such that I feel that I am prepared
to break the world record," Johnson, who shares the U.S. record
of 12.92 with Roger Kingdom, said this week.
</P>
<P>
Johnson will also run the 200 meters in a field featuring
U.S. superstar Michael Johnson.
</P>
<P>
In the men's mile, Kenyan Daniel Komen is aiming at the
fastest mark ever on American soil -- 3:50.86 by Noureddine
Morceli of Algeria in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, there have been 55 sub-four-minute
miles recorded in the Prefontaine Classic.
</P>
<P>
America's distance doyenne Mary Slaney will run the women's
5,000 meters in her first high-profile race since she was
exonerated last year of doping allegations over high testerone
levels.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Today's Economic Daily reported the
first dumping case under China's Price Law which became effective
May 1.
</P>
<P>
A supermarket in Shanghai was fined 3,000 yuan (361 U.S.
dollars) for selling 500-gram "White Cat" brand detergent at less
than its cost.
</P>
<P>
Other supermarkets in Shanghai first thought the manufacturer
had made preferential price arrangements. However, after
confirming that the manufacturer was supplying the detergent to
all retailers at the same price, the supermarket was reported to
Shanghai price control authorities.
</P>
<P>
Further investigation confirmed that the supermarket sold the
detergent at 2.5 yuan per 500 grams while the wholesale price is
2.67 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that the dumping practice seems to benefit
the consumer, but it results in market disorder and eventually
harms the public interest.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Worldbest Kama Machinery
Co. Ltd. (WKM), a major farm machinery supplier in China, plans to
issue 270 million "B shares" for overseas investors this summer.
</P>
<P>
The shares, to be issued at 0.276 U.S. dollars each and at an
estimated profit-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 6.5, are being
underwritten by the China Securities Co. Ltd. and Core
Pacific-Yamaichi International (HK) Limited. They are scheduled
for listing in July or August.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said the share issue is expected to inject fresh
vitality into China's sluggish B-share market. B shares refer to
those issued by Chinese companies but reserved for overseas
investors only.
</P>
<P>
WKM, a leading manufacturer of farming vehicles and tractors,
is controlled by the Worldbest Group, which is a enterprise group
founded in 1992. It has assets of more than 9.7 billion yuan now.
</P>
<P>
The funds to be raised through the share issue, an expected 76
million U.S. dollars, would be invested in 15 projects to help
retain or expand WKM's market share, according to general manager
Lu Mingren.
</P>
<P>
WKM is striving for a post-tax profit of 256 million yuan and
foreign exchange earnings of 50 million U.S. dollars on sales of
3.8 billion yuan (466 million U.S. dollars), Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu's five-year business objectives include raising his
company's annual production capacity of three-wheeled farm
transport vehicles to 300,000, four-wheeled vehicles to 100,000,
four-wheeled light tractors to 200,000, and single-cylinder
diesels to one million.
</P>
<P>
Following the scheduled share listing, WKM will also establish
a technical research-and-development center in Shanghai and
improve its national sales network, the general manager said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Resolves to Boost Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Officials in Shanghai, China's
leading economic and financial center, are resolved to boost
industrial growth despite a slowdown in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Shanghai's industrial output
value was up 8.6 percent year-on-year in the first three months, a
significant decline from the double-digit growth rate for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are determined to overcome difficulties and meet a
10 percent increase in the city's industrial output value for the
first half of this year," a municipal official said.
</P>
<P>
This will lay the foundation for the targeted 11-to-12 percent
increase for the whole of 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts quoted official data showing that Shanghai's industrial
slowdown has come mainly as a result of sluggish demand and the
effects of the Asian financial crisis.

<P>
The official said that Shanghai will take measures to cash in
on the rising residential housing market and the burgeoning market
in the less-developed areas in central and western China to ensure
an upturn in industrial growth.
</P>

Shanghai is also readjusting its export strategy, market and
product mix to minimize the impacts of the Asian financial crisis
and to tap new markets in South Africa, the Middle East, Europe
and the Americas, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that efforts are also being made to develop products
with a high added value and high technical content.

stepping up its effort to develop high technology and the
information, medical and new material industries. City officials
also have placed a priority on strengthening internal management
to increase efficiency.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Food Giant Opens First China Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hormel Foods Corp. of the
United States officially opened its first joint-venture in China
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese partner of the joint venture, which is named the
Shanghai Hormel Foods Co. Ltd., is Shanghai Da-Chang Meat
Processing Complex, the largest meat plant in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of 11 million U.S. dollars, the joint venture expects
to annually produce 10,000 tons of frozen and vacuum-packed
meats such as sausages, ham and bacon.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture's products have been on sale in more than 500
supermarkets, restaurants and hotels since it went into trial
production in November.
</P>
<P>
Hormel's second China venture, built at a cost of 20 million
U.S. dollars in the Chinese capital, will begin operation soon.
</P>
<P>
Joel Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of Hormel,
said that the American food manufacturer is keen to turn China
into one of its largest markets in the world. He said that China's
1.3 billion people consume an average of 27 kilograms (kg) of meat
per person each year, nine kg more than U.S. residents.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1891, Hormel is now the largest multinational
U.S. manufacturer of meat products with more than 10,000 employees
worldwide. Its 1,600 varieties of meat products in 275 trademarks,
such as Dinty Moore and Spam, are sold in more than 60 countries,
with sales exceeding 3.2 billion U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Overseas Financing for Hydropower Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Water Resources
(MWR) plans to set up an overseas investment fund to finance the
country's cash-strapped medium and small hydropower projects.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the MWR said the ministry will mandate that the
Bank of China (BOC) launch and manage the investment fund, while
MWR will recommend projects and offer information and other
services for the fund.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China International Holdings Ltd., BOC's investment arm
in London, together with Hong Kong-based First Eastern Investment
Group, are making preparations for the initial offering of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the fund has been ratified in principle by the
People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Targeting global strategic investors with interest in
hydropower projects, the planned fund has found strong interest
with international conglomerates and transnational corporations.
</P>
<P>
This move is expected to boost the construction of China's
hydropower projects, with an estimated usable capacity of 378
million kilowatts, of which one-fourth are medium and small plants
with an installed capacity below 250,000 kilowatts located in
mountainous and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China plans to increase the installed capacity of hydroelectric
stations in rural areas by 10 million kilowatts during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and achieved electrification in 300
counties, for which a total investment of 100 billion yuan is
needed.
</P>
<P>
However, four-to-five billion yuan will be needed each year to
meet the target.
</P>
<P>
Experts said encouraging foreign investors to participate in
hydropower construction could be a significant source to make up
the fund shortage. So far, 800 million U.S. dollars of foreign
funds have been used in constructing rural hydropower projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the MWR has recommended 52 hydropower
and water supply projects to fund sponsors. With a total installed
capacity of three million kilowatts and a daily water supply
capacity of 9.5 million tons, these projects would cost about 3.5
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Provinces Lead China in Mobile Phone Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 percent of China's
mobile telephones are in five of the country's coastal provinces,
statistics from the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) show.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province in south China and Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu
and Shandong provinces in east China account for 41.6 percent of
the total number of mobile telephone users in the country, MII
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The five provinces had 6.9 million mobile telephone users by
the end of April, compared with a national total of 16.73 million.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, 35 percent of the newly
increased number of mobile telephone users were in the five
coastal provinces. The provinces had signed up 1.21 million new
mobile telephone users during the period.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has the largest crowd of mobile telephone users in
the country, which numbered 2.75 million by April. The ratio of
mobile phone users to its population is 39 for every 1,000
residents, the highest among other provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
China now has the third largest population of mobile phone
users in the world. The number of mobile telephone users is
increasing at a rate of 150 percent every year.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunication authorities predict the country will far
exceed the target of having 20 million mobile telephone users by
2000.

<HEADLINE> Early Removal of Sanctions Against Iraq Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
today called for an early lifting of United Nations sanctions
against Iraq and reaffirmed China's position within the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with special envoy Amir Mohammed Rashid sent
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Qian urged the United Nations
to give an objective and just evaluation over weapons inspection
in Iraq to conclude this issue and lead to a final dismantling of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Rashid delivered to Qian an oral message from President Saddam
to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Saddam congratulated the Chinese
people on their continuous progress and appreciated China's active
role in the United Nations and its Security Council, and stressed
the further reinforcement of relations with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rashid also briefed Qian on Iraq's implementation of relevant
U.N. resolutions, and the latest development of weapons inspection
work. He expressed appreciation over China's principled stance on
the Iraqi issue, and said Iraq would continue to cooperate with
the U.N. Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the United Nations would transfer
weapons inspection into long-term monitoring to end weapons
inspections at an earlier date and remove sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is deeply concerned with the suffering
of the Iraqi people caused by the sanctions, and is paying close
attention to the Iraqi issue, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Iraq should carry out relevant resolutions
in a comprehensive and practical manner, but Iraq's national
sovereignty, territorial integrity and its security concerns
should also be respected.
</P>
<P>
Qian spoke highly of the memorandum of understanding reached
between Iraq and the U.N. Secretary General and Iraq's cooperative
spirit in implementing relevant U.N. resolutions, and said he
hoped that Iraq would continue its cooperation with the United
Nations and the international community.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- House leasing in the largest
Vietnamese city of Ho Chi Minh City has slumped in recent months,
the Vietnam News newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Occupancy rates of high-rise office buildings throughout the
city declined to 20-30 percent. The city has more than 50
high-rise office and apartment buildings for leasing.
</P>
<P>
The situation has brought several local entrepreneurs to the
brink of bankruptcy, and lessors have had to rent or sell their
properties at low prices, the English-language daily said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of several high-rise buildings has been
temporarily stopped as investors, most of them from Singapore,
Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan, stopped
injecting more capital.
</P>
<P>
Property developers attributed the slump to the oversupply of
high-rise buildings and the influence of the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Urged to Confess Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Member of Iran's conservative
Guardians Council Ayatollah Khazali has strongly called on Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami to "publicly and unequivocally"
confess and correct his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this mistake will immediately be corrected, I request
our president to declare this mistake unequivocally," the Iranian
official news agency IRNA on Friday quoted Khazali as saying
Thursday. However, the IRNA did not mention where Khazali made the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the president must frankly admit his mistakes at
a public assembly, "or else I fear a slap on the face by God and
by the people."
</P>
<P>
Khazali was referring to the celebration rally last Saturday by
tens of thousands of Khatami's supporters in Tehran University to
mark the anniversary of Khatami's landslide victory in
the presidential elections in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The crowd applauded Khatami for his open-minded policies by
clapping hands and whistling, while calling for resignation of the
conservative judiciary head, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, and reforms
on the country's radio, television and security forces.
</P>
<P>
The celebration angered the hard-liners who described the
cheerful action in support of Khatami as "desecration of the
Islamic mourning month of Moharram," during which the Shiite
Muslims usually stop all kinds of cheerful actions in order to
mourn the third Imam Hussein, who was killed in Karbala, southern
Iraq, over 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by his supporters, Khatami strongly called for
respect to laws and the constitution, particularly by those who
have powers at hands.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's speech was interpreted as a criticism against the
conservatives, who still control the country's important organs
such as the Majlis or parliament, the Guardians Council, state
radio and television, as well as the armed forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- International freight transport
franchise business has been booming in south China's Guangdong
Province in the past decade as its foreign trade has maintained
double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
The province now stands second in the sector after Shanghai,
the country's largest industrial center, with 163 related firms of
various ownerships competing in such fields as foreign trade,
communications, civil aviation, post and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The 163 businesses last year handled some 20 million tons of
cargo, involving 1.79 billion yuan in total volume and 182 million
yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development of the province's foreign trade, which
totaled more than 130 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, has been
encouraging the sector. Customs statistics show that last year's
imports and exports via local ports amounted to 145 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong-based businesses now turn to other places to develop
cargo services. Some of the franchise enterprises have opened
branches in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. A firm
has even obtained the approval to carry surplus cargo
at neighboring Hong Kong airport, and then ship it to Europe and
America.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and domestic counterparts are also participating in the
effort. In Guangzhou alone, 13 overseas-funded franchise
businesses have begun operation, and another 200 have opened
representative offices.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to establish an enterprise association this
year to improve management, according to the local foreign trade
and economic cooperation commission.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Seen to Rebound in 2nd Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy, which slowed
down considerably in the first quarter of 1998, is expected to
rebound by the second half of the year with the El Nino phenomenon
fading and the Asian financial crisis dying down.
</P>
<P>
This projection was made Friday by Philippine Socio-economic
Planning Secretary Cielito Habito at a news conference on the
country's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy, as measured by the gross domestic
product (GDP), grew by 1.7 percent for the first quarter, a sharp
decline from a high of 5.5 percent in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The gross national product (GNP), adjusted for inflation, rose
by 2.5 percent, much lower than the year-ago level of 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Habito predicted major improvements in the economy during
the second half of the year due to the end of the El Nino
phenomenon, declining interest rates and a stable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the El Nino drought and the steadily improving
macroeconomic environment, and barring any further destabilizing
developments, we believe that the economy has already weathered
the worst part of the crisis," Habito told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Although some lingering effects are likely to remain for the
rest of the year, the economy is nonetheless anticipated to
rebound by the second semester of 1998," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Habito did not expect the economy to improve in the second
quarter this year as the El Nino-induced drought continued to
affect agriculture and the high interest rate regime remained.
</P>
<P>
In view of the slowed-down first quarter growth, Habito said,
the real GNP is targeted to increase by an average of 3.2 to 4.5
percent for the next three quarters to reach the full year target
of 3 to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slower economic growth in the first quarter was attributed
to a sharp decline in the agriculture sector due to the El Nino,
and a considerable slowdown in the manufacturing and private
construction sectors caused by the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector continued to experience poor production
due to the wide-spread effect of the El Nino-induced dry spell.
The overall growth in the agriculture, fishery and forestry sector
registered a 3.5-percent decline due to a general drop of crop
production.
</P>
<P>
Industry registered a merely 1.3-percent growth with the
financial crisis taking its toll on the construction and
manufacturing sectors.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis, El Nino Take Toll on  Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy decelerated
significantly in the first quarter of 1998 due to the Asian
financial crisis and the lingering effects of the El Nino
phenomenon, Socio-economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) for the first
quarter eased to 1.7 percent from a high of 5.5 percent in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The gross national product (GNP) rose by 2.5 percent thanks to
the higher remittance flows from overseas workers as a result of
higher peso-dollar exchange rate. But the figure is a much lower
than the year-ago level of 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
With population growth estimated at 2.3 percent, the real per
capita GDP registered a 0.5 percent decline, the first time in the
past 20 quarters. Per capita GNP increased minimally by 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Habito attributed the slower economic growth to a sharp decline
in the agriculture sector due to the El Nino, and a considerable
slowdown in the manufacturing and private construction sectors
caused by the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector continued to experience poor production
due to the wide-spread effect of the El Nino-induced dryspell. The
overall growth in the agriculture, fishery and forestry sector
registered a 3.5 percent decline due to a general drop of crop
production.
</P>
<P>
Industry registered only a 1.3 percent growth due to the
financial crisis on the construction and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
But the aggregate service sector sustained a 4.9 percent growth
to carry the economy during the period.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, exports and personal consumption
expenditures stirred the economy. Total exports of goods and
services expanded by 11.6 percent during the first quarter of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Rice Institute Calls for Safeguarding Biodiversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI) Friday called for safeguarding the
biodiversity of rice landscapes to ensure humanity's food supply
and the Earth's health.
</P>
<P>
IRRI Director General Dr. Robert Havener underscored the need
to maintain the balance of biodiversity in the institute's 1997-98
Corporate Report.
</P>
<P>
"The permanency of the food base on which we depend, today and
for generations to come, depends on caring for and wisely using
the genetic diversity of rice and the natural resources of its
landscape," he said.
</P>
<P>
Havener added that cooperation in conserving, using and sharing
rice genetic resources and developing ways to make use of
biodiversity for sustainable pest management can make enormous
contributions to the well-being of humanity.
</P>
<P>
The report described how IRRI took responsibility in conserving
and sharing the wealth of rice genetic diversity as an insurance
for food security in feeding today's nearly 3 billion people and
the expected 4.6 billion people in 2025 with rice as their stable
food.
</P>
<P>
It also explained how advances in biotechnology steadily
increase IRRI scientists' abilities to use genes of wild rice to
improve cultivated rice with a view to creating high-yielding rice
plants capable of withstanding harsh environments and pests.
</P>
<P>
IRRI is a non-profit international agricultural research and
training center that carries out rice and rice-related research
and is concerned about maintaining and increasing rice production
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
IRRI's goal is to improve the well-being of present and future
generations of rice farmers and consumers, particularly those with
low incomes.

<HEADLINE> New Opportunities Seen for Wine Production in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- As more and more Chinese drinkers
are turning to wine, China's wine industry has a good opportunity
for development.
</P>
<P>
This is the view of the organizing committee of the "Third
China Wine Culture Festival," which is scheduled for January of
1999.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 only, more than 100 new wineries were built, bringing
the total number to more than 270.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to meet the growing demand for high-quality dry
wine, China began in the early '90s to reduce the production of
ordinary wine and increase the output of dry wine and brandy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, though annual output of wine declined to 200,000
tons from 300,000 tons, more high-grade dry wines and red wines
have come to market.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many grape-growing areas with potential have
been hot investment spots for overseas wineries.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by "China News Pictorial" and Great Wall Wine
Co. Ltd., the January festival will feature exhibitions,
symposiums and parties.

UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States deplored
Pakistan's decision to test nuclear explosive devices, Bill
Richardson, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The tests further raise tensions in South Asia and undermine
the global consensuses on nonproliferation. The test made by
Pakistan is a huge mistake," Richardson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore the action which we think could raise tensions in
South Asia and accelerate the arms race. We call on the
Governments of India and Pakistan not to conduct any further tests
and stop creating tensions in the region, and to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that India tested first and Pakistan was
responding. This is no excuse for the test. We are concerned
about the developments in South Asia. We urge restraints from all
sides.
</P>
<P>
"We will be seeking a proper Security Council action which we
think should be a multilateral, multi-national response to reduce
tensions in South Asia," Richardson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's National Economic
Council (NEC) has approved the 1998-99 annual development plan
(ADP) with an outlay of 136 billion taka (about 2.96 billion U.S.
dollars), press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The approval was given Thursday at an NEC meeting presided over
by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also approved the revised ADP of 122 billion taka
(about 2.65 billion dollars) for the current fiscal year (July
1997 - June 1998), slashing 6 billion taka (about 130 million
dollars) from actual allocation of 128 billion taka (about 2.78
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the new development budget has been
estimated at 6.3 percent against anticipated growth of 5.6 percent
in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 1998-99 ADP budget, 72.6 billion taka (about 1.58
billion dollars) will be mobilized from domestic resources with 58
billion taka (about 1.26 billion dollars) as project aid and 5.4
billion taka (117.4 million dollars) from food aid.
</P>
<P>
As for the revised ADP, the reports said, local resources of
65.2 billion taka (about 1.42 billion dollars) were involved while
project aid was 51.1 billion taka (about 1.11 billion dollars) and
food aid was 5.7 billion taka (about 124 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Thai Image Building Campaign Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- An international advertising
campaign launched by the Board of Investment (BOI) of Thailand has
proved successful in rebuilding Thailand's image, a BOI survey
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, called "Thailand: on the Road to Recovery", was
staged in the last quarter of 1997. It ran exclusively in Time
Warner's media properties, including magazines like Time, Fortune,
Asiaweek, President and Sawasdee, as well as CNN International.
</P>
<P>
A survey of readers of Fortune by independent firm European
Data and Research before and after the campaign revealed that
awareness of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s rescue
package increased after the advertisement blitz.
</P>
<P>
Before the campaign, only 66 percent of respondents were aware
of IMF's role. The figure jumped to 85 percent after the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was also successful in achieving desired
investment objectives, since 9.8 percent more respondents said
they would import products from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Respondents who said they would locate a manufacturing facility
in Thailand increased 13.3 percentage points to 34 percent of the
total respondents, while 37 percent said they would invest in
Thailand, an increase of 23.3 percentage points from before the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that Thailand was perceived as having
stronger prospects compared with South Korea and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Asked to respond to the question, "Is the government becoming
more open to changes?", 46 percent were in the affirmative for
Thailand, followed by 37 percent for South Korea and 30 percent
for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In terms of investment climate, Thailand is rated 2.85 on a
scale of one to five, decreasing only 0.35 percent from the
pre-survey. South Korea and Malaysia experienced sharp fall of
10.19 percent and 13.25 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The results were based on pre- and post-campaign studies
conducted among the subscribers of Fortune Global Finance edition
in Japan, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 372 respondents of the pre-campaign survey and the
378 respondents after were top managers or department heads or
managers.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the success of this campaign, BOI
Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon said a new campaign, branding
Thailand, focusing on improving the image of local products, will
be launched soon.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Stocks Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rice stocks have
declined because the stocks obtained from domestic output would
fall short of the target of 1 million tons this year, local press
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted logistic agency Bulog Chairman Beddu Amang
as saying that because of poor harvests, rice stocks obtained from
domestic output since the start of the year have only amounted to
87,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, Bulog's rice stocks now stood at 2.1
million tons, compared with the 2.5 million tons two weeks ago,
Amang said, adding that the agency would guarantee sufficient
supply of basic commodities through imports.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Food and Horticulture A. M. Saefuddin said
recently that the country needed to import another 2 million tons
of rice to increase stocks.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought which affected the country last year has
affected the output of commodities such as rice, coffee, rubber
and cocoa. Locusts also hit rice fields in Lampung province in
Sumatera last month.

MEXICO CITY, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The gross sales in Argentina's supermarkets in
the first four months of this year were up 11.8 percent from the
same period last year, said a report by the National Statistics
and Census Institute (Indec).
</P>
<P>
In April alone, the sales increased 13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- The First Technology Fair-Exhibition of Nicaragua,
Expomer 98, will be held May 28-31 in the Olof Palme Conventions
Center of Managua.
</P>
<P>
About 25 companies including JVC, Sanyo, Atlas, Oracle, Compaq,
Toshiba, Triplite and Lanier will participate the four-day event.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica's coffee production in the 1998-99
season will reduce by nine percent, to 3.07 million bags (46
kilograms per bag), as compared with the output of the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
That means a drop of 39 million dollars in income, sources
close to the Coffee Institute (Icafe) said.
</P>
<P>
Icafe chief executive official Guillermo Canet attributed the
drop to a cyclic reduction of the harvest which occurs every two
years, as well as to the effect of the "El Nino" climate
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil exported 197,600 tons of chickens in the
first three months of this year, down 10 percent from the same
period last year, said a report of the Brazilian Poultry Exporters
Association.
</P>
<P>
It said the exports brought about 229.7 million U.S. dollars
income, 25 percent less than the figure for the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- Panama's insurance market represented three
percent of the country's gross domestic product, Carlos Gonzalez,

SANTIAGO -- Chile's current account deficit in the first
quarter of this year grew to 905 million dollars, compared with
the 155 million dollars surplus registered in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The increased deficit was attributed to a drop in prices of
exports and an increase in internal expenditures.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil's pork exports in the first four months of
this year totalled 53.7 million dollars, up 48 percent over the
same period of 1997, said the Brazilian Pork Exporters Association.

material for children. But their pride shows in their comments.
</P>
<P>
"The library is the very place we all like to stay," said
Gesang Ciren, head of the village, which is nearly 60 kilometers
away from Lhasa, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The library has the only antenna dish in the village, which
enables the villagers to watch recreational TV programs. Tibetan
versions of domestic and foreign films are the villagers' favorites.
</P>
<P>
The library also hosts training courses on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday to teach the villagers farm skills and inform them of
state policies and laws. It is also the site of the village
congress.
</P>
<P>
Semu is only one of more than 350 villages in the autonomous
region to open their own libraries in recent years. A regional
government official told Xinhua that Tibet is making efforts to
set up more rural libraries across the region.
</P>
<P>
Normally, a village library's television set is donated by the
county or township government, while its books are mainly from
individual donors. The library buildings are constructed at
village expense.
</P>
<P>
The libraries have played a big role in promoting cultural and
ethnic progress among rural Tibetans, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the village's average per-capital annual income
exceeded 2,400 yuan, compared with the region's average of 1,040
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua's Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua exported 286 million
U.S. dollars worth of goods in the first four months of 1998, a 12
percent increase over the same period last year, according to the
country's Exports Processing Center (Cetrex).
</P>
<P>
Cetrex Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Illescas said the good
performance of coffee and other agricultural sectors made up for
the drop in grain harvest brought by drought.
</P>
<P>
He said Nicaragua's exports maintained their growth thanks to
larger volumes of traditional items as well as higher
international prices.
</P>
<P>
Notable sectors included gold, coffee, sugar, shrimp, cattle
and dairy products, which substantially increased their export
volumes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 907,452 bags of coffee were exported at a unit price
of 153 dollars in the January-April period this year, compared
with 643,170 bags at a unit price of 132 dollars in the year-ago
period.
</P>
<P>
Illescas predicted that if the export momentum continued, the
country's 1998 export total could increase by 20 percent, which
means some 900 million dollars in hard currency terms.

<HEADLINE> No Major Party Rivals for House Members in November Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-nine incumbents,
including 50 republicans and 29 democrats in the U.S. House of
Representative, will have no major party rivals so far, while
republicans and democrats fight for control of the House.
</P>
<P>
"Both parties, I believe, have made a decision to concentrate
on really competitive districts" this fall, the Associated Press
quoted Representative Martin Frost of Texas, who heads the
democratic campaign effort in the House.
</P>
<P>
Frost's counterpart for the republicans, Representative John
Linder, said the republicans did not recruit candidates in
districts where democrats are shoo-ins for re-election, many of
whom are blacks or Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
He cited other reasons such as a good economy for the unusual
number of unopposed lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
For whatever reason, the list runs from well-known lawmakers
such as Majority Leader Dick Armey, to those with no national
profile such as first-term legislators.
</P>
<P>
Strikingly, 18 Florida lawmakers -- out of a total of 23 --
have no major party rival.
</P>
<P>
The list, already the longest in recent memory, is certain to
grow. Filing deadlines have passed in only 31 states, accounting
for 315 of the nation's 435 congressional districts. At the
current rate, the number is likely to approach 100.
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons, including the fact that congressional
districts were last redrawn for the 1992 elections, and many
incumbents have had several years to become entrenched.
</P>
<P>
Republicans contend the large number of democratic vacancies is
evidence of poor recruitment and a faltering effort to challenge
republican control of the House.
</P>
<P>
Frost disagreed vehemently. "There aren't any (competitive)
districts where we failed to field a candidate," he said in an
interview, although he conceded party elders "wish we had a
stronger" challenger in some districts.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, republicans in particular, hope to persuade
their sure-fire winners to donate liberally to contenders in
tougher races.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Attend Anti-Drug World Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez will attend the June 8-10 Anti-drug World Summit in New
York, which is sponsored by the United Nations (UN).
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Rojas said
Thursday that the president will stress international cooperation
in tackling drug-trafficking issues. Costa Rica expects the
summit to generate strategies and methods to strengthen
multilateral collaboration in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is used as a pipeline for transporting cocaine by
international drug trafficking groups. Police have seized in
recent months nearly three tons of cocaine and dismantled two
organizations that were transporting drugs through its territory
to Guatemala, where the drugs were forwarded to the United States
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Central American countries have become a source and corridor
for large amounts of cocaine, which are taken from production
centers in Colombia to International consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
The role that consumer countries have played in the laundering
of drug money also causes concern for Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Costa Rica has a special interest in
taking part in the U.N. summit because it intends to strengthen
its multilateral cooperation in the war against drug trafficking
and related crimes. enditem

<P>
NANJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Areas along the mighty Yangtze
River in east China's Jiangsu Province have been on the alert
against possible grave floods.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the El Niqo weather phenomenon, Jiangsu reported
an abnormal climate this spring with the amount of rainfall 2.5
times normal in the province's southern parts. The largest-ever
spring flood occurred on the trunk of the Yangtze in March.
</P>
<P>
Official forecasts predict that there will be two rain belts in
China during the coming flood season, with one along the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze, which covers southern Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
To counter possible floods, Jiangsu has arranged 88 million
yuan in funds for flood prevention, prepared 830,000 tons of stone
and more than 12 million straw bags, knitted bags and gunnysacks,
and organized a flood-control team of 900,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The embankment along the two sides of the Yangtze River in
Jiangsu runs more than 1,500 kilometers and protects an area of
more than 7,600 square kilometers, which has a combined economic
size of more than 500 billion yuan. A total of 615 million yuan
had been invested to reinforce the embankment.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has also decided to indefinitely bar
sand-gathering in the Yangtze River to ensure the safety of the
embankment.

<P>
SAN JOSE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica condemned Pakistan's
nuclear tests on Thursday, saying they imperil world peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
A government communique urged both India and Pakistan to cease
immediately and unconditionally this series of mutual
provocations, and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as
proposed by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad and New Delhi must commit themselves to abstain from
using this kind of weapon against each other, the communique
stressed.
</P>
<P>
A report from Montevideo, capital of Uruguay, said the
Uruguayan government also deplored Pakistan's tests, and warned
that repeated nuclear tests in South Asia endangered international
peace and security and would unleash an arms race in the area.
</P>
<P>
A communique from the Foreign Affairs Ministry urged Pakistan
to sign, as soon as possible, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
and take part in negotiations aimed at banning atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices in the southwestern
Chagai area on Thursday in response to the same number of tests by
India two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> European Countries Voice Concern About Pakistani N-Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Four Eastern European countries --
Russia, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic -- voiced their
concern Thursday over Pakistan's nuclear tests, saying that
Islamabad's rivalry with India could trigger a nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said Russia expressed the
"deepest concern" over Pakistan's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Russia "again firmly appeals to Pakistan and India to listen to
the world community, refrain from further tests and immediately
join the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was
concerned that a nuclear arms race might begin in South Asia after
Pakistan's five nuclear tests Thursday, which followed five Indian
tests.
</P>
<P>
"The Hungarian government is 'increasingly worried' that the
decisions of India and Pakistan could start a nuclear arms race in
the region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It further expressed concern that the `tit-for-tat' tests could
block the full implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which seek to prevent the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that
Poland also expressed "great concern" over the nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Poland is deeply grieved by the tension in
South Asia, adding that it could bring about serious consequences
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Poland appealed to Pakistan and India to stop further tests and
immediately join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
A Czech Foreign Ministry statement said the Czech Republic was
"deeply concerned and disappointed" about the Pakistan tests.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan carried out the tests to retaliate for India's nuclear
blasts on May 11 and 13, the statement said, adding that the
Pakistani action could lead to further deterioration in the
region's situation.
</P>
<P>
A nuclear arms race could result not only in serious
consequences for the region but also for the entire world, the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Appraisal Key for Entrepreneurs' Future in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Up to 2,330 chief executives of
state enterprises in north China's Liaoning Province have been
demoted or dismissed from their posts in the January-April period
because they got less than 60 percent of the confidence votes at
the employees' representative conferences.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's heavy industry bases, Liaoning Province
pioneered in the introduction of the system of an employees'
representative conference in an effort to improve efficiency and
invigorate state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, since the beginning of the year,
democratic appraisals organized by the employees' representative
conference have been conducted in more than 15,000 state
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Those who won plaudits from ordinary workers have been promoted
or given various awards.
</P>
<P>
"Democratic appraisals and a democratic selection of enterprise
heads are key to the invigoration of state enterprises," said one
leading official with the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1994 the communications bureau of Shenyang, capital of
Liaoning Province, promoted 28 managers and deputy managers for
its subsidiaries by democratic means, accounting for 77 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Within two years, the profits of the bureau's subsidiaries
increased by 13 times, and even four money-losing enterprises have
begun to net profits.
</P>
<P>
Observers here pointed out that ordinary workers, who are the
real masters of state enterprises, should be entitled to select
and supervise their bellwethers.

<HEADLINE> Six Indonesian Private Banks to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- In the face of fierce competition
in the era of globalization, six Indonesian private banks have
agreed to merge by the end of 1998, local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The six banks are Bank Asia Pacific (Aspac), Bank Indotrade,
Bank Lautan Berlian, Bank Patriot, Bank Tata and Bank Uppindo.
</P>
<P>
The new bank will operate under the name Bank Aspac and it will
have 93 branch offices and a network of 423 automatic teller
machines (ATMs) in locations throughout the country, the reports
quoted Thomas Suyatno, chairman of a joint secretariat of the
banks in the merger, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The six banks' assets as per March 31 this year stood at 6
trillion rupiah (about 600 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The merger is expected to build confidence in the new bank with
sound liquidity, allowing it to face the coming free trade era in
2003, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia's largest private bank Bank Central Asia
(BCA) was placed under the supervision of the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the move, the country's central bank Bank Indonesia
Governor Sjahril Sabirin told reporters that the continuing run on
BCA since May 18 had resulted in liquidity problems and dried up
its reserves at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"The liquidity assistance provided by Bank Indonesia has
exceeded 200 percent of the bank's capital, so BCA meets the
criteria for being managed and supervised by IBRA," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recent rioting and looting in the capital have caused damage to
BCA offices and halted operations in several of its branches. The
bank has also been hit by a run on deposits.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin called on depositors, especially those of the BCA, to
remain calm since their deposits are fully secured by government
guarantees.

will prohibit all work units in the Taihu Lake Valley from
discharging over-standard pollutants into the lake beginning

units which discharge over-standard pollutants to comply with
requirements by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Peace Deadlock to Dominate Palermo Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The deadlock in the Middle East peace
process will dominate next week's June 3-4 Palermo meeting of
foreign ministers from the European Union and 12 Mediterranean
countries, the Italian Foreign Ministry said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock, the ministry said, "is cause for instability
which goes beyond the Middle East and affects the entire
Mediterranean region."
</P>
<P>
The Palermo meeting will also see a more ample debate on
global stability. Participating nations are expected to
demonstrate their prospects for economic, social and cultural
development.
</P>
<P>
The informal forum will be co-chaired by British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, representing the EU presidency, and Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, representing the host country.
</P>
<P>
Next week's meeting follows the Malta Conference, which was
held in the spring of 1997, and comes ahead of the Stuttgart
Conference, which is scheduled for April 1999. The first
Euro-Mediterranean conference was held in Barcelona, Spain, in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Ministry said the Palermo meeting has all the
qualifications to be "an appointment of quality," thanks to the
fact that "all participants in this Mediterranean partnership,
with the exception of Israel, the Palestinian National Authority
and Turkey, have confirmed that they will send their foreign
ministers."
</P>
<P>
The ministry added that while the Mideast peace deadlock will
certainly dominate the Palermo meeting, "the situation in the
Middle East is not the only threat to the Mediterranean. There is
also organized crime, terrorism and arms trafficking, to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
Given its informal nature, next week's forum will not have a
set agenda. Discussion is also likely to involve human rights, but
diplomats are unlikely to tackle the Greek-Turkish dispute over
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 14 Injured After Riots in Indonesian Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- At least one died and 14 persons
were injured after fresh riots erupted in two towns in Indonesia's
provinces of North Sumatera and South Sulawesi Wednesday,
according to reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Tanjungbalai town, about 160 kilometers southeast of the
North Sumatera capital of Medan, one man died when he was hit by a
vehicle during the unrest. The 14 injured were hit by rubber
bullets fired by police, the reports quoted local police officers
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 people were arrested, including seven women, for
rioting and looting.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are still investigating what provoked the riot,
the reports said, adding that riots also occurred in the Strait of
Malacca port-town, sparked by people angry over years of rampant
gambling, prostitution and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
In Jeneponto, some 75 kilometers southeast of the South
Sulawesi capital of Ujungpandang, about 100 junior and senior high
school students smashed shops and buildings near the local public
market.
</P>
<P>
Students began rioting after attending a free-speech forum held
by local university students to protest alleged nepotism in the
election of the regent, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The riots in the two towns happened less than two weeks after
the three-day widespread rioting and looting in Jakarta, the
capital, in mid-May. At least 500 people died in the violence
which caused more than 238 millions U.S. dollars in material loss.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's tax revenue reached
the equivalent of more than 40 billion U.S. dollars in the first
four months of this year, an increase of 30 percent over the same
period of 1997.

dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 tax revenue is forecast to grow 15 percent, amounting
to 125 billion dollars, against the 112 billion dollars of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Economy on a Steady Rise: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's economy is now on a
steady rise as a positive result of the International Monetary
Fund's (IMF) financial aid to the country, Kazakh Prime Minister
Nurlan Balgimbaev said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting IMF Managing Director Michael
Camdessus, Balgimbaev said Kazakhstan's gross industrial product
in the first quarter of 1998 increased 3 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was declining notably, while the average wage
increased by 20 percent, and investments also rose sharply, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Balgimbaev noted problems still existed in the economy, in
particular laws on tax levying were yet to be perfected.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus spoke highly of the progress made by Kazakhstan in
achieving economic development and curbing inflation. But he hoped
Kazakhstan could lower its import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
However, Balgimbaev said he believed it was not a simple
question of lowering tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan must protect its manufacturers as well as safeguard
the country's export interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev met
Camdessus. The president thanked Camdessus for IMF's financial aid
to further help Kazakhstan's market economy reform.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus was on his third visit to Kazakhstan following his
visit to Kyrgyzstan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy expressed concern over
Pakistan's five nuclear tests on Thursday, warning that they would
have an inevitable impact on relations between Italy and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A communique released by Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's
office said the premier was deeply concerned after learning the
news that Pakistan followed India's action in testing nuclear
weapons, which he considered an obstacle to international efforts
against nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
He urged Pakistan and India to repair their relations and adopt
a responsible attitude toward the world's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan carried out five nuclear tests on Thursday in the wake
of the same number of tests by neighboring India earlier this
month, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in a televised
address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency ANSA said Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini, in Luxembourg attending a foreign ministers'
meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said "strong
concerns" were aroused by the fact that another developing country
conducted nuclear tests after India.
</P>
<P>
He urged Pakistan and India to halt their nuclear tests which,
he said, constituted a "serious reality" for the international
community, and called for an early and thorough implementation of
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said "emergency measures" were needed to prevent further
proliferation of mass killing weapons.

KATHMANDU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Nepal sincerely hopes that the

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar
declared late Thursday night emergency in the country with
immediate effect just hours after Pakistan detonated five nuclear
devices.
</P>
<P>
The emergency was announced in view of the threat of external
aggression to the security of Pakistan, said a presidential
decree.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president also imposed with immediate effect
temporary restrictions in relation to foreign exchange. Under
these restrictions, the right to bring, hold, sell, withdraw and
transfer foreign exchange shall remain suspended.
</P>
<P>
The presidential order came after Pakistan conducted five
nuclear tests Thursday afternoon.
</P>

Pakistan, whose economy is very dependent on foreign
assistance, is facing possible economic sanctions to be imposed by
some major powers.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Adopting Broad Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) is adopting a wide range of reforms
in line with the recommendations of the Secretary-General and the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
That is the picture that emerged from UNDP's 1997 Annual Report,
released here on Thursday. "UNDP implemented organizational
changes to make it a leaner, more efficient and more effective
organization with stronger accountability, a culture of
cost-consciousness and a sharper focus on country operations."
</P>
<P>
Targets have been set for improving the effectiveness of UNDP
country offices, the report states. The programme has also
streamlined its headquarters, separating corporate and operational
functions.
</P>
<P>
The main challenges for the future, according to the report, will
be to anticipate and adjust to the evolving development
cooperation environment.
</P>
<P>
As part of this report, UNDP will seek new strategic
partnerships within the United Nations system as well as with
international financial institutions, non-governmental
organizations, the private sector and bilateral donors.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar up More Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar extended its
seven-year high against the Japanese yen Thursday, as investors
bought the U.S. currency as safe haven.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 138.81 yen,
up from 137.40 yen late Wednesday. The dollar hit a high of 138.95
yen before falling back. The dollar has not been that high against
the yen since July 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dollar slid against the German mark. The dollar
was changing hands at 1.7794 marks, down from 1.7829.
</P>
<P>
Two government reports seemed to affect the market little. The
U.S. government said that corporate profits fell 2.2 percent in
the first quarter, and the gross domestic product expanded at a
rapid 4.8 percent annual rate, on a record increase in unsold
inventories.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4744 Swiss francs, up from 1.4711; 5.9645 French
francs, down from 5.9740; 1,754.50 Italian lire, down from

<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday condemned the
nuclear tests carried out by Pakistan early Thursday, urging both
India and Pakistan to engage in a political dialogue to ease
tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued
Thursday that Britain condemned Pakistan's action which "runs
counter to the will expressed by 149 signatories to the CTBT
(Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) to cease nuclear testing."
</P>
<P>
"We urge Pakistan, along with India and other states in the
region, to refrain from further tests and deployment of nuclear
weapons or ballistic missiles," Cook said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Cook appealed to both India and Pakistan to "engage in a
dialogue which addresses the root causes of the tensions between
them, and try to build confidence, rather than seek
confrontation."

<P>
Los Angeles, May 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. chain wholesaler Costco
will open a retail warehouse in Japan, marking the company's
second foray this month into an Asian market.
</P>
<P>
The company said Thursday that a lease has been signed to build
a 13,500- square-meter warehouse at a shopping center in Fukuoka,
Japan. The store is scheduled to open in April of next year.
</P>
<P>
Costco officials said that Japan has the potential to be a
strong market for the company, which is also continuing its search
for additional sites in greater Tokyo and other areas of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Costco acquired two warehouses it had been
licensing in South Korea, and it will open a third store in that
country later this week. Another Costco warehouse operates in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The latest expansion news came after Costco reported a profit
of 85. 2 million U. S. dollars or a 23 percent gain in the
third-quarter of its fiscal year ending September 1. The company
tallied 16.26 billion in sales in the first three quarters and
comparative profit increased 32 percent to 309 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Costco's warehouses present one of America's largest product
category selections to be found under a single roof. The company
currently operates 292 membership warehouses in the United States,
nine in Canada, seven in Britain and 14 in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The company boasts 27 million business and individual
membership cardholders and 60,000 employees. Its sales in the past
fiscal year exceeded 21 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> IDB Assists Water Sector in El Salvador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank Thursday announced the approval of 45.2 million U.S. dollars
in financing to El Salvador to promote a more rational and
efficient use of water resources and greater investment in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The financing will assist the establishment of a financially
independent regulatory agency responsible for oversight and
policy-making to ensure the proper development and preservation of
water as a natural resource. In addition, the program will create
a modern regulatory framework for services in the sanitation and
water supply sector.
</P>
<P>
A component of the program provides for investments in rural
water and sanitation systems that are independently managed by
local communities.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a 43.7 million dollar loan and a
1.5 million grant for technical cooperation in support of the
locally managed rural systems.
</P>
<P>
In relating financing, the Multilateral Investment Fund, an
independent fund administered by the IDB, approved a 2.4 million
dollar grant for technical cooperation to assist decentralization,
privatization, management restructuring, and the establishment of
a new regulatory framework and a new regulatory agency for water
and sanitation services.
</P>
<P>
Local counterpart funds total 11.5 million dollars for the
IDB financing and 0.9 million dollars for the MIF financing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Praises WTO for Requiring EU to End Beef Hormone Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States praised the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday for its decision asking
the European Union (EU) to end its ban on beef treated with
hormones by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the EU will now take the necessary steps to
bring its policies into compliance with WTO obligations by moving
to lift the ban," U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the WTO rejected the EU contention that
compliance with a previous order invalidating the ban should be
delayed until completion of a new assessment on health risks of
the growth-promoting hormones.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruled earlier this year that the EU ban was not
supported by scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU said they would simply conduct a new study on
whether use of the six hormones in cattle is hazardous to humans.
Such hormones are widely used in the United States and considered
safe
</P>
<P>
"Withdrawal of the EU hormone ban is the only way to bring EU
directives into compliance," Barshefsky added.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rose modestly
Thursday, extending a powerful Wall Street rebound that helped steady
markets around the world after a steep selloff on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.63 to 8,970.20 after
swinging from an early 35-point deficit to a 56-point gain that

Most broad-market indexes also recovered from an early stumble.

The Commerce Department reported today that the U.S. economy
expanded at a rapid 4.8 percent annual rate in the January-March
period, up from last month's estimate of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Corporate profits, however, were 2.2 percent lower in the first
quarter than in the final three months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the department also reported that orders to
factories for big-ticket durable goods shot up 2.6 percent in
April, the biggest gain in five months.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 5.36 to 1,097.59, and the

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Announce Sanctions on Pakistan for Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States is going to
announce sanctions on Pakistan for its nuclear tests under the
direction of President Bill Clinton, the White House said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"They (sanctions) are being prepared now, and they could be
issued as early as later today or certainly in coming days,"
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Clinton told a gathering in the Old
Executive Office that he had no choice but to impose sanctions
on Pakistan for its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged that without "determined efforts" a new
arms race in Asia now appears possible, a defeat for U.S.
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe we are about to start the 21st century by
having the Indian subcontinent repeat the worst mistakes of the
20th century when we know it is not necessary to peace, to
security, to prosperity, to national greatness or personal
fulfillment," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said at a
special briefing at the State Department that the United States
would urge India and Pakistan to renounce any further testing,
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, take decisive steps in
reducing tensions between India and Pakistan, join negotiations
on a cut-off of the production of fissile material; and
undertake not to weaponize or deploy ballistic missiles.
