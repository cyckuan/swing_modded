<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has been cleared by his doctors for a 10-hour flight to Tokyo for
an informal summit with his Japanese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the president's
health was "150 percent" ready for the long-haul journey.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation is scheduled to depart for Japan on
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which was originally scheduled for April 11 to 13,
was postponed for a week because of the uncertainty of the Russian
political situation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismissed his entire government on March 23. His
nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko as new prime minister was refused
by the State Duma (lower house of parliament) last Friday.

<P>
The Duma will hold the second round vote on Kiriyenko on
Friday, shortly before the president leaves for Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The president and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
will discuss space cooperation and put forward other specific
projects throughout the year.

<HEADLINE> Italy Dampens Japan's Bid for UNSC Permanent Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro has dampened Japan's hopes for a permanent seat on the
United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
</P>
<P>
He told Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto during a
visit to Tokyo that Italy was concerned about a proposal to give
new permanent seats to a limited number of "major" countries.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto had been seeking Italy's understanding on Japan's bid
to become a permanent member of the council, Japanese government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian president was quoted as saying: "What we are
worried about is that if the Security Council is limited to some
major powers, so many other countries would be excluded."
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said Italy had no intention of antagonizing friendly
nations, including Japan, over reforms of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Diet (Japan's parliament) earlier Wednesday,
Scalfaro called for enhancing the Italian-Japanese cooperation in
solving global problems such as disarmament and environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro arrived here on Monday for a week-long state visit to
Japan. He will leave Tokyo on Thursday for western Japan before
returning home on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Exported Arms Worth $260 Million Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa exported
military equipment worth over 1.3 billion Rand (260 million U.S.
Dollars) last year, South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted
the country's annual armament export statistics as showing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This represented a 34 percent rise in arms sales compared with
the previous year, National Conventional Arms Control Committee
(NCACC) Chairman, Kader Asmal, said in Pretoria Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the weapons sold, worth one billion Rand (200
million dollars), was of a lethal nature and fell into the A
category, described as "sensitive major significant equipment",
SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Material in this category is defined as "conventional
implements of war that could cause heavy personnel casualties and
or major damage and destruction to material, structures, objects
and facilities."
</P>
<P>
India was the biggest buyer of weapons in this class, and
acquired equipment to the value of 572 million Rand (114 million
dollars). Next on the list was Switzerland (19.4 million
dollars), Singapore (16.2 million dollars), and Colombia (11.8
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, Kuwait imported A category arms totalling
one million dollars, while African clients of such weapons
included the Republic of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
South Africa suspended arms sales to Rwanda in November 1996
after evidence emerged that Rwandan forces had made cross-border
excursions into former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, the government announced that the sale of
non-lethal arms to Rwanda would resume, adding it would also
consider supplying that country with sensitive weapons.
</P>
<P>
Asmal at the time said the decision was prompted by assurances
from the Rwandan government that the material would not be used
outside its borders.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday he said the government remained committed to
transparency and the disclosure of its arms sales.
</P>
<P>
On arms exports to the Republic of Congo, Asmal said that the
export of arms took place before that country's elected
government was toppled. No requests for exports had been received
since.
</P>
<P>
"And if such a request comes, we will take into account the
fact that the legitimate government was overthrown," said Asmal.
</P>
<P>
South Africa rigorously implemented United Nations arms
embargoes, and was at the bottom of the list of exporters
compared to countries such as the United States, Russia and
Sweden, he said.
</P>
<P>
Countries to which South Africa refused to export arms last
year included Nigeria, Afghanistan, Congo, Burundi, Myanmar,
Sudan, Sri Lanka and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said no serious claims of arms export breaches had been
levelled against South Africa since the NCACC started its work in
August 1995, and all NCACC decisions were based on
cabinet-approved policy.
</P>
<P>
He said all claims against South Africa of breaches of export
regulations were investigated as soon as possible. But many of
the allegations involved a "bit of destabilization," and were
far-fetched, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said government departments were compiling an inventory
of all weapons in their possession, adding that to date the
figure was remarkable. The list would be tabled before the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He said a NCACC document on the future of the defense-related
industry was at an advanced stage. The document was expected to
be adopted at the NCACC's next meeting on April 23, after which
it would be released for public debate.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Freed After Top-Level Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Detained Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi was set free on bail on Wednesday after
the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorsed the release.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported the release in a short
dispatch, without giving any details on the controversial case
that has tipped moderates against hardliners and triggered off
massive protests.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said the release came only after the
supreme leader held discussions with former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who now heads the influential State Expediency
Council, and received a written appeal from sitting President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, 44, is a close ally of Iran's moderate President
Mohammad Khatami. He was detained on April 4 by the hardliner-led
judiciary on charges of embezzlement, misappropriation of funds
and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said Karbaschi was hated by hardliners
because he had channeled municipal funds to help Khatami's
presidential campaign that resulted in a humiliating defeat for
his hardline rival.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believe that intervention by Iran's top
notch is aimed at containing the dispute between different
political factions. Demonstrators demanding Karbaschi's release
clashed with police in the capital on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moderates have rejected the charges against the mayor and said
the detention was politically motivated in an attempt to weaken
the government of Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Aims to Cut 33,000 Civil Service Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government said
Wednesday that it is targeting to abolish 33,000 civil service
posts by 2000, with 4,000 jobs expected to go by September this
year.
</P>
<P>
But the time frame of the target is still a matter to be
agreed upon by the Ministry of Finance and the World Bank (WB)
and International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the financing of the
exercise, the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Dennis Rwafa, public
relations officer of the Public Service Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rwafa said: "The government intends to abolish 4,000 posts by
September 1998 as part of the public service reform program. At
the end of this second phase of the program (1996-2000) at least
33,000 posts will have been abolished."
</P>
<P>
Most of the civil servants to be retrenched are expected to
take up voluntary retirement.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of the civil service reform which began
in 1991 and ended in 1996, a total of 23,000 public service posts
were abolished to leave a civil service staff establishment of
184,000.
</P>
<P>
The government, now implementing WB/IMF sponsored economic
reforms, has since 1991 been under pressure to reduce its
expenditure and is even more pressed as it starts on the second
phase of economic restructuring, the Zimbabwe Program for
Economic and Social Transformation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's First Stock Exchange Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dar es Salaam Stock
Exchange (DSE), the first in Tanzania, opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,350 shares of the Tanzania Oxygen Limited (TOL), the
sole company that has been listed at the stock exchange, were
traded by five licensed dealers from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m..
</P>
<P>
One share of the TOL, a leading manufacturer and distributor
of industrial and medical gases in the east African country,
opened at 500 Shillings and closed at 510 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The Director of DSE, Dr Hamisi Kibola, told Xinhua that the
stock exchange opens once a week since only one company has been
listed so far. But he said more profitable companies have lined
up for issuing stocks to the public.
</P>
<P>
The 7.5 million shares floated by TOL worth 37.5 billion
Shillings were bought by 10,000 shareholders from the end of last
year to March this year. President Mkapa has bought 100 shares

<HEADLINE> Ambassador: Dialogue, Cooperation Right Way to Human  Rights Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The right way to promote and
protect human rights is dialogue and cooperation rather than
confrontation, head of the Chinese delegation Wu Jianmin said here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a statement on country resolutions at the ongoing
54th session of the Commission on Human Rights, Wu recalled that
since the end of the Cold War in 1992, the human rights commission
has adopted altogether 87 country resolutions, all of which are
directed against developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is quite abnormal," he said. "What was the
consequence? The atmosphere in this commission became more and
more tense, confrontation more and more intensified, and
politicization more and more serious."
</P>
<P>
"It is the human rights cause and the developing countries that
suffered from it," the Chinese ambassador said. "This situation
should not be allowed to continue."
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the current session in the first four weeks was
in a better atmosphere than in the past sessions: there have been
more dialogue and cooperation than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that people are fed up with confrontation which has
burdened this commission for a long time, and begin to realize
that dialogue and cooperation is the right way to promote and
protect human rights," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Wu hoped that the spirit of dialogue and cooperation shown in
the past four weeks will be adhered to, for it will only bring
benefit and no harm to all commission members.

<P>
The figure, if accurate, would make the problem the fourth
leading cause of death, the Wall Street Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
Millions more suffer injuries such as heart irregularities
and internal bleeding as a result of complications from drugs
often prescribed by doctors, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.2 million of the 30 million people hospitalized in
1994, the latest year for which statistics are available, suffered
adverse drug reactions, researchers say, and 106,000 of these
proved fatal.
</P>
<P>
The figure was based on pooled data from 39 of 153 long-term
studies of adverse drug reactions done in U.S. hospitals between
1966 and 1996. Overall, nearly 7 percent of hospital patients
suffered adverse effects, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
But the findings came under immediate attack. They were not
based on original research projected to a national picture, some
analysts said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
petrochemical giant, Sasol, has reached an agreement with
multinational Chevron to begin design and engineering activities
leading to the construction of a natural gas-to-liquid fuel plant
in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) Wednesday quoted a
Sasol statement as saying that the undertaking had a projected
capacity of 20,000 barrels a day of high quality, environmentally
superior diesel and naphtha products.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, announced by Sasol's Managing Director and
Chief Executive Officer Pieter Cox, followed encouraging results
from a recently completed commercial and technical evaluation.
</P>
<P>
But SAPA did not say when the agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Both companies believe that the cooperation has a bright
future.
</P>
<P>
"Sasol is delighted to join Chevron in this project, and we
are confident that our combined expertise in technology and
hydrocarbon production will support a fruitful association
utilizing the best of both companies," Cox was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Richard Matzke, a Chevron executive, said: "The prospects are
bright for the viability of the plant in Nigeria and looking into
the future, Chevron sees this new partnership as a corner stone
for future projects with Sasol, including the possibility of
expansion of this new technology to other worldwide
applications."

Richardson is also expected to visit Afghanistan Friday where
he will meet leaders of Afghanistan's warring factions.

British victims of the 1988 explosion of a jetliner over Scotland,
said Wednesday he carried fresh proposals to break the Libya-West
crisis over the trial of two Libya suspects in the air crash.
</P>
<P>
Jim Swire, a spokesman for the defense council of the families
of the British victims in the Pan-Am airliner bombing, told
reporters here the proposals will be sent to Libya by Arab League
(AL) Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to make certain proposals to him
(Abdel-Meguid) which he has undertaken to pass on to Libya," Swire
said at a news conference following a meeting with the AL chief.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting dealt with the latest developments of the
crisis over the venue of the planned trial of the two Libyans
suspected of blowing up the plane over Lockerbie, Scotland. All
270 passengers on the Pan-Am flight were killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Swire did not go into details about the proposals, but made it
clear that London and Washington have not yet accepted them.
</P>
<P>
"The proposals must be satisfactory to Libya, the Security
Council, America and Britain," said Swire who led the British
delegation representing the victims' families here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Swire touched on the April 8th meeting held by the victims'
families committee with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
during which Cook spoke of still-under-wraps "diplomatic
initiatives" to defuse the Libya-West crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid declined to uncover the proposals or to say
whether they will be acceptable to Libya which wants a trial of
the two suspects either in Libya or in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. insist the two Libyans be tried in Britain
or the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid, however, told the news conference that there is a
"serious dialog that has started and I certainly appreciate it."
</P>
<P>
"I think the decision has to come from our brothers in
Libya... This (the proposals) will be communicated to them, Our
objective is truth and justice and respect of Libya's sovereignty
and dignity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was "an agreement on that" with the British
defense council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in April
1992 for its refusal to hand over the suspects to the U.S. or
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Libya-West showdown has been again put under the spotlight
following the International Court of Justice ruling in February,
giving it the jurisdiction over the case.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have watered down the ruling and insisted
that the Security council is the body concerned with the issue.
</P>
<P>
A committee groups representatives of the victims' families,
after a meeting in London last week with Cook, vowed to pursue
pressures on the British government to accept Libya's compromise
solutions to defuse the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Be in Egypt on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq
Al-Hariri will start a two-day visit next Wednesday to Egypt for
talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hariri is expected to brief Mubarak on the outcome of the recent
Syrian-Lebanese summit meeting in the Syrian resort Latakia on
Monday and Lebanese drives to pursue the Mideast peace process,
the Middle East News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Lebanese talks will focus on the efforts being
exerted to revitalize the stalled Mideast peace process as well as
the Israeli proposal to withdraw from south Lebanon on condition
that Beirut should provide some security safeguards.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, saying that it will pull back its troops from
south Lebanon after negotiating security arrangements with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad and Lebanese President Elias Hrawi insisted that the
withdrawal should be full unconditional. They rejected the Israeli
plan as an attempt to drive a wedge between them and torpedo the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hariri will also have talks with Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri on means of promoting cooperation in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Hariri will further hold a meeting with Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid within the framework of the Lebanese
efforts to confront the Israeli political and media campaigns to
sell the idea of conditional implementation of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid paid a lightning visit last week to Beirut where
he held consultations with Hariri on similar issues.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's visit comes after a surprise visit Wednesday by Syrian
President Hafez Al-Assad to Cairo. The flurry of diplomatic
activity is aimed at coordinating Arab stances on the latest
development on the Lebanese track.

<HEADLINE> ILO: Millions to Lose Jobs Because of Financial  Crisis in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Millions in the countries worst
affected by the financial crisis in Asia will lose their jobs, the
Geneva-based International Labor Organization (ILO) said in a new
report released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The workers in the construction, financial services and
manufacturing sectors will suffer more, according to the ILO
report.
</P>
<P>
It said that underemployment will become widespread and the
real earnings of those who can hang on to their jobs will fall
substantially as a result of the decline in labor demand and the
inflation induced by large currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
Most dramatically, the report predicted, the impressive trends
in poverty reduction achieved in these countries over the past 20
years will be reversed.
</P>
<P>
In the report, ILO called for new policy responses to the
crisis, saying that otherwise, the pain inflicted on Asian
societies will continue to grow in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This combinations of sharp and unexpected social pain on the
one hand, and lack of collectively provided relief on the other",
ILO warned, "is fertile ground for breeding social unrest".
</P>
<P>
The ILO report, based on the latest available data, focuses
primarily on Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea. It will serve as
a background paper for a high-level meeting of governments, trade
unions and employers organizations in Bangkok on April 22-24.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China will participate
in the meeting.

LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here Wednesday that it had sent four Tornado bombers to the Gulf
region as the British aircraft carrier Illustrious is to return
home.
</P>
<P>
British defense officials were quoted by Reuters as saying

<HEADLINE> EC, EP Jointly Hosts Anti-Corruption Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- An anti-corruption conference
concluded here on Wednesday with the participation of businessmen,
scholars, legislators and government officials from the European
Union, EU member states, Canada, Japan, Russia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the two-day conference, entitled "Achieving a
Corruption-Free Commercial Environment", agreed that corruption
hinders international business, limits the possibilities for
business expansion and represents an unnecessary but significant
cost to business.
</P>
<P>
The conference was jointly hosted by the European Commission
and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Anita Gradin, European commissioner responsible for internal
and judicial affairs, said at the conference: "Corruption
undermines the trust of our citizens in our institutions and
markets. It undermines the morality and the ethics which are
necessary for a well-functioning democracy. That is why action is
required at all levels: private, in the member states, in the
union and globally."
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that the interests of the 15-nation
union are affected directly by corruption as it undermines sound
decision making, damages its financial interests and adversely
affects its external policies.
</P>
<P>
Corruption was also blamed for distorting competition and
challenging the principles of open and free markets and in
particular affecting the proper functioning of the internal
market.
</P>
<P>
Gradin said: "Rules and prohibitions, administrative guidelines
and sanctions alone cannot change the ways of politics or
business. We also have to improve our habits and the way we
think.
</P>
<P>
"In the end, the successful prevention of corruption is
dependent on our ability to raise the level of ethics in our
organizations and in society as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the European Commission presented to the European
Council of Ministers and the European Parliament a proposal on a
union-wide policy against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The proposal pointed to the need for a coherent union-wide
strategy on corruption both within and outside the union's
borders.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Repatriates Ethiopian Refugees in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Wednesday started repatriation
of Ethiopian refugees in northeastern Kenya for the first phase
of its 1998 repatriation operation.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Wednesday said that some 500
refugees in the Dadaab camps will return to Moyale of Ethiopia by
UNHCR-chartered Buffalo aircraft within next week.
</P>
<P>
Over the next months, 400 more Ethiopian refugees will be
repatriated from the Dadaab camps and each returnee will receive
a repatriation grant, funds for transport and a nine-month food
ration from the World Food program.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, more than 70,000 Ethiopian refugees have returned
home from Kenyan refugee camps and UNHCR has closed 12 camps in
the East African country following their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, UNHCR is also expected to repatriate some
1,300 Somali refugees in Jomvu camp in Coast Province, bringing
the total number of repatriated Somali refugees from Kenya to
155,000 in six years.
</P>
<P>
Kenya currently shelters some 179,000 refugees in the Dadaab
camps and Kakuma camp in Turkana district, down from a maximum of

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Keeps Factory Gate Prices Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) - The strong pound has helped keep
the prices of goods leaving the factory gate at their lowest level
for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper imports meant the price of core goods produced by
British manufacturers rose by 0.3% in the year to March- the
lowest annual increase since July 1967, according to the latest
official figures.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation of sterling by almost 30% since August 1996
has made raw materials bought overseas cheaper while competition
from imported goods has forced UK manufacturers to keep their
prices down.
</P>
<P>
However, the strong pound is not hurting the UK economy despite
the pain for manufacturers as well as exporters.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of companies expected higher sales over the next
quarter, and more than two-thirds expected higher profits, showed,
a survey by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, the credit checking agency.
</P>
<P>
"Despite problems for exporters, we are seeing the economy
performing reasonably well," said Philip Mellor, senior analyst at
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the City economists warned that a fall in
sterling could quickly force raw material and producer prices back
up again.
</P>
<P>
Richard Iley, a UK economist at ABN Amro bank, said the
deflationary impact of lower prices would keep inflation subdued
in the short term.
</P>
<P>
"Further out however, underlying inflation should begin to edge
higher," he added.

AMMAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A sick Iraqi girl was specially

treatment.
</P>
<P>
Maria Hamza, 4, was flown here from Baghdad by a special plane
from Jordanian Royal Wings and greeted by a representative from
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Maria is one of over a million persons who have developed
leukaemia in Iraq since the 1990-91 Gulf war, according to Jordan

</P>
<P>
Hassan earlier decided to give the girl a stopover in Amman
after British officials asked him to provide logistic support for
Maria who is to be treated in a U.K. hospital, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The British government had secured an exemption of the United

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A United States government
official said here Wednesday that the "strong ties" between the
U.S. and Jordan are "a base for solving regional problems."
</P>
<P>
Stewart Eizenstat, U.S. State Department undersecretary for
economic affairs, said that U.S.-Jordanian partnership has been
achieved through continuous U.S. economic and military assistance
to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Such assistance is expected to reach 246 million U.S. dollars
annually in the coming years, said Eizenstat at a seminar
organized by the U.S. Center in Amman.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to encourage U.S. investment in Jordan, support
Jordan through all possible means and promote regional
cooperation between Jordan and its neighbors," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that with reliable support from the U.S. and
other partners, Jordan has been playing a "constructive and
positive role" in the Middle East peace process and regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government very much appreciates such efforts exerted
by Jordan, he added. The kingdom signed peace with Israel in 1994
and has played an active role in promoting peace-making between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is the second largest economic and military aid
contributor to the kingdom after Japan. From 1990 to 1997, it
provided a total of 1.552 billion dollars worth of aid, according
to a press release from the U.S. Embassy in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is short on natural resources and strong pillar
industries. Foreign aid has been a major support of its national
economy through the years.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Against Britain's Call for Meeting on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq slammed Britain on Wednesday
for its proposal to hold a meeting in London regarding the
implementation of a oil-for-food program between Iraq and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry described
Britain's call as pursuing an anti-Iraq policy with a misleading
and venomous nature.
</P>
<P>
Britain has reportedly called for a meeting to be attended by
various bodies of the oil-for-food program and aid organizations
to work out ways of speeding up the delivery of humanitarian goods
under the program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has allowed Iraq to increase the oil sale from 2 billion
U.S. dollars to 5.2 billion dollars in every six months to buy food
and medicine under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused Britain of interfering in Iraq's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has maintained that the affairs relating to the
oil-for-food program should be discussed and decided by Iraq and
the U.N. rather than other parties.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in 1997, Britain attempted to hinder
the implementation of the oil-for-food program by delaying or
blocking the execution of contracts to deliver humanitarian goods
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It accused Britain's representative in the U.N. Sanctions
Committee of having tried to suspend 21 medical contracts that the
World Health Organization has deemed essential to meet the needs
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Britain is continuing its anti-Iraq policy aimed at prolonging
sanctions on Iraq, the statement said, adding that the British
proposal is nothing but a new means to inflict more harm on the
people of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sweeping economic sanctions
on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran has set up a council for
supervising the mass media, the official news agency IRNA reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The High Council on Mass Media chaired by Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami was formed by Iran's Supreme Council of the
Cultural Revolution on Tuesday night, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The media council is aimed at averting further chaotic
factional fightings of the mass media, according to the news

Iran's mass media have recently split and engaged in fierce
attacks against each other over the April 4 detention of Tehran
Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a close ally of President Mohammad
Khatami, on charges of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
As a policy-making body, the media council is expected to
formulate comprehensive criteria for either governmental or
non-governmental media.
</P>
<P>
Members of the council include five cabinet ministers and heads
of the Plan and Budget Organization, National Library, Standard

the institution, said Diogo, adding that the university will
enroll more students by offering correspondence courses.
</P>
<P>

<P>
NICOSIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has planned to cancel the
ceiling for interest rates in view of its accession talks with the
European Union (EU), according to Finance Minister Christodoulos
Christodoulou on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at liberalizing the interest rates,

</P>
<P>
The government will submit a bill in this regard to the House

<P>
The ceiling must be abolished in a bid to promote Cyprus'
accession talks with the EU and modernize its financial system,
Christodoulou said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the move is in line with the liberalization of

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Peace Moves Within U.N. Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government proclaimed its
position that any initiatives or moves aimed at reaching a
peaceful settlement in the island must be part of U.N. efforts
toward this end.
</P>
<P>
This stand was made clear here Wednesday after a five-hour
meeting of the National Council, which comprises of the Greek
Cypriot political party leaders.
</P>
<P>
The council, a consultative body to President Glafcos
Clerides, discussed recent developments including Turkish
Cypriots' refusal to continue peace talks and fresh demands for a
change of the basis of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides told reporters that
Clerides and Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides briefed the
council on the current situation and talks between Greek and
Cypriot government officials on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"The party leaders expressed their views on developments and
the council will meet again at the beginning of May to discuss
matters of strategy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Political party leaders also called for more active engagement
of the U.N. Security Council, including the participation of
Russia and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process was bogged down after Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash's refusal to attend the bicommunal talks in
protest of the EU decision to open talks with the Cypriot
government on its entry into EU.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said he will not participate in peace
negotiations unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus is
recognized.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has stepped up efforts to
break the current deadlock in the Cyprus peace process and bring
Denktash back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was only recognized
by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> 414 Arrested for Drug Abuse in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Drug Enforcement Commission
(DEC) has in the first three months of this year arrested 414
people with drugs with a street value of 689.5 million Zambian
Kwacha, or about 400,000 U.S. Dollars, the DEC said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by DEC spokesperson Mukutulu Sinyani at a
one-day anti-drug workshop in Livingstone, a southern border
city, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Of those people arrested, said the spokesperson, 392 are
Zambians, while foreign nationals include seven Tanzanians, six
South Africans, three Zimbabweans, two Malawians and one each
from Somalia, India, Lebanon and the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
She further revealed that cannabis amounting to 203 tons was
seized in the first quarter and that 90 drug dependent persons
were registered with the DEC.
</P>
<P>
Some of the drugs being consumed and peddled in Zambia include
cannabis and valium, which is a drug for medical prescription.
Others are mandrax, cocaine, etc., said ZANA.

<HEADLINE> Russian Acting PM Pledges to Consider All Nominees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko told a briefing here on Wednesday that all
proposals on candidates for positions in the Cabinet will be
considered attentively.
</P>
<P>
However, it does not guarantee that all candidates will be
appointed, although "there have been some interesting
suggestions," Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
The acting premier said his duty is to present an economic
program and fill it with concrete content, and the Duma would vote
on an economic program rather than on him personally in the second
round of vote on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, he had established constructive dialogue with
the Duma on the economic program.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko has been Russian President Boris Yeltsin's nominee
twice. He was turned down by the State Duma last Friday and the
president named him again on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Another report quoted Communist Party of Russia leader Gennady
Zyuganov as saying that the Duma will not approve Kiriyenko as
prime minister at the second ballot on April 17. Communist
deputies in the Duma will vote against Kiriyenko, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gennady Seleznyov, the Chairman of the State Duma,
has changed his Tuesday's predication that Kiriyenko was very
likely to be approved by the Duma in the second try.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov on Wednesday said he was not sure the persident's
nominee would be able to win 226 votes of lawmakers necessary to
secure him the post.

<HEADLINE> Annan Decides to Pull out UN Investigation Team in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday decided to pull out the UN team sent to the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The team was sent to the country last August to investigate
reports that forces royal to President Laurent Kabila massacred
thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees last year.
</P>
<P>
The move came after months of disputes between President
Laurent Kabila's Government and the UN mission over the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the authorities of Kabila detained a Canadian, a
member of the investigation team, and seized some official UN
documents, which leads directly to the withdrawal of the UN team.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Tutsi forces loyal to Kabila are suspected of killing
thousands of Hutu refugees, including women and children, during a
bush war across the former Zaire that resulted the ousting of
Mobutu Sese Seko.

<HEADLINE> S. African Horror Smash Kills 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people, including
15 school children, were killed Wednesday afternoon in a
five-vehicle smash in Newcastle, Kwazulu-Natal province, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA said 44 people were wounded during the accident,
correcting the figure of 70 injured as it reported earlier on the
event.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted police spokesman Godfrey Nyembe as saying that the
accident happened at 14:50 p.m. (12:50 GMT) in an industrial area
outside Newcastle, a city about 300 kilometers southeast of
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Nyembe said the police were investigating the cause of the
crash, but said a horse and trailer, a private school bus, a car,
a mini-bus and a light truck were involved in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal traffic spokesman Vijen Murugan said four of the
vehicles, including the school bus and the horse and trailer,
plunged down a 50-meter embankment.
</P>
<P>
Murugan said the school bus was transporting primary school
children from three nearby schools.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident was unknown.
</P>
<P>
Nyembe said most of the injured were in a serious condition
and some had suffered severed limbs.
</P>
<P>
The injured were being treated at two hospitals in Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers were still removing bodies from the wreckage at
18:00 p.m. (16:00 GMT), Nyembe said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Visit Egypt on Israeli Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri is expected to visit Egypt next Tuesday as part of his
diplomatic endeavor to counter Israel's proposal on conditional
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese National News Agency said Wednesday that Hariri will
hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled
Middle East peace process, especially the Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in two decades, Israeli cabinet decided on
April 1 to honor the United Nations Security Council Resolution
425, which calls for an immediate and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
But it conditioned implementation of the resolution on
negotiated security arrangements with Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria, which has great influence on
Lebanon, firmly rejected the offer, arguing the resolution asks
Israel to leave Lebanon without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two countries are concerned that the recent
Israeli diplomatic campaign to sell its proposal will isolate
them politically in the world, as the United States has expressed
welcome to the offer and pressed Lebanon to give it serious
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's visit comes on the heels of a trip by Syrian President
Hafez Al-Assad, who is Cairo to explain to Egypt the Syrian and
Lebanese position over the Israeli move, in an effort to win the
backing from this major power broker in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer area in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern villages and towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border
attack.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which lost its Golan Heights to Israel in the 1967
Middle East war, wants its territory back and has reached a
coordinated stance with Lebanon in dealing with Israel in the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Most EU Members Meet Deadline on Jobs Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) member
states Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg failed to meet a Wednesday
deadline for handing in national action plans to tackle
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU member states agreed at the special EU jobs summit in
Luxembourg last November to present their plans to the EU's
executive body, the European Commission, by April 15.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that six EU countries -- Britain, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal and Greece -- have already
submitted their action plans.
</P>
<P>
Finland, Austria and Spain had confirmed that they would hand
over their plans later on Wednesday, while France, Italy and
Sweden were also expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
A Commission spokeswoman said that Luxembourg would present its
plan on April 18, Germany on April 22 and Belgium on April 24.
</P>
<P>
She said the Commission had however received all the draft
plans allowing the EU executive to start work on a policy paper
due for the first half of May.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is therefore globally very satisfactory," she
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The action plans will be discussed at the summit of EU heads of
state and government in Cardiff on June 15-16.
</P>
<P>
The plans were designed to incorporate loosely worded
guidelines negotiated at the Luxembourg summit where EU leaders
agreed specific targets to deal with the bloc's jobs crisis.
</P>
<P>
EU unemployment stood at 10.3 percent in February, the lowest
level in five years, but still more than twice the level in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Delayed Justice Concerning Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the fourth
commemoration of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, organizations of
genocide survivors have expressed serious concern about the
failure to render justice.
</P>
<P>
It is in this context that a conference organized by "Ibuka"
(literally meaning Remember) Association deplored the slow pace
at which trials of genocide suspects have been conducted, the
Rwanda News Agency said in a dispatch to Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
The conference was chaired by the President of the Supreme
Court, Simeon Rwagasore, Laurent Nkongoli, member of parliament,
and the President of AVP -- Association of Peace Volunteers --
Bernadette Kanzayire.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many problems regarding justice in Rwanda," said
Rwagasore. When the new government was set up, the priority was
to put in place institutions, and "Those of justice came later,"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
Rwagasore highlighted the many problems facing the judicial
system in Rwanda, notably the lack of enough personnel, the high
number of people to be judged, and the lack of equipment.
</P>
<P>
"There is much to be done," he underscored, pointing to the
fact that some laws need to be changed.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not the lack of personnel, justice has been
neglected," charged Nkongoli, calling for the renovation of the
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
For Benadette Kanzayire, justice is an ideal. "Those who
committed genocide should be punished, since they did not only
kill people, they also destroyed the country's economy," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
All the issues raised about the delays in administering justice
will be submitted to the government and parliament, the
conference-organizers resolved.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 genocide suspects are currently detained in
Rwandan prisons. Last year only 300 suspects were tried in
Rwandan courts.
</P>
<P>
But so far, none of those found guilty of genocide crimes has
been punished.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that over half a million Tutsis and moderate
Hutus were killed in the genocide in 1994.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Updated Health Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) needs to
update its approach to public health protection in order to meet
the threat of new or resurgent diseases, the European Commission,
the EU's executive body, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the EU's health policies were formulated up to a
decade ago. Some of the most important health problems didn't
exist then or weren't so visible," a senior Commission official
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The health of European citizens has never been better,
according to a discussion paper published by the Commission on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, it also says that there is still room for major
improvement, adding that one in five Europeans, or 600,000 a year,
will die prematurely before the age of 65.
</P>
<P>
"The population of the 15-nation EU is now aging rapidly and
once-dwindling contagious diseases like tuberculosis are now
making a worrying comeback," the commission official said.
</P>
<P>
The EU's current health protection program, introduced in 1993,
is split into eight categories covering AIDS, cancer, drug
dependence, pollution-related disease, injury prevention, rare
diseases, health promotion and health monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that some of the emerging health
problems did not fit into these categories, leaving the EU without
the tools to tackle them effectively.

<HEADLINE> Symposium Held in Ethiopia to Deliberate on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Participants of the second
symposium on the federal constitution of Ethiopia Wednesday
pledged to work toward democratic unity and speedy economic
development, before ending the five-day deliberations here.
</P>
<P>
In their five-point resolution, the participants also vowed to
share with the local communities the outcomes of the symposium,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Over 250 participants attended the symposium, including
representatives of federal and regional legislative, executive
and judicial bodies, who were determined to seek ways to amend
civil and criminal codes conflicting with the constitution which
was approved on December 8, 1994.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to assist women's efforts to ensure their
equality and constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
Dawit Yohannes, speaker of the House of People's
Representatives, said in his closing speech that a state
structure centered around democratic and human rights has been
put in place.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the symposium would significantly contribute to
the effective implementation of the rights enshrined in the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The five-day symposium has deliberated on democratic rights,
freedom of opinion and right of women and nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The first symposium on the federal constitution was held four
months ago in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian MPs to Assess Mine Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A team of three Tanzanian
parliament members left here Wednesday for Arusha in northern
Tanzania to assess the situation of a tanzanite mine where more
than 90 miners are feared to be buried alive.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by Edgar Maokola-Majogo, vice-chairman of the
Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defense and Security, is
expected to present a report to parliament on the casualties and
future remedial measures.
</P>
<P>
The operation to retrieve bodies of the miners are in full
swing. Another seven bodies are reported to be spotted on
Tuesday, but the work to retrieve them seemed to be difficult
because of lack of proper equipment, including submersible pumps.
Earlier, four bodies have been recovered by the rescue team.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ole Njoolay, the Arusha Regional Commissioner, said the
government could seek assistance from anywhere, including Europe
and South Africa, according to The Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen pits at the tanzanite mine collapsed following a
landslide caused by downpour last Thursday evening. Authorities
have offered a list of 55 miners who are presumed dead, but the
death toll could be higher since more miners might have entered
the area to work illegally.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one miners escaped the disaster thanks to the help of
their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanite is a semi-precious stone unique to Tanzania and is
often mined using primitive methods, often without safety
equipment.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Students in Guinea Eager to Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Sierra Leonean
students in Guinea as refugees Wednesday staged a demonstration
in the Sierra Leonean embassy compound in the Guinean capital
Conakry, demanding to be repatriated back home.
</P>
<P>
The students, including those from primary and second schools
and universities, carried with them placards some of which read:
"We are the Leaders of Tomorrow," "We Need Education" and "Send
Us back to Our Classes," the British Broadcasting Corporation
reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 900 students have registered with the Sierra Leonean
embassy for repatriation. Many of them, like other Sierra Leonean
refugees, have given up their rented apartments.
</P>
<P>
However, since the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) has suspended its repatriation exercise, most of them now
have to find a place for living in the garage in the embassy
compound, the report said.
</P>
<P>
With the new semester approaching, the students have become
increasingly anxious to return home.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR a week ago suspended the repatriation of Sierra Leonean
refugees three weeks after the exercise started.
</P>
<P>
No official reason for the suspension has been disclosed but
reports said it might be partly attributed to Sierra Leoneans who
sold the tickets issued to registered would-be refugees to
businessmen to help them avoid customs duties for their
belongings to be brought into Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that UNHCR is planning a new scheme for the
repatriation but many refugees complained that they could not
afford the transport fare.
</P>
<P>
Following the demonstration, the report said, the embassy has
given assurance to do its utmost to alleviate the price for
Sierra Leonean refugees.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Information Tech Industry Grows Much Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. information
technology, including business on the Internet, is growing twice
as fast as the overall economy, the Commerce Department reported
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the latest report "The Emerging Digital Economy," the
department also found that the industry employs 7.4 million
workers, some of whom earn among the nation's highest average
salaries.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the Internet has doubled every 100 days and Internet
commerce among business will likely surpass 300 billion U.S.
dollars by 2002, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the report also found:
</P>
<P>
--The Internet is growing faster than all other technologies
that have preceded it. Radio existed for 38 years before it had 50
million listeners, and television took 13 years to reach that
level. The Internet crossed the line in just four years.
</P>
<P>
--In 1994, about 3 million people were connected to the
Internet. By the end of last year, there were over 100 million
people using it.
</P>
<P>
--Without information technology, inflation in 1997 would have
been 3.1 percent, more than a full percentage point higher than
the 2 percent it was.
</P>
<P>
--Workers in the information technology industry earn an
average of almost 46,000 dollars annually as against an average of
28,000 dollars for the private sector overall. Workers in the
software and service industries are the highest wage earners, at
almost 56,000 dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that governments stay out of the growing
industry, saying electronic commerce shouldn't be "burdened with
extensive regulation, taxation or censorship."
</P>
<P>
Government instead should help provide legal frameworks for
business on the Internet, and rules should result from "private
collective action, not government regulation" whenever possible,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The department said consumers must be getting more comfortable
making online credit-card purchases: 10 million people in the
United States and Canada had purchased something on the World Wide
Web by the end of 1997, an increase from 4.7 million people six
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report also notes a shortage of highly skilled workers and
recommends that students be better prepared.
</P>
<P>
"Countries that have an insufficient supply of skilled workers
will see high-skilled, high-paying jobs migrate to countries that
can supply the needed talent," the report said.

WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will hold a summit in Washington on April 24
and 25, 1999, to mark the alliance's 50th anniversary and to
accept Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic as new members.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to use the upcoming summit meeting in Washington to
welcome the entry of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as
new members of the alliance," the White House said in a statement
announcing the gathering.

The 16-member NATO decided last July to accept the three former
Soviet allies and accession protocols have been signed in December
last year.
</P>
<P>
All the parliaments of the NATO members will have to ratify the
protocols. A vote of two-thirds majority is needed for the U.S.
Senate to approve the plan.

<HEADLINE> Russian Planes Send Goods to UNITA From S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian aircraft are
allegedly transporting food and military equipment from South
Africa to UNITA rebels in Angola, South African Press Association
(SAPA) quoted police as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a police detective service statement as saying
that an official complaint to this end had been received from the
Angolan government last month.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no evidence of arms being flown to Angola,
information was being followed up that military equipment such as
fuel tanks and Tow trucks, clothing, food and mining equipment
were being exported.
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating 200 charges related to
transgressions of the Civil Aviation Act, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni said the
alleged exports were in contravention of a United Nations
Security Council embargo on the supply of goods to the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), except for
humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
"This is illegal as they have no permission from the U.N.
Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
The detective service statement said a team comprising members
of the border police unit, the trans-national crime projects unit
and the Civil Aviation Authority visited a Pietersburg aviation
company last week.
</P>
<P>
The Pietersburg airport in Northern Province was said to be
the place where the cargos were transported.
</P>
<P>
Detective service spokesman Faizel Kader said no arrests had
yet been made. He noted that the aircraft belonged to Russian
nationals who lived in South Africa legally.
</P>
<P>
On completion of the investigation, the case dockets would be
presented to the office of the senior public prosecutor for a
decision on possible prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Boni said South Africa was committed to implementing the
mandatory U.N. sanctions against UNITA, and would do everything
in its power to prevent illegal flights to Angola.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, the former rebel movement, and the Angolan government
signed a 1994 Lusaka peace protocol to end the 19-year civil
war, and the U.N. sanctions aimed to force UNITA to implement
the accord and form a national unity government in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to Boni, South Africa and its Southern African
Development Community partners last year set up regional and
national information centers to control illegal flights to and
from Angola.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Africa increased its surveillance of airports
from which flights to Angola may depart, he added.
</P>
<P>
A South African private plane was forced down in Angola in
January for flying goods to the region controlled by UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Minister Protests against Police's Raid on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani on Wednesday lodged a
strong protest against the police for its raid on the offices of
two Iranian daily newspapers Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, some
policemen raided the lithography sections of the two pro-moderate
newspapers Iran Daily and Hamshahri to control the material which
was going into print.
</P>
<P>
The raid came hours after anti-riot police clashed with
students in a demonstration in front of Tehran University in
support of the detained Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted a press release from the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance as saying that the minister believed such acts by
the police contrary to the existing laws of the nation, asking
both the judiciary and the police to present an official
explanation for such a move.
</P>
<P>
The police who had assailed newspaper offices showed a check
warrant issued by one of the district courts of Tehran, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry sees the necessity of all agencies, organs,
organizations, and departments to abide by the laws governing the
nation, it said, adding that according to Article 24 of the
Constitution, press is free to express their views unless they
run contrary to the interests of the Islamic ideals and common
laws of the nation.
</P>
<P>
According to the press law passed by the Iranian parliament in
1984, no government officials nor non-governmental agencies have
the right to pressure the press, or press for censorship of the
articles or have the right of instant control of the material to
be printed.
</P>
<P>
Iran Daily, which is published by IRNA, and Hamshahri, which is
owned by Tehran Mayor Karbaschi, are the two major newspapers that
supported the mayor after he was detained by the conservative-led
judiciary on charges of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was released Wednesday after top Iranian leaders
including the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani stepped in to prevent a growing
factional fighting among the moderates and the conservatives over
the issue.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Stresses Jordan's Support for PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein on Wednesday
stressed his country's support for the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) in achieving Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
"In compliance with our fixed and clear stand, we consider the
PNA and its president Yasser Arafat as the legitimate authority in
the Palestinian arena," the king said in a message to his prime
minister, Abdul-Salam Majali.
</P>
<P>
"They enjoy our support," he said, "The most valuable thing
between us, that should be maintained and strengthened, is mutual
confidence."
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan's relations with the PNA are based on supporting
it to achieve Palestinians' legitimate rights on their national
soil as well as on their "close coordination and continuous
consultation."
</P>
<P>
The king said that he recently conveyed the "ideas" of the
U.S. government, a major broker in the Middle East peace process,
to the Palestinian and Egyptian leadership respectively in order
to help reactivate the long-stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest sign of Jordan's support for the PNA, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I found a wise and mature response from the Palestinian
president and senior officials, though the American proposals have
not met the full aspirations (of the PNA)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan as well as other Arab countries appreciate the
Palestinian response, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal demands Israel to pull back from more than 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for stepped-up Palestinian
efforts to combat terror.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king lashed out at some Jordanian publications
which attacked the PNA leadership. "These attacks serve only the
enemies of Palestine and Jordan and the march of both peoples," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, has
been an active mediator between the PNA and Israel. In January
last year, King Hussein helped reach the Hebron accord, under
which Israel commits itself to phased withdrawal from the West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> Austrian FM in Cyprus for Talks on EU Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Vice Chancellor and
Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wolfgang Schussel, arrived
here Wednesday for talks with the Cypriot government on European
Union (EU) course.
</P>
<P>
Schussel's two-day visit comes only three months before
Austria takes over the rotating presidency of the EU, currently
held by Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, Schussel said his talks here
will deal with "the issues, the problems, the possibilities and
the perspectives" regarding the EU and Cyprus' accession.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a good time to visit Cyprus to prepare
ourselves to meet the relevant personalities and have full
access to relevant information and to the people of Cyprus,"
the Austrian Vice Chancellor told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said his country was looking forward to taking the EU
presidency, which he described as a "big challenge".
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to talking tomorrow with all the
important politicians and personalities of Cyprus about the
relevant issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming his guest, Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides
said the visit demonstrated Austria's great interest in Cyprus,
adding that this visit is particularly important since Austria
will be assuming the presidency of the EU for the second part
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Schussel is expected to have meetings
with President Glafcos Clerides and other government officials, as
well as U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
He will also visit members of the Austrian contingent
serving with the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in the eastern part
of the island.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Assad Demand Unconditional Israeli Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and his visiting Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad Wednesday
demanded an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference here at the end of their two-hour
meeting, the two leaders underlined the importance of Arab
coordination in facing challenges to the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to the two presidents, consultations are under way
among Arab leaders on reaching the optimum means for convening an
Arab mini-summit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak highlighted the importance of the American role in
pushing forward the peace process and voiced conviction that the
U.S. was about to announce its initiative on advancing the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked for over a
year, while negotiations on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks have
been on ice since March 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to Mubarak, the issue of Israeli security is too
"elastic" to be used as a pretext not to implement what has been
agreed.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Assad, who arrived here at noon on a lightning
visit, said he was against linking Israel's pullout from south
Lebanon with Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad was accompanied by a high-level delegation, including
Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
"Our meetings in Syria and Egypt are held on a routine basis,
with neither side hiding anything from the other one," said Assad.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Assad also tackled the latest developments in the
Middle East, particularly the outcome of the Lebanese-Syrian
summit held in the Syrian resort of Latakia on Monday on the
recent Israeli offer to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution
425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted in 1978 calls on Israel to withdraw from
Lebanon without any conditions. But Israel has said that it would
pull back its troops from Lebanon in exchange for security
arrangements by the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the Israeli plan. Assad and Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi insisted that the withdrawal should be
unconditional, saying the Israeli plan was an attempt to drive a
wedge between them and torpedo the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which is stationing 30,000 troops in Lebanon
as peacekeepers, have agreed not to make peace separately with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the Israeli pullback from Lebanon attached to the
return of its Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by
Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president's visit came a week before a planned
two-day visit to Egypt by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri for
talks with the Egyptian leadership on the recent development on
the Lebanese track.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior OAU official Wednesday
calls on both the Angolan government and the opposition National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to make
continued efforts to achieve final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Antonio, deputy secretary-general of the Organization
of Africa Unity (OAU) made the appeal here to the press after
concluding a four-day visit to the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He lauded as "positive" the measures taken by the two sides to
implement the Lusaka Peace Accord signed in 1994, saying that the
OAU believes the Angolan peace process will soon reach its
"projected goals."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blondin Beye, United Nations special envoy in
Angola, told the press Wednesday after his meeting with Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos that he was satisfied with the
progress made in accordance with the new agenda passed on March 6
by the joint committee of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the cooperation demonstrated by the
two sides in accomplishing some of the tasks.
</P>
<P>
Beye revealed that two high level delegations composed of
representatives from the Angolan government, UNITA, U.N. observer
mission and observer countries Wednesday left for Bailundo and
Andulo, the headquarters of the UNITA, to discuss with UNITA
leaders on the re-establishment of government authorities in the
two regions.

<HEADLINE> White Water Figure's Lawyer Seeks to Bar Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A lawyer for Susan McDougal in
Little Rock, Arkansas, has asked a federal judge to bar Whitewater
prosecutor Kenneth Starr from investigating whether money from a
conservative group was funneled to a key witness.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Starr said he and his staff hadn't decided whether
they would look into alleged payments to David Hale or whether
they would ask the Justice Department to appoint a special
investigator.
</P>
<P>
The same day, McDougal attorney Mark Geragos of Los Angeles
wrote to U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Eisele asking the judge to
prohibit Starr from pursuing such an investigation, which Geragos
called a "clear conflict of interest."
</P>
<P>
Starr has a stake in Hale's credibility and has other conflicts
of interest, Geragos said.
</P>
<P>
Eisele responded Wednesday with a letter advising Geragos that
a complaint related to Mrs. McDougal's case should be directed to
the presiding judge, U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr., The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
If Geragos' letter was meant as a general ethics complaint
against Starr, Eisele said, he would withhold a decision on how to
proceed until Starr decides whether his office will investigate the
allegations or refer them back to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a deputy attorney general said in a letter to Starr
that he would leave the decision to Starr, despite an appearance of
a conflict.
</P>
<P>
Hale was a key witness at the 1996 trial that resulted in Mrs.
McDougal's conviction for fraud, for which she was sentenced to
two years in prison. Mrs. McDougal, U.S. President Bill Clinton's
former business partner in the Whitewater land venture, began
serving the sentence March 9, after spending 18 months behind bars
for a contempt of court citation for refusing to testify to a
Whitewater grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of the allegations involving Hale could result in
reversal of Mrs. McDougal's convictions, Geragos said.
</P>
<P>
An Arkansas woman claims Hale received money from conservative
activists working for a foundation that publishes the American
Spectator magazine and that Hale gave the magazine information
about Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
American Spectator publisher Terry Eastland has said no money
was ever given to Hale. Hale's lawyer said he is not aware of any
payments.

<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi girl who is suffering
from cancer arrived in Britain early Wednesday for medical
treatment at a Scottish children's hospital.
</P>
<P>
Four-year-old Mariam Hamza, whose plane touched down at
London's Heathrow airport Wednesday afternoon, would be
transferred to Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children in
Scotland for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Jameson, medical director of the Royal Hospital, told
BBC Radio, "The main thing will be to settle her down and get her
used to being here and to run a series of tests both to confirm
her diagnosis."
</P>
<P>
British MP George Galloway, who arranged the Iraqi girl's trip
to Britain, said, "We hope Mariam will show the British public
that Iraqis are people too... not monsters, not demons."
</P>
<P>
Golloway, who is campaigning to put an end to international
sanctions against Iraq, stressed, "I hope Mariam will light a
candle which will illuminate the terrible picture we have left
behind."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Projects 5.72-Billion-Dollar Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has projected its
budget deficit in the coming fiscal year (July 1, 1998 to June 30,
1999) at 1.733 billion Kuwait Dinars (5.72 billion U.S. dollars),
about 10 percent less than previously conceived.
</P>
<P>
The new figure was announced Wednesday by Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Nasser
Al-Roudhan at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet has approved a bill on interlinking budgets
with revenues estimated at 3.127 billion dinars (10.32 billion
dollars) and expenditures at 4.860 billion dinars (16.03 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total sum, 2.577 billion dinars (8.504 billion dollars)
will come from oil revenues and 550 million dinars (1.815 billion
dollars) from non-oil revenues, almost the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
Local reports last month warned that the budget deficit for
the 1998-99 fiscal year is expected to exceed the 2 billion dinars
(6.6 billion dollars) mark for the first time since the sheikdom
was liberated in the 1991 Gulf War from seven-month Iraqi
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's projected oil revenues, which account for about 80
percent of the state income, were badly affected by the slump of
oil prices on the world market since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
As part of an overall move to make up for the shortfall, the
government in February instructed all the ministries and
government departments to cut their budgets by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is also seriously considering reviving plans to impose
charges on various public services in a bid to boost non-oil
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also proposed a draft law to stop
transferring 10 percent of state revenues to the country's Future
Generation Fund during fiscal years which record budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, Kuwaiti government has been feeding the fund,
which was drastically depleted by over 20 billion dinars (66
billion dollars) to meet its post-war financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulate that there should be no cuts from
revenues in years when expenditure exceeds revenues.
</P>
<P>
In January, Kuwait said it had injected 439.1 million dinars
(1.449 billion dollars) of the 1996-97 budget surplus of 502.3
million dinars (1.658 billion dollars) into the fund which now is
unofficially estimated at more than 40 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Airwaves Open to Private Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is opening its
airwaves to private commercial broadcasters, the country's
telecommunications authority said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It invited tenders to set up commercial radio stations
throughout the country. Radio broadcasting had been restricted to
the government-controlled Radio Botswana since independence in
1966, the authority said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The authority invited applications for two licenses, one in
Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, the other in Francistown or
Lobatse, two towns in the country. Bids for licenses in other
towns and villages would be accepted if frequencies are
available.
</P>
<P>
The body said tenders could bid for licenses in more than one
town or village. The body expected programing that would reflect
a broadcaster's social obligations and assist in nation-building.
The national broadcaster was precluded from bidding.

<HEADLINE> Europe Slow in Bank Mergers, Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- European banks are unlikely to
repeat the merging waves sweeping the U.S. banking sector,
although they are badly in need of consolidation, the Wall Street
Journal said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cultural barriers, regulatory hurdles and national pride stand
in the way, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
To be sure, it said, European lenders worry about losing the
race to create truly global financial institutions, but, as the
pending merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp.
demonstrates, their sights remain set on home markets rather than
on pan-European combinations comparable to the agreed merger of
some U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
The three mergers -- the BankAmerica deal as well as the
combinations between Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD Corp.,
and Travelers Group Inc. with Citicorp -- are worth more than 160
billion U.S. dollars. That is more than the value of all mergers
and acquisitions in the European financial sector combined in
1997. That figure was 134.1 billion dollars, in 463 deals, the
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Not that European banks fail to recognize the need to
consolidate, it said. A common complaint among banks on the
Continent is that they have too many branches and too many
employees to achieve the sort of profit margins enjoyed by banks
in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Now the more important task for European banking remains
cost-cutting, rather than revenue-enhancement. But even the
cost-cutting goal remains elusive in Europe, it said, given the
powerful sway that labor unions, governments, and public opinion
have over the industry.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, speculation continued that Credit Suisse
Group of Switzerland will be involved in the next major European
deal, with possible partners including some major German banks.
</P>
<P>
Other merger scenarios include Deutsche Bank AG with Munich
Re, Allianz AG with Dresdner Bank Ag, Barclays Bank PLC with
National Westminster Bank PLC, and HSBC Holdings PLC with J.P.
Morgan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Delay F-22 Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
expected to put off a final approval for production of F-22
fighters until the end of 1999 to ensure enough time for flight
testing.
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, last month said the F-22 production should be delayed
for a year because of engineering problems and a lack of flight
testing.
</P>
<P>
But Jacques Gansler, undersecretary of defense for acquisition
and technology, said at a Pentagon briefing Wednesday he is
recommending that two production models be built as planned this
December, but that the decision to authorize production of the
entire line of 339 F-22s be delayed until December 1999, when
another six planes are to be built.
</P>
<P>
The F-22 fighter, which uses stealth or radar-evading
technology, is to replace aging F-15s and F-16s in the coming
century, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon wants at least 200 hours of flight tests before
approving full production, Gansler said. So far, only one flight
test has been conducted for a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to make a formal
decision on whether to follow Gansler's recommendations before
December.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the first two production models plus related
expenditures is 595 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indian Finance Minister Says India to Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- India's Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha said here on Wednesday that He would strive to
double 1997 foreign investment of 3 billion U.S. dollars during
his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever needs to be done will be done to achieve the goal,"
Sinha told U.S. business executives at a breakfast meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sinha was appointed finance minister in India's new coalition
government formed three weeks ago. He is in Washington to attend
the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Sinha said the Indian coalition government led by Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wanted to "grow India without
anti-foreignism", which U.S. investors are concerned about. The
Indian coalition would take market-friendly measure to attract
more foreign capital, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government will also seek to boost its export
capability and product quality with a focus on infrastructure,
energy and technology, Sinha said.
</P>
<P>
But "non-priority" areas of imports, which would cover many
consumer goods, would be discouraged, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sinha said he expected India's economic growth at 7 to 8
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF in its semiannual World Economic Outlook this
week cut India's 1998 growth estimate to 5.2 percent from 5.5
percent in 1997, citing concerns about political uncertainty and
high interest rates.

NICOSIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will invest 200-250
million pounds (about 400-500 million U.S. dollars) in tourism,
the Financial Mirror newspaper reported on Wednesday.

The paper quoted Cypriot Minister of Commerce, Industry and
Tourism Nicos Rolandis as saying that Cyprus has so far invested
1.5 billion pounds (3 billion dollars) in the sector.

The tourism industry is Cyprus' most dynamic economic
sector. It accounts for 20 percent of the 4.3-billion-pound
(8.6-billion-dollar) gross domestic product of the Mediterranean
island.
</P>

The minister expected more than 2 million tourists to visit his
country this year, an increase of 5 to 10 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Strikes Positive Balance of Telecom Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- German Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said on Thursday that 100 days of liberalization of the
German telecommunications market has achieved positive results
with competition heating up and prices going down.
</P>
<P>
In an assessment of the market opening since January this year,
Rexrodt said that due to private competition, prices for the
long-distance telephone calls had been cut by up to 70 percent in
Germany when compared with the end of last year. Meanwhile
short-distance telephone charges also dropped by up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
More than two percent of all telephone calls were now handled
by private operators, a share which was expected to be broadened
to five percent in a few months, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt also noted that the market opening had also injected
new impetus for growth and job creation.
</P>
<P>
After about 50,000 new jobs had created in each of the past two
year in telecom and information industries, another 100,000 jobs
were expected to be created this year, Rexrodt said.
</P>
<P>
The economics minister also stressed the government's
determination to fully open up the country's post services to
private competition by the year 2003. Currently about half of the
German post market are still controlled by the state monopoly, the
Deutsche Post AG.

<HEADLINE> ANZ Bank's Asian Exposure Down 38 Percent in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ), which had its ratings downgraded
recently because of its exposure to Asia, revealed on Thursday its
total exposure to the region had fallen 38 percent to 7.1 billion
U.S. dollars in the six months to March 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chief financial officer Peter Marriott said the bank would
incur some losses from its exposures, but it did not expect its
specific provisions to exceed its standard provisioning policy.
</P>
<P>
He also said the bank's economic and financial forecast for the
region was more positive, and it had confidence in the reform
progress of the troubled nations.
</P>
<P>
"We have confidence in the way that all these countries are
sticking to their reform programs," he was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
David Ward, a general manager of the ANZ, said the decline in
ANZ's regional exposure would slow over the next six months
because the bank would continue to write business in the region
for its customers.
</P>
<P>
The multi-billion dollar reduction in the bank's regional
exposure occurred because Asian companies met their loan repayment
requirements, and not through writedowns.
</P>
<P>
He declined, however, to reveal the extent of the ANZ's
non-performing loans until the half-yearly profit results are
released next month.
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time we are not disclosing non-accrual loans
or specific provisions because that's part of our May profit
announcement," Marriott said.
</P>
<P>
Two international ratings agencies, Moody's Investor Services
and Standard &AMP; Poor's, downgraded the ratings outlook for the bank
from stable to negative in January and February respectively.
</P>
<P>
In response, Chief Executive John McFarlane said the change in
the ratings outlook was "unduly cautious," arguing that the bank
had been "managing down our overall exposure to Asian-owned
entities whilst preserving relationships with our major clients."

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Heeds Year 2000 Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the World's software
giant, began to take heed of the year 2000 computer bug problem as
it showed in its newly revamped Web site.
</P>
<P>
It announced earlier this week that it would take a strategy to
screen its big name products like Windows 95, Office 95 and Office
97, which are more likely to have bugs.
</P>
<P>
Of the products tested, the vast majority are compliant or
compliant with "minor issues" that are now documented, said Jason
Matusow, the company's Year 2000 strategy manager.
</P>
<P>
Out of all the software products it produced only three --
Access 2.0, Word for MS-DOS 5.0 and Office Professional 4.3 -- are
not Year 2000 compliant, he said. However, products that are
compliant with "minor issues" include widely used products like
Windows NT server and workstation 4.0, Windows 95, Office 4.0
Standard, and both Office 95 and 97 standard and professional
editions.
</P>
<P>
After the tests and fixing work are completed, if a product
needs a fix or service pack for compliance, the company will
provide it for free, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the effort is late in the game and marks a change
in the company's expectations for Windows 98 adoption. Microsoft's
Windows version 3.1 needs some adjustments to be fully Year 2000
compliant, and the company has had to issue patches to make
Windows 95 Year 2000 ready.

<HEADLINE> Patent Cooperation Promotes Technology Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Patent Cooperation Treaty
(PCT) requires China to grant 36,534 patents to domestic and
overseas applicants in 1997, a 2.3-fold rise from the figure for
1994, when the nation joined the treaty, according to a
high-ranking patent official.
</P>
<P>
The treaty requires China to research and use the most advanced
technologies invented by enterprises from developed countries,
according to Gao Lulin, commissioner of the State Intellectual
Property Office (SIPO).
</P>
<P>
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) formed the
PCT which now has 95 member nations. The treaty allows applicants
to acquire worldwide protection if granted an international patent
in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
A number of multinational corporations, including Samsung and
Motorola, have increased the number of patent applications submitted
annually in China.
</P>
<P>
The top ten foreign businesses sumbitted 3,851 patent
applications in 1997, as against 575 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Strict patent protection and international cooperation
continue to play an active role in China's efforts to attract
foreign investment, according to Gao
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Chinese enterprises have also made
patent applications in other countries which have signed the PCT.
</P>
<P>
The WIPO is currently organizing a three-day international
symposium in Beijing to discuss the PCT system in the 21st
century.

workers will be affected when Toyota's production line in
Melbourne stops next Tuesday because the ongoing waterfront
dispute is holding up vital car parts on Melbourne's wharves.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Australia President Sam Komori said 45 containers of
components needed for the company's Melbourne production line were
stranded on East Swanson Dock, where union picket lines are
blocking the docks.
</P>
<P>
"So far, all efforts to have the containers taken off the dock
have failed and we are fast running out of parts," Komori said in
a statement released in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The auto company will become the first Australian manufacturing
firm forced to halt production by protesting sacked workers
following the sacking of 1,400 unionized dock workers at major
ports across the nation by stevedoring company Patrick last week.
</P>
<P>
The sacking was backed by the Australian government in a bid to
break the 60-year-old monopoly of power of the Maritime Union of
Australia (MUA) and improve dock efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Australian Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith announced
its political and financial support for Patrick just hours after
Patrick forced its unionized workers out of their posts with
security persons and dogs on April 7.
</P>
<P>
Reith said Toyota's move to halt production next week because
of the waterfront dispute was a damning indictment of the union
movement, and the minister accused the car workers' union, the
Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), of putting the
interests of the MUA ahead of its own members by backing the
picket on the docks.
</P>
<P>
Sacked workers and their family members have been protesting
over the their dismissal in major Australian ports, including
Sydney and Melbourne, with hundreds of them blocking the docks.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard told Australian
Broadcasting Corporation radio early on Thursday that the
government will not yield to the pressure of the union.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Features Colorful Household Electric Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The large international household
electric appliances show which opened on Tuesday in Beijing
features colorful appliances which are expected to seriously
challenge the traditional black and white units.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Household Electric Appliances '98 has served as a
venue for the introduction of new products, with the Haier Group
presenting its Huawangzi (Picture Prince) model refrigerator. the
Italian Ariston-Merloni Household Electric Corp. introducing a
colorful refrigerator series. and the Xiaoya Group premiering its
new washing machine series -- "Rainbow Washers."
</P>
<P>
Chinese consumers began purchasing electric appliances on a
large-scale in the 1980's, with black and white products having
since dominated the market.
</P>
<P>
White has long been the predominant color used for
refrigerators, washers and air conditioners, with black dominating
TV sets and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
European and North American electric appliance manufacturers
have extensively developed colored units in recent years, while
improving quality and introducing new functions.
</P>
<P>
Colorful and decorative household electric appliances have
emerged as the new trend on the international market.
</P>
<P>
A Haier representative said that Huawangzi refrigerators, which
were introduced in Beijing and Shanghai, have received a positive
consumer response.
</P>
<P>
Ariston-Merloni, the first manufacturer in the world to win a
patent for colored appliance technology, plans to introduce its
colored refrigerators to the Chinese market, according to Li
Dubai, manager of the Italian company's Beijing Office.
</P>
<P>
With more money in their pockets, the chinese consumers have
greater discrimination when selecting products, said Li, adding
that his company has full confidence in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
"Some consumers, especially young people, are placing increased
importance on the decorative aspects of household electric
appliances, and are at the same time paying more attention to
performance."
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that many Chinese families place electric
appliances such as refrigerators and washers in their living rooms
due to limited kitchen space. Decorative electric appliances face
a promising future on the market.

<HEADLINE> Officials Punished for Dereliction of Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party Committee of
Luliang Prefecture in north China's Shanxi Province announced
today that 24 officials have been punished in line with Party and
administrative discipline procedures for dereliction of duty
involving their failure to inspect counterfeit spirits.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, farmers in a number of locations
throughout Shanxi distilled and sold counterfeit low quality
spirits which killed 26 and poisoned hundreds of people. Six
perpetrators were sentenced to death on March 9 with the approval
of the Supreme People's Court, with various others subject to
differing degrees of punishment.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin expressed great concern for the incident,
and local governments in Shanxi have since investigated cases
involving alleged dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
The 24 people punished included one prefectural official and
five county-level officials, including Li Liulan, secretary of the
Communist Party Committee of Wenshui County, Wenshui Magistrate
Song Weimin and Deputy Magistrate Cheng Haihan, and Vice-Mayor Li
Guangmao of Fenyang City.
</P>
<P>
A number of officials in charge of quality inspection of liquor
were also penalized for neglecting their duties.
</P>
<P>
Various officials were subject to Party warnings or major
administrative demerits on their records, with other either
expelled from the Party or removed from their official posts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Favor Patent Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial enterprises
have exhibited an increasing preference for intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released today by the State
Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), the number of patent
applications from Chinese industrial enterprises increased by 25
percent last year from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chinese industrial enterprises made a record 25,469 Patent
applications in 1997, as against 7,020 in 1991, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Haier Group, China's major manufacturer of household
electrical appliances located in Qingdao, Shandong Province, led
the nation's business sector in patent applications for
technological inventions and designs.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 enterprises in patent applications included the
China Petrochemical Corporation and the Shanghai-based Baoshan
Steel Group.
</P>
<P>
The nation's scientific research institutes have submitted
2,000 applications annually in the past seven years, with
the number of applications from universities and colleges
declining on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also revealed that economically developed coastal
areas and provinces in south China led the nation in terms of
applications. For example, Guangdong Province, an economic
powerhouse neighboring Hong Kong, accounted for nearly 15 percent
of the total patent applications in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China has standardized competition between domestic businesses
by strengthening the protection of intellectual property
rights, according to a SIPO official.
</P>
<P>
Patents granted to multinational corporations have not only
provided China with information about the development of the
high-tech industry but also sparked an increase in foreign
investments, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China adopted its first Patent Law in 1993 and in the following
year signed the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) formulated by the
World Intellectual Property Organization.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Uganda to Strengthen Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Uganda signed
two agreements on trade and on economic, scientific and cultural
cooperation here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The accords were signed after talks between Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni,
said Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Museveni proposed that Malaysia consider
investing in Uganda's manufacturing as well as the cocoa, tea and
coffee plantation sectors.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said he also looked forward to having Malaysia
investment in his country's booming hotel and travel industry,
Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda also sought Malaysia's cooperation in human resources
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister gave the undertaking to assign a minister
as well as a Malaysian trade and investment mission to explore
investment and trade opportunities in Uganda," said Badawi.
</P>
<P>
He said Mahathir expressed Malaysia's keenness in investing in
telecommunications and power generation.
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time the prime minister said given the current
economic problems, the capacity of the Malaysian businessmen and
investors may be a little limited," said Badawi.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also expressed willingness to hold courses on
privatization and help set up free trade zones and industrial
parks should Uganda require them.
</P>
<P>
Museveni arrived here Wednesday for a four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports Causes, Potential Cures of Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday presented the Security Council of the United
Nations a report on causes and potential cures of conflict in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
On September 25, 1997, the Security Council convened at the
level of Foreign Ministers to consider the need for a concerted
international efforts to promote peace and security in the
continent. At this meeting, the UN Secretary-General was requested
by the Council to submit the report.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief's 21-page report, perhaps his most important
political report to date, analyzes sources of conflict in Africa,
ways to prevent and address those conflicts, and how to lay the
foundation for durable peace and economic growth following the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, more than 30 wars have been fought in Africa, the
vast majority of them intra-state in origin. In 1996 alone, 14 of
the 53 countries of Africa were afflicted by armed conflicts,
accounting for more than half of all war-related deaths worldwide
and resulting in more than 8 million refugees, returnees and
displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of those conflicts have not only seriously
undermimed Africa's efforts to ensure long-term stability,
prosperity and peace for its people, but also poses a major
challenge to United Nations efforts designed to ensure global
peace, prosperity and human rights for all.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Investors continued to pile onto
the Internet bandwagon today, powering stocks to new highs as
Yahoo showed the sector can be profitable.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo Inc, the famous search engine maker on the Internet, has
been chased by buyers over the past few weeks and its stock price
has been pushed as high as 119 U.S. dollars at the opening today.
</P>
<P>
It retreated a bit as the broad market dipped at profit taking
after the Dow Jones industrial average set new highs over the past
two sessions on end.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the American Stock Exchange of Internet stocks
was up 2.5 percent as the sector sprinted ahead of the broader
market.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believed that as Compaq and other computer
hardware companies missed earnings estimates, a lot of
institutional money were turned into Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo's stock price was just a bit more than 20 U.S. dollars
last June and it jumped to 60 dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Talk of a stock split at Yahoo also is fueling the share
price, said analysts, who cautioned that the dizzying rise makes
Internet stocks vulnerable to a sharp pullback.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder says the Justice Department is still negotiating with
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr in an attempt to prevent Secret
Service testimony.
</P>
<P>
Starr wants uniformed service personnel to tell what they know
about the relationship between President Bill Clinton and former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The independent counsel is
pursuing allegations that the president urged Lewinsky to lie
under oath about an affair.
</P>
<P>
But the Justice Department contends the Secret Service should
have some form of privilege that prevents its officers from
testifying against the president.
</P>
<P>
Starr has reportedly filed a motion with a federal judge in
Washington asking that Secret Service personnel be compelled to
testify before his grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Holder told reporters Thursday, "It's our hope to resolve this
matter short of litigation."
</P>
<P>
While conceding that there is no case law outlining privilege
for Secret Service personnel, Holder said Secret Service privilege
could be established "if there was a general consensus that such a
privilege exists."

PHNOM PENH, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pol Pot, former Cambodian
Khmer Rouge leader, may be really dead this time, Cambodia's
co-Minister of Defense Tea Banh said on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Tea Banh told Xinhua by telephone he believed that Pol Pot was
dead this time because of his poor health.
</P>
<P>
However, the royal government could not confirm the news of Pol
Pot's death yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to senior Thai military officials, Pol Pot died of a

jungle close to the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Khmer Rouge's clandestine radio also broadcast Thursday the

Khieu Kanarhidh, secretary of state for the Information
Ministry, said Thursday that the Cambodian royal government was
contacting the Thai military and the sections of Khmer Rouge to
confirm the death of Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kanarhidh said that the Cambodian government's
position is that any side getting hold of Pol Pot or his body
should immediately turn him or it to the royal government.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot, the most powerful leader of Khmer Rouge, lost his
power in a bloody internal struggle of Khmer Rouge last year and
was then put under house arrest.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pol Pot, former Cambodian
Khmer Rouge leader, died of heart attack on Wednesday night, the
Khmer Rouge broadcasting station announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Pol Pot, 73, died at 11:15 p.m. (local
time) on a hill near Anlong Veng, the last stronghold of Khmer
Rouge near the Cambodian-Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Another report coming from the scene said that Khmer Rouge had
shown off his body to some reporters and Thai officers to prove
his death.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot's wife and daughter were among the only mourners along
with five young Khmer Rouge soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Some Khmer Rouge soldiers were quoted as saying that Pol Pot
would be cremated in three days.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot, the most powerful leader of Khmer Rouge, lost his
power in a bloody internal struggle of the organization last year
and was then put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
The defections of a large number of Khmer Rouge troops on March
26 enabled the Cambodian government forces to capture Anlong Veng
and push Khmer Rouge remainders into jungles near the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Chea Mun, commander of the Cambodian Army in the Anlong Veng
zone, said Thursday that Ta Mok, current head of the Khmer Rouge,
had taken Pol Pot with him when he retreated from Anlong Veng.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Nou, who had been assigned to guard Pol Pot, said that Pol
Pot died in a hut built for him after he lost his power.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Khieu Kanaridh, secretary of state for the
Cambodian Information Ministry, told Xinhua, "the Cambodian
government's position is that any side which gets hold of Pol Pot
or his body should immediately turn him or it over to the royal
government."
</P>

CHANGSHA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian
has called on the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China to
fully participate in the nation's reform and work hard to
build a new image as a modern revolutionary army.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a recent inspection tour of central
China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Chi, member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) Central Committee, noted that China's reform and
socialist modernization drive are entering a critical period. He
stressed that all the members of the PLA should remain fully
confident in front of problems and difficulties emerging during
the deepening of the reform.
</P>
<P>
He said PLA' officers and men should study Deng Xiaoping Theory
and the documents approved by the 15th CPC National Congress and
the First Session of the 9th National People's Congress so as
to gain a better understanding of the reform.
</P>
<P>
On the modernization of the army, he said, the rapid
development of the high-tech industry has sparked profound changes
in the military field, creating both challenges and opportunities
to the PLA.
</P>
<P>
He urged the PLA staff to improve both political and
professional knowledge levels in order to fully enhance the combat
readiness and effectiveness of the army.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Pursues Anti-Graft Drive: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Executive Secretary
Alexander Aguirre said Thursday that the government has
aggressively pursued the drive against graft and corruption which
has reduced bureaucracy and the cases of graft.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre made the statement in response to criticisms from some
presidential candidates against the government's record on
fighting graft and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Commission against Graft and Corruption
(PCAGC) in fact reported a declining incidence of graft and
corruption being brought to their attention, Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases filed with the PCAGC peaked in 1994 with
205 cases, but dipped to 115 in 1995, 98 in 1996 and only 45 in
1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the present government will continue to push its
campaign against graft and corruption in the remaining part of its
term in office.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines will hold its presidential elections on May 11.
President Fidel Ramos will step down when his
constitutionally-mandated single six-year term expires on June 30.

<HEADLINE> Higher Commodity Prices Push Australian Stocks Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Higher commodity prices on
Thursday boosted resource stocks and led the Australian
sharemarket to another record closing high.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index improved 10.9 points to 2,881.4 as the
buying in resources offset profit-taking in banks after their
recent surge.
</P>
<P>
The market hit an early intraday record high of 2,893.7 before
easing on some booking of profits and weak Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
"These better metal prices have certainly helped resource
stocks which have been lagging the market recently while the banks
had their run," Steve Mayne from Nevitts said.
</P>
<P>
"The banks fell on a bit of profit-taking and the Asian markets
were a bit weak so we came back this afternoon," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index rose 28.3 points to 1,222.0 after a
strong overnight rise in the copper price to a 1998 high, and
increases also in aluminum, nickel and oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Copper giant BHP Co. Ltd. benefited from the better prices to
improve 46.9 cents to 15.659 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto also had a marked improvement, closing
50.8 cents higher at 20.75 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index added 5.3 points to 1,303.5 although the bullion
price fell to 306.25 U.S. dollars an ounce, down 2.80 U.S. dollars
from the close in Melbourne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fell 6.2 points to 4,958.3 as
investors cashed in on the recent bank rally.
</P>
<P>
ANZ bank shares dropped 13.8 cents to 11.742 Australian dollars
despite announcing on Thursday that its exposure to Asia had
fallen 38 percent since September.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank was unmoved at 23.10 Australian
dollars, Westpac bank had a big 33.7-cent drop to 11.043
Australian dollars while Commonwealth bank was four cents lighter
at 19.45 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover for Thursday was 399.96 million shares at a
value of 807.95 million U.S. dollars, with rises outnumbering
falls 689 to 543.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigration Threating Romania's Security: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Illegal immigrates are threats
to Romania's national security, the Romanian newspaper, The Truth,
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal immigration has greatly damaged the country," the
newspaper quoted a senior police officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government will take severe measures to stop the
phenomenon, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that illegal immigrates from Asian and the CIS
countries always transit Romania to the Western European nations
and, in 1997 alone, they committed more than 2,200 crimes here.
</P>
<P>
The officer blamed this situation on Romania's diplomatic
representatives' offices overseas, because it was too easy for
these dubious foreigners, some of them noted criminal offenders,
to get Romanian visas.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) - The Russian Communist Party and its
allies will vote against would-be prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko
in a second parliamentary ballot Friday, Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with Kiriyenko, Zyuganov also said the
left-wing bloc, which has 221 seats in the 450-seat State Duma,
the lower house of parliament, would insist to vote by a show of
hands rather than a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko failed to win approval in the Duma's first ballot on
his candidacy for the premiership last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov insists that 35-year-old technocrat Kiriyenko was too
young and inexperienced to head the government.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, chosen by President Boris Yeltsin for the post,
needs 226 votes to be confirmed as prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Tries to Stop Political Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei finally intervened Thursday in a political row
between the moderates and the conservatives with a call for unity
and solidarity among the different branches of the regime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the heads of the government, the judiciary and the
legislature, Khamenei said the main feature of the Islamic
political and social system is unity and solidarity, the Iranian
official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
If all forces in the country join hands to keep hoisted the
flag of Islam with amity and sympathy, the hope sparked in the
hearts of the Muslims will be kept alive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's call came one day after the release of the moderate
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who was detained on April 4
by the conservative judiciary on charges of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's detention triggered a power struggle between the
moderates and the conservatives and brought the government of
President Mohammad Khatami and the judiciary headed by Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi to stand against each other.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei warned against magnifying some of the problems and
blowing small flaws out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
"We are still at the beginning of the road" to build the
country and bring the Islamic civilization before the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that traces of attempts to create tension and rift
among the people can be found in the propaganda of the enemies
outside the borders and in the attempts of their followers inside
the country as well as by those whose interests have been damaged
by the revolution.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to support the government, the
judiciary and the legislature, saying that all are duty-bound to
support both the administration and the judiciary.

WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

heavily hit by a tornado last week, and promised that the
government would fully assist its recovery.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

cancer checkups for a decade can expect to get at least one false
alarm, wrongly suggesting the presence of a tumor, said new

cancer screening.
</P>
<P>
-- Fifteen years before the Food and Drug Administration made

<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Cultural Festival
opened here today, with the Russian State Folk Dance Company
giving an evening performance.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Culture Minister Sun Jiazheng addressed the opening
ceremony and noted that the festival is an important event in
the Sino-Russian cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the festival will serve as a new
starting point for bilateral cultural exchanges and build a

Acting Russian Culture Minister Natalia Dementyeva said on the

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Pushes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar pushed
higher on Thursday but was largely sidelined as the market focused
on the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The local currency lifted as high as 65.15 U.S. cents before
closing at 65.00 from 64.72 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"With interest rates on the back burner, the Australian dollar
has been offered some well-earned relief," Colonial State Bank
Chief Economist Craig James said.
</P>
<P>
A number of factors have weighed on the Australian dollar in
recent weeks, including speculation about a cut in official
interest rates, weakness of the Japanese economy, the Australian
waterfront conflict, and sluggish commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
However, Wednesday's G7 meeting has put the focus back on the
yen.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after the meeting of world finance
ministers in Washington, members of the Group of Seven top
industrial nations welcomed steps taken by Japan to stimulate its
economy, but appeared to offer little support for Tokyo's drive to
bolster the sagging yen.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin confirmed the country's
strong U.S. dollar policy remains in place and added that the G7
meeting did not discuss the possibility of joint intervention in
the currency markets.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 85.43 yen from a close of 83.57 on
Wednesday, and at 1.1754 Deutsche marks from 1.1658 marks.

<HEADLINE> China To Train IPR Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to train
experts on intellectual property rights in order to stimulate the
nation's economic growth and serve related global protection,
according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an ongoing international symposium on intellectual
property protection, Zhou Guangzhao, vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), disclosed that
the Chinese government recently established the China Intellectual
Property Rights Training Center, the first of its kind in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The center will be the pivotal education base for nurturing
intellectual property professionals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven well-known intellectual property experts have been
invited to teach at the center, according to officials from the
State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO).
</P>
<P>
The center will also collect the latest academic works for
training programs and will regularly organize international forums.
</P>
<P>
"Establishment of the center will alleviate the severe shortage
of the IPR specialists in China," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
"We will strengthen the cooperation with the World Intellectual
Property Rights Organization and strive to be the WIPO's key base
in the Asia-Pacific Region," said Gao Lulin, Commissioner of the
SIPO, the organization which will administer the new training
center.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Chinese government upgraded the office in
charge of intellectual property rights to a department directly
under the State Council. China also adopted its first patent law
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
WIPO Deputy Director-General Francois Curchod expressed full
support for the Chinese training center.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Good progress is being made in
the clean-up of dead fish as a result of a toxic red tide, a Hong
Kong official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip completed a
helicopter inspection of the clearance exercise over Tolo Harbor,
Sai Kung, Kat O and Lamma Island Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the northeastern part of the water surface of Hong Kong
was basically cleared of dead fish. Only off Lamma Island there
was still a small quantity of dead fish to be collected.
</P>
<P>
About 120 tons of dead fish was scavenged Thursday. The Marine
Department is working from dawn to dusk, deploying a total of 51
vessels in the operation. The exercise is expected to continue
over the next few days until all the dead fish is disposed of.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- About 840,000 pirated compact
discs (CDs) were seized in a joint operation by Hong Kong's
anti-graft and customs officers, the Customs and Excise Department
(CED) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and Customs

an industrial premises at Tsuen Wan, the "New Territories."
</P>
<P>
"This is a record seizure effected in a single storage location
and the value is estimated at about 26 million HK dollars (3.3
million U.S. dollars)," said a CED spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Officers found that over 54,000 copies of the pirated CDs are
of an obscene nature.
</P>
<P>
Initial inquiries indicated that about 15 percent of the goods
in question were from Taiwan. Follow-up investigations are
continuing, the spokesman added.

CDs and production equipment were seized.
</P>

The Customs, in conjunction with other Law enforcement
agencies, has once again demonstrated the full commitment to
eradicating piracy in Hong Kong, protecting the rights of

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will have a surplus of
1.1 million tons of sugar for export this year as a result of a
bumper sugarcane crop, the official Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's 73 sugar mills had turned out 3.25 million tons
of sugar by the end of March this year, APP said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources are expecting an additional output of 250,000
tons of sugar by the mills till next month, which will make the
total output at 3.5 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
The amount, together with the holdover stock of 400,000 tons,
makes a total availability of 3.9 million tons in the country.
</P>
<P>
After deducting the total domestic demand of 2.8 million tons,
the country will have a surplus stock of 1.1 million tons this
year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan reported a bumper crop of 52 million tons of sugarcane
last year, as the higher support price encouraged local growers to
cultivate more sugarcane.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Foreign Minister Accuses EU of Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi Wednesday accused the European Union (EU) of encouraging
subversive elements in the west African country by funding their
activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 54th session of the United Nations Commission
of Human Rights (UNCHR) in Geneva, Ikimi said the EU has set
aside three million European Community Unit (about three million
U.S. Dollars) in its 1998 budget to support the so-called
pro-democracy activities in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that in spite of our protest, these funds have
been made available and are now being secretly disbursed in
Nigeria to finance subversion through out the country," said
Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reiterated his government's commitment to
protecting human rights of all Nigerians, and vowed to resist
attempts by some powerful nations to dictate to the country what
system of government it must operate and who its leader should
be, said a report reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He accused these nations of using human rights as tool to
project their narrow foreign policy interests and objectives.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi stressed the need to make efforts at all levels to
recognize the importance of consultations and dialog among member
states, not only for the promotion of human rights, but also for
enhancing international relations as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He urged the UNCHR to adopt a pragmatic and forward-looking
approach to the issue of human rights, by not adopting any
resolution against Nigeria and removing the item of human rights
situation in Nigeria from its agenda.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wants Israeli Pullback Offer Linked to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has said Israel's offer to pull back from south Lebanon would be
more effective if it is linked with a similar move on the Syrian
track.
</P>
<P>
"The British government regards this (Israeli) stance as a
positive step, and that the application will be easier if progress
would be made within the context of a comprehensive settlement
mainly on the Syrian track," he told the Arabic daily Al Ahram in
an interview published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, but conditioned a pullback from south Lebanon on
making security arrangements with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, wanting a full and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon as well as the Syrian Golan Heights,
have rejected the Israeli plan as an attempt to drive a wedge
between them. Peace talks between Israel and the Lebanese and
Syrian sides have been stalled since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The interview was published a day before Blair starts a two-day
visit to Egypt Friday on the first leg of his Mideast tour aimed
at pushing forward the peace-making. He will also visit Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he looks forward to meeting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to discuss a host of issues of mutual interest,
especially the stalemated Mideast peace process and the current
Arab conditions.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, and
other EU member states feel deeply concerned over the
"disappearance of Madrid's and Oslo's spirit," Blair said,
referring respectively to the 1991 peace conference in the Spanish
capital and the Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement signed in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU members give top priority to the peace issue
thanks to their economic and historical ties as well as their
vital interests with countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We should earnestly work to set up confidence among parties
and to float ideas that could contribute to boosting the
U.S. drive to bring about peace in the region," said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing worries that the U.S. might "wash hands off" the
stalled peace process, he assured that "Washington will not pull
out from the peace process in the Middle East", adding that the
European role will be complementary to the American one.
</P>
<P>
As for the current situation in Iraq, Blair mentioned about
Bratain's attitude toward the U.N. sanctions on Iraq and the
keenness that humanitarian assistance reaches the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq honors its pledges, cooperates with U.N. arms
inspectors and applies what was cited in U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan's memorandum, then talks will start about lifting those
sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq negotiated a deal with the U.N. in February, which helped
avert imminent U.S. and British military strikes and paved way for
unfettered U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait
can not be lifted until the U.N. gives it a clean bill of health
on destroying its weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Product Quality Improves at Large, Mid-Size Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Large- and mid-size companies
continue to perform well in quality control checks compared with
small enterprises, according to an official inspection report for
the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprises were given a quality rating of 93.3 percent,
up 4.6 percent from the previous quarter, while mid-size companies
had an average rating of 91.9 percent, their highest record since
1995, according to the report, which was released by the State
Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision (SBQTS).
</P>
<P>
Both quality ratings are above average for the 1,050 companies
checked, or 76.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The product quality of the country's large- and mid-size
manufacturers has been improving steadily during the past few
years, said an official with SBQTS, adding that this may help some
state-owned enterprises solve the problem of slow sales.
</P>
<P>
He said that the comparatively low quality rating of small
enterprises, which stood at 70.2 percent in the first quarter of
this year, is the major factor hindering the progress of the
average quality rating.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicated that quality problems with some
medical equipment, food and mining equipment were still serious.
</P>
<P>
SBQTS has already urged technical supervision departments at
all levels to resolve these problems, listed in the report, and
pay special attention to products closely related to people's
health and safety.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A baby giant panda, weighing 160
grams when its was born, has passed an examination by experts in
the Beijing Zoo and been awarded a health certificate.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinguo, the zoo's deputy director, said the giant panda,
named "Ben Ben," was born in July and was not up to health
standards at one month old.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ben's mother, Yong Yong, was 16 years old and very sick
when giving birth to Ben Ben and another 80-gram panda, who was too
weak to survive.
</P>
<P>
Before Ben Ben, Yong Yong had delivered seven pandas.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ben's weight reached 8,700 grams 100 days after its birth
and was in good health because of the panda keepers' efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ben now weighs 33 kilograms and its health is normal.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Zoo has 14 giant pandas, 13 of them artificially bred.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are considered an endangered species. There are
about 1,000 giant pandas worldwide, most of them living in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.

LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Ruud Gullit said English
Premiership club Chelsea sacked him because Stamford Bridge
chairman Ken Bates felt jealous and uneasy of his success.
</P>
<P>
Gullit compared himself to former vice-chairman Matthew
Harding, who died in a helicopter crash, after he got too much
attention from his achievement.
</P>
<P>
But he said he did not regret being sacked because he could not
work any longer in that kind of atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Gullit, who was never told the reason of being sacked , was
kicked out of the club on an excuse that his transfer budget was
too much to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea is 1-0 down in the first leg of the European Cup
Winners' Cup clash with Vicenza and is bidding to turn around the
table in the return leg at home.

<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea hosted an evening working dinner for
their Republic of Korea counterparts, according to sources from
ROK.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for the two sides held last-minute talks in a bid
to narrow remaining gaps. However, no information has been
released concerning the location and results of the dinner meeting.
</P>
<P>
The first high-level direct contact between the two sides in
four years adjourned this morning following a two-hour closed-door
session which showed no signs of tangible results following
a break on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We engaged in serious talks during today's meeting, and
time for the next round of talks will be determined and scheduled
during further contacts," according to Chun Kum Chul, leader of
the DPRK delegation.
</P>
<P>
ROK delegation leader Jeong Se Hyun pointed to the lack of
progress during the morning session.
</P>
<P>
However, one DPRK delegate was quoted as saying that the
delegation does not want to go home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Local observers note that it is too early to predict the
outcome of the dinner meeting which might, in fact, lead to
further talks.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, both sides agreed to remain in Beijing for an
additional two days following the unsuccessful third round of full
meetings which failed to yield an agreement concerning fertilizer
supplies from the ROK.
</P>
<P>
The two sides remained in contact on Thursday, with each
waiting for the other side to take the first step needed to spark
the resumption of talks. Neither side has shown a willingness
to make concessions.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Step up Crackdown on Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Government has decided to
step up crackdown on piracy through strict restrictions on the
import and export of certain equipment and products.
</P>
<P>
Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira has signed a new decree,
which will be published in the government gazette next week, to
restrict the flow of machines and products that are liable for
making piracy from May 1.
</P>

The import and export of more than 20 items, which include
printing machines, video-taking equipment and other machines that
can be used to make pirated products must first obtain approval and
license.
</P>
<P>
The restriction also covers such digital products as CD-ROM's,
LD's, VCD's and DVD's, according to the decree.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Wednesday night from the Government
Information Office said the authorities hope these measures will
prevent piracy of computer programs, games and digital audio and
video products and other illegal business activities.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to put the import and export of audio and
video recorders and other products that can be used for piracy
under control so as to implement Macao's due duty as a member of
the World Trade Organization in the protection of intellectual
property rights," the governor said in the decree.

<HEADLINE> MTN Promises to Establish 89,000 Lines in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Mobile Telephone Network (MTN)
has promised to establish 89,000 lines in the next five years in
Uganda, The New Vision reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
John Nasasira, Ugandan minister of works, transport and
communication, yesterday told the paper after a signing ceremony
of the licence of the second national operator to the MTN, a
South Africa led consortium.
</P>
<P>
The MTN consortium is to deposit with the government a credit
letter of four million U.S. dollars to secure the commitment, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to the MTN's bid payment of 5.6 million
U.S. dollars and a licence fee of 200,000 U.S. dollars. The
investment was over 60 million U.S. dollars in the next five
years. MTN has paid up 5.8 million U.S. dollars for the licence,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The licence has clauses protecting consumers against potential
abuses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Sellschop, the MTN corporate public relation excutive,
said MTN will start testing its network within three or four
months and commercial services could commence shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
"Phones are no longer facilities for a privileged few,"
claimed Charles Mbiire, the MTN Uganda chairman.
</P>
<P>
MTN is a South African telecommunication giant. It holds 50
percent of MTN consortium's share. The other shares are kept by
the Swedish based Telia Overseas with 30 percent and Rwanda
registered Trister Investment S.A.R.L. and Uganda's Invesco (U)
Limited with 10 percent each.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan government granted the licence to MTN to break
monopoly in telecommunication in the country. Uganda has devided
Uganda posts and telecommunications into two separate firms: The
Uganda Posts Limited and The Uganda Telecommunications last year.
Earlier reports said the two firms are to privatise later to
improve services and management.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Hampers Somali Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Reports from the Southern
Somali regions of Lower and Middle Jubba indicate that heavy
rains are posing difficulties in both the business and
humanitarian activities in those regions.
</P>
<P>
According to local elders in the Southern port town of Kismaio
and the flood stricken town of Bu'ale, the Gu' season rains have
already begun seriously cutting off many roads within and outside
these towns.
</P>
<P>
On the continuing humanitarian efforts, a World Food Program
convoy which left the port town of Merca, 100 km south of
Mogadishu, last week is yet to reach its destination.
</P>
<P>
The head of loading and transporting firm of the food aid,
Ahmed Mohamed Farah (Hilweyne) said that 319 tons of lentils,
ground maize and cooking oil still remain stuck in the district
of Sakow.
</P>
<P>
Hilweyne said the WFP food convoy is destined to the town of
Bu'ale which has seriously been affected by the floods last year.
</P>
<P>
Four trucks out of the 26 food convoy remained stuck in a mud
27 km south of Sakow town until last night before making to the
town of Sakow yesterday, Hilweyne said.
</P>
<P>
Hilweyne declared that the road situation in the region
doesn't permit them to continue their journey while the heavy
rains still continue falling.
</P>
<P>
The food convoy is accompanied by four battle wagons and quite
a number of heavily armed militiamen. Some of the food convoy was
also destined to Salagle village, 105 km West of Bu'ale town
where people are reportedly suffering the most because of the
past disastrous floods.
</P>
<P>
Inside the Southern port town of Kismaio, 500 km South of
Mogadishu, the rains have hindered the local business activities
closing down many shops and business places. The business of the
town has already been shattered by the recent clan-based clashes
between the Majerten and Marehan subclans over the control of the
town.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this week, the rains have been falling
heavily in the towns of Kismaio, Jamama, Hagar and Bu'ale where
the inter-business between these towns have been cut off after
pools of water have once again been created in the roads already
ruined by last year's floods.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The April 6 coal-mine explosion
in central China's Henan Province was mainly caused by the fight
for resources among individual employers, according to
investigators of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from the explosion in three shafts in
Pingdingshan City now stands at 55.
</P>
<P>
The three shafts, which were connected, are all unlicensed and
their employers illegally conducted mining beyond the allowed
sites, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
To obtain more resources, dynamite was fired in one shaft to
block it but the explosion spread into the other two.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is holding urgent meetings to ensure
safe production and investigating the accident.
</P>
<P>
Li Chengyu, deputy governor of Henan, said the province will
stop approving new small mines. Any mine that was unlicensed
or fails to meet safe production standards will be shut down, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Mao said
here today that the city will take measures to vigorously develop
the service sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the development of the service trade in
Beijing, he said the local government will first open service
markets in the economic and high-tech zones while forming
international service trade companies with the capacity to provide
funds, professionals, management and technology.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will foster more entrepreneurs, business people,
financiers and lawyers familiar with this trade, Zhang said, and
try to guide enterprises in extending their business overseas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is in charge of Beijing's foreign trade and economic
affairs, pledged that the municipal government will work out
measures to support the development of the service trade.
</P>
<P>
For example, the government will give priority to the service
trade in terms of granting loans, tax exemptions, land use and
technological equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also outlined key sectors of the service trade that
Beijing will develop in the near future such as international
travel, finance, insurance and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing already has a sound foundation for developing
these sectors. The international travel and service sectors have
become a main source of foreign currency earners.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the service sector accounted for 53.8 percent of the
city's gross domestic product, topping other cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing received 2,298,000 foreign tourists in 1997, and earned
foreign currency worth 2.25 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- About 1,360 tons of Indian hemp
were seized across Nigeria in 1997, the country's National Drug
Law Enforcement Agency has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Nigerian Television Authority Hausa service
Wednesday, NDLEA chairman, Major-General Musa Bamaiyi said the
cultivation and trafficking in Indian hemp has assumed serious
dimension in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the increased rate of drug trafficking in Nigeria on
the political misunderstanding between Nigeria and the U.S.,
which he said has given traffickers the leeway to engage in their
nefarious trade.
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi urged the U.S. to co-operate with Nigeria in the fight
against drug trafficking and money laundering, saying that it
would be beneficial not only to the two countries, but to
humanity at large.
</P>
<P>
He also warned staff of the NDLEA to desist from corrupt
practices or be booted out of service.
</P>
<P>
"There are bad eggs in NDLEA who will arrest suspects and ask
them to pay certain amounts of money to regain their freedom," he
said, adding that NDLEA would not condone such practices.

TOKYO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo
Thursday with the key Nikkei index closing below the 16,000 line
for the first time since April 7.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted 415.53 points, or
2.55 percent from Wednesday's close to 15,883.77.
</P>

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, sank 24.11 points, or 1.94 percent to

<P>
Trading on the First Section went up to an estimated 400
million shares from Wednesday's 280 million shares.
</P>
<P>

Traders said arbitrage unwinding pulled down stock prices,

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw
arrived here Thursday on a three-day visit to Bangladesh, to
discuss bilateral issues, particularly the repatriation of
Rohingya refugees, border trade and cooperation in joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old foreign minister, who is leading a five-member
delegation, was greeted at the airport by his Bangladeshi
counterpart, Abdus Samad Azad.
</P>
<P>
U Ohn Gyaw, who is also member of the Myanmar-Bangladesh Joint
Border Commission, is the highest-ranking Myanmar official to
visit Bangladesh since June 1996, when the present Awami
League-led government was formed.
</P>
<P>
Repatriation of some 21,000 Rohingya refugees at different
transit camps in Cox's Bazar, southeast Bangladesh, would be the
major topic of official discussions on Friday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also expected to discuss repatriation of
Myanmar nationals from Bangladeshi jails, removal of land mines
from border areas, the conclusion of a treaty on demarcation of
land boundary, expansion of border trade, and demarcation of
maritime boundary.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250,000 Rohingyas crossed Bangladesh border in 1991,
and about 230,000 of them have been repatriated under joint
supervision of Bangladesh and Myanmar governments and the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation process, however, has remained stalled since
July 1997 reportedly as a result of the refugees' refusal to
return.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls on Students to Return to Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
called on the protesting students to return to class and develop
their competitiveness in order to face the future.
</P>
<P>
"The president asked that students continue their studies so
that they could become competitive people," Minister of Education
and Culture Wiranto Arismunandar said Wednesday evening after
meeting with Soeharto, official Antara News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This (competitiveness) is important because otherwise we would
not be able to have national resistance, economic, political and
cultural resistance," the minister quoted Soeharto as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students kept up their demands for reforms and
lower prices of basic commodities Wednesday at campus rallies
organized concurrently at dozens of universities in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least four campuses in Jakarta witnessed noisy rallies
demanding a reshuffle of the cabinet, a clean government, lower
prices of commodities and the empowerment of the House of
Representatives, the "Jakarta Post" daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Students in big cities have staged demonstrations since
February this year, blaming the government for the economic crisis
and demanding political reforms.
</P>
<P>
In some cities, students held hunger strikes and clashed with
police.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto reiterated his earlier warning that rectors should not
allow student politics on campus, but said students or lecturers
were free to engage in political activities outside campuses and
in their private capacity.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the ban on conducting practical politics on campuses is
positively responded to in this development era ...," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some cabinet ministers have held dialogues with the
representatives of students, but the latter asked for meeting with
President Soeharto directly.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Harmoko said earlier that President Soeharto
would hold talks with students some time in the future as long as
it is necessary for national development.

<HEADLINE> Majority in UK, Ireland Back N.Irish Accord: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- About three quarters of voters on
both sides of the Irish border would say "yes" to the historic
Northern Ireland peace accord in next month's referendum, an
opinion poll showed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The joint Guardian-Irish Times opinion poll showed a
surprisingly strong majority support for the peace agreement
struck last Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Northern Ireland, 73 percent would vote for the accord,
while in the rest of Britain, 81 percent would back the peace
deal. In the Republic of Ireland, 61 percent of voters would show
their favor if they were asked to vote.
</P>
<P>
The accord, which maintains Northern Ireland's links with
Britain but also builds cross-border bridges with the Irish
republic, is being put to referendums north and south of the
border on May 22.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, support for the agreement is
particularly strong among the supporters of Sinn Fein and the
Ulster Unionist Party, the two major feuding parties in the
province. Four-fifths of Sinn Fein supporters backed the accord
and only seven percent were against.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, welcomed
the poll and forecast that his party council would overwhelmingly
back him at a crucial weekend meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is the best deal available -- warts and all," he told BBC
Radio. "We have stuck to the course."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Uganda Sign Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Uganda signed
here Thursday a trade agreement to provide a conducive framework
for the two countries to enhance trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the agreement is to expand and deepen
trade, economic and industrial cooperation between Malaysia and
Uganda, an official press release said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by Malaysian International Trade and
Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz and Ugandan Minister of State for
Planning and Economic Development, the two sides will grant each
other the most-favored nation status in matters relating to custom
duties and foreign trade formalities in import and export.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will facilitate each others' participation in
trade fairs and exhibitions which include exemptions from custom
duties and other charges for samples intended for exhibitions and
fairs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for the establishment of a joint
trade committee to discuss measures to enhance two-day trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, bilateral trade between Malaysia and Uganda totaled
17.5 million ringgit (4.729 million U.S. dollars) and for the
period of January to February this year, trade between the two
countries amounted to 0.39 million ringgit (0.105 million
dollars), according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's main export items to Uganda were radio-broadcast
receivers, garments, furniture and parts, footwear and printed
matter while its main import items from Uganda were cotton and
fresh, chilled or frozen fish.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed after talks between visiting Ugandan
President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni and Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohammad who witnessed the signing.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president arrived here Wednesday for a four-day
state visit to Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> PC Chip Market Growth to Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide sales of the most
widely-used primary chips in personal computers will rise only by
16 percent, according to a U.S. market research firm Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest Corp. based in San Jose, California, said that
slowdown of x86 microprocessor sales reflects collapsing
prices. Chip sales rose by 24 percent in 1997 from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The drop is primarily because of lower average selling prices
of microprocessors, Dataquest said. The price of an average PC has
dropped from 2,000 dollars to about 1,000 dollars, forcing
chipmakers to cut their prices, said the company.
</P>
<P>
In February, Dataquest cut its forecast of worldwide
semiconductor market to 160 billion dollars in 1998, saying that a
continuing overcapacity would force manufacturers to keep price
low.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the world's computers use the chips of
x86. Intel is the inventor of the standard and is the biggest
producer. But now its rivals sell x86 chips for much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest said that most of the worldwide microprocessor
revenue growth in 1998 would come from sales of chips for high-end
desktop machines, known as workstations, or for servers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has lost 53
plant species to extinction, an alarming rate to the country
which is renowned for its rich and unique flora, a senior
environment conservationist has warned.
</P>
<P>
Ian MacDonald, chief executive of the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF) South Africa, said "the sense of pride South Africans have
in this fact is dampened by our inability to manage bio-diversity
successfully."
</P>
<P>
"The loss and potential loss of plant diversity as indicated
in the red list should be a primary concerns for all South
Africans," MacDonal said at the launch of the 1997 World
Conservation Union red list of threatened plants.
</P>
<P>
The list, the result of 20 years work by scientists,
conservation organizations, botanical gardens and museums,
reports that at least one in every plant species world wide is at
risk of extinction.
</P>
<P>
The red list reveals that 12.5 percent (about 34,000) of the
world's plant species are threatened.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, claimed to be the most thoroughly studied
country on the African continent, 11 percent of the nation's
20,000 plant species are at risk.
</P>
<P>
WWF South African officials have expressed commitment to
rectifying this sorry state of affairs and was working with
numerous other organizations in the battle to save flower and
plant species.

on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) lost 28.79 points to close at 1,515.15 points on

<HEADLINE> Divorce Easier in S. Africa as New Law Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Divorce in South Africa is
easier as the Divorce Court Amendment Act comes into force, the
Justice Department said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The act adopted in 1997 has been put into effect from April 6,
1998, the department said.
</P>
<P>
"This act makes divorce courts, which were previously only
accessible to a particular population group, now open to all
population groups throughout the republic."
</P>
<P>
"Any person now has the choice to either approach the high
court or the divorce courts in order to obtain a divorce," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
No legal representation is required at divorce courts and it
is hoped that this would make divorce procedures uncomplicated
and affordable.
</P>
<P>
Through the commencement of the act, the laws relating to
divorce are now uniform throughout the country, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, divorce laws differed in the former self-governing
states.

<HEADLINE> China To Improve Medical Aid to Foreign Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China will establish hospitals,
pharmaceutical factories and service centers in a number of
foreign countries and regions as part of its medical aid to them.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of doing so is to promote bilateral cooperation
between China and the recipient countries, Chinese minister of
Health Zhang Wenkang said here today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will not only send medical teams to foreign
countries but also jointly run hospitals and pharmaceutical
factories abroad in order to promote the export of medical
facilities, pharmaceuticals, medical materials, and traditional
Chinese medicine and technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said medical aid should become an important channel for
Chinese companies entering foreign markets and boosting
multi-level, wide-ranging and mutually beneficial economic and
trade cooperation with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Since China sent its first medical team to Algeria in April of
1963, more than 16,000 doctors and other medical workers have been
assigned to over 60 countries and regions in Asia, Africa, Latin
America and Europe, offering treatment to 220 million foreign
patients and training some 2,000 local doctors and medical
personnel, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister made the remarks at a meeting, which was
held in the Great Hall of the People here today to mark the 35th
anniversary of China's first overseas medical team. At the
meeting, some medical units and doctors were honored for their
outstanding contributions in the field.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Defense Minister Ends Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Defense Minister
Arthur Eggleton ended his official visit to Kuwait Thursday, during
which he held talks with senior Kuwaiti officials on Kuwaiti
procurement of Canadian arms.
</P>
<P>
"We have talked about the Kuwaiti government procurement and
what the Canadian defense industry has to offer," Eggleton told
reporters Wednesday on board the Canadian frigate HMCS Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The patrol frigate carrying 239 sailors on board, is currently
on mission in the Gulf and docked at Kuwait's Shuwaikh port last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton said the response of the Kuwaiti government to the
talks is "very positive," but adding that no agreement has been
materialized so far.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Canada would be able to sell some of
its military products to Kuwait. Canada has been trying to sell
Kuwait warships and military trucks.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton, who arrived in Kuwait Monday, held talks with Kuwaiti
officials on Canadian commitment to maintaining peace and
stability in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Gaza to continue his Middle East tour,
Eggleton reasserted Canada's support for peace and stability in
the region and for the integrity of Kuwaiti borders.
</P>
<P>
He also held talks with Kuwaiti leaders on holding joint
military maneuvers within the framework of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight airmen of the 435 Air Squadron of Winnipeg, have
been in Kuwait since early March. The Canadian forces were part of
Ottawa's contribution to the multinational forces that rushed to
the Gulf earlier this year to ensure Iraq's compliance with an
agreement it signed with U.N. over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton said the deployment of more Canadian troops to the
region depends on Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions, adding
that withdrawal of current troops from the region is possible.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Control on Liquor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to crack down even
further on fake alcoholic products to protect famous brands in the
next few years, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Zhu Mingxian,
deputy-director of the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision, called on the technical supervision departments at
all levels to inspect all the liquor manufacturers and tighten its
management over production certificates.
</P>
<P>
Those firms producing substandard liquors should halt
production and make restitution, and those that do not have
production certificates should be dealt with in line with the law,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said liquor market inspections should focus on the
elimination of shoddy and unqualified products, while paying
attention to the protection and publicity of name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, the bureau will choose a group of
liquor products and test samples of famous brands from 30 major
Chinese cities each year to guarantee their quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the Spring Festival period, several kinds of liquors
spiked with methanol caused 19 deaths in Shuozhou City of north
China's Shanxi Province. The Shanxi Xinhuacun Group Company,
which produces two famous brands of spirits, had its sales volume
drop sharply because it was located beside one of the fake spirits
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The two famous brands, Fen Yew and Zhu Ye Qing, are up to the
state standards in terms of quality.

</P>
<P>
ICBC plans to increase its yearly loan portfolio by 200 billion
yuan this year, of which 75 billion yuan will be extended in the

<P>
To that end, the bank has to attract an additional 250 billion

<HEADLINE> Aid Workers Kidnaped in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Kenya pilot was among nine
International Red Cross workers kidnaped by gunmen in Mogadishu
Wednesday after they landed at an airstrip north of the Somali
capital, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen arrived aboard four "technicals" -- pick-up trucks
with heavy weapons mounted -- and fired in the air to scare off
the lightly armed airstrip guards, witnesses were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The airport guards did not attempt to intervene and ran off to
hide in tea kiosks, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen also kidnaped a Somali working for the local Red
Crescent Society.
</P>
<P>
It was said the kidnappers were members of the Da'ud subclan
of the Abgal, loyal to north Mogadishu strongman Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen took the expatriates and the Somali -- who were
unhurt -- to the Karan district in the north of the divided
capital, said the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
They were seen there in a high-walled compound belonging to a
feared militia commander, Ahmed Adley, said the press reports.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping was confirmed in Nairobi by Josue Anselmo,
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC).
</P>
<P>
He said the aid workers flew to Mogadishu to carry out various
evaluation missions in the anarchic nation which has been hard
hit by months of torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best to sort out the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been ruled by competing warlords since the
overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the expatriates work for the ICRC, including two
pilots, and two for the International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies, said Anselmo.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Kenyan, the other victims were an American, a
South African, a German, a Belgian, A French, two Swiss and a
Norwegian.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi is himself in Nairobi, where earlier this week he
reached an agreement with three other Mogadishu leaders to reopen
the main port and international airport by the end of his month.
He said he did not know about the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened. But if it's true, they will be
released immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers made no immediate demands.

<HEADLINE> Mobil Establishes Environmental Education Fund in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Mobil Oil Company today
donated 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) to China's
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) to set up a
fund to support the country's environmental education plans.
</P>
<P>
The Mobil China Environmental Education Fund will be used to
aid a series of programs on environmental protection publicity and
education in a five-year period starting in 1998, especially
China's key programs in the field.
</P>
<P>
The first project supported by the fund is the Mayors' Seminar
on the Protection of Taihu, Chaohu and Dianchi lakes, which has
already started.
</P>
<P>
SEPA's Deputy-Director Zhu Guangyao said at today's inaugural
ceremony that environmental protection work is facing growing
challenges as a result of increasing global deterioration and
limited funds.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that we bring environmental protection onto
the agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called on more domestic and international companies to
participate in environmental protection activities in China.
</P>
<P>
Lucille Cavanaugh, chairwoman of Mobil Asia Pacific Private
Co. Ltd., said that the fund is Mobil's inaugural step in ensuring
that China will be renowned as an environmentally sound and secure
country, adding that Mobil will "spare no efforts in supporting
China's modernization and environmental protection requirements
now and in the future."
</P>
<P>
Mobil, a global energy company, has more than 20 offices in
China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan. Its
business in China can be traced back to 1894 when it set up its
first representative office in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Accused of Planning to Destabilize S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military Thursday
accused Liberia of planning to destabilize neighboring Sierra
Leone where order is being restored after the fall of the
coupists and reinstatement of the legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
There are enough proofs to show that the government of
President Charles Taylor wanted the situation in Sierra Leone to
be unstable, Col. Godwin Ugbo, acting Director of Defense
Information, told Xinhua over the phone.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official allegation from the Nigerian
military that brings to open the rift between Taylor and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to the defense spokesman, the Liberian government is
training 3,000 of its soldiers in Libya to fight the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) along the border between Sierra Leone
and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"This is based on security reports available to ECOMOG high
command," he said, adding that the soldiers being trained are
expected to soon become part of Sierra Leone's rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and junta forces to fight ECOMOG
at the border areas.
</P>
<P>
"It has been established that Taylor is aiding and abetting
the RUF in Sierra Leone because he does not want stability in
Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
"This is wrong but he wants instability in Sierra Leone so
that Liberia, his own country, will be stable," the spokesman
claimed.
</P>
<P>
It has long been reported that Taylor does not like Nigeria
especially after his overwhelming victory towards Liberia's top
seat was checked by the Nigerian-led ECOMOG in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG arrived in Liberia at the invitation of the then
President Samuel Doe in 1990 when Taylor launched an offensive
against the Doe administration, triggering off the seven-year
bloody civil war.

<HEADLINE> Iran's to Promote Non-oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has decided
to promote non-oil exports in order to reduce the impacts of the
reduction of oil revenue on the country's economy, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet ministers discussed ways to encourage non-oil
exports on Wednesday afternoon and decided to seriously follow
specific policies to minimize the damage of the sharp fall in oil
incomes on the economy.
</P>
<P>
They discussed a report by the Plan and Budget Organization
(PBO) on the impact of shrinking oil revenues on the country's
economy, but stressing that although a drop in oil prices will
reduce the government's revenues in the new Iranian year (started
on March 21), it is a "blessing in disguise" for the government
since it will be compelled to move toward an oil-free economy.
</P>
<P>
The government will formulate and implement plans to promote
non-oil exports and remove obstacles hindering exports, improve
quality and quantity of products, increase output and
competitiveness of Iranian products at international markets, the
IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Despite desperate efforts to promote the status of non-oil
exports, Iran's customs announced recently that the exports had
fallen by 3.1 percent to 3 billion U.S. dollars during the past
Iranian year, much less than the figure of 5.5 billion dollars
projected in the second five year development plan (1995-2000).
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts said that the instability of policies
and complicated procedures were the main hurdles for the country
to promote non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
In order to save its limited foreign capitals, the government
raised the rate of foreign exchanges sold to Iranian travelers
from 3,000 rials to 4,800 rials against the dollar in order to
prevent any unnecessary trips.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA said that the cabinet also decided to take measures
to eliminate hindrances and restrictions on way of investment, to
protect the vulnerable masses through subsidies, control and
reduce current government expenditures and give priority to
implementation of development projects.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sees Reduction in Election-Related Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine National Police
Director General Santiago Alino Thursday said there would be a 50
percent reduction in election-related violence in the coming May
11 elections compared to previous polls.
</P>
<P>
Alino made the remark on account of comparative studies made by
the police which said there was one election-related violence
every two days in the 1995 congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 polls, there was a total of 121 violence cases, of
which 65 percent took place before the elections and the rest
happened on the election day.
</P>
<P>
Alino attributed the expected decrease in violence cases this
year to the early deployment of police forces in expected poll hot
spots nationwide and the strict implementation of the campaign
against loose firearms and private armed groups.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that insurgency groups pose the biggest threat
to the coming elections. However, the National People's Army (NPA)
had announced ceasefire with government troops while the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front was engaged in talks with government
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
According to Alino, the most recent incident was the burning of
a candidate's vehicle by NPA rebels when the candidate refused to
pay 120,000 pesos (3,157 U.S. dollars) as taxes to the rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992 presidential elections, more than 100 people
were killed in the outbreak of violence.

<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine National Police Chief
Director General Santiago Alino said here on Thursday that the
police had confiscated 847 firearms nationwide since the
imposition of the gun ban.
</P>
<P>
Alino said he expect more weapons to be confiscated since he
had directed a stepped-up campaign against violators of the
election gun ban.
</P>
<P>
He warned violators that once caught, they will be charged with
illegal possession of firearms and violation of the Commission on
Elections prohibition.
</P>
<P>
Alino challenged the public to report to the police immediately
the presence of armed groups in their communities and those
keeping loose firearms.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Commission on Elections imposed the gun ban last
January to ensure the coming May 11 elections to be held
peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of S. African Crash Rises to 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of a horror
crash near Newcastle in South Africa's Kwazulu-Natal province has
risen to 31 Thursday, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The dead included 23 school children. Over 50 other people
were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred shortly after 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) and five
vehicles were involved. Four of the vehicles, including a school
bus and a horse and trailer, fell into a 50-meter embankment.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal transport spokesman Ranjeni Munusamy said four
children and one adult had died overnight, bringing the number of
deaths to 31.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen people, including 15 children, were killed at the
scene Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle police spokesman Godfrey Nyembe, who visited the
scene of the accident, said many of the people had been seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot put into words what a terrible, terrible accident
this was. There were young people crying for help, young children
crying for help, young children with gaping wounds.
</P>
<P>
"It was complete chaos. I have never seen anything as
terrible," Nyembe said.
</P>
<P>
A minibus, which was also involved in the accident, remained
on the road.
</P>
<P>
An investigative team flew to the scene to determine the cause
of the accident. Munusamy said bad weather was thought to be one
of the possible causes.
</P>
<P>
He said Kwazulu-Natal chief official for transport, Sibusiso
Ndebele, would fly to Newcastle Thursday morning to visit the
scene of the accident, and discuss with Newcastle mayor the
possibility of setting up a special fund to assist the victims

<HEADLINE> Released Mayor Announces No Changes in Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The released Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi has announced that he has not changed his
opinion on the city's administration after an 11-day imprisonment,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I am of the same opinion that I have held during my services
as the mayor of Tehran and you can see that my outlooks have not
changed," Karbaschi was quoted by IRNA as saying on Wednesday
after he was released on bail from the prison upon an order from
the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The mayor was detained on April 4 by the hard-line judiciary on
charges of embezzlement, misuse of public fund and mismanagement,
triggering a new round of factional fighting between the
hardliners and the moderates.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi once again rejected the charges against him, saying
that no form of embezzlement or misuse of public funds have taken
place. However, he noted that there is a possibility of a flaw
when one takes responsibility and makes decisions on the planning
for the city.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that there might be better ways to settle
the issues, expressing the hope that these problems would be
thoroughly scrutinized with the show of patience and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his release, Karbaschi said that he was informed
ten minutes before his release that he was going to be set free
from the jail.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the people who showed warm welcome to him in front
of his house and shouted slogans in support of him.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the district court of
Tehran, IRNA said, Karbaschi was released on bail at the request
of President Mohammad Khatami, who enjoyed strong support from the
Tehran mayor during the presidential elections in last May.
</P>
<P>
After agreeing with the president's request, Khamenei issued a
decree to the judiciary head Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi asking him
to free the detained mayor "on basis of surety for the bail."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also instructed the judicial body to pursue the case
"in an atmosphere free from any tension and according to the laws
governing the nation."
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani
had launched "extensive efforts" to free Karbaschi after his
detention and convinced Khamenei to agree with the mayors release
in order to prevent further tension between the two rival
factions.

<HEADLINE> New Owner Spends Big Money in Zambia's Copper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Roan Antelope Mining Corporation
of Zambia has invested an additional 69 million U.S. Dollars to
refurbish the mine plant and buy new equipment for Luanshya
Copper Mine in Zambia's Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it has already spent 105 million dollars in various
new mining projects in the mine.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Thursday quoted the corporation's General
Manager Sam Phiri as saying in Luanshya that the corporation is
working to turn the whole mine around by improving operations and
work on new projects has begun with the extension of the mine
below 2,800 feet level.
</P>
<P>
The newly privatized mine has formulated the new projects to
resuscitate the mine through the construction of an open pit
mine, where experts are already conducting feasibility studies,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Phiri said the corporation has already committed 20 million
dollars for the refurbishment of the plant and machinery and
another 26 million dollars will be spent within the next 18
months for capital replenishment.
</P>
<P>
He said three million dollars has been committed for the
feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
With the new projects and huge investment in place, the
current output of 45,000 tons of finished copper will be
increased to 65,000 in the next two and half years and to 100,000
tons by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The corporation is also contributing to the community
rehabilitation in Luanshya with a pledge of five million dollars
a year for the health, schools, sewer services and garbage
collection.
</P>
<P>
Due to copper price falls in the international market and
outdated equipment, lack of investment and mismanagement, annual
copper output of the country, one of the biggest copper-producing
countries in the world, has decreased gradually to about 300,000
tons in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investments, advanced technology and
management to revive the stagnating copper production, the
government has invited foreign tenders for the mines and assets.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ethiopian Govt Helps Youth in Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government has
paid much attention to the unemployment and other problems facing
youth and has taken measures to help young people support
themselves.
</P>
<P>
As one of the least developed countries, Ethiopia, with a big
population of over 58 million only after Nigeria and Egypt in
Africa, certainly faces the problems of youth unemployment and
absence of sufficient job opportunities for school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report of the Ethiopian Herald, a large
number of school dropouts and those who have completed high
school education but with no opportunity to go to higher learning
institutes, could not remain dependent on their parents or
guardians with meager income. However, a considerable number of
them spend almost half of their life-time in such a state.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the youths, particularly those from low income
families often become hopeless and juvenile delinquents.
</P>
<P>
Surveys have indicated that during the past decade, 75 percent
of the young population in urban areas have remained unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government and pertinent departments have paid
more attention to the young people's unemployment problem, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
They not only train jobless youngsters in technologies for job
opportunities, but also provide government institutes and private
enterprises with staffs and workers with professional skills.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, they educate youths by positive measures including
providing them with study materials, recreational facilities and
other leisure time activities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they encourage parents to regularly advise
their children and teach them good manners.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, strong relationship is encouraged between and among
parents, schools, society and the youths themselves in order that
the latter can be well-nurtured so as to develop an all-round
personality.
</P>
<P>
In order to address the multifaced problems of the youth, the
government departments have already forwarded proposals to
initiate the adoption of national youth policy, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Once such policy comes into effect, it will be possible to
devise different strategies and action-oriented programs directed
towards alleviating youth-related problems and empower them to be
actively engaged in the national development activities.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Ethiopian government has implemented a
vocational training policy to open up job opportunities to many
youths.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide effort is going on for forming youth associations
and students councils so that the youth and students can be
organized.
</P>
<P>
The vocational training courses run by various government and
non-governmental organizations in Ethiopia have proved
successful.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 youth in northern Tigray region have become
self-supportive after receiving various vocational trainings run
by the Tigray youth association in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen jobless high school girl graduates have completed a
three-month fast training course and received certificates in
Addis Ababa recently, according to a report of the Ethiopian
Herald.
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, jobless youth in Ethiopia's northern
Amhara region have been trained to become self-supportive. Some
1,052 youth have been trained in carpentry, masonry and other
trades in three training centers of the region since 1994, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the trained young people are now employed by
government and private organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trained youths have also organized themselves
by setting up their own joint ventures and small enterprises.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expert Explains Tax System on Internet Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States opposed new
taxes on the Internet but would consider levying Internet shoppers
to ensure existing sales tax revenue was not lost in the shift to
cyberspace shopping, an adviser to U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Australia's first summit on electronic commerce
attended by about 350 Australian government ministers, business
and research leaders, Ira Magaziner, senior policy adviser to
President Clinton, said that any new approach would have to be tax
neutral, signaling it was looking to shift the onus for tax
collection on to the shopper.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to any new or discriminatory taxation on
Internet or on electronic commerce," Magaziner told the two-day
meeting, which began on Thursday, organized by Australian National
Office for the Information Economy and Australia's
telecommunications giant Telstra company.
</P>
<P>
"What we want is a uniform, simple automatic approach based
upon principles of tax neutrality, and no discriminatory taxation.
So we are not proposing any new tax of any sort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized nations were discussing ways to take existing
value-added tax and sales tax and apply it to Internet
transactions in a neutral way, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are favoring legislation in the United States which would
create a moratorium on the application of any new taxes on
Internet commerce," Magaziner said.
</P>
<P>
"And then the creation of a commission among the states and
cities and counties in order to develop a uniform approach to the
collection of taxation."
</P>
<P>
Magaziner has completed a document recently outlining the U.S.
government's strategy for promoting the development of global
electronic commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was keen to develop the approach over the next few
years, with a new way of collecting taxes but not a new tax, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that as the Internet takes off, electronic commerce
takes off, more companies will do more business, they'll make more
money and we automatically get our share," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for us to do is do nothing, just to let it go,"
he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Judge Stresses Judicial Fairness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The President of the Supreme
People's Court Xiao Yang has told a national meeting on judicial
work that China needs a contingent of superior judges to ensure
judicial fairness and safeguard the sanctity of the law.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the judiciary need to put themselves under
supervision by the press and that they should discipline
themselves and protect the rights of the people by implementing
the law and being fair in their verdicts.
</P>
<P>
They need to win the trust and support of the people, he said,
and there should be a check on their conduct. To do that, the
court personnel system should be reformed, Xiao says, and a system
of judicial supervision introduced, and the relations between
judges and prosecutors, defendants and lawyers should be clearly
defined.
</P>
<P>
Courts should invite people's congress deputies and members of
Chinese people's political consultative conferences to hear cases
and participate in judicial work.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court and courts at various levels should
set up offices or even open special telephone lines for people to
report judicial misconduct, Xiao says, and with the exception of
cases involving national security, privacy, or juvenile
delinquency, every case should be handled openly and be covered by
the news media.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Top 30 Conglomerates to Sell 200 Subsidiaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's top 30 conglomerates,
or chaebols, are working to sell some 200 affiliated companies,
said the Federation of of Korean Industries (FKI) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerates have been trying to sell those businesses
since the current financial crisis occurred late last year, said
Sohn Byung-doo, Deputy Chairman of the FKI.
</P>
<P>
FKI is the interest group representing leading family-owned
chaebols of the nation, which has been in a serious financial
crisis caused by a slew of corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to President Kim Dae-jung's open
criticism against the top conglomerates' slowness in reforms, Sohn
said the chaebols have no choice but to restructure to survive the
IMF period.
</P>
<P>
"Trading 200 businesses is a big job and has to be done with
great discretion," said Sohn.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Monday said he was not satisfied with the "pace
and great discretion," Sohn added.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the government, the top 30
chaebols have to take serious self-reform steps, including the
sell-off of real estate and ailing subsidiary companies, to raise
funds.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair will visit Saudi Arabia Saturday as part of his Mideast
tour aimed at trying to find means of reinvigorating the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, Blair will hold talks with
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and other government officials on
how to push the Mideast peace process forward, Diplomatic sources
in Saudi Arabia was quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The European states, in particular France and Britain which
currently chairs the European Union, are deeply worried about the
freezing of the Middle East peace process and have called on
Israel time and again to abide by the agreements it signed with
the Palestinians, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
But they said that Blair would not present to Saudi Arabia or
other parties a package of British or European ideas aimed at
ending the stalemate in the peace process during his trip.
</P>
<P>
However, while not spelling out any peace initiatives, Blair
would "attempt to find a better atmosphere for resuming the talks
between the Palestinians and Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has been stalled for over a year due
to Israeli intransigent policies.
</P>
<P>
Blair's Mideast trip will also include Egypt, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Increasing Cooperation With Chinese Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The US Boeing has said it will
enter the Chinese market further by training Chinese pilots and
maintenance workers and selling more planes to the country, a
Boeing official has said.
</P>
<P>
Boeing will invest more in training Chinese for the 21st
century, and this year, more than 13 million yuan has been set
aside to train more than 40 Chinese managers in Seattle's Boeing
Institute, said Jiande Chen, a Boeing official in charge of China
affairs, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has, so far, invested several hundred million US dollars
in helping develop infrastructure, with emphasis laid on further
improving safety, increasing capacity, and management skills. In
addition, 6,000 Chinese have attended professional courses,
technical seminars, and other activities in the US and China.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has 288 of its airliners operating in China, accounting
for 70 percent of the nation's civil aircraft, with 142
Boeing-737s, the most popular airliner in the world, operating
with 24 of the country's 34 air carriers.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid growth of China's civil aviation, it is expected
to need about 1,900 jetliners over the next 20 years, about 140
billion US dollars worth of planes. With that bright a future,
they expect good gains, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China and Boeing started cooperating 26 years ago, when China
first ordered ten Boeing-707s.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Output Rises in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's sugar production
recorded a slight improvement last year with 401,000 tons
compared to 389,000 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A report compiled by the U.S. embassy attributes the
improvement to better management of factories, enhanced
processing efficiency and the ability of sugar companies to move
stocks that rose in 1996 to the market, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report projects production for this year will be 410,000
tons and consumption, 484,000 tons, including 27,000 tons to be
exported to the region.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the newly-installed equipment at Mumias
Sugar Company contributed to increased production but also points
out that the new diffuser technology does not cope well
over-mature cane carried over from other seasons.
</P>
<P>
Constraints hindering expansion of area under the crop include
high production costs, limited suitable land and delayed harvests
which tend to discourage farmers from growing cane.
</P>
<P>
The industry still faces many problems especially low
processing efficiency due to old machinery, poor maintenance and
management, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Low processing efficiency, capacity and decaying transport
infrastructure have led to delayed harvesting in almost every
zone of production," it says.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's trade with Britain is on
the increase and the east African country is now the second
highest exporter of goods to Britain from sub-Saharan Africa, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two countries rose by 2.3 percent in

The figures confirm the recent trend of British exports to
Kenya falling while those from Kenya have been rising.
</P>
<P>
Only South Africa now sells more goods to the Britain from
Africa than Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The main exports by Kenya are tea, coffee and horticultural

<HEADLINE> Beijing Turned into "Mud City" By Spring Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Early-rising Beijingers today
found a city coated with a thin layer of mud -- roads, houses,
tree leaves, bikes and cars.
</P>
<P>
The thunderstorm that awakened many residents around midnight,
however, was the usual springtime phenomenon. And the rain lasted
less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
"It counts merely as a light one at most, with a rainfall of
only two or three millimeters," said Ding Deping, an expert with
the Beijing Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said a strong breeze from northern Inner Mongolia and the
Loess Highlands made a surprise attack on Beijing last night,
blowing up dust from the loose soil.
</P>
<P>
The rain was enough to coat the dust and was not strong enough
to wash it away, leaving mud stains on the face of the city, Ding
said.
</P>
<P>
Those most seriously affected by the "muddy rain" were the
city's drivers, whose vehicles all were dotted with yellowish
stains today. Washing cars became a hot business in the city.
</P>
<P>
A car-washing shop near the China Art Gallery put out a
handwritten sign saying "quick mud-washing" early this morning. Its
employees were busy waiving rags at drivers to woo business.
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents say dusty weather used to often plague
Beijing in early Spring, but massive planting of trees and grass
in recent years has reduced the dust problem.
</P>

Ding said construction sites were another cause of the dust and
sand floating in the air.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters at the Beijing Meteorological Station predict more
dusty weather because of strong winds. When the mud dropped on
the ground dries, it once again is picked up by the wind to float
in the air.

PHNOM PENH -- Chea Mun, commander of the Cambodian Army's
Fourth Military Zone, told Xinhua Thursday that he cannot confirm
reports that former Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot is dead.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I have learned, Da Mok, current head of the Khmer
Rouge, took Pol Pot to Thailand a few days ago when they were
retreating from their Anlong Veng stronghold," said the Cambodian
commander, who is in charge of the military operations against
Anlong Veng. "As the situation along the Cambodian-Thai border is
still complicated, it is very difficult to get accurate
information about Pol Pot and Da Mok for the time being," Chea Mun
said.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Nearly Makes No Profit in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Compaq, the world's biggest
personal computer maker, reported Wednesday that flat computer
sales nearly wiped out its entire profit for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The company said it earned 16 million U.S. dollars, or just one
cent a share during the quarter, compared with 414 million
dollars, or 27 cents per share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
First quarter sales for Compaq totaled 5.7 billion dollars, an
8 percent increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the narrow profit margin to the "price
war". Compaq said it had cut prices of its business desktops more
steeply than expected due to intense competition for corporate
customers.
</P>
<P>
Another factor, said Compaq's President and Chief Executive
Officer Eckhard Pfeiffer, is that sales from North American
commercial channels were not meeting expectations.
</P>
<P>
Compaq is the fifth largest computer company in the world and
the biggest supplier of personal computers, with worldwide sales
of 24.6 billion dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> New Technique Makes Use of Subterranean Warm Water in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
a new technique for using subterranean hot water resources in the
city of Tianjin, the biggest port in northern China.
</P>
<P>
An 8,700-sq-km underground pool with more than 220 billion
cubic meters of hot water was found in Tianjin, the largest region
of mid- to low-temperature geothermal resources in China. The
water lies from 60 to 3,000 meters deep, has a high mineral
content, moderate temperature, and is suitable for daily use.
</P>
<P>
The technique employs double wells, one for pumping up hot
water, the other for replacing it to prevent surface subsidence
and pollution. They were drilled in an urban area, the pumping
well at 1,494 meters and the replenishing well at 1,590 meters. As
many as 112 cubic meters of hot water are pumped from the first
well every hour and 152 cubic meters pumped into the other.
</P>
<P>
The city has drilled 300 wells and gets 30 million cubic meters
of hot water annually. Three surface geothermal pools alone
provide enough water for central heating for 3 million sq.m. of
residential housing.
</P>
<P>
This has allowed the Tanggu District to shut down 581 boilers
and 500 chimneys, and at least 100,000 people are benefiting from
the geothermal energy.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has branched out in its use of geothermal energy, from
central heating and industrial use to greenhouses, aquatic
products, therapeutic uses, mineral water, and scientific
research.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy Gloomy: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
painted a gloomy picture of the country's economy as it struggles
to find a medium and long-term solution to economic and social
problems.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae said Wednesday that
Kenya's economy has slowed down significantly partly as a result
of fiscal imbalances which the government has experienced over
the years, the East African Standard reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The current slowdown in the economy, the high interest rates
that discouraged investments in the real sector, the large volume
of short term government debt and the dilapidated infrastructure
are big challenges to the east African state, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The current large stock of 91-day Treasury bills, which
necessitated a roll-over every week, make it difficult to reduce
interest rates from the current high levels. The situation has
been exacerbated by the decline in external receipts," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
At the current yields on Treasury bills, the government would
pay 31 billion Shillings (521 million U.S. Dollars) of its
ordinary revenue on domestic debt interest payments in the
1997/98 fiscal year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, budget for operations and maintenance will
continue to decline thereby inhibiting delivery of public
services. In short, public servants continue to be paid but are
not provided with the tools to render services which the public
expects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the total wage bill should be reduced as a
proportion of both government revenue and the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for Kenyans to understand its implications on
both the quality and quantity of public services together with
its impact on the economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Talks Re-open Without Tangible Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators for North and South
Korea adjourned again here this morning after a two-hour
closed-door session which showed no sign of tangible results
following Wednesday's break.
</P>
<P>
"We had a serious meeting today," said Chun Kum Chul, head of
the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), but he declined to comment on any progress.
</P>
<P>
"The time for the next round of talks will be considered and
fixed after further contacts," Chun said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the delegation of the Republic of Korea (ROK) has not
made any comment on the morning session. But they are scheduled to
leave Beijing on Saturday, one source said.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say it is still too early to say what would
really come out of further talks.
</P>
<P>
This working-level morning session opened at 10:05 and ended at
12:05, with the head delegate and one member from each side in
attendance at a local hotel where talks started last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK delegate was quoted as saying his delegation would not
be leaving even when the talks conclude. The DPRK insists that the
fertilizer aid issue should be tackled first, a source said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, both sides agreed to stay for another two days
after the unsuccessful third round of full meetings, which failed
to reach agreement on terms for the ROK's supply of fertilizer aid
to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Both sides stayed in contact Thursday, waiting for the other
side to take the first step to re-start the talks. But concessions
failed to come from either side.
</P>
<P>
These are the first direct talks between the two governments in
four years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Councillor Confers with Thai Deputy Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Wu Yi
reiterated today that China will not seek entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) if it has to sacrifice its own
fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark this morning in talks with Supachai
Panitchpakdi, deputy prime minister and minister of Commerce of
Thailand who is here as Wu's guest.
</P>
<P>
Supachai briefed Wu on Thailand's domestic economic situation,
hoping to further bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various
fields, including trade.
</P>
<P>
He said that Thailand actively supports China's early entry
into the WTO, for which Wu expressed her appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Wu told Supachai that China, as a responsible member of the
international community, will spare no effort to help Southeast
Asian nations which have suffered from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that Chinese government has taken part in the
package financial assistance program sponsored by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is unprecedented for
China to participate in such a program under an international and
regional framework.
</P>
<P>
Among IMF's total 17.2 billion U.S. dollars in assistance,
Chinese offer is second only to that of the United States and
Japan, and higher than any other western countries, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She said the Chinese government has already provided the Thai
government with one billion U.S. dollars in loans, and that
Thailand is the only country receiving such bilateral assistance
from China since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that China has made a commitment not to devalue its
currency -- Renminbi -- and supports the stability of the Hong
Kong dollar, and it will continue to do so unswervingly even if
China suffers a lot.
</P>
<P>
Expressing a deep sympathy with Southeast Asian nations,
including Thailand, and an admiration for the Thai people's
efforts to overcome their difficulties, Wu said that China, as a
friendly neighbor of Thailand, all along has been concerned about
Thailand's difficulties and will exert substantial efforts to help
Thailand out of its difficulties at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also exchanged opinions on further strengthening
bilateral economic and trade cooperation under the current
conditions.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Doje Cering, the reappointed
Minister of Civil Affairs, expressed his intention to share more
worries with the Central Government and provide better services to
the people.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry will continue to play an active role in
state affairs, though parts of its duty -- such as old-age
insurance in rural areas -- have been shifted to the newly
established Ministry of Labor and Social Security, he said in an
interview with today's Guangming Daily, a Beijing-based national
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the importance of the work of civil affairs,
the 59-year-old minister said that "we serve people on their way
from the cradle to the grave."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the management of non-state organizations
and issues related to marriage and adoption should be
strengthened in their future work while continuing reforms in
funerals.
</P>
<P>
More efforts will be directed to expanding village elections
and the work concerning democratic elections, decisions,
management and supervision is expected to be upgraded to a new
level, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to open more channels to help ex-servicemen
and layoffs find jobs, and poverty and disaster relief work will
be emphasized to ensure a better life for senior citizens and the
disabled.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Economic Minister Comments On Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Sheng Huaren, the
newly-appointed State Economic and Trade Commission minister says
he is quite certain that China can reach its goal of 11-percent
growth in industrial production this year, "China Economic Times"
reports today.
</P>
<P>
China should stick to the tasks of the State Council for 1998
in working for an eight-percent increase in economic growth and
that the industrial growth should be 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Based on the first quarter results, Sheng said, industrial
growth rate in the period is likely to be 8.2 percent, lower than
the same period of last year, although this has not been
officially announced.
</P>
<P>
The economist-minister says that 8.2-percent growth is normal
for the first quarter and the growth is expected to reach 11
percent in the second quarter, and stay around 12 percent in the
third and fourth quarters. In this way, the annual goal of
11-percent increase can be reached, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
However, a special effort will be made in four areas:
</P>
<P>
-- State fixed assets investment will be increased to stimulate
consumer spending and the rural market, which is expected to be
much larger than urban market.
</P>
<P>
-- The state should increase exports, especially of light
industry, textile, machinery, electronics, and chemical products
in spite of the adverse effects of the Asian financial crisis in
the latter half of last year.
</P>
<P>
-- Priority will be given to technological improvements and to
product mix to meet domestic and international market needs.
</P>
<P>
-- The State Economic and Trade Commission should cooperate
with finance departments to provide enterprises with good
performance records with adequate funds for expansion of
production and exports.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Governmental Debt Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government's total
domestic debt rose to 149.6 billion Shillings (2.514 billion U.S.
Dollars) at the end of February from 148.9 billion Shillings at
the end of January, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) says.
</P>
<P>
The CBK monthly report for April#,quoted by Thursday's East
African Standard newspaper, said domestic debt represented 23.2
percent of GDP and comprised mainly government securities,
Treasury bills, Treasury bonds and long term stock.
</P>
<P>
Government's total domestic debt stood at 130.8 billion
Shillings at the end of the 1996/97 fiscal year ending in June
1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
Of the outstanding goverrnment securities, Treasury bills
accounted for 119.7 billion Shillings or 72.5 percent of GDP,
down from 121.2 billion Shillings at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector continued to be the biggest holder of
treasury bills, accounting for 44.4 billion Shillings worth.
</P>
<P>
The CBK held 16.2 billion Shillings of which 16 billion
Shillings was acquired through repurchase agreements "for the
purpose of conducting monetary policy" and the remaining 0.2
percent was held in rediscounted bills, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Money supply growth decelerated to a 5.8 percent year-on-year
rise in February 1998 from 9.8 percent in January and compared to
17.4 percent in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown was supported by the decline in net foreign
assets of the banking system as net domestic assets increased.
</P>
<P>
"The monetary contraction was above the expectation with the
February money stock of 293.6 billion Shillings falling below the
295.7 billion Shillings target," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"This is consistent with the objective of monetary policy in
the year to June 1998 which is to limit the growth in money
supply to not more than 8.3 percent in order to achieve low and
stable inflation," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the government collected 111.9 billion Shillings
in revenue from domestic sources in the first eight months of
fiscal year 1997/98 (July/June)#,compared to 94.8 billion
Shillings in the same period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The government received a further 3.5 billion Shillings in
the form of external grants, which was a 1.2 billion Shillings
decline... and 0.8 billion Shillings below target," it said.
</P>
<P>
The government's net borrowing from the Central Bank for the
fiscal year up to February amounted to 12.6 billion Shillings
compared to 4.0 billion Shillings in the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Taking a Closer Look at Reasons for Yellow River's Dryness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Five journalists from China's
Central TV Station and the Economic Daily began a three-month
journey on Wednesday to study the impact of drying up of lower
reaches of the Yellow River, today's "Economic Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held in Beijing yesterday to mark the start of
the expedition. The journalists will travel from the river's
estuary in Shandong Province, in the east, to its source in
Qinghai Province in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, Chen Junsheng, vice-chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee, and Niu Maosheng, Water Resources minister, were
present for the event.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River wanders for 5,464 km across China from its
source in the Bayanhar Mountains in Qinghai and flows east through
nine provinces and autonomous regions, emptying into the sea in
Shandong.
</P>
<P>
The river has been drying up more frequently in certain spots
and for longer periods of time since the first stoppage was
reported in the lower reaches in 1972, and then, in 1997, it
stopped flowing for 272 days.
</P>
<P>
The interrupted flow is largely blamed on insufficient water
at the source, a sharp increase in water consumption, a serious
waste of water in daily use, a lack of management, and pollution.
</P>
<P>
It has also caused serious problems for the country. The lower
reaches in Shandong lost more than 13 billion yuan in business and
3.6 million people had difficulties getting drinking water in
1997, according to local reports.

<HEADLINE> PNG Rebels Boycott Meeting Organized by Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Prominent Bougainville rebel
leaders have boycotted a meeting organized by their political
figurehead Francis Ona in an indication of a widening split in the
leadership of the secessionists in the Bougainville island, Papua
New Guinea (PNG).
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Bougainville chiefs and politicians at Pakia
Village in the island's center entered its second day Thursday
without the presence of two key rebel figures, Joseph Kabui and
military commander Sam Kauona, the Australian Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The gathering is seen as an attempt by Ona to involve himself
in the current peace process on the Pacific island which has been
wrecked by a 10-year war for independence from PNG, the wire
service said.
</P>
<P>
The reclusive Ona has excluded himself from ongoing peace talks
between the warring factions which paved the way for a ceasefire
due to start next month, it said.
</P>
<P>
Kabui, vice-president of the rebel's political arm, issued a
statement overnight saying that prominent rebel leaders wanted to
talk to Ona before the Pakia gathering.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from Ona's office near Pakia said on Thursday that
the meeting was intended as a unifying exercise for
Bougainvillians.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rift, Kabui said that Ona was still the paramount
political leader of the rebels, and that there was no attempt to
exclude him from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ona's intransigency has been a stumbling block to previous
attempts to end the secessionist crisis, with his repeated refusal
to take part in other peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Some observers see the Pakia meeting as a belated attempt by
Ona to shore up his diminishing leadership.
</P>
<P>
Pakia is located near the giant Paguna copper-mine which
triggered the secessionist crisis a decade ago after landowner and
royalty disputes and accusations of environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
The mine is mainly owned by Australian company RTZ-CRA.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have harbored mistrust of the Australian government,
which trained and equipped PNG's military during the conflict in
which an estimated 15,000 people have died, the Australian wire
service said.

<HEADLINE> China Preparing To Face Serious Flood Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China is involved in a race
against time to repair its water conservation facilities, in
anticipation of bigger flooding than usual this year.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say that China could have unprecedented
flooding, with rain covering a wider area and heavy rainfalls in
the Yangtze River Valley and upper reaches of the Yellow River
this summer.
</P>
<P>
The flood season got off to a start in January, two months
earlier than usual, causing flooding in Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian,
and Guangdong provinces, according to Zhu Dengquan, vice-minister
of water resources, who spoke with Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
In early March, heavy rains pushed water levels in the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze and on Taihu Lake up, causing the
third biggest flood in the history of the Ganjiang River, and
record flooding on the Xiangjiang and Minjiang rivers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ganjiang and Xiangjiang are branches of the Yangtze and the
Minjiang is mainly in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and the State Flood and Drought Control HQ are
urging disaster-prone areas to increase preparation, Zhu said, and
the two will soon send flood-control experts for a look at flood
prevention efforts in the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe river
valleys. One team, led by Vice-minister Zhou Wenzhi, has already
returned to Beijing from the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
While the south is preparing to deal with flooding, the north
is suffering from a serious drought that has affected planting in
the Northeast and in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, the
vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
There has been much less rainfall than usual this year in the
North, with about 20 million ha of farmland hit by drought in
February, Zhu said. The Yellow River has dried up six times so far
this year, and the lower reaches had no flow for a total of 70
days, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister and the State Flood and Drought Control
Headquarters have sent 12 teams to the hardest-hit areas to
coordinate drought-relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Niu Maosheng, the water resources minister, says that northern
China, and Sichuan Province and the city of Chongqing in the
Southwest have spent a great deal of money digging wells and
canals to bring water from rivers and encouraging the use of
water-saving irrigation technology.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a program of
sending high-ranking government officials to 500 state-run major
enterprises to help as supervisors, according to today's Wenhui

<HEADLINE> Pol Pot's Death Not Confirmed: Cambodian Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chea Mun, commander of the
Cambodian Army's Fourth Military Zone, told Xinhua Thursday
that he cannot confirm reports that former Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot is dead.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I have learned, Da Mok, current head of the Khmer
Rouge, took Pol Pot to Thailand a few days ago when they were
retreating from their Anlong Veng stronghold," said the Cambodian
commander, who is in charge of the military operations against
Anlong Veng.
</P>
<P>
"As the situation along the Cambodian-Thai border is still
complicated, it is very difficult to get accurate information
about Pol Pot and Da Mok for the time being," Chea Mun said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are making contacts with the Thai military through
our defense ministry," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot, 71, has reportedly died of heart attack on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Khieu Kanaridh, secretary of state for the Cambodian
Information Ministry, told Xinhua that he also cannot confirm Pol
Pot's death.
</P>
<P>
"We are now making contacts with the Thai government and Khmer
Rouge separatists," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "The Cambodian royal government's position is that no
matter which side gets hold of Pol Pot or his body, they should
immediately turn him or it over to the royal government."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Signs, Then Appeals Arts Return Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed Wednesday a law banning the return to Germany of cultural
treasures looted by the Soviet army in World War II -- but
immediately appealed against it to the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
The ITAR-Tass News Agency said Yeltsin argued in the passage of
the so-called trophy art bill that it "directly violates both the
constitution of the Russian Federation and the country's
international obligations."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin argued that the law does not differentiate between
German art works and those seized by the Nazis from other
countries and individuals in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the signing of the bill, which is required by the
constitutional court, would complicate Russia's relations with
certain countries. It would also make it difficult for Russia to
ask for the return of its own art treasures looted by Nazi
Germany, which outnumbered the arts works taken by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Shakhrai, Yeltsin's representative at the Constitutional
Court, explained a few days ago that according to Russian
constitution, when a Russian law had provisions contradictory with
international treaties signed by Russia, the national law had to
follow the international law.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin vetoed the bill in March 1997, but was overridden by
both houses of parliament. He then refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled in early April that the
president must sign the bill before he can file an appeal
challenging the constitutionality of the new law.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that treasures taken by the Soviet army during
World War II amounted to 200,000 pieces including books,
paintings, sculptures, coins and medals and other art works. But
the number of art works seized by Nazi Germany from Russia totaled
500,000 pieces.
</P>
<P>
The return of looted art has always been a thorny issue
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Half Foreign Investment Proposals not Implemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the 205 foreign
investment proposals registered with Bangladesh's Board of
Investment (BOI) since July 1996 have not made any progress, a
press report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A recent BOI survey revealed that there was no physical
progress in implementing 46 percent, or 94 of the 205 proposals
with a total estimated investment of 1,807 million U.S. dollars,
The Financial Express daily reported, quoting BOI officials.
</P>
<P>
Only 157 million dollars, or about 9 percent of the proposed
foreign investment, have been made in 38 projects which have
already started production, they said. These projects are mainly
engaged in the service sector, textiles and food processing.
</P>
<P>
Nine other projects involving 190 million dollars will go into
production soon, and 64 proposals with an estimated investment of
474 million dollars are under different stages of implementation.
</P>
<P>
Japan tops the list of the projects implemented with an
investment of 68 million dollars, followed by Britain and
Singapore with 33 million dollars of investment each.
</P>
<P>
BOI officials attributed the low rate of implementation to
non-availability of industrial plots with ready-made
infrastructure facilities and utility services, non-availability
of bank loans, cumbersome customs and bureaucratic procedures,
problems at the port, litigation between local and foreign
partners, corruption and unnecessary documentation process.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate and erratic supply of power and interference of the
musclemen also create unwanted obstacles in implementing the
projects, and the recent economic crisis in neighboring Southeast
Asian countries may have also hindered foreign investment in
Bangladesh, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials nonetheless termed the overall trend of foreign
investment as positive in the country, saying that the problems of
the stalled projects would be resolved gradually. The BOI have
held meetings with foreign investors to solve their problems, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The BOI registered a total of 2,137 projects with a proposed
investment of 3,404 million dollars between July 1996, when the
present government was formed, and December 1997.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Be United to Integrate Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) should stand united to move forward towards
the integration of regional economies, ASEAN Secretary-General
Rodolfo Severino said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN should develop a collective voice in dealing with the
financial crisis affecting the region as it has both global and
regional dimensions, he told reporters after meeting Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad here in his capacity as the
grouping's new secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
A collective voice was necessary as it would greatly contribute
towards influencing the evolution of an international financial
system, he said, adding "Currency trading should be an important
element of this evolution."
</P>
<P>
Severino said that discussions during his half-hour meeting
with Mahathir centered on the financial problems as well as the
haze facing ASEAN at present.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mahathir stressed the need for ASEAN to stand
united in facing the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
"He (Mahathir) was particularly concerned with efforts in
dealing with the changing financial structure of the international
system," the ASEAN secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
Severino said Mahathir also stressed the necessity for ASEAN to
work together to overcome the haze problem as it affects everyone
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also stressed the need to mobilize international
assistance," Severino said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Romania: New Government Validated by the Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Parliament validated
the new cabinet, which is headed by Prime Minister Radu Vasile,
with a majority of 317 to 124 votes Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also approved a program presented by the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The task of the new cabinet is to "get us out quickly from the
deadlock we have floundered in. If we are not able to, we
will leave by ourselves, inviting someone better to replace us,"
Vasile said when addressing the parliament before the validation.
</P>
<P>
Vasile said the guiding principles for his cabinet would be:
social reform for the recognition and affirmation of moral values;
property rights; a decent living standard; accelerated
institutional reform; and the restructuring and upgrading of
industry to insure economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will also work to develop agriculture, and
to distribute costs fairly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Integration with European and Euro-Atlantic political, economic
and security organizations is the key issue of foreign policy,
Vasile said, adding that good relations with neighboring
countries and a strategic partnership with the U.S is also a major
goal of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Romania will also continue to develop ties with Russia, Vasile
said.
</P>
<P>
On April 2, President Emil Constantinescu officially authorized
Radu Vasile, general secretary of the largest National Peasant's
Party in the coalition, to form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The former government, which was headed by Victor Ciorbea,
resigned on March 30 after failing to solve a government crisis.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Rejects Outside Mediation On Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While meeting with visiting Danish Foreign minister Helveg
Petersen, Milosevic said there is no need for foreign mediation in
talks on the Kosovo issue. There were no reasons to interfere in
Yugoslavia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said the Kosovo issue is Serbia's internal affair and
Kosovo an inalienable part of the territory of Serbia. The issue
needed to be resolved in a political way.
</P>
<P>
The president said Albanians in Kosovo province have the same
rights as other citizens in Serbia, as stipulated in the
Constitution of the Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority,
has sunk into chaos since ethnic Albanians, calling for
independence from Serbia, began clashing with local Serb police.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav and Serbian authorities have rejected international
mediation or the internationalization of the issue, arguing it is
Serbia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In order to win popular support, the parliament of the Republic
of Serbia decided to hold a referendum to decide whether to accept
foreign mediation in the Kosovo crisis. It will be held within
Serbia on April 23.

<P>
ZAGREB, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Croatia and Macedonia share a
similar view on the establishment of the Southern European Union,
Assembly (parliament) of Croatia President Vlatko Pavletic said.
</P>
<P>
Pavletic made the remark in a news conference after meeting
with Macedonian Assembly (parliament) President Tito Petkovski,
who arrived here Wednesday with a delegation for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The two parliamentary chiefs held talks on strengthening
bilateral cooperation and discussed regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia supports all multi-lateral economic cooperation that
is profitable, but is opposed to the establishment of political
alliances or confederations of any form, Pavletic said.
</P>
<P>
Both Croatia and Macedonia hope to be admitted into the
European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and
both are willing to develop market economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expected visit by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to
Macedonia this year affirms the good ties that exist between the
two countries, Petkovski said, adding that the two countries will
sign a series of cooperative agreements.
</P>
<P>
Petkovski thanked Croatia for its understanding attitude on the
Kosovo crisis and warned of the possible spread of the conflict to
Macedonian soil.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Leader Attacks U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Vice-President Carlos Lage
Wednesday attacked the United States for maintaining its
four-decade-long sanctions against his country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar entitled "Economic War Against This Nation
and Local Development Perspectives," Lage said the sanctions have
prevented Cuba from participating in the world market economy since
they were imposed in 1959.
</P>
<P>
However, Cuba has managed to create the necessary conditions to
support its economic recovery and sustain its development despite
the sanctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest U.S. moves to ease sanctions, Lage said
they were positive steps but not adequate enough to relieve the
nation's problems brought on by the economic blockage.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the humanitarian assistance proposed by the U.S.,
Lage said it was "unacceptable and humiliating from every point of
view. One cannot bloc and strangle a country while at the same
time offering it charity."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Privatization Program Gets Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka's privatization
program is showing development with 59.7 million U.S. dollars
being realized during the first quarter of this year, the official
News Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A sum of 371 million dollars in 1997 was realized from 78.33
million dollars in 1996 and 49.15 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The biggest privatization deal so far has been national carrier
Air Lanka which put its 40 percent for the United Arab Emirates
Airlines. An agreement for this was signed here at the end of
last month.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka's privatization program was launched in 1978 to
accelerate economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was to be done through improvement in efficiency and
competitiveness in the national economy, acquisition of new
technology and expertise and open access to international markets
and enhance capital formation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the divestiture of state-owned enterprises has
reduced government expenditure through the reduction in transfers
to set off large losses and financial capital expenditure which
otherwise would have suffered due to lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
This enables the government to channel more resources to other
development activities and poverty alleviation and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
Several more ventures have been lined up for this year. They
include two farms, the licensing of the import of lubricants,
stakes in several plantation companies as well as a few other
state ventures and the restructuring of the giant Pugoda Textile
Mill.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the overall program in 1998 will aim at
the minimizing of the benefits of the government shareholding of
already privatized public enterprises through asset management
mechanisms to secure high dividends and other forms of income to
the government.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Concerted Fight Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The world is "at the
crossroads" in dealing with the drug problem, the U.N. Under
Secretary General for Drug Control, Pino Arlacchi, said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Countries may continue "taking one step forwards for every two
steps back," or they may recognize that drug control requires a
global solution, the official said in a speech at the National
Press Club here.
</P>
<P>
The official said the U.N. drug control program "looks to the
United States" for financial and intellectual resources in a
coordinated international effort against production, trafficking,
distribution and demand of drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The United States remains a key player in our new global
strategy to eliminate the production and use of illegal drugs by
the year 2008," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is a particularly interesting case because
it is both a consumer and a producer country," he said. "The
United States remains the world's main consumer market for illegal
drugs."
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. program, in 1993 Americans spent 48.3
billion dollars on cocaine, heroin and cannabis. In an average
month in 1994, 15 million Americans used illicit drugs, 10 million
used cannabis, and 1.4 million used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
"UNDCP estimates that one-fourth of the cannabis consumed in
this country is grown domestically," Arlacchi said. "The illicit
manufacture of drugs is also widespread, particularly
methamphetamines, and to a lesser extent, hallucinogens,
depressants, cocaine and opiates."
</P>
<P>
However, "real improvement has been made over the past decade,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of money spent on drug consumption is 23 percent
less today than it was in 1988, and the number of Americans who
use cocaine every month is down a striking 80 percent from the
estimated 5.7 million who used the drug every month in 1985,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reaffirms Commitment to Vienna Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A day after Virginia executed
a Paraguayan man, the United States on Wednesday reaffirmed its
commitment to the Vienna Convention that guarantees consular
access.
</P>
<P>
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the
U.S. remained committed to the principle of consular protection
for foreigners accused of crimes.
</P>
<P>
Albright, speaking during a stop-over in Miami on her way to a
weekend Summit of the Americas in Santiago, Chile, said the
executed man, Angel Francisco Breard had received a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
But she said the U.S. stood by conventions over consular help
and insisted on the same rights for its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We have made very clear that it is essential any foreign
national who is arrested for any reason...is told immediately that
he or she is entitled to be in touch with their consul," she said.
</P>
<P>
Breard, 32, was executed Tuesday for a 1992 murder of an
American woman, despite requests for a delay from International
Court of Justice in the Hague because the Paraguayan's right to

<HEADLINE> Greece Backs Bulgaria for EU, NATO Memberships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 15 (Xinhua) - Greece has voiced its support for
Bulgaria's plan to join the European Union and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference on Wednesday with his Bulgarian
counterpart Ivan Kostov, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said
the EU should embrace all European countries. He added that
Bulgaria's participation in the EU's expansion is a key factor for
the new stage of Bulgarian-Greek relations that started in 1989.
</P>
<P>
He believes bilateral relations will improve in quality based
on European standards and rules.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion should go further and the participation of the
Balkan countries in the pact will guarantee regional security,
said the Greek prime minister, who arrived here Tuesday for a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Balkans need a policy of cooperation to promote
peace and stability in the region. "We are against the creation of
axes and groups that create demarcation lines," said Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Kostov said the two sides share identical views on the regional
situation. "I am happy we stand together in our assessment of the
future and in the will to solve the Kosovo issue and
perform our roles as a major factor of stability in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
During Simitis's visit, the two sides discussed the
construction of new motorways through the Roudozem-Xanthe, Gotse
Delchev-Drama and Kurdjali-Komotini border crossings.
</P>
<P>
The two sides promised that the ratification of a 1991 bilateral
accord on avoidance of double taxation would be stepped up, and a
separate protocol would be signed on transport-related questions
that Bulgaria has raised.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to promote cooperation between
the interior ministries in combating organized crime, terrorism
and the illegal transportation of drugs and arms.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Wednesday
held two crucial meetings on its new three-year economic plan in
preparation for its formal launch on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 1999-2001 document was submitted for discussion to
parliamentary leaders and union confederations.
</P>
<P>
The economic policy blueprint contains plans for the creation
of 700,000 jobs, said the Democratic Left floor leader Fabio
Mussi, after one of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
He said unemployment would fall by 0.7 percent in 1999, 0.9
percent in 2000 and one percent in 2001, putting it at under 10
percent at the end of the three years.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the public debt would also fall to under 100
percent of GDP by 2003 so that Italy could meet the convergence
criteria for the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
These figures are closely associated with a predicted rise in
GDP of 2.7 percent in 1999, three percent in 2000 and 2.9 percent
in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Wandering Chinese River In Loess Plateau Brought Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Wuding ('Unfixed') River in the
Loess Plateau of northwest China has finally been brought under
control and people have taken to calling it the "Yongding"
(Eternally Still).
</P>
<P>
Long ago, the river, which runs by the Muus Desert in the
northern part of Shaanxi Province, had a fertile valley with
flocks of sheep wandering here and there. But wars and unchecked
logging left the area desolate. This caused the river to wander
more, bringing in a large amount of silt and desert, a condition
that then plagued the people for centuries.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, forest and grass covered a mere 1.8 percent
of the area. But, in the 1980s, the government started a campaign
to put the river under control, with a shelter-belt project and a
40,000-hectare irrigation project in sandy areas.
</P>
<P>
The past five years have been the period of greatest success in
this, with 110,000 hectares of land improved, and a reduction of
6.27 million tons of silt annually. In addition, per-capita income
of farmers went up from 530 yuan to 1,400 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The local people now work on terraced fields in the watershed
area and most have gotten involved in some sort of cottage
industry or other.

<HEADLINE> G7 Urges Japan to Take Effective Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Financial leaders of the Group
of Seven industrial nations on Wednesday urged Japan to take
"effective fiscal measures and structural reforms" to achieve a
strong economy.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after their meeting in Washington, which was
attended by finance ministers and bank governors of France,
Britain, Canada, Italy, the United States, Japan and Germany, said
Japan had taken positive steps to stimulate its economy.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, "The challenges facing Japan are serious and
have intensified in recent months."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen has depreciated so sharply that in March it
reached its lowest value against the U.S. dollar since 1992, and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that Japan's
output growth will be zero this year.
</P>
<P>
The financial leaders said they would cooperate in foreign
exchange markets and try to prevent excessive currency falls.
</P>
<P>
But they did not discuss the possibility of joint action in
currency markets to prop up the yen, United States Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing after the G7 meeting, Rubin said
that the world was still waiting for Japan to provide more details
about its plans to stimulate its ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his support for a strong dollar, but also noted
that he continued to share Japan's concern over the excessively
weak yen.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the G7 was eager to see quick action by Japan to
boost its economy after Tokyo announced a series of fiscal
stimulus measures last week.
</P>
<P>
"The world still hasn't seen the details," he said. "The market
will provide an evaluation as to whether that program is
sufficient."
</P>
<P>
Rubin added that Japan gave no sign of any plans to continue
intervening in currency markets on behalf of the yen.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 financial leaders believed the measures announced by
the Japanese government last month would help correct the
excessive weakness of the yen.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasized that it is important to avoid excessive
depreciation where this could exacerbate large external
imbalances. In light of this, we support appropriate steps by
Japan aimed at stimulating domestic demand-led growth and reducing
external imbalances, thus also correcting the excessive
depreciation of the yen," they said.
</P>
<P>
"What is crucial (for Japan) is to implement quickly a strong
program of effective fiscal confidence," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the focus of the meeting, which is part of the spring
meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. It will be followed by a
meeting in England next month.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made on China's WTO Admission: US Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said here Wednesday that important progress
has been made regarding China's access to the World Trade
Organization(WTO), but some issues remain to be solved.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've made progress with China, and I think the
progress, from time to time, would be what I would consider to be
important progress with China on this," she told a gathering at
the Institute for International Economics Conference.
</P>
<P>
The official did not elaborate. It was reported earlier that
she would go to Beijing probably by the end of this month to
continue the tough negotiations with China.
</P>
<P>
China has declared several tariff cuts in recent years to
pave its way to the WTO, but the United States still feels they are
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky reaffirmed that the United States would welcome
China to the global trade organization, but certain requirements
must be met.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see China's entry into the WTO. We think it's
important for China; we think it's important for the WTO; we think
it's very important for the United States; but only, only on the
basis of commercially meaningful commitments," she said.
</P>
<P>
Washington is pushing for further opening of the Chinese
market, especially the service sector. China, still a developing
country, has committed itself to the WTO rules, but insists that
changes should be a gradual process.
</P>
<P>
"Until that can be accomplished, we can't seriously entertain
the admission of any country -- any new country into the WTO," the
U.S. official said, giving little hope for a breakthrough in
Sino-U.S. negotiations.
</P>
<P>
As President Bill Clinton will visit China in late June, it is
speculated that the two sides might try to remove the obstacles
for China's WTO membership. However, it may be too early to
predict if a final settlement could be reached prior to or during
President Clinton's China trip.
</P>
<P>
The United States, as Barshefsky said, is "looking at a range
of market access issues, whether tariffs, non-tariff barriers,
services trade, agriculture trade, industrial goods, and so on and
so forth."
</P>
<P>
"We see a regime that we believe is intent on reform; we would
like to capture that spirit in connection with the WTO, but that
decision ultimately is only for China to make," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, China complained that Washington lacks adequate and
accurate understanding of China's situation, and its conditions
for WTO admission are too harsh to accept for a developing country
like China.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
said Wednesday that his country and Venezuela would reinforce the
friendly relations and strengthen economic development and social
progress between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Venezuela was a good opportunity to strengthen
bilateral ties, Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Venezuela have signed agreements and treaties to
promote dialogue, productive exchanges and cooperation in
education, science and technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the free trade agreement of the Group of the Three
(Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia) which took effect in 1995, the
two countries had been working at promoting investments and trade
to help their economic growth and well-being, the Mexican
president said.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo arrived here Tuesday night for a three-day visit and
will continue on to Chile Thursday to attend the Summit of the

<HEADLINE> Chinese College Students Think Love Basis of Successful Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent study has shown that
nearly eight out of ten Chinese college students believe that a
marriage should be based on love, and about 90 percent think that
feelings are very important in choosing a spouse or boyfriend or
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that China's younger generation has adopted a
more modern and idealistic view of marriage as the country
undergoes rapid economic and social changes, according to Lu
Shizhen, a scholar of the China Youth Political College, who
conducted the survey of 500 students in 9 of Beijing's colleges.
</P>
<P>
Traditional emphasis on social and economic status in choosing
a husband or wife seems to hold little importance for the college
students, according to the survey, and as many as 60.8 percent
expressed indifference to family background, while 74.6 percent
attached much importance to moral character and 65.8 percent to
temperament.
</P>
<P>
With livelihood no longer a major issue in family life, Lu
says, people tend to look more for emotional fulfillment in a
family, something that gets added force from increasing pressures
on people living in an increasingly competitive and indifferent
society.
</P>
<P>
The survey also suggests that Chinese college students have
adopted a more liberal attitude toward sex since 13.4 percent
admitted having had some sexual experience, while 69.1 percent
thought that pre-marital co-habitation or pre-marital sex were
acceptable. Male students tend to have more liberal view than
female ones.
</P>
<P>
As for placing importance on occupation and income in a
marriage, female students' belief in them was 9.3 percentage
points higher than for male students in the former an 8.1
percentage points higher in the latter.
</P>
<P>
This seems to indicate that men are still expected to be the
major source of support of a marriage and family, which is in line
with traditional thinking, Lu says, and he expects that in future
families in China will be a blend of both the modern and the
traditional.

<HEADLINE> Car Exhaust Turns Out A Major Concern for Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Since a car is no longer a luxury
for many Chinese, they have been living in cities choked by
automobile's harmful exhaust fumes. While the government
departments are committing greater efforts to curb the pollution,
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government has carried out spot-checks on
automobiles on the road since early this month. Those vehicles
that exceed State emission control limits must get catalytic
converters installed at designated fitting stations.
</P>
<P>
Now, 1.2 million vehicles in the city have been using lead-free
petrol as another measure to curb exhaust fume
pollution. Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
has banned the sale and use of leaded petrol.
</P>
<P>
China now totals 12 million automobiles. Guangzhou has one
million cars and Shanghai 470,000. They discharge 10 million tons
of carbon monoxide and one million tons of nitrogen oxide
annually, according to Shen Dixin, an environmental expert with
the National Ecological Research Center.
</P>
<P>
There are now more spot checks on automobile emissions and more
than 30 cities in the country have been publicizing weekly reports
on their air quality through the media.
</P>
<P>
As in the capital, monitoring showed the content of carbon
monoxide in the air of 30 streets in the downtown area within the
Third Ring Road of Beijing exceeded the State standards by 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts urged the exact amount of different air pollutants
contributing to atmospheric contamination should be measured to
provide scientific data. Meanwhile, cars and light-duty vehicles
which are used in big cities in large numbers are the focus of the
emission control studies, said officials from the government
departments in charge of car manufacturing industries.

<HEADLINE> China to Be World's 2nd Biggest PC Market, Intel Official Predicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the leading
international computer chip supplier, estimates that China will
become the world's second-largest market for personal computers
(PC) early next century, following the United States.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, China's PC sales may surpass 200 billion yuan,
according to predictions made by an Intel representative in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that, in 1997, the country's computer
sales topped 130 billion yuan, including 41.5 billion yuan from PC
buyers. A total of 3.5 million PCs were sold in the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say China's computer market remains in a
"rapid-growth" period, while the PC market is the most active part
and faces fierce competition among dealers.
</P>
<P>
The Intel representative told Xinhua that his company is
confident of its prospects in China's PC market as the country has
launched a series of national programs to popularize computers,
especially PCs, in all economic and industrial fields.
</P>
<P>
One of the two Intel labs in Asia is located in Shanghai, he
said. This year, the U.S. company has sponsored a series of
seminars to help small- and medium-sized firms learn more about the
use of computer technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Latest quarterly official product
quality inspection report show China's large and medium-sized
enterprises continue to perform well.
</P>
<P>
The quality rating of their products was more than 21
percentage points higher than smaller factories, according to the
China State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprises have shown steady improvement in product
quality control in recent years. They were given a quality rating
of 93.3 percent, 4.6 percentage points above the previous
quarterly sample product quality inspection.
</P>
<P>
Medium-sized enterprises achieved an average rating of 91.9
percent, their best figure since 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, products made by small factories only registered a
70.2 percent rating, 6.3 percentage points below the national
average.
</P>
<P>
The national average product quality rate was only 76.5
percent, said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The quality inspection for the first quarter covered 1,252
products from 1,050 enterprises, 71.4 percent of which were small
factories.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's report indicated quality problems with some
medical equipment, food and mining equipment were still serious.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that small factories, especially
collectively-owned and private works, are the main factors
preventing any further advance in product quality.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Clears Transfer of Marcos Money to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Supreme Court has
cleared the way for the transfer to Manila of 540 million U.S.
dollars in Swiss bank accounts belonging to the late President
Ferdinand Marcos, Manila Standard reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Magtanggol Gunigundo, Chairman of the
Presidential Commission on Good Government, as saying that the
Swiss court last week dismissed the appeals of six Marcos
Foundations based in Panama and Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
The ruling paved the way for the release of the Marcos money to
an escrow account at the Philippine National Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Swiss court, the money could be released to
the Philippine government only if former First Lady Imelda Marcos
was convicted of guilty in a fair and final trial.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the transfer to the Philippines of 100
million dollars of the Marcos deposits last December, then last
January it extended the ruling to cover the entire amount.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a division of the Philippine Supreme Court
upheld a local court's ruling in 1993 which sentenced Imelda to 12
years of imprisonment. Imelda is appealing to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Imelda is running for the presidency in the coming
May elections. She suddenly announced on March 26 that her family
has at least 800 million U.S. dollars in Swiss bank accounts
besides the 540 million dollars to be returned to the Philippines.

<P>
ZAGREB, April 15 (Xinhua) -- FIFA secretary-general Joseph
Blatter, one of the two candidates for FIFA presidency, was in
Croatia on Wednesday to drum up support for his candidature.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of my visit is the possibility of getting a
positive response to my candidature for the next FIFA presidency,"
he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The current FIFA president, Brazilian Joao Havelange, is due to
step down on June 8, two days before the World Cup kicks off in
France.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the members of the European Football Union (UEFA)
have said they will back Blatter's rival -- UEFA president Lannart
Johansson of Sweden -- as Havelange's replacement.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, however, seemed to have met with some success in his
trip to Zagreb on Wednesday, during which he met Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman and watched FC Croatia beat Zagreb 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Football Federation chief Branko Miksa ended the press
conference by saying that he had been delighted that "the next
FIFA president" had come to Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, for his part, said that he would not be surprised if
the Croatian national team reached the quarter-finals of the World
Cup.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Appears to Support Japan's Fight to Defend Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven industrial
countries agreed here Wednesday to cooperate in foreign exchange
markets and try to prevent excessive currency falls, urging Japan
to "quickly" take effective measures and structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Financial leaders of the group said in a statement issued after
their meeting, which was attended by finance ministers and bank
governors from France, Britain, Canada, Italy, the U.S., Japan and
Germany, that Japan had taken positive steps to stimulate its
economy.
</P>
<P>
The yen depreciated sharply for the past months and reached its
lowest level in March against the dollar since early 1992, and the
International Monetary Fund projected Japan's economy growth in
1998 at zero.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders believed that the measures announced by the
Japanese government last month would help correct the excessive
weakness of the yen.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasized that it is important to avoid excessive
depreciation where this could exacerbate large external
imbalances. In light of this, we support appropriate steps by
Japan aimed at stimulating domestic demand-led growth and reducing
external imbalances, thus also correcting the excessive
depreciation of the yen," they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement stressed, "The challenges facing Japan
are serious and have intensified in recent months."
</P>
<P>
"What is crucial (for Japan) is to implement quickly a strong
program of effective fiscal confidence," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the focus of the meeting, which is part of the spring
meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank. It will be followed up in England next month.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that economic expansion remained strong in
North America and in Britain, while the growth in Germany, France
and Italy "gained momentum in 1997 and was expected to strengthen
further this year."
</P>
<P>
The G-7 financial leaders welcomed progress toward restoring
financial stability in crisis-wracked Asia and signs capital
markets were being restored in some countries in the region. They
urged Indonesia to implement "fully and vigorously" reforms.
</P>
<P>
But the ministers and bank governors indicated that
"substantial challenges" still faced the Asian nations and "there
is no time for complacency."
</P>
<P>
"A strong and enduring recovery requires a substantial
commitment to the macroeconomic and structural reform necessary to
restore confidence," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that they encouraged "emerging and transition
economies to pursue strong macroeconomic policies, improved
governance and structural reform programs to reduce their
vulnerability to contagion."

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Excise Expected to Go up in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
expected to charge 50 NZ cents (28 U.S. cents) more for each
packet of cigarettes from Nay to discourage smoking, the New
Zealand Press Association reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The price increase is expected in the government budget for
this year to be announced on May 14, which will contain a 50-cent
rise in Tobacco excise.
</P>
<P>
The report said the move has been pushed by the New Zealand
First party and will be the first one-off tobacco price increase
since the 1991 budget.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First MP and Associate Treasurer Tuariki Delamere
has previously spoken publicly about the high level of
smoking-related diseases, and he is particularly concerned about
risks to young Maoris.
</P>
<P>
He is backed by some other Maori MPs in the New Zealand First
party, who have successfully urged Maori Affairs Minister Tau
Henare to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
At present, a packet of 20 cigarettes sells at 6.15 NZ dollars
(about 3.5 U.S. dollars) or more, some 70 percent of which is
excise.
</P>
<P>
The government collects 650 million NZ dollars (358 million
U.S. dollars) a year in tobacco excise. An increase will bring in
another 50 million NZ dollars (about 27.7 million U.S. dollars) to
the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand scientists have
developed the country's first cloned calf, the Wellington
newspaper "The Dominion" reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted scientist David Wells as telling a cloning
symposium in Melbourne, Australia, on Wednesday as saying that the
calf, named Jill, was developed by AgResearch scientists at a
research center near Hamilton in central North Island.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wells said the technology could aid the New Zealand dairy
industry.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to develop the technology to the point where it can
provide commercial advantages for our agricultural industries,"
he stated.
</P>
<P>
Cloning could be used to develop herds for particular purposes,
 such as cows that produce specific kinds of milk.
</P>
<P>
In February last year, the research center produced two cloned
lambs, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> G-24 Developing Countries Urge Accelerated Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Group 24 developing
nations Wednesday urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
World Bank and major industrial countries to accelerate the pace
of debt relief to countries undergoing economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 developing countries also said in a communique that it
wants a task force of industrial and developing countries to
review the ability of these institutions to "prevent and to
respond in a timely and effective manner to crises induced by
large-scale capital movements."
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued after its 59th meeting concluded
Wednesday afternoon in Washington.
</P>
<P>
It said the G-24 would like to make more poor nations eligible
for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative which
was launched by the two international financial institutions in
September 1996, and to speed the disbursement of aid under the
international program.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the HIPC initiative "is still slower than
expected," the communique noted.
</P>
<P>
HIPC is provided for low income debtor countries with a strong
record of reform with the most generous debt relief terms
creditors have ever offered. A group of 41 developing nations were
classified as being the heavily indebted poor countries, mainly in
the south-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars in debt relief has been
offered to six countries. A week earlier, the IMF and the World
Bank approved a 2.9 billion dollar debt relief package for
war-torn Mozambique. They also completed a 650 million dollar
package for Uganda, making it the first recipient of debt relief
under the initiative. The Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Guyana and
Bolivia have also qualified.
</P>
<P>
G-24 ministers also voiced their support for promoting an
"orderly and gradual liberalization of capital movements."
</P>
<P>
These developing nations also called for a "cautious and
well-sequenced capital account liberalization," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
China is not a member of the G-24, but was invited to attend
the group's ministerial meeting.

NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar continued to
slip against major foreign currencies Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was down against the German mark but was little
changed against other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7979
marks, down from 1.8020 late Tuesday. The U.S. currency also
changed hands at 129.36 yen, down from 129.55 yen.
</P>
<P>
Traders were worried the Bank of Japan, the nation's central
bank, would intervene in currency markets, as it did last week, to
prop up the yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's slip against the mark came as investor sentiment
shifted slightly on the perception that German interest rates were
rising and that U.S. economic fundamentals weren't as strong given
Tuesday's weak retail sales report.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday: 1.4928 Swiss francs, up from 1.4927; 6.0385 French
francs, unchanged; 1,782.00 Italian lire, down from 1,782.85; and
1.4395 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4335.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6852 dollars, unchanged from
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Europe Slow in Bank Mergers, Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- European banks are unlikely to
repeat the merging waves sweeping the U.S. banking sector,
although they are badly in need of consolidation, the Wall Street
Journal said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cultural barriers, regulatory hurdles and national pride stand
in the way, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
To be sure, it said, European lenders worry about losing the
race to create truly global financial institutions, but, as the
pending merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp.
demonstrates, their sights remain set on home markets rather than
on pan-European combinations comparable to the agreed merger of
some U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
The three mergers -- the BankAmerica deal as well as the
combinations between Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD Corp.,
and Travelers Group Inc. with Citicorp -- are worth more than 160
billion U.S. dollars. That is more than the value of all mergers
and acquisitions in the European financial sector combined in
1997. That figure was 134.1 billion dollars, in 463 deals, the
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Not that European banks fail to recognize the need to
consolidate, it said. A common complaint among banks on the
Continent is that they have too many branches and too many
employees to achieve the sort of profit margins enjoyed by banks
in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Now the more important task for European banking remains
cost-cutting, rather than revenue-enhancement. But even the
cost-cutting goal remains elusive in Europe, it said, given the
powerful sway that labor unions, governments, and public opinion
have over the industry.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, speculation continued that Credit Suisse
Group of Switzerland will be involved in the next major European
deal, with possible partners including some major German banks.
</P>
<P>
Other merger scenarios include Deutsche Bank AG with Munich
Re, Allianz AG with Dresdner Bank Ag, Barclays Bank PLC with
National Westminster Bank PLC, and HSBC Holdings PLC with J.P.
Morgan.

<HEADLINE> Orange Order Says No to Northern Ireland Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Orange Order, a pro-British
Unionist group, decided Wednesday to reject the Northern Ireland
peace agreement reached last week.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in Belfast, the Orange Order members agreed to
seek further clarification on key aspects of the peace deal,
including the future of Northern Ireland's police force and plans
for the release of prisoners belonging to guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Grand Secretary John McCrea of the Orange Order was quoted by
the BBC television as saying that "certain vital issues" must be
clarified before the Unionist group could back the deal.
</P>
<P>
The "almost unanimous" no vote of the Orange Order, which has
25 percent control of the Ulster Unionist Council, could be
regarded a serious hurdle in achieving yes vote in the referendum
due to be held later next month in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Ross to Make New Bid for Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Dennis
Ross will travel to the Middle East at the end of the next week
in a fresh attempt to break a deadlock in peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians, the State Department said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ross will go to the region "beginning the weekend of April
24" for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, the State Department said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the trip is to continue to work on the basis
of U.S. ideas and to help focus the parties on the decisions
that need to be made if an agreement is to be reached," the State
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-illan
disclosed the trip to the press, saying: "Ross is arriving to
continue talks on ways to advance the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ross shuttled between Netanyahu and Arafat in a
bid to bring them again to the negotiating table for peace
process which has been suspended for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
But the proposals he had brought on the percentage of
israel's pullback on the West Bank in the next stage of
withdrawal was rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has warned that if
the two sides do not make "hard decisions", Washington might be
forced to wind up the U.S.-brokered peace process in its current
form.

<HEADLINE> German Poll Sees Likely Power Change in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of German
political, economic and media elites now expect a power change in
Bonn after the country's general elections on September 27 this
year, a survey released Wednesday indicated.
</P>
<P>
According to the opinion poll conducted by the German Emnid
institute, about 49 percent of the questioned political, business
and media leaders said that the country's two main opposition
parties, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, would
form a ruling coalition after the elections.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, only 30 percent said they
expected such a power change in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey also showed that only 23 percent still
believed that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's current ruling
coalition -- his Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian
sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) and the junior partner
Free Democratic Party (FDP) -- would remain in power after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
About 22 percent said it was more likely to see a grand
coalition between the CDU and the SPD.
</P>
<P>
Those who participated in the survey included government
officials, parliament members, business leaders and chief editors.
</P>
<P>
A majority of them said that CDU parliamentary leader Wolfgang
Schaeuble would have a better chance than Kohl to beat SPD
chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder in the September vote.
</P>
<P>
Most of them believed that unemployment would be the most
important issue for the election campaigns, followed by
crime-combating and reforms of the social welfare state.
