<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Participates in African Connection Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Transport and Communications announced Wednesday that Ethiopia
supports and has participated in the 16,000-kilometer-long African
connection rally from March 30 to April 20,1999.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the ministry said that Ethiopia is
one of the 10 African countries that the rally will cross.
</P>
<P>
The rally is led by Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and
Broadcasting of South Africa Jay Naidoo. It is aimed at
invigorating Africa's participation in the information revolution
in the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia supports the objective as it has already launched a
plan to dramatically improve its telecommunications
infrastructure, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The rally could bring the attention of the developing world to
Africa's communications development requirements," it added.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications infrastructure in Africa lags behind other
developing countries in the world. For example, telephone lines
in Africa account for only two percent of the total telephone
lines in the world now.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said that telephone lines in Japanese capital Tokyo
alone are more than those in the whole Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Arms Agency to Be Absorbed by State Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency (ACDA) will go out of business Wednesday
midnight after a 38-year run that included the negotiation of
international agreements aimed at controlling nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The functions of the ACDA will be taken over by the U.S. State
Department.
</P>
<P>
John Holum, who has served as ACDA director since 1993, is due
to become the first undersecretary of state for arms control and
international security affairs, once he is confirmed by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
The agency was created in 1961 as an independent voice within
the government on behalf of arms control.
</P>
<P>
The legislation implementing the merger states that the arms
control office may continue to advocate a point of view which is
at odds with that of the secretary of state, Holum said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Something unusual is going to happen at midnight tonight, and
that is a federal agency will disappear," Holum said.
</P>
<P>
He said the cost savings of the merger already have been
realized in the form of a 6 percent personnel cutback.
</P>
<P>
As part of the merger process, the U.S. Information Agency also
will be absorbed by the State Department. The merger will take
place in October.

<HEADLINE> Feature: NATO Bombs Cut Lifeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CACAK, Yugoslavia, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Boja Bojic, 52, has
toiled in the Sloboda home appliances plant for three decades. For
him, the factory has been the lifeline of his family.
</P>
<P>
Not any more.
</P>
<P>
Sloboda, or Freedom, the largest employer in the town of
100,000 residents, was struck by over 20 NATO bombs and missiles
in the early hours of Sunday and Tuesday, leaving its 5,000
employees jobless.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a savage. We work here to earn our bread and make
28-56 dollars a month. Today, we have nothing," Bojic said.
</P>
<P>
Radomir Ljujic, the factory's general manager, told three
busloads of foreign journalists Wednesday that 80 percent of the
sprawling plant had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Workers were clearing the debris and scavenging for what was
left in the ruins 160 kilometers south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The factory produces ovens, hair dryers and vacuum cleaners
rather than military hardware as the NATO had claimed, Ljujic
said.
</P>
<P>
About 10 people, all of them security guards, were wounded in
the first night, said Ljujic, who was also inside the factory when
it was bombed.
</P>
<P>
At a crater about six meters deep and 10 meters across, one
could still smell dust and gunpowder. The roofs were ripped off
and some galvanized iron sheets landed several hundred meters away
across the road. Some were perching in the trees' branches.
</P>
<P>
One section of the bombed warehouses was cordoned off. The
manager said there were two unexploded missiles there waiting for
sappers to tackle.
</P>
<P>
Asked what made the NATO choose his factory as a target, Ljujic
said he had been looking for answers for days.
</P>
<P>
The factory, which cooperated with Siemens and Bosch of Germany
and Iglis of Italy a few years ago, was still producing the
appliances using the license of Siemens.
</P>
<P>
In the clearance outside the warehouses and work shops were
piles of Biljana hair dryers, a Sloboda electric stove with a hole
in the cover and vacuum cleaners of Sloboda 3000 and Sloboda 700
models.
</P>
<P>
With nowhere to work, Bojic was wondering how to support his
wife and children.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see (U.S. President) Bill Clinton's daughter to
be with our children here," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This can only be done by those who has no senses, has not
hearts," Bojic said, sorting through the broken parts in the work
shop where engines for vacuum cleaners were assembled.
</P>
<P>
"Can vacuum cleaners kill," asked Miloze Basnnokovic, a power
engineer.
</P>
<P>
Ljujic, the manager, said his factory, which celebrated its
50th anniversary last year, lost 300 million dollars as a result
of the NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
Facing the foreign reporters, many from countries that
participated in the NATO air raids, Ljujic said: "Tell those who
decided to bomb us that the factory has not been totally
destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Amid the mounting rage against NATO air raids, which entered
its eighth day Wednesday, none of the reporters from the western
media had their agencies' logos on their equipment.
</P>
<P>
One worker, a wooden club in hand, demanded: "Who's American?
Who's British?"

<HEADLINE> South Africa's Producer Inflation at Two-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Production
Price Index (PPI) showed an annual rate of increase of five
percent in February, the highest since September 1997, when it was
6.1 percent, Statistics South Africa announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This rate is 0.6 percentage points higher than the
corresponding rate of 4.4 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase of five percent in the PPI is mainly due to
a 3.9- percentage-point increase in the price index for locally
produced commodities. The annual increase in imported commodities
is 1.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of increase in the PPI for locally produced
commodities is 4.8 percent in February, compared with the
corresponding annual rate of four percent in January.

<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 153 Zimbabweans have
been killed by cholera since its outbreak this January, the
Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Welfare announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that a total of 1,623 cases
were reported during the period despite efforts to curb the spread
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"The current spread of cholera has been fuelled by people
travelling to and from affected areas without due regard to
adherence to adequate hygienic practices," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It urged the private sector to compliment its efforts by
giving support for the anti-cholera campaigns to bring the
epidemic under control.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is contracted through eating food or drinking water
contaminated by the cholera germ. The patients lose body fluids
and, if not promptly replaced, they would become weak and die.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Denounces Serb Actions in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia denounced Wednesday
the Serb actions in Kosovo, saying they led to "the killing and
displacing of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Kosovars."
</P>
<P>
A Saudi official lashed out at "the policy of collective
punishment and ethnic cleansing" pursued by the Yugoslav
government against the Muslim people of Kosovo, the Saudi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, condemned
what he called "intransigence" of the Yugoslav government in
rejecting the international efforts aimed at solving the Kosovo
crisis peacefully and notably in the contact group talks in France.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Serb-led government and independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo intensified early last year.
</P>
<P>
The contact group, consisting of Russia, the U.S., France,
Britain, Germany and Italy, hammered out a ceasefire proposal,
which was rejected by Yugoslav government and accepted by ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has launched air
strikes against Serb targets since last Wednesday after it claimed
the diplomatic efforts were exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official did not comment on the NATO air strikes. But
he said Saudi Arabia supports the Kosovars that are suffering the
"cruelest kind of oppression and homelessness at the hands of the
aggressive Serbs," highlighting the necessity of putting an end to
these actions.

<HEADLINE> IGC's Outlook For World Wheat Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- On the basis of information
currently available, world wheat production is forecast at 569
million tons, compared with 583 million tons in 1998, said a
report by the International Grains Council (IGC).
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue of Grain Market Report, the IGC said: "Wet
weather and a higher set-aside rate curtailed sowings in the EC,
and the winter wheat area in the U.S. is the lowest since 1972."
</P>
<P>
However, "Some return from oilseeds to wheat could boost the
outturn in Canada, and India could see a near record harvest," it
added.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast at a record 592 million
tons, with food use at 437 million and world wheat trade is
forecast to rise by 6 million to 99 million tons, the IGC said.
</P>
<P>
Taking account of initial projections for world supply and
demand, world wheat stocks are forecast to fall by 24 million to
105 million tons, which would be the lowest since 1980, according
to the report.

<HEADLINE> Ties With China Important: Clinton's Security Advisor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. relationship with
China is so important that its nature will have a profound effect
on America's future interests, not only in Asia, but globally, a
prominent Security Advisor to U.S. President Bill Clinton said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech prior to the expected upcoming visit of
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, Kenneth Lieberthal, senior director of
the U.S. National Security Council, said that if China were to be
at loggerheads in a serious fashion with the U.S., that would
vastly complicate the world.
</P>
<P>
"We would run into increased problems in everything from
proliferation to international economics, to stability in
Northeast Asia," he said, adding that an antagonist relationship
between the U.S. and China is neither in the interest of the U.S.,
nor China and others in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. diplomacy in the U.S. relationship with China,
which is called comprehensive engagement, "means that we seek to
deal with China, to increase mutual understanding, to develop
cooperation where our interests permit this, and to provide frank
advice where we think the other side in in error."
</P>
<P>
On China's accession to international institutions such as the
World Trade Organization (WTO), he said any such organization
without China falls at least 22 percent short of being global in
scope.
</P>
<P>
"If you aspire to a post-Cold War world that is governed in the
main by agreement on international norms, and by institutions to
express those norms and provide a regulatory framework," he said,
"you really need to work to get China constructively into those
institutions. "
</P>
<P>
Admitting that "non-trivial issues" remain on the table, he
said that to bring China into the WTO would make the WTO virtually
global in scope and would subject China to the international rules
of the game in its trade regime.
</P>
<P>
He said a WTO agreement is a "win-win," good not only for U.S.
business and interests, but also for China and Chinese interests.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about China's faith in implementing the
WTO agreement, Kenneth, a China expert who has been watching China
for 30 years, said it depends on China's political will and the
WTO's institutional capacity. "I think the Chinese would enter
this regime in good faith," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at China's participation in multilateral
organizations, almost without exception, China is not an outlier,"
he said. "It is not the one everyone points to as the one that's
impossible to deal with."
</P>
<P>
He also said China has made "tremendous progress" in human
rights, effective rule based on law, effective protection of
property rights, etc.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat to Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is
to hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the latest
developments in the Mideast peace process, Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, is due to arrive in Cairo
on Thursday for a brief visit, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two leaders will dwell on the outcome of
Arafat's recent visits to a number of European countries and the
United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has announced that he would declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year interim self-rule
period under the Oslo Accord signed with Israel in 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
Israel is opposed to the Palestinian plan, threatening to take
tough actions against the possible step, including annexation of
the parts of the West Bank under its control.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been under mounting pressure from the West and the
Arab countries to postpone the declaration of statehood. It is
feared a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would
further stalk the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his recent European and U.S. visit, Arafat has tried to
win the support from the world community for the Palestinian plan
and recognition for the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The talks also follow a statement of the European Union (EU) on
recognizing the Palestinian people's right to establish their own
independent state, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The EU issued last Thursday a statement that the Palestinians
have "unqualified right to self-determination, including the
option of a state."
</P>
<P>
Moussa described EU's stance as "important," saying it
formulates the world public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Any coming Israeli government will face such a stance, which
means that the issue of the Palestinian statehood does not and
should not be subject to Israeli veto, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel is scheduled to hold general elections on May 17.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Much of Rainwater in Europe Unfit to Drink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Much of the rain falling in Europe
contains such high levels of dissolved pesticides that it would be
unfit to be used as drinking water, Swiss researchers said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental
Science and Technology have found that rainwater in Europe is full
of toxic chemicals used in crop sprays, which appear to have
evaporated from fields and become part of the clouds.
</P>
<P>
Both the European Union and Switzerland have set a limit of 100
nanograms for any particular pesticide in a liter of drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
But scientists found that European rainwater can contain much
more than that, especially in the first minutes of a heavy storm.
</P>
<P>
"Drinking water standards are regularly exceeded in rain,"
Stephan Muller, one of the researchers, told the New Scientist
magazine.
</P>
<P>
Muller and his colleague found in a study that one sample of
rainwater contained almost 4,000 nanograms per liter of
2-4-dinitrophenol, a widely used pesticide.
</P>
<P>
Some of their previous research also showed that in rain
samples taken from 41 storms, nine contained more than 100
nanograms of atrazine per liter, one of them around 900 nanograms.
</P>
<P>
Until now, scientists had assumed that the pesticides only
infiltrated groundwater directly from fields.
</P>
<P>
However, Muller and his colleagues found that the highest
concentrations of pesticides turned up in the first rain after a
long dry spell, particularly when local fields had recently been
sprayed.

<HEADLINE> Gene Discovery May Help Produce Tastier Strawberries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Strawberries could soon become
tastier thanks to the discovery of the genes which control flavor
formation and make strawberries red, the New Scientist magazine
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ken Manning and colleagues from Horticulture Research
International in Warwickshire, central England, have found that a
protein in strawberries delivers sugar into fruit cells from the
phloem, the tissue that circulates nutrients to all parts of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
Called a sucrose transporter, the protein dumps sucrose sugar
in vacuoles, large chambers within plant cells, and allows more
sugar in as the plant ripens.
</P>
<P>
"If the gene which makes the protein were overexpressed, we
could raise the amount of sucrose coming into the fruit, which
would result in a sweeter strawberry," Manning was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Manning's team has also discovered as many as six families of
genes which play a part in removing the sharp taste of unripe
strawberries, turning them red at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Another of the team's findings is the identification of genes
crucial to the manufacture of volatile substances that give
strawberries their rich smell.
</P>
<P>
Armed with these discoveries, the researchers said it may be
possible to develop superior strawberries that taste sweeter,
richer as well as smelling more appetizing.

northeastern Angola's Lunda-Norte Province, a diamond-rich
province bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Catoca Project is a joint venture between Angola's National
Diamond Company and Russia's Arma Company and Brizalia's Odebrecht
Company.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador said that Angola has obtained Russia's
high technology in diamond development through the joint
development.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reportedly not to Observe Arms Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to Cyprus
Georgi Mouradov Wednesday said Russia will no more observe the
U.N. arms embargo on Yugoslavia since it has already been violated
the NATO, Cyprus News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cyprus House (parliament) Speaker
Spyros Kyprianou, he said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) has violated the relevant U.N. resolution about arms
embargo on Yugoslavia, adding arms provisions are already finding
their way into Kosovo openly by NATO forces to Kosovo army.
</P>
<P>
"We have certain indications that a ground offensive is being
prepared," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov expressed fears that the NATO is trying to apply a new
world order, which entails recognition of the right of powerful
nations to set up a separate state through military intervention
and occupation of part of a smaller state.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov said some American politicians are talking about
Kosovo's secession, which effectively means giving the right to
powerful states to create a separate state by force.
</P>
<P>
"This is terrible because it has ramifications for many other
countries," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov conveyed to Kyprianou a statement by Russian State
Duma on the Yugoslav crisis, which describes the NATO's air
strikes as "a serious threat to the security of the Russian
Federation" and calls for "an immediate cessation of military
attacks."
</P>
<P>
The statement recommends, among other things, to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and the government to "take measures on
increasing the readiness of the military forces of the Russian
Federation" and calls for an extraordinary session of the
U.N. General Assembly to discuss the aggression against a
U.N. member.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows by 3.9 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The real gross domestic
product (GDP) of the United States surged at a seasonally adjusted
6 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter of last year,
bringing the growth for the whole year to a robust 3.9 percent,
the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The revised GDP estimate for the last three months of 1998 was
down slightly from the department's preliminary estimate of 6.1
percent released last month, and the growth estimate for the year
was left unchanged. The real GDP stood at 7,551.9 billion U.S.
dollars last year, 282.1 billion dollars more than that in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, the department's first estimate of after-tax corporate
profits for the fourth quarter showed a drop at a 1 percent rate,
marking the third quarterly decline of the year.
</P>
<P>
And for all of 1998, profits fell 2.2 percent, the first drop
since 1989, when profits declined 4.8 percent in a precursor to
the 1990-91 recession.
</P>
<P>
Profits are being pinched by the combination of increasing
labor costs and the inability of manufacturing firms to raise
prices in the face of stiff price competition from imports
produced in countries with devalued currencies.
</P>
<P>
A price index tied to the GDP rose just 1 percent in 1998.
There hasn't been a rate that low since 1959, also 1 percent, and
there hasn't been one lower since 1950.
</P>
<P>
Labor costs are increasing because the long expansion, which
began its ninth year in March, reduced the unemployment rate to a
29-year low last year.
</P>
<P>
Plentiful jobs and surging stock prices have been the principal
fuel of the growth in consumer spending, which represents about
two-thirds of economic activity. It rose at a 5 percent seasonally
adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter and 4.9 percent for all
of 1998, the most in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to wages, consumers spent some of their stock gains
and tapped their home equity in a wave of refinancing last year
after mortgage rates fell to three-decade lows.
</P>
<P>
Those, in turn, produced a big drop in the nation's savings
rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- from 2.1
percent in 1997 to just 0.5 percent in 1998, the lowest since
1933. The rate was zero during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to economic growth were business investment
in computers and other new equipment, up 16.5 percent last year,
and housing construction, up 10.4 percent, the most since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Overseas economic turmoil, however, held U.S. exports to only a
1.5 percent increase, the weakest in 15 years, while imports shot
up 10.6 percent.

</P>
<P>
The United States closed its embassy in Belgrade last weekend
and had evacuated remaining diplomats prior to NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
With neighboring streets blocked, officials first took
possession of the Yugoslav chancery and then the ambassador's
residence, both located just off Washington's main embassy row on
Massachusetts Avenue.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will respect and protect the properties
without prejudice to the eventual settlement of property issues
among all the successor states to the former Yugoslavia," said a
statement by Lee McClenny, a State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
For the past seven years, the nations of the former Yugoslav
union -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia and today's rump
Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro -- have been
locked in a dispute over how to divide the assets left by the
Yugoslav federation when it dissolved in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
In the first days of the NATO attack, which began a week ago,
Yugoslav diplomats tried to maintain a business-as-usual
atmosphere in Washington.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief: Iraq-Kuwait Border Generally Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (xinhua) -- The situation in the
demilitarized area between Iraq and Kuwait has remained generally
calm despite occasional air skirmishes over the "no-fly" zones,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council on the United
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM), Annan said the
mission had contributed to the maintenance of calm and stability
along the border and he therefore recommended that the mission be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, despite several violations during the
reporting period of September 1998 to March 1999, the UNIKOM has
continued to receive the cooperation of the Iraqi and Kuwaiti
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The 1,300-person UNIKOM was established by the Security Council
in 1991 following the Persian Gulf war to maintain a demilitarized
buffer along the Iraq-Kuwait border.

<HEADLINE> WTO Fails to Agree on New Chief Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) failed again to decide who will lead the
organization into the new century after a last-minute meeting here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said that delegations of the WTO's 134 members
faced difficulties in choosing a new director-general by
consensus.
</P>
<P>
"It is with deep regret that I have to report to you that the
difficulties faced by both candidates are so serious that neither
of them can enjoy consensus from the membership to enable them to
be elected as the next director-general," said Ambassador Ali
Mchumo of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mchumo, elected on February 16 as chairman of the WTO's
governing body General Council, took full charge of the
consultations among WTO members in the selection process from his
predecessor, Ambassador John Weekes of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"This is most unfortunate and disappointing," said Mchumo. "We
had all wanted to conclude this process by today at the latest in
order for us to devote our attention to more substantive issues in
the WTO. We all have to prepare for the Seattle Ministerial, for
instance."
</P>
<P>
Missing the end-March deadline, the delegations will meet next
week in Geneva following the Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
Mchumo expressed the hope that the WTO members would elect the
new director-general at the regular General Council meeting set
for April 14.
</P>
<P>
Originally, there were four candidates to run for the WTO
position. Since Hassan Abuyoub of Morocco quit and Roy MacLaren of
Canada suspended the contest after failing to gather sufficient
backing, Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand and Michael Moore of
New Zealand have been the only two candidates eligible in the
contest.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has been in the lead since the WTO began to choose its
new director-general in the fourth quarter of 1998, but Moore is
believed to have support from the United States and majority
support from Latin America and much of the sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The WTO members have missed several deadlines before to agree
on their new leader.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent WTO director-general, Renato Ruggiero, will leave
his post on April 30 at the end of a four-year term in office.

<HEADLINE> Study Explains Why Drinking Green Tea Prevents Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A chemical found in green tea
which inhibits the growth of new blood vessels in animals may
explain why drinking green tea prevents cancer, researchers said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Drinking tea, especially green tea, is associated with a lower
incidence of cancer in humans and has been shown to suppress the
growth of several types of tumor in animals, but how and why tea
has such an effect is less clear.
</P>
<P>
Now two China-born Swedish scientists have found for the first
time that a substance in green tea called
epigallocatechin-3-gallate or EGCG, significantly prevents
angiogenesis, a process of blood-vessel growth, in mice.
</P>
<P>
This may explain the cancer inhibition mechanism of green tea
as angiogenesis is particularly important for tumor growth and
spread, Yihai Cao, one of the researchers, told Xinhua Wednesday
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Cao, an associate professor at the Karolinska Institute,
Stockholm, Sweden, said that their study, to be published in the 1
April issue of the science journal Nature, could also help expand
the applications of green tea in medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
The result indicates that drinking tea may be beneficial for
the prevention and treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases,
including blindness caused by diabetes, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that according to their new findings,
pregnant women may better avoid tea as they need promotion rather
than prevention of blood vessel growth.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Considers to Deregister 300 Publications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is considering to
deregister more than 300 publications which have failed to print
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Tanzania Information Services, Kassim Mpenda,
told Xinhua here Wednesday that the government has issued a 90-day
notice, effective from March 16, to 315 publications asking them
to submit copies of their publications on every production day.
</P>
<P>
If they cannot show their copies and fail to give good reasons
for it, their registration certificates will be scrapped off,
Mpenda said.
</P>
<P>
"We want you to publish. We don't want you to keep your
registration certificate in your pocket," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another government information officer said: "There is a law in
our country -- once a newspaper is registered, it should come out
as regularly as it is asked to publish."
</P>
<P>
Under the Newspaper Act of 1976, publishers are supposed to
submit copies of every issue to the Registrar of Newspapers at
their own expenses so that the government can make sure that they
are operational.
</P>
<P>
A number of Tanzanian publications have failed to come out with
even one copy after they got registered, forcing the government to
take measures against them, Mpenda said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the government may issue notices next month to
another 200 publications which have not come out regularly as
expected.
</P>
<P>
Some papers, such as Mwananchi, Ngurumo, Motomoto, Fahari,
Wakati ni Huu and Mizani were publishing for a period of time but
later were out of circulation.
</P>
<P>
Other publication, like Daily Times, Bayana, Jambo and Harakati
and the Tanzania Law Magazine, have not been published since they
were registered, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mpenda also said by deregistering the publications, their names
can be used by others who wish to launch a new paper or magazine.

TEHRAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Wednesday expressed deep concern over the worsening
situation in Kosovo following airstrikes launched by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a message to heads of Islamic countries, Khatami warned
against continuation of the killing, displacement of innocent
civilians and possible expansion of the crisis to other parts of
the Balkans, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The attacks by the NATO on Yugoslavia will further complicate
the crisis, said Khatami, who is also current chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
He said the heads of state of the OIC member countries
burden the responsibility of preventing repetition of the bitter
experiences of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also instructed his foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi to
contact his counterparts in the OIC contact group to prepare the
preliminaries for a new move, along with other international
institutions, in a bid to find a principled solution to the crisis
and help restore a lasting peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
After the NATO started military strikes on Yugoslavia last
Wednesday, Iran expressed grave concern over the situation in the
Balkan region and called for a peaceful solution to the crisis
through political efforts.

</P>
<P>
According to the vice premier, Chinese students, and especially
infants, should have their nutritional intake improved with more
milk and soybean products. "I hope that every student will be able

Organization (WTO) failed again to decide who will lead the
organization into the new century after a last-minute meeting here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said that delegations of the WTO's 134 members
faced difficulties in choosing a new director-general by
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Missing the end-March deadline, the delegations will meet next
week in Geneva following Easter holidays.
</P>
<P>
Originally, there were four candidates to run for the WTO
position. Since Hassan Abuyoub of Morocco quit and Roy MacLaren of
Canada suspended the contest after failing to gather sufficient
backing, Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand and Michael Moore of
New Zealand have been the only two candidates eligible in the
contest.
</P>
<P>
The WTO members have missed several deadlines before to agree
on their new leader.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches Stamps for World Youth Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Postal Service
Wednesday launched commemorative stamps for the 10th World Youth
Soccer Championship tagged as Nigeria '99 which is scheduled to
start in Lagos, Nigeria, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony, Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar warned in a message that "the government would
not tolerate failure on the part of those responsible for Nigeria
'99."
</P>
<P>
He challenged members of the local organizing committee and
managers of sports in the west African country to brace up to
ensure the success of the championship.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar noted that the championship coincided with the
country's return to the mainstream of international politics after
years of isolation over human rights and democratization.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian media has recently been replete with complaints
from officials of the Federation of International Football
Association (FIFA) and football teams who began arriving in the
country at the weekend about the state of facilities in the eight
centers for the 21-day games.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the FIFA withdrew the hosting rights from Nigeria over
fears about medical facilities in the most populous African
country.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "charity stamps" specifically produced for sales during
the championship, the postal stamps will come in six different
denominations.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the stamps is football, Head of Media Relations of
the Nigeria Postal Service Jaiye Olaniyi explained, adding that
each of the stamps will carry a surcharge of five nairas (less
than six U.S. cents ) which is meant to be turned to the Local
Organizing Committee of Nigeria ' 99 after sales.
</P>
<P>
Video documentaries on Nigerian cultural heritage in postage
stamps would be played in the official hotels for Nigeria '99 as a
form of entertainment to visitors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service has also planned to release for sale some
specialized postcards which are football related topics.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with U.S. Congress Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and a U.S. Congress delegation on Wednesday discussed U.S. aid to
Egypt and the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and the delegation led by Benjamin Gilman, chairman of
the U.S. House International Relations Committee, discussed
economic and cultural ties, Mubarak's top advisor Osman el-Baz
told reporters after the meeting in the Sinai resort of Sharm
El-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also dealt with the issue of U.S. military aid to
Egypt, el-Baz was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Egypt receives 1.2 billion U.S. dollars annually from the
United States in military aid.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz said the two sides also discussed ways of reviving the
Arab-Israeli peace talks after the May 17 Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks came to a halt in December when
Israel shelved the Wye peace agreement signed last October in
Washington after it carried out the first of a three-phase
withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel-Syria and Israel-Lebanon negotiations broke down in
early 1996 due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights
captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War from Syria.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to realize peace with Israel, has
been an active mediator in the Middle East peace process.
U.S. officials often consult with Mubarak on issues related to the
peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A team of United States army
officers arrived in Harare Wednesday to train the Zimbabweans to
remove land mines planted along Zimbabwe's borders during the
country's liberation struggle in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The team led by General Robert Coffey brought demining
expertise and 756, 000 U.S. dollars to purchase equipment which
will be donated to the Zimbabwean army, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Coffey said that Zimbabwe was doing an important job in
clearing areas infested with land mines for the sake of innocent
people's life.
</P>
<P>
He said that the demining exercise would go a long way in
bringing relief to people who lived in those areas infested with
land mines.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people in developing countries continued to be maimed
or killed by land mines because they had little knowledge of the
deadly weapons, said the U.S. general.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has mine fields on its peripheral districts which
cover an area of 678 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The land mines were planted during the war of liberation
struggle between 1976 and 1979.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Drop Sharply in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- New orders to the U.S.
factories fell sharply in February as demand for costly
transportation goods like new commercial aircraft contracted
significantly, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total factory orders were down 2.5 percent to 340.5 billion
U.S. dollars, the biggest monthly falloff since a 2.6 percent
plunge in April 1995, following a revised 1.5 percent January
increase.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment dropped 14.4 percent to
44.9 billion dollars, with aircraft orders down 30.6 percent.
Transportation orders increased by 13.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said the manufacturing sector should
continue to be supported by healthy domestic demand. Manufacturing
has been gradually recovering after lagging other key sectors like
homebuilding throughout much of the long-running expansion.
</P>
<P>
A separate report, from Chicago purchasing agents, showed a
sharp spike upward in March manufacturing activity in the Midwest.
Its regional index climbed to 57.0 from 52.9 in February and
included increases in new orders, production and employment in
March.

<P>
KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-eight years
ago, a primary school teacher known as Miloje Pavlovic chose to
die with his pupils by pointing toward his chest as the target for
Nazi gunshots.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight years after, upwards of 10,000 people chose to be
bombed by pasting bull's eye onto their chest, back and forehead
as the target for NATO cruise missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
Both stories took place at Kragujevac in central Serbia, where
people coming from far and wide on Wednesday to the memorial
service of the 7,000 innocent people who were killed by the Nazis
on October 21, 1941.
</P>
<P>
The primary school teacher was told to stand away from his
pupils to shun death but he chose otherwise while the people at
Kragujevac chose not to succumb to the pressure of the western
society.
</P>
<P>
They chose, rather, to be bombed.
</P>
<P>
Not far from the monument erected to commemorate the 7,000
people killed by Nazi during World War II, there were three bomb
craters left by the first round of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Though the bombs were close enough to civilian housing to have
done severe damage, local people still thought that NATO was off
target and offered to help train NATO cruise missiles and bombs by
using black-and-white and red-and-white target papers.
</P>
<P>
Even the handicapped in wheelchairs and toddlers in baby prams
had target papers pasted to their arm-rests and sun-shades.
</P>
<P>
Jaswin Varkovic, a 19-year-old choir soprano, was so moved by
the brave gathering that she sang with her troupe mates the
national anthem, orthodoxic requiem and Serbian folksong, all with
tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
The first-year college student of English language said that
she was scared the first night NATO bombs fell upon her hometown
but she no longer felt scared as the bombs continued to fall and
especially after she saw so many brave people gathered around the
monument to defy western pressure and aerial invasion.
</P>
<P>
She said that her choir's message was peace to the world
whereas NATO's message were missiles and bombs to her nation.
</P>
<P>
As yellow narcissus wavering and candle flames dancing in the
breeze, hundreds of pigeons flew up with the song "Rise Serbia"
that was composed during the first World War to urge the people of
the country to resist the invasion of others.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Writers Denounce NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Writers Association
(CWA) on Wednesday announced their most vigorous condemnation of
the bombing and intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) in Yugoslavian territory.
</P>
<P>
At the same time they expressed their protest against the
interference of a political and military alliance in a non allied
nation, such as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Such determination was made public on Wednesday in a statement
by the writers group signed by the president, Edmundo Herrera, and
the general secretary, Virginia Verdal and corresponds to the
agreement adopted last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement expresses that "the Chilean writers are against
the war, for the defense of world peace. We do not want NATO to
begin world war three, which may also signify the end of the
planet. We demand the end of the bombings and the start of
diplomatic talks".
</P>
<P>
In addition, the writers are against the attitude of the large
powers "which are establishing themselves as the police force of
humanity. We demand that the United Nations (UN) comply with their
role as defenders of the populations".
</P>
<P>
Finally, the society demand that the mediums of national
communication are opened to the whole information and truth about
the real events, "because the Chileans are overwhelmed by the
dis-information".
</P>
<P>
"It is not correct that only people with access to cable
television are well informed".

<HEADLINE> S.African President Encourages N. Ireland Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Wednesday urged parties in the faltering Northern
Ireland peace talks to find common ground, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the plea as the anniversary of last year's Good Friday
accord approaches.
</P>
<P>
Mandela issued a formal message of support following phone
calls he made earlier this week to leaders involved in the
negotiations, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Wednesday that South Africa's own experience in
overcoming the divisions of centuries showed that even the deepest
and most difficult problems could be resolved through talks and
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
"The Good Friday agreement has our full support, because we
believe that its final implementation will assure Northern Ireland
of the better future it deserves, a future of lasting peace based
on democracy and respect for human rights," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, negotiated last year, aims to set up a new
Protestant- Catholic government, which is to receive powers
gradually from the British government and pursue joint
police-making with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
But the talks have stalled over the insistence of the largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, that the Irish Republican
Army must start to disarm before its political wing, Sinn Fein,
can receive two posts in the government.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, confirmed Wednesday that
Mandela had phoned Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, Ulster Unionists
head David Trimble, who was elected to lead the new government,
and Seamus Mallon, the moderate Catholic elected as his
deputy-to-be.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Breakthrough above 15 Dollars Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- World oil prices passed a key
milestone on Wednesday, hitting a new 10-month high over 15 U.S.
dollars, on the joint forces of gasoline demand in the United
States and continued trader faith in producer output cuts.
</P>
<P>
International benchmark North Sea Brent broke through the 15
dollars a barrel level for the first time since May 1998, to trade
up to 15.30 dollars in afternoon business in London before closing
at 15.22 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brent has gained around 4 dollars this month on major oil
producers' decision to reduce output and knock down what has been
a chronic overhang in global oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
The North Sea benchmark averaged a mere 13.34 dollars a barrel
in 1998 and has managed an average of just 11.50 dollars so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
Markets took further heart on Wednesday from the perception of
strained gasoline supplies on the West Coast of the United States,
where a series of refinery disruptions have hindered production
just as the U.S. driving season begins, according to a Reuters oil
analyst.
</P>
<P>
Two major explosions at West Coast refineries helped cut
gasoline inventories there by nearly 600,000 barrels last week,
with national stockpiles down some 5.4 million barrels, according
to statistics from the American Petroleum Institute (API).
</P>
<P>
Data from the U.S. Department of Energy confirmed the stock
draw, calculating a weekly decline in gasoline inventories of 5.3
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
A rise in U.S. inventories of crude oil worked to counter the
positive sentiment, but analysts expressed optimism about the
market's long-term prospects, saying funds and trade buyers
appeared to be locking into more longer term positions in
anticipation of further price gains, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"The market (Brent) is incredibly constructive at the moment;
it's overbought but it's not losing momentum; there's just no
stopping it," Independent Consultant Elli Gifford was quoted
saying.

<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern went back to Northern
Ireland Wednesday evening to rescue the province's deadlocked
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern left the talks earlier in the day to attend to
government matters in their capitals and promised to come back
when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders have brokered three days of talks to try to break
a stalemate over decommissioning that has blocked formation of a
coalition cabinet that will inherit some home-rule powers from
London -- a key provision of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
John Hume, a moderate Roman Catholic architect of the peace
process, said he was hopeful some compromise would be reached in
Wednesday night's talks.
</P>
<P>
Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s refusal to disarm itself has
triggered a row between Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and
the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Trimble has refused to admit Sinn Fein to the cabinet until the
IRA gives up the weapons it used to wage a 30-year campaign
against British rule.
</P>
<P>
The British government has set the week running up to this Good
Friday, April 2, as a final deadline for the implementation of the
peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parliament Passes Refugee Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SOFIA, April 1 (Xinhua) - With no debates, and almost
unanimously, the Bulgarian Parliament passed a refugee bill on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moving the bill to the plenary chamber was not prompted only
by the Kosovo crisis, said Ivan Soungarski, chief of the
parliamentary human rights committee. He said that work on the
bill started a long time ago and its passage is part of Bulgaria's
steps to integrate into European structures.
</P>
<P>
The bill was put on Parliament's agenda by proposal of the
opposition Socialist party early last month.
</P>
<P>
A refugee in Bulgaria can be any foreigner who has reasons to
fear persecution because of his race, religion, political
affiliations or for belonging to a certain public group.
</P>
<P>
A refugee can also be a foreigner who is out of the country in
which he is a citizen, or if he does not have citizenship but is
out of the country of his permanent residence, or he refuses to
accept its protection and refuses to return to it for fear of
persecution. A refugee's spouse and children can also get refugee
status.
</P>
<P>
Refugee status will not be granted to persons who are
suspected of having been involved in war crimes, or a crime
against peace and humanity. The restriction applies to foreigners
who are suspected perpetrators of a grave crime of nonpolitical
character outside Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The competent authorities may refuse to grant such status to
persons who are citizens of, or live permanently in a country that
is considered to be safe. Foreigners who have entered Bulgaria to
seek refugee status may not be returned to the country where they
feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
Refugees and persons applying for refugee status have civil,
administrative and criminal liability to the regulations that
apply to Bulgarian citizens.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will provide humanitarian protection to refugees up
to one year and may be extended to another year.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Greece Against Territorial Revision in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Defense Minister
Victor Babiuc and his visiting Greek counterpart Apostolos
Tsohatzopoulos expressed objections to any territorial revisions
in the Balkan region, stressing that the Kosovo issue should be
resolved through political means.
</P>
<P>
 Following their talks, the two ministers told a joint news
conference on Thursday that Kosovo would enjoy high autonomous
rights on the condition that the territorial integrity of both
Yugoslavia and the Serbian Republic be observed.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos, who arrived here on Thursday for a two-day
official visit, pointed out that the worsening situation in
Yugoslavia will affect the stability and security of the whole
Balkan region, and this should be taken into account at the coming
NATO summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Greece also suggested a discussion regarding NATO's expansion
to southeastern Europe by inviting Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia
to join the military organization, since the three countries are
in a region that has suffered directly the consequences of the
current crisis in Yugoslavia, Tsohatzopoulos said.

<HEADLINE> Dalai's Sabotage Contributes to Tibet's Backwardness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region said here today that "the
disturbance and sabotage of the Dalai Lama clique constitutes one
of the major factors behind the backwardness of Tibet."
</P>
<P>
Basang, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made the remark this
afternoon while meeting with visiting member of the United States
House of Representatives Matt Salmon.
</P>
<P>
Basang briefed the visitors on the history of Tibet, saying
that "Tibet has always been an inalienable part of China."
</P>
<P>
She noted that "the feudal serfdom system was practiced in
Tibet until 1959 when democratic reform was introduced into the
region."
</P>
<P>
Some 95 percent of the Tibetan population were serfs without
their own land, pastures, or property, and five percent of the
serfs were slaves who could be exchanged as gifts among serf-
owners, according to Basang.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Dalai Lama regards the system as a sacred,
brilliant, and unchangeable system, and organized an armed
rebellion in 1959 to prevent the introduction of democratic reform
into Tibet. Dalai fled abroad with a small handful of upper-class
splittists when the rebellion failed," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the attitude of the Chinese government toward the
Dalai Lama is consistent and explicit, "the Dalai Lama can return
to China during his lifetime as long as he completely abandons his
splitting activities, recognizes publicly that Tibet is a part of
China, Taiwan is a province of China, and the fact that the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government of China."
</P>
<P>
Basang also discussed Tibet's development in the fields of
economy, culture, education, and religious protection.
</P>
<P>
Matt Salmon and two others arrived in Tibet on March 31 at the
invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The three visited the Potala Palace, the Jokhang Temple, and
other scenic spots during their stay; the group is scheduled to
leave Tibet for the U.S. tomorrow.

MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua)-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
his visiting Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma exchanged the
ratified version of the friendship and cooperation treaty between
the two countries on Thursday which put the 10-year-long treaty
into effect.
</P>
<P>
The friendship and cooperation treaty between Russia and
Ukraine was signed by Yeltsin and Kuchma in May, 1997. Due to
disputes on issues regarding the Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet,
the treaty was not ratified by the parliaments of the two
countries until March 24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Kuchma at the Kremlin, Yeltsin stressed the
need for a strategic partnership between the two countries. He
said Russia and Ukraine should take careful and responsible action
to safeguard the stability of Europe and the world.
</P>
<P>
NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia triggered a new crisis
throughout Europe and makes cooperation between the two countries
even more urgent, he added. Kuchma expressed the same view in
saying a friendship and cooperation treaty is indispensable to
bilateral relations as well as the security of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma was in Moscow for the summit meeting of the Commonwealth
of Independent States.

<HEADLINE> Five U.S. B-1 Bombers Arrive at British Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua)-- Five B-1 bombers from the United
States on Thursday arrived in a British airforce base.
</P>
<P>
The bombers, which would fly missions of airstrikes on
Yugoslavia, came from their Ellsworth airforce base in South
Dakota of the U.S. and landed at the Royal Air Force base in
Fairford in Gloucestershire in western England, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The B-1 bombers each has a crew of four and can carry 20 cruise
missiles, the report said.
</P>
<P>
With a sophisticated defense system to detect hostile jets and
can fly 7,500 miles without refueling, the plane can fly at any
time of the day and in all weather, BBC said.
</P>
<P>
The five new arrivals would combine with the 13 U.S. B-52s,
which had already been based in Britain, to bomb the Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO said on Wednesday that it would intensify and widen its
campaign on Yugoslavia.

LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Talks on Northern Ireland's

He said at a press conference in Belfast that a basis for

Blair made the announcement after nearly two days of talks at

"All parties are wedded to the Good Friday agreement," he said.

Protestants demand that the Irish Republican Army disarm
before its political ally Sinn Fein can take part in a new

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt: Kaunda's Citizenship Deprived by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has said that
depriving former President Kenneth Kaunda's Zambian nationality
is an independent decision of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Thursday quoted chief government spokesman
Newstead Zimba as saying that it is not the government that passed
the ruling but the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He said that justice Chalendo Sakala acted independently and
professionally.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will need time to study the judgement
before any more remarks.
</P>
<P>
An official from Kaunda's United National Independence Party
(UNIP) dismissed the judgement as unfair.
</P>
<P>
UNIP's Ndola District chairperson for women's affairs, Evelyn
Chikonde, called on the British government to intervene, saying if
Kaunda is stateless then everyone else in Zambia is a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
She said despite the ruling Kaunda will remain UNIP leader and
continue to enjoy the sport of the party.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Democratic Party Secretary-General Dante Saunders said
the judgement is a great setback for democratic progress in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia quoted UNIP Secretary for Information Publicity
Bwendo Mulengela as saying that the decision is retrogressive.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's lawyers have appealed to the Supreme Court against
the judgement.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was declared stateless Wednesday by the Ndola High Court
because his parents were Malawians.
</P>
<P>
Judge Chalendo Sakala ordered the citizenship Board of Zambia
to quash the Zambian nationality of Kaunda, who ruled the country
since its independence from 1964 to 1991, when he was defeated by
current President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda were barred from running for president in the elections
held in 1996, when a constitutional amendment was adopted under
which foreign nationals and those with foreign parentage are
prohibited from contesting.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has vowed to contest the post in the next elections in
2001.

WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. troops in Macedonia came under fire from unknown
assailants near the border with Kosovo on Wednesday, and three
enlisted soldiers were reported missing after an intensive ground
and air search failed to locate them.
</P>
<P>
-- The ethnic Albanian rebel group in Kosovo is facing imminent
military defeat unless NATO airdrops heavy weaponry to help the
guerrillas survive a relentless assault by Yugoslav forces, a
leading figure in the group said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- There are signs that NATO's strategy would fail Kosovars.The
finger-pointing about missed signals and suggestions of
mismanagement began to surface in Brussels and Washington as the
second week of the bombing campaign began with no sign that Mr.
Milosevic was buckling, and no idea how it would end.
</P>
<P>
-- Four New York City police officers were arraigned on charges
of second-degree murder and suspended from police duty on
Wednesday as a result of the shooting death of a black man named
Amadou Diallo about two months ago. The event has brought several
Federal investigations into Police Department practices.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Presidential candidates prepared early financial-reporting
filings for the 2000 election. Texas Governor Bush raised more
than $6 million, and Gore is expected to report raising more than$
7 million.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ambitious Thorpe Eyes New World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ian Thorpe, who smashed a nine-
year-old world record in the men's 200 meters freestyle Thursday
night at the world short-course swimming championships, said that
he would not let the triumph stand in his way.
</P>
<P>
The Australian, 16, finished the distance at 1:43:28, 0.36
better of the old world mark set by Italy's Georgio Lamberti in
Bonn in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Known for his mastery of middle distance events, Thorpe is also
a world record holder of 400m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"It is my second world record in short course. I've learned to
accept that. It's not difficult, but you have to get on with your
career. Don't let that stand in your way," Thorpe said after the
final.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his own performance, the teenager said: "I felt
fine. I produced a very fast 200m in the warm-up and I was quite
excited to do a fast time in the actual event (final). To come
here for a sprint meet was much easier. I did not feel together --
my stroke and my kick were not synchronized and that was somewhat
of a problem.
</P>
<P>
"The short-course world records are probably not as high a
standard as the long-course world records, which take nothing away
from them. But they're a little bit easier," Thorpe said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still striving for a long-course world record. It makes my
400m freestyle tomorrow very exciting," added Thorpe, who is
looking forward to that and the 4x200m freestlye relay Friday
night.

<HEADLINE> CPAPD Urges NATO to Stop Air Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Association
for Peace and Disarmament (CPAPD) has strongly appealed to NATO to
immediately stop its military interference in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
While making a statement on U.S.-led NATO's military attacks on
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a CPAPD spokesman today called
on the international community and relevant parties to make joint
efforts in order to enable the Kosovo issue to return to the track
of political solution as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The CPAPD fully supports the solemn and just stand that Chinese
President Jiang Zemin has voiced several times on behalf of the
government, the spokesman said. The CPAPD expresses great
indignation and firmly opposes NATO's military intervention, while
at the same time showing sympathy and support for the Yugoslavian
people who, under NATO's wanton and indiscriminate bombing, have
suffered losses in lives and property and have been left homeless,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the Kosovo issue is purely an internal affair of
Yugoslavia, and should be resolved through peaceful negotiations
in a just and rational way and under the prerequisite of
respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia
and guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnic
groups in the Kosovo area.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman blasted NATO's military action against a
sovereign state, which has not been authorized by the United
Nations Security Council, as a violation of the international law.
He also rapped it as an act against the morality and justice, a
case of the strong bullying the weak by amassing the strongest
military forces and the most sophisticated weapons in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO's military intervention is actually an anti-
humanitarianism act posing as the "safeguarding of humanitarianism,
" and evil behavior of interfering in internal affairs and
violating sovereignty under the excuse of mediating ethnic
conflict.
</P>
<P>
NATO's act goes against the world trend of peace and
development and has set a bad precedent for international
relations, the spokesman noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Defense Minister
Victor Babiuc and his visiting Greek counterpart Apostolos
Tsohatzopoulos expressed objections to any territorial revisions
in the Balkan country of Yugoslavia, stressing that the Kosovo
issue should be resolved through political means.
</P>
<P>
 Following their talks, the two ministers told a joint news
conference on Thursday that Kosovo would enjoy high autonomous
rights on the condition that the territorial integrity of both
Yugoslavia and the Serbian Republic be observed.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos, who arrived here on Thursday for a two-day
official visit, pointed out that the worsening situation in
Yugoslavia will affect the stability and security of the whole
Balkan region, and this should be taken into account at the coming
NATO summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Greece also suggested a discussion regarding NATO's expansion
to southeastern Europe by inviting Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia
to join the military organization, since the three countries are
in a region that has suffered directly the consequences of the
current crisis in Yugoslavia, Tsohatzopoulos said.

<HEADLINE> 13 NATO Members Participate in Bombardment of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing open-ended NATO bombing
of Yugoslavia has involved troops and military facilities from 13-
member countries of the U.S.-led Western military alliance, the
Russian military said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Information collected by Russia shows that 300 planes, some 40
warships and more than 12,000 ground troops from the 13 NATO
countries are taking part in the military action in Yugoslavia,
the General Staff of Russia's Armed Forces said in a report.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes have made more than 750 sorties over Yugoslavia
and over 350 cruise missiles have been launched from land or
airplanes at targets in the Balkan country since NATO's massive
bombardment began on March 24, the report said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has also used two U.S. B-2 stealth bombers in the air
strikes. The bombers flew directly to Yugoslavia from their base
in the United States. Boeing E-3 early warning planes are also
playing a role in the action.
</P>
<P>
During the air campaign, the report said, NATO experimented
with a series of new and highly precise weapons, including cruise
missiles and guided aerial bombs, which can reduce losses as
warplanes are able to hit targets without entering the range of
the Yugoslav Air Defense Force.

<HEADLINE> French Communists Remain in Government Despite Dispute on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF) has
not shown any sign of leaving the Socialist government of Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, although it strongly opposes France's role
in NATO strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The government ministers from the PCF expressed their concerns
over the bombings by NATO at two cabinet meetings Wednesday and
Thursday, while the Greens and Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, who leads the left-wing group, have also expressed
opposition to the NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
Jospin admitted on Thursday that France is experiencing a time
of ``crisis and tension,'' but he said the government has to run
the country in a normal way.
</P>
<P>
With a few exceptions, the opposition Gaullist Rally for the
Republic (RPR) and centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF)
supported President Jacques Chirac and the government in joining
the U.S.-led NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
RPR President Philippe Seguin even suggested that Jospin expel
the PCF ministers because, he said, France is ``in a state of war.
''
</P>
<P>
The French constitution, drafted under President Charles de
Gaulle, does not require the president or the government to seek
parliamentary approval before joining a war.
</P>
<P>
Although most French lawmakers support the country's role in
the NATO operation, recent polls on public opinion show that those
who support the NATO action and those who oppose it are equally
divided. enditem

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Nepal Improve Primary Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Thursday a credit of 12.5 million U.S. dollars to support Nepal's
basic and primary education program, the bank's Kathmandu Office
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the credit is the first in a series of adaptable
program loans totaling up to 50 million dollars that the bank
plans to provide over the next 10 years to support Nepal's
education reforms.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year program will focus on strengthening institutional
capacity at national, district and school levels, delivering more
efficient and better quality basic and primary education services
and raising the learning achievements and increasing equitable
access, especially for girls and under-served communities.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to improve the quality of teaching and
educational results, and work toward extending the basic cycle
from five to eight years," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the World Bank and the Danish International Development
Agency, the European Union, Finland and Norway will contribute a
total of 106 million dollars to the program.
</P>
<P>
"The expected increase in access to basic and primary education
under the program, combined with higher completion rates resulting
from quality improvement, would result in a 10 percent increase in
net enrollment over the program period," the bank predicted.
</P>
<P>
Though Nepal has announced basic education for all by the year
2000, it has attained only a literacy rate of 42 percent in the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"At present, about 3.2 million children have enrolled in public
and private primary schools across the nation, which is 68 percent
of the total population of school-aged children," said the State
of the Rights of the Child in Nepal in 1998 released by the Child
Workers in Nepal Concerned Center, a non-governmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank provided a credit of 30.6 million dollars in
1992 for a basic and primary education project in Nepal, which is
expected to close at the end of this year, the bank added.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Speedier Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
today urged related departments to hasten tree-planting and
greening efforts to significantly improve the country's ecological
environment in ten to fifteen years.
</P>
<P>
At a plenary session of the National Greening Committee today,
Wen, also head of the Committee, said that although China has been
launching large-scale afforestation drives for two decades, the
nation's forest cover is still relatively low, and many places are
still suffering from soil erosion and ecological degeneration.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that past experience shows that in order to
achieve optimum results in these efforts, all of society should be
fully mobilized, and relevant laws should be strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also emphasized the importance of public
awareness and technology in the afforestation drive.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the State Council issued an action plan for China's
ecological improvement which called for a combination of economic
development and ecological improvement.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice premier, the state will greatly increase
investment in greening projects this year and in the future.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, 530 people who have made remarkable
contributions to afforestation and greening were rewarded with
National Greening Medals.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Separates From Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian State Police
(Polri) Thursday officially separated from the Indonesian Armed
Forces (ABRI), to become an independent force in the country.
</P>
<P>
Defense and Security Minister/ABRI chief Gen. Wiranto, who
attended the separation ceremony at ABRI headquarters here, said,
as of April 1, 1999 the State Police which had been put under the
control of the armed forces since 1966, have become a force under
the organizational purview of the Ministry of Defense and
Security.
</P>
<P>
He said the detachment was the starting point of the
government's efforts to make the police an independent force and
efforts to strengthen democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the detachment did not mean an "absolute
severance" in the structural and cultural links between Polri and
ABRI.
</P>
<P>
Polri's complete separation from ABRI and evolution into a
really independent force required a transitional period of at
least two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said although policemen would retain their status as ABRI
members during the transitional period, they were from now on
expected to operate as law enforcers who carry out their duties
without resort to military methods.
</P>
<P>
"Policemen must increasingly abide by the philosophy: fight
crime, love humanity and protect the people," Wiranto noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wiranto said, after the separation (of the police from
ABRI), ABRI will only consist of the Army, the Navy and the Air
Force. So, ABRI leaders have proposed to the president to change
the institution's name to Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Police chief Gen. Roesmanhadi said the
police will change its educational system starting this coming
academic year and conduct a review of its doctrines and laws.
</P>
<P>
"The present police laws, which use military discipline, will
have to be changed to address civilian values," he added.

NEW DELHI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market Thursday lost 53.67 points to
3,686.29 as against Wednesday's close of 3,739.96.
</P>
<P>
The national index dipped by 17.50 points to 1,633.87 from the
previous close of 1,651.37.

The BSE-200 index and U.S. dollar index were quoted lower at
376.14 and 147.59 compared with the last close of 380.01 and
149.11 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Equities turned weak on BSE Thursday due to selling pressure in
the form of squaring up by operators and lack of fresh purchases
from Indian financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Operators attributed the selling pressure to the last day of
the current settlement in view of a holiday Friday on account of
Good Friday.

<HEADLINE> S. African Prisoners to Be Allowed to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South African prisoners will
be allowed to vote in this year's general election, the
Constitutional Court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its judgement on an application brought on behalf of two
prisoners, the court ruled that it was unconstitutional to deny
prisoners the right to vote and ordered the Independent Electoral
Commission to provide for awaiting-trial and convicted prisoners
to put their names on the voters' roll and to vote on June 2.
</P>
<P>
The ruling only applies to people who are behind bars during
the registration period which began in November last year and
ended on March 15.
</P>
<P>
The ruling extends the franchise to most of South Africa's
146,000 prisoners, a third of them awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
The court said the order excluded people, now in prison, who
were free during the registration periods but failed to register.
</P>
<P>
Certain classes of prisoners had been excluded by law from
voting in the 1994 election but parliament had made no attempt to
introduce similar legislation since 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. firms have won the bid
to design the main building of the terminal for Guangzhou's Baiyun
Airport to be relocated, in south China's Guangdong Province, it
was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Parsons Corp. and URS Greiner Corp. will collaborate with
the Guangdong Provincial Architectural Design Institute to do the
designing, said Guangzhou Mayor Lin Shusen.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou city government decided to move its Baiyun
Airport, one of China's busiest, to the outskirts away from the
crowded urban area as the airport has been overburdened by
increasing passengers and cargo volume.
</P>
<P>
The design will be completed in October of this year, and
public bidding will then be held for the purchase of equipment,
said Zhang Chunlin, general manger of the Baiyun Airport.
</P>
<P>
At an estimated total cost of 19.5 billion yuan (about 2.3
billion U.S. dollars), the first-phase construction of the airport
will become operational by 2002 and it will be capable of handling
some 70 million arrivals and departures a year when the entire
airport is completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- IOC member Phil Coles was
deprived of his organising role in the 100-day Olympic Torch relay
of the Sydney 2000 Games on Thursday in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Coles, 67, has all his Sydney Games duties taken away by the
Sydney organising committee SOCOG when the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) invested him for his acceptation of free holidays
in Salt Lake City last month.
</P>
<P>
The former Olympic kayaker now faces a further IOC inquiry over
allegations that he received gold and diamond jewelry from someone
connected with Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
The allegations, which Coles denies, was recognized by Coles'
ex-wife Georgina, who wrote to the IOC two weeks ago that she had
received a gold and diamond necklace and cufflinks from a man
involved in Athens' 1996 bid.
</P>
<P>
Coles has said he received a pair of cufflinks in Athens but
they were not worth any more than 30 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Corporate Earnings in Singapore Plunge in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large number of listed big companies, like Singapore Telecom,
Singapore Airlines and Singapore Press Holdings that do not have
December year-ends for their account, were not counted in the
data.
</P>
<P>
The drop in 1998 corporate earnings meant a much more sharp
fall than the 49-percent plunge sustained by 106 companies in the
previous economic recession in 1985, when the total corporate
earnings declined to 483.1 million Singapore dollars (280 million
U.S. dollars) from the previous year's 925.1 million Singapore
dollars (536.3 million U.S. dollars) and 68 percent of the 106
companies reported positive earnings.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1997, the companies' earnings were down 75
percent to about 800 million Singapore dollars (463.8 million U.S.
dollars) in the first half of last year, but they incurred losses
of 292 million Singapore dollars (169.3 million U.S. dollars) in
the second half, which saw Singapore's economy going into
recession.
</P>
<P>
A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the average
earnings per company was about 2.6 million Singapore dollars (1.5
million U.S. dollars) last year, about half the 4.6 million
Singapore dollars (2.7 million U.S. dollars) for 1985 when the
economy shrank 1.6 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Data also show that a total of 130 companies or 67 percent of
the 193 listed companies managed to stay in black in 1998 although
a full 70 percent of the total declared either lower profits or
outright losses.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the sharp plunge in total earnings to
companies' correction to property bubbles in the past year, saying
the companies were availing themselves the opportunity to clean
house by taking huge provisions.
</P>
<P>
They said that many listed companies were plagued by property
woe and nine out of 10 of those which declared the biggest losses
were developers making massive write-offs on their properties.
</P>
<P>
Even the banks, which kept their position as Singapore's
biggest profit generators, saw their earnings eroded by provisions
on housing and property loans.
</P>
<P>
Government linked companies (GLCs), looking for growth in
Singapore's limited domestic market and once considered by many to
be a good bet on the growth of Singapore, were also among the
worst performers last year as they rushed headlong into property
during the boom years and now were paying for the price.
</P>
<P>
Neptune Orient Line (NOL) led the loss-makers for 1998, losing
438.2 million Singapore dollars (254 million U.S. dollars). Next
to NOL were the other two GLCs, Keppel Land and DBS Land, that
suffered from a net loss of 350.6 and 239 million Singapore
dollars (203.2 and 138.6 million U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
These three GLCs lost a staggering 1 billion Singapore dollars
(579.7 million U.S. dollars) in all as a result of battering by
low traffic and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, hotels and car distributors also had a hard time
last year.
</P>
<P>
A signed article in the local English newspaper The Business
Times commented, "In general, companies that maintained their
profitability tended to be those whose markets were outside of the
region -- such as the electronic sub-contractors and the
ship-repairers."
</P>
<P>
"Companies that make good profits are those who either have a
commanding position in the domestic market or those who could open
new markets outside of Singapore," it added.
</P>
<P>
The article noted, "This was in striking contrast to the
experience in the last decade when profits were mostly generated
by those dealing in properties and when even the weakest developer
could hope to make money by waiting for inflation to bring up the
value of property."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, most analysts expect a strong recovery in
corporate earnings this year due to write-back of provisions.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Hold Conference on Harnessing Eastern Himalayan Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference will begin
here Saturday on regional cooperation in harnessing the eastern
Himalayan rivers, the organizer said in a press release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is to be the final dissemination conference as a part of
the joint study undertaken by the Center for Policy Research in
New Delhi, the Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad in Dhaka and the
Institute for Integrated Development Studies of Nepal (IIDS).
</P>
<P>
The IIDS, the organizer of the conference, said that the 86
participants include politicians, academicians, journalists,
representatives of the private sector and experts from India,
Bangladesh and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
It said that under the second phase of the joint study, the
eight studies completed looked at many of the crucial issues
concerning the subjects under study and offered insights and ideas
toward helping solve the problems standing in the way of
strengthened cooperative efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The subjects under study included augmentation of lean season
flow, water quality, regional energy grid, flood disaster
management, dam safety, environment and rehabilitation, seismic
monitoring and inland water transport," the IIDS, a
non-governmental organization, said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, efforts have been made to exploit waters of the
Ganges, Brahamaputra and Meghna. The Growth Quadrangle comprising
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal was initiated in December 1996
for joint efforts in this regard. Foreign secretaries of the four
countries had met on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
The IIDS said that prior to the conference, it will be
organizing an interaction session on Friday on "SAARC Process: How
to Move Forward."
</P>
<P>
Prominent Nepalese experts, high-ranking officials and the
SAARC secretary-general are expected to attend the interaction
along with some prominent persons from India, it said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is to host in November the 11th summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which groups
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.

NEW DELHI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A large number of school

spurt in violence in the capital in the past few months.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China strongly urges NATO to
immediately stop its military operation against Yugoslavia in
order to bring the Kosovo issue back to the negotiating table for
a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao made the remarks during talks
with his Yemeni counterpart Abdo Rabo Mansour Hadi here this

</P>
<P>
Hu said the recent escalation of NATO military operations has
aroused strong response worldwide. "We feel shocked and uneasy,"
he told Hadi.
</P>
<P>
Hu reiterated that the Chinese government advocates that the
Kosovo issue should be resolved through dialogue on the basis of
respecting Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and
ensuring the lawful rights of all ethnic groups in the Kosovo
region.
</P>
<P>
He restated that China consistently advocates properly
resolving territorial or border disputes between countries
through dialogue and consultations, opposes the use of force or
the threat of the use of force, and supports all efforts

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Announces Acquisition Of US Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- BP Amoco PLC announced Thursday
that it has acquired U.S. oil company Atlantic Richfield (ARCO)
for 26.6 billion dollars in stock, paving the way to become the
world's second largest oil company.
</P>
<P>
The deal is the latest example of consolidation in the oil
industry. BP Amoco has been a leading force in that consolidation.
The former British Petroleum PLC acquired Amoco Corp. of Chicago
for 57.6 billion dollars in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have hailed the deal as a coup for BP Amoco and
expressed confidence in its ability to save nearly one billion US
dollars in costs from it.
</P>
<P>
Those savings have raised the value of BP Amoco to 170 billion
U.S. dollars compared with a combined market capitalization for
the two firms of around 100 billion US dollars last August when
their merger was announced.
</P>
<P>
However, the deal could fall foul of the regulatory authorities
in Alaska where there is growing concern in the US state's
legislature over BP's potential dominance of Alaska's primary
industry.
</P>
<P>
The 25 billion dollar takeover of Arco will immediately breach
Alaskan statutes which limit a company's right to oil exploration
acreage.
</P>
<P>
Ken Boyd, director of Alaska's Department of Natural Resources,
was quoted as saying, "the takeover of Arco would give the new BP
870,349 acres onshore, well above the 500,000 acre limit."

<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's total foreign currency
reserves rose to a record high of 57.45 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of March from 55.46 billion dollars in February, said the
Bank of Korea on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total of foreign currency reserves include deposits in
overseas branches of South Korean banks.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's usable foreign currency reserves dipped to 7.26
billion dollars in November 1997 when it borrowed a bailout loan
of 58 billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund to tide
over its foreign exchange crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies
and bad loans of financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the rise of foreign exchange
reserves to the steady expansion of the current account surplus
and the inflow of foreign funds arising from asset sales by local
companies.

<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) - British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said on Thursday that the NATO campaign in Yugoslavia
would be "long and difficult".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Britain's Sky television, Robertson said the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization "has the determination and stomach"
to keep on the bombing as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
The air strike against Yugoslavia stretched into its ninth day
on Thursday. NATO said on Wednesday that the bombing would be
intensified and expanded as a number of new targets had been
chosen.
</P>
<P>
Robertson had been in sombre mood late on Wednesday when he was
reporting to British House of Commons on the conflict. There are
more and more critics now in the parliament who said the air
strikes have sparked more violence in Kosovo and the bombing
should be stopped as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Week of Mourning of Genocide Victims Begins in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
declared a one- week mourning period countrywide in preparation
for the fifth commemoration of the 1994 genocide due on April 7th,
state-run radio announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The week will be marked by low-key activities in Rwanda, with
the organization of conferences, debates, as well as film shows on
genocide in all prefectures of the country. Flags will flying at
half-mast, and the national radio will continually play funeral
music and songs, recalling the terrible sufferings and ordeal
undergone during the 90-day genocide, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Themes to be discussed will focus on the evaluation of the
five-year period after the genocide, what has been so far done to
the victims, the government's strategy to fight the genocidal
ideology, the release of detainees without file cases, and the
role of Rwanda in curbing genocide in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Burial ceremonies of the remains of the victims at identified
massacre sites will take place in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
''To remember the people who were brutally massacred during the
April- July genocide is the responsibility of any conscientious
human being,'' said Rwandan Culture Minister Francois Ngarambe.
</P>
<P>
Over half a million of Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
slaughtered during the period.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the week of mourning will culminate into the
official burial of the remains of more than 20,000 Tutsis
massacred at Kibeho Catholic Mission, in Gikongoro, southwest of
the capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Genocide survivors have taken the opportunity to call for
justice to be done, and compensation paid to the victims. More
than 125,000 genocide suspects are detained in Rwandan prisons.
Rwandan criminal courts which began operating in December 1996
have tried over 1,000 suspects.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two culprits have so far been publicly executed.
</P>
<P>
Frederic Mutagwera, chairman of the ''Ibuka'' (remember)
umbrella organization of 20 associations of genocide survivors,
said ''the evaluation of what has been done in favor of the
survivors and that of actions aimed at fighting the causes of
genocide is positive, but there is a long way to go, notably about
uprooting the culture of impunity.''
</P>
<P>
He said genocide survivors still face insurmountable problems
to be integrated in the socio-economic life like other citizens.
</P>
<P>
Similar programs relating to the commemoration of the 1994
genocide have been organized by communities of Rwandans in the
diaspora, notably in Belgium, Switzerland, Britain, France, the
U.S., and Canada.

MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua)-- A Russian reconnaissance warship

aggression against Yugoslavia, said Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said he had informed U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright of the decision to send the warship there.
</P>

Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev announced Wednesday that
Russia would soon send seven warships to the region around the
Yugoslavia conflict and the first reconnaissance ship is to leave
its Black Sea base on Friday.

<P>
Turkey on Wednesday also approved a Russian request for the
passage of its warships through the Bosporus straight.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ivanov said that Russia would soon put forward new

<HEADLINE> Thais to Save 30 Bln Baht Under New Economic Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Thais will save nearly 30 billion
baht (810 million U.S. dollars) annually from tax cuts and reduced
energy costs under the government's new economic stimulus package
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Power bills in the household sector would drop by 370 million
baht (10 million dollars) a month from April to July, while those
in the commercial and industrial sectors would decline by 1.1
billion baht (29 million dollars) a month and those of other users
would slip by 128 billion baht (3.4 billion dollars), Thai News
Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local households nationwide could save 187 million baht (5
million dollars) a month on their cooking gas bills, while the
industrial sector could save 42 billion baht (1.1 billion dollars)
a month.
</P>
<P>
The overall savings result from the government's decision to
cut value-added tax from 10 percent to seven percent, excise tax
on fuel oil from 17.5 percent to five percent and reduce income
tax.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commercial banks welcomed the new economic package,
saying it reflected the government's commitment to pull out the
economy out of the crisis, and pledged to resume lending to local
business communities.
</P>
<P>
Economists said they believed the package could help spur
economic activities and boost the country growth rate to achieve a
conservative target of one percent this year, from a contraction
of eight percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said the government would
introduce further measures to boost Thai exports and tackle
remaining problems in the financial and corporate sectors, two key
areas that are vital to the achievement of Thailand's economic
revival efforts.

constructive partnership oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
To advance friendship between China and India, two most

Party of India (Marxist) during a meeting here this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Egypt for Talks on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Thursday arrived in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in
the Sinai Peninsula for a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
the latest developments in the Middle East peace process, seeking
ways of breaking the stalemate in the peace-making efforts,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
last December when Israel suspended the Wye accord signed last
October after it carried out the first stage of the three-phased
withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who frequently visits Egypt to consult with Mubarak on
issues related to the peace process, will brief the Egyptian
leader on the outcome of his recent efforts to garner
international support for Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has announced that he would declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year interim self-rule
period stipulated by the Oslo accords expires.
</P>
<P>
He had visited a number of European countries and the United
States in recent weeks, trying to rally support for the
Palestinian plan and recognition for a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's efforts have yielded tangible results. The European
Union (EU) issued a statement a week ago saying that the
Palestinians have "unqualified right to self-determination,
including the option of a state," which it expressed readiness to
recognize "in due course."

<P>
PARIS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The engagement by France in NATO attacks against Yugoslavia
has triggered a dispute within the leftwing government. The French
Communist Party, which has three ministers in the government, are
increasing its protests against the policy of the prime minister
backing the military intervention.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has regarded the government in Belgrade as
the principal obstacle to any solution to the conflict in Kosovo.
Washington also no longer regards independence of Kosovo as a
taboo.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The debate on the participation by France in the NATO
operation against Yugoslavia has shaken the government of Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, as the government ministers from the
Communist Party expressed their concern about the NATO airstrikes
during a cabinet meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- After the failure of mediation efforts by Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeni Primakov, NATO has increased pressure on
Yugoslavia and intensified the war. French President Jacques
Chirac has regretted what he called ``absolute intransigence'' of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- The exodus of the Kosovo Albanians, the doubt about the
efficiency of the airstrikes and the failure of the Russian
mediation have relaunched the debate in France and the United
States on a ground intervention by NATO. Meanwhile, NATO is
hardening its offensive against Yugoslavia, while Washington has
urged an upgrading of the airstrikes into a ``phase 3.''

<HEADLINE> Light Industry Export Targeted to Grow 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry will try to
earn its targeted profits of 56 billion U.S. dollars in exports
this year or achieve a growth of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lingering Asian financial crisis and the global
economic slowdown, boosting exports in the sector will become
tougher this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Tao, deputy director of the State Administration of Light
Industry (SALI), said that China will adopt a series of measures
to encourage the export of profit-making products by upgrading
technology and improving quality.
</P>
<P>
He said that products such as leather, handicrafts, plastics,
hardware, household electric appliances and ceramics will be given
priority.
</P>
<P>
"The sector will undergo further restructuring to increase
technology and meet the demands of the ever-changing global market,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
China will take positive measures to encourage the booming
processing sector to set up factories and increase sales outlets
in other countries as an effective way to open up export channels.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a number of famous Chinese enterprises have
established footholds in foreign markets, for instance, the
Jiangsu-based Chun Lan Group has sold complete sets of equipment
for making air conditioners to Russia, and the Shanghai-based "
Hero Pen" company has established factories in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
An official with SALI said that the sector made progress in
promoting market diversification last year, pointing out that 80
percent of exports went to the United States, European and
Hongkong markets.
</P>
<P>
She also said that China will continue to boost exports to
these traditional markets this year, and at the same time, more
efforts will be made to tap new markets such as the Russian, East
European, Latin American and African markets.
</P>
<P>
The sector's export volume reached 54.9 billion U.S. dollars
last year, up 3.04 percent from 1997.

CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- British police officers have been stationed in the
Netherlands in preparation for the trial of two former Libyan
intelligence agents suspected of bombing a Pan Am jumbo jet over
the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The two are accused of planting the suitcase bomb that blew up
the jet on December 21, 1988, killing 270 people, mostly
Americans and Britons.
</P>
<P>
The trial could last several years, said legal experts in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian embassy in Belgrade, capital of Yugoslavia, is

</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhouria:

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Export Earnings to Drop: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is not expected to earn as
much from exports as it did last year because of reduced exports
in textile, sugar and cement and low copper sales.
</P>
<P>
A report on the first quarter of 1999 prepared by an economist
intelligence unit said Thursday that higher exports to Europe were
expected in horti and floricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Although Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi predicted a 15 percent
increase in non-traditional export earnings in 1999, total
earnings were likely to be lower, it predicted.
</P>
<P>
"Even if non-traditional export revenue does grow, total export
earnings in 1999 are unlikely to be much higher when copper export
earnings, which account for some 75 percent of the total, are
unlikely to increase much," the report says.
</P>
<P>
Prospects of increased exports in textile, sugar and cement to
central Africa would remain subdued because of continuing
political instability there.
</P>
<P>
Growth in imported expenditure was expected because of demands
of new investors in the copper mines and an anticipated increase
in imported agricultural equipment following the scrapping of
duty.
</P>
<P>
The increase is also attributed to an impending salary rises in
the civil service and the relative stability in the value of the
local currency kwacha.
</P>
<P>
"Although donor funding will boost invisible inflow into Zambia
in the form of current transfers this will be offset by increased
expenditure on imported services associated with new investment in
the country's copper mines," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also forecast that Zambia's current account deficit
would widen to 410 million U.S. dollars this year and narrow down
to 192 million dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report expects the exchange rate to stabilize with the
kwacha depreciating to 2,928 to one dollar at the end of 1999 and
3,210 to the dollar in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report describes the four percent growth announced by the
Finance Minister in the 1999 Budget as optimistic and over
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
Zambia should not expect an increase in copper production even
if the mines were sold as planned because actual production would
only take off between 2000 and 2001, it said.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Bangladeshi Workers Abroad May Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The demand for Bangladeshi workers
in foreign countries may decline in the coming years, producing an
unfavorable impact on the inward remittances by Bangladeshi
workers abroad.
</P>
<P>
A total of 267,667 Bangladeshi workers, both skilled and
unskilled, got employment in 15 countries last year, about 30
percent down from 381,077 employment in the previous year, The
Financial Express daily newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia, once the major employment destination for
Bangladeshi workers abroad, has lost its position due to an
economic recession there following a financial turmoil in the
region in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, once the largest provider of employment to
Bangladeshi citizens overseas, employed only 551 Bangladeshi
workers in 1998, a sharp decrease from 152,844 workers employed in
1997.
</P>
<P>
During the first two months this year, expatriate Bangladeshis
sent back only 260 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi workers abroad remitted about 1.59 billion dollars
in 1998, and about 1.53 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the highest amount of remittance was sent from
expatriate Bangladeshis in Saudi Arabia, followed by the Untied
Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Singapore.

will officially do away with the services of pre-shipment
inspections and will begin "Destination Inspection of Imports" as
from April 1.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Ahmed Mustapha, comptroller-general of the customs
service, told reporters in capital Abuja Wednesday that the
introduction of the new system was in line with the 1999 budget
speech by Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar, New
Nigerian paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said in the speech that the pre-shipment inspection of
imports into the country would be phased out with effect as from
April 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Mustapha said all the reforms were directed toward achieving
greater trade facilitation and revenue generation without
compromising accountability and transparency.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, he noted, decided to abolish the
pre-shipment inspection scheme introduced in 1976 as it found that
the scheme created more problems than the ones it was intended to
solve.
</P>
<P>
Destination inspection of imports would lead to "tremendous
rise in revenue collection" because in the past the government had
to pay huge amount of foreign currency for the services of the
inspectors outside the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mustapha stressed that the better part of the new scheme was
the preparedness of the Nigeria Customs Service to give quick
clearance within 48 hours which has been put in place.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stone Library Gets Donations from Outside China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The decision of China's cultural
relics authorities to put some 1,000-year-old Buddhist stone
tablets with inscriptions in their original caves has got a good
response from donors.
</P>
<P>
The Restoration Organizing Committee of Stone Scriptures at
Beijing's Yunju Temple today accepted 5.5 million yuan (662,000 U.
S. dollars) worth of donations.
</P>
<P>
Yunju Temple is in a suburban area of Beijing. It has 14,278
stone slabs carved with scriptures from the Sui Dynasty (581-618)
to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), 22,000 volumes of scriptures on
paper from the Ming, and 77,000 wooden blocks with scriptures from
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Buddhism came to China from India about 2,000 years ago. Both
scholars and common people regard the temple and its Buddhist
relics as Beijing's Dunhuang, a reference to the site of famous
grottoes in northwestern Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Preserving these stone scriptures is important to Buddhists,
scholars, and common people as well, according to Shan Jixiang,
vice-chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
China started uncovering the stone scriptures in 1956 in
commemoration of the 2,500th anniversary of the birth of Sakyamuni,
the founder of Buddhism. But, because of the type of stone and air
pollution over a long period of time, many of them are seriously
corroded.
</P>
<P>
Between the Sui and Tang (618-907) dynasties, Jing Wan, a
Buddhist monk, built a temple for the stone inscriptions to
preserve Buddhist classicals during the wars of the time.
</P>
<P>
The Yonghe Temple, another famous Buddhist site in downtown
Beijing, has put some stone slabs on exhibit for visitors.

<HEADLINE> NATO Confirms 3 U.S. Soldiers Seized by Yugoslav forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, April 1 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) spokesman Jamie Shea said here Thursday that
three US soldiers who went missing Tuesday afternoon had been
captured by Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed it in a statement, saying the capture was
indicated by some TV pictures this morning. But he gave no details
about the TV reports.
</P>
<P>
Shea said the three US soldiers serving under NATO Command as
part of the NATO-led force in the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia which is preparing for a peacekeeping mission went
missing "along the border between Yugoslavia and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".
</P>
<P>
The NATO spokesman stressed that all NATO forces in Macedonia
are there "in the context of a peacekeeping mission. They pose
absolutely no threat to Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said the NATO expects that any soldier that
happen to be captured by the Yugoslav armed forces "must be
treated in a humane way in accordance with international civilized
norms of Behavior."
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. Army soldiers on a reconnaissance mission on the
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border were missing Wednesday night after
being fired upon, the U.S. Pentagon officials said.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Declared Stateless by Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president Kenneth
Kaunda has been declared stateless by the Ndola High Court, media
reports here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his landmark judgement Wednesday, Judge Chalendo Sakala
ordered the citizenship Board of Zambia to quash the Zambian
nationality of Kaunda, who had been ruling the country since its
independence in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by current
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said the then acting Home Affairs Minister John
Mwanakatwe made a "serious error" in 1970 when he granted Kaunda
Zambian citizenship because at no time did Kaunda apply for
Zambian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
He said Kaunda, who was absent from court, ruled Zambia legally
as a Malawian only in the first term which ended in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was required by law to apply for Zambian citizenship a
year after Zambia's independence, Zambia Daily Mail said.
</P>
<P>
According to a letter read out in court, Mwanakatwe granted
Kaunda citizenship because the former president was unaware of
his nationality status.
</P>
<P>
The judgement means Kaunda, who was born of Malawian parents,
is neither a Zambia nor a Malawian.
</P>
<P>
After the judgement, Kaunda's lawyers Patrick mvunga and
Mwangala Zaloumis appealed to the Supreme Court for a stay of
execution for the order to quash Kaunda's Zambian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Sakala granted the stay.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's lawyers told the press after the ruling that the
judgement will have a telling effect on the nation.
</P>
<P>
Former Legal Affairs Minister Remmy Mushota and
ex-parliamentarian Patrick Katyoke presented their petition in
1997 for having Kaunda declared a stateless citizen, arguing that
Kaunda ruled the country fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was barred from running for the country's presidency in
the elections held in 1996, when a constitutional amendment was
adopted under which foreign nationals and those with foreign
parentage are prohibited from contesting the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has vowed to contest the post in the next elections in
2001.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Reduce Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has taken measures to
force factories to adopt cleaner technology over the next two
years and restrict vehicles entering Bangkok's major roads, senior
Thai officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rachada Singalavanija, deputy director-general of the Industry
Ministry's Department of Industrial Works, said the new
enforcement was aimed at ensuring minimum emission and waste
generating by local factories and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Incentives would be employed to encourage local firms to reduce
pollution, or they would be forced to pay for the pollution they
create, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The new measures, which would be contained in amendments to the
1992 Industrial Work Act, include the introduction of an emission
charge to be imposed based on the amount of pollution or waste
generated, and a pollution management fee to be imposed on
factories that fail to meet the legal requirement, Rachada said.
</P>
<P>
The amendments, which are in line with objectives of Thailand's
Eighth National Economic and Social Development Plan, were
expected to take effect by 2002, the last year of the five-year
national plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA)
claimed its success in an initial effort to reduce air pollution
in metropolitan areas by imposing a zoning-restriction program,
banning vehicles from entering three main roads -- Silom,
Rajprarop and Paholyothin -- in certain times.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that the amount of air pollution on
Rajprorop Road decreased to 80-100 micrograms/cubic meter from 242
micrograms/cubic meter before the campaign; on Silom Road to 50-90
micrograms/cubic meter, from 195; and on Paholyothin Road to 65-75
micrograms/cubic meter, from 395, BMA's Deputy City Clerk Wanchart
Supajaturat said.
</P>
<P>
According to the international standard, the safe amount of air
pollution should not exceed 120 micrograms/cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
The BMA would not issue legal measures to enforce the zoning
restriction due to good cooperation from the public and the
program would not be extended to other roads because no other
areas were found to have air pollution exceeding the standard
level, said Wanchart.

</P>
<P>
Qian made this remark during a meeting with Hans-Ulrich Klose,
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the German Parliament,

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Stresses Governing of Macao According to Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Qian Qichen, vice-premier of the
State Council, stressed here today that the long-term stability
and sound development of Macao can be achieved only through the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum marking the sixth anniversary of the
promulgation of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR), Qian pointed out that the Basic Law is the
essential guideline for handling all matters related to the
transition and noted it will serve as a basis for drawing up each
principle and policy for the future MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Adopted on March 31, 1993 at the first session of the Eighth
National People's Congress, the Basic Law was drawn up after four
years' extensive study and after soliciting the opinions of people
from all walks of life in mainland areas of China and in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Every year since relevant central departments have marked the
anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law. This year's
forum is the last before the return of Macao to the motherland on
December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the Basic Law is the constitutional law of the
future MSAR and is essential for the future of the region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, a comprehensive study and understanding of
the Law is necessary, especially as it will go into effect in
eight months.
</P>
<P>
The Law must be publicized among Macao residents and mainland
people, he noted, adding that this must be in line with the
preparations for the MSAR.

<HEADLINE> Thirsty Tanzania Wastes Nearly Half of Processed Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Though many of its residents
have no access to water, Tanzania is losing 72 million shillings
(about 104,347.8 U. S. dollars) daily due to illegal water tapping
and leakage from dilapidated pipelines in its Urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The loss equals to about half of the 523,000 cubic meters of
portable water generated throughout the country in a day, The
African newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a report by Professor Damas Mashauri of the Dar es
Salaam University as saying that this loss of revenue was the main
cause of inefficiency in water supply in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mashauri made the remarks Wednesday at a roundtable discussion
here on water shortage that was attended by industrialists, the
World Bank officials, the business community and scholars.
</P>
<P>
The attendants called for appropriate pricing that matches the
quality and quantity of water supplied in a bid to discard the
notion that water is a free natural resource and freely supplied.
</P>
<P>
The forum also blamed the Dar es Salaam Water and Sanitation
Authority and the Ministry of Water for poor management, urging
immediate privatization of the water supply authorities.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank representative in the country, Ronald Brigish,
said his office is working with the Tanzanian government to
identify a private operator to run water service provision on
tariff basis in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Brigish said, however, it is hard at the moment to locate a
wholesale operator due to the water authority's huge debts and
outdated equipment installations.
</P>
<P>
"Even with the new private operator it will take another five
to six years to establish smooth water supply system in the city,"
the official added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accused of Harming Yugoslav Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav ambassador to Ankara,
Darko Tanascovic, has accused Turkey of harming Yugoslavia's
territorial integrity and sovereignty by joining in NATO military
actions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Daily News published Thursday,
Tanascovic said that by taking part in NATO military operations
against Yugoslavia, it was practically working against
Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
This was contradictory to Turkey's repeatedly expressed support
for Yugoslavia's territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey might believe that granting the status of a
third autonomous republic to Kosovo within Yugoslavia's
territorial integrity could be a solution to the problem, but such
a solution could not work because it would not stop the
independent ambitions of the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador called on Turkey to re-evaluate its
participation in NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia, which
entered their eighth day Thursday and contributed in part to the
crisis now unfolding in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Turkey and Yugoslavia could be
repaired if Ankara is to change its position, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Tanascovic also accused the Untied States and Britain of being
the leaders of a campaign aimed at dividing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports of mass massacres of Kosovo civilians by
Serbian forces, saying that the reports were the product of a
well-organized propaganda machine aiming to justify the NATO air
strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a member state of NATO, supports the military
alliance's bombings against Yugoslavia to pressure President
Slobedan Milosevic into allowing NATO forces into Kosovo to police
a peace deal that would give broad autonomy to ethnic Albanians
who make up 90 percent of the population there.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 Turkish warplanes stationed in the NATO bases in
Italy, have joined the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> UAE Expects Increase in GDP in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirate (UAE)
expects its gross domestic product (GDP) to increase this year
despite the impact of depressed oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues represent more than 70 percent of the UAE income,
therefore it cannot avoid the impact of the oil prices fall, the
Khaleej Times daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the expected improvement in oil prices, the
UAE's GDP is expected to increase from 170 billion dirhams (about
46.5 billion U.S. dollars) to 176 billion dirhams (about 48.1
billion dollars) in 1999, the paper quoted UAE Minister of
Planning Shaikh Humaid bin Ahmed Al Mualla as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Arab oil ministers recently announced a total oil output
cut of over 900,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Al Mualla said that the UAE's exports of oil products
witnessed a sharp decline from 24 billion dirhams (about 6.6
billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 8.4 billion dirhams (about 2.3
billion U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said the GDP had a marginal decline to 170 billion dirhams
(about 46.5 billion dollars) in 1998 from 180 billion dirhams
(about 49.2 billion dollars) in 1996 as oil prices fell by 37
percent during this period.
</P>
<P>
He said consistent attempts are now being made to develop
non-oil revenues, and "we promise an accelerated program of
restructuring."
</P>
<P>
The measures being taken involve slashing government
expenditure and increasing government service fees.
</P>
<P>
"We have adopted certain economic and financial policies to
cope with low crude oil prices and weak demand for petroleum
products," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the UAE economic outlook seems to be very positive.
</P>
<P>
"A clear indication of that is the increase in the final
consumption figures from 112.3 billion dirhams (about 30.7
billion dollars) in 1996 to 114.3 billion dirhams (about 31.2
billion dollars) in 1997 and 119.3 billion dirhams (about 32.6
billion dollars) in 1998," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lake Polluters Face 30-Day Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Serious polluters around the
Dianchi Lake in southwest China's Yunnan province face compulsory
shutdown of their businesses if they fail to meet the tight
restrictions imposed to transform the lake in time for the opening
of the World Horticulture Exposition which starts early May.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say there are 253 such organizations allowing
outfalls of serious pollution into China's sixth largest
freshwater lake and they have only until May 1st to comply with
the stricter rules.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities have insisted businesses stop polluting the
lake, which covers an area of 307 square kilometers, before the
expo, according to an official from the State Environmental
Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
So far, among the 253 enterprises listed as major polluters in
the area, 150 have passed inspections by environmental protection
agencies, 50 have introduced pollution control systems and another
50 are awaiting inspection, said the official.
</P>
<P>
However, three enterprises have not even started to take any
pollution control action yet and are being closely watched, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Now, from today to May 5, a monitoring center in Kunming, the
provincial capital, will receive and deal with reports from the
public about the pollution situation.
</P>
<P>
The famous lake, located on a high plateau, plays a key role in
balancing the ecological environment in Kunming but has been
seriously polluted by industrial and urban waste water.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese government listed Dianchi Lake as one of
the key projects to be tackled in the "three rivers and three
lakes" project, which also covers Liaohe, Huaihe and Haihe rivers
and Taihu, Chaohu and Dianchi lakes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has spent more than three billion yuan (
about 400 million US dollars) to clean up the lake, including
loans of 150 million US dollars from the World Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission will give
140 million shillings (about 2.2 million U.S. dollars) to the
Kenya Tourism Board as part of its effort to revamp the tourist
sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lutz Salzman, a delegate of the European Commission mission in
Kenyan, announced Wednesday in Mombasa, a coastal city in southern
Kenya, that his mission would establish an endowment fund for
Kenya Tourism Board with a capital investment of 980 million
shillings.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the tourism sector in Kenya which is facing a
major crisis due to long-and short-term structural problems,
needed support from all stake-holders, saying that the annual
earnings from the capital fund would be used to carry out
marketing campaigns for identifying the marketing strategy and
plan.
</P>
<P>
Salzman said the European Commission would also assist the
tourism sector to introduce cruise tourism, which might
significantly contribute to the recovery of the industry.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the success of the cruise tourism would depend
on safe and efficient bathing facilities at the Kenya Ports
Authority coupled by good customer service.
</P>
<P>
Eliud Mahihu, chairman of the Kenya Tourism Board, hailed the
establishment of the capital as supplementary funds to his tourist
board, which had managed to implement marketing campaigns in
Europe with advertisements placed in 46 consumer magazines.

<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- New automobile insurance
regulations issued by China's Insurance Regulatory Commission (
CIRC) came into force today in Beijing and Shenzhen in Guangdong
Province, partly in a bid to stamp out forged documents.
</P>
<P>
The new rules set the national standards for premiums and
detail the contents of additional insurance cover which will be
observed by all insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with international practice, each driver of a car
has to be insured and policies will be issued under the
supervision of the CIRC. They are forgery-proof and easily
identified with bar-codes and using the English language in
certain sections.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Huaili, deputy general manager of the People's Insurance
Company of China Beijing Branch, said the new regulations will
prevent the use of forged insurance documents.
</P>
<P>
The branch has launched initiatives such as making phone calls
and door to door inquiries to ensure that car owners have
correctly completed insurance application forms and have
officially approved policies.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of the year, the branch's revenue
from auto insurance premiums went up by 36 percent from the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> Drought-Stricken Zhuhai Ensures Water Supply to Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Zhuhai in south
China's Guangdong Province faces mounting water shortages, and yet
it tries its best to ensure water supply to nearby Macao,
according to the city's Mayor Huang Longyun.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing dry spell in most of Guangdong province has now
forced officials to ration water between 17:00 and 22:00 each day
when normal supplies are available. The amount is reduced outside
of that core time.
</P>
<P>
Rain has not fallen for more than 200 days and the area only
has a total reservoir water storage of 13.2 million cu.m, which is
only topped up each day by river sources with about 2.0 million cu.
m
</P>
<P>
The Zhuhai Urban Water Supply Company revealed that the city
has 400,000 tons of water for its own daily use and pipes a
further 150,000 tons daily to Macao. An official said that the
company's staff have now been mobilized to help keep sea water
from pouring into the depleted reservoirs that supply water to
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Huang has pledged that the city will continue to shoulder the
responsibility of guaranteeing the amount and the quality of water
supply to Macao, which is the main reason it has restricted
supplies to its own citizens while the shortage continues.
</P>
<P>
Historically, Macao has always been short of fresh water as
there are no rivers feeding its two small reservoirs, which only
hold about one million cu.m at most.

BEIRUT, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and three of his ministers could face judicial
investigations over alleged public funds squandering, the Daily

rampant official corruptions, was elected to the presidency last
October.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Securities Law Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China will hold a nationwide
contest on Securities Law as part of effort to help Chinese
citizens study and understand the law which can be used to protect
their legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Securities reported that the contest will be
sponsored by the General Office of the National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, the NPC Financial and Economic
Committees, the Commission of Legislative Affairs of the NPC
Standing Committee, China Securities Regulatory Commission, China
Securities and China Central TV (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
The test questions will be carried by China Securities and
Shanghai Securities News on April 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Law, the first of its kind, was adopted by the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, China's highest
legislative body, on December 29 last year and will take effect on
July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 12-chapter, 214-article law governs all aspects of the
securities industry ranging from securities trading to purchases
of listed companies, to stock exchanges and securities companies,
as well as registration, account settlement and trading services
agencies, self-disciplinary associations, government regulatory
bodies and liabilities for violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
The law prohibits foreign capital from entering the nation's A-
share market.
</P>
<P>
It provides for a two-tier system for the securities industry
and requires securities companies to separate client and internal
accounts. Securities companies are separated from banking, trust
and insurance operations according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers formulated the law in line with lessons learned from
the Asian financial and stock market crisis. The law contains
detailed stipulations for preventing market risk and standardizing
market operations to protect the interests of investors.
</P>
<P>
Some 38 million Chinese citizens have invested in the nation's
securities market. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have
827 listed companies with total assets over 2,000 billion yuan.
Related companies account for 23.4 percent of the nation total GDP.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Develop Resin Automobile Molds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed resin automobile molds which will help solve problems
related to time required and high production costs.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say the development will facilitate the
development of types of automobiles. They also expect the
technology to improve the appearance of domestically manufactured
models.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China's mold production technology has lagged
behind the overall development of the automobile industry has
forced many Chinese automakers to depend heavily on imported molds.
</P>
<P>
Technicians with the Mold Center at the First Automobile Works
(FAW) Group and researchers from Jilin University have developed
12 resin molds for Red Flag limousines. The use of resins in
automobile molds has reduced production time by 50 percent and
costs by as much as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experiments with the molds have yielded positive results. The
Technology Committee under the National Mold Industry Association
plans to recommend the molds for classification as new national
products.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
prohibited night fishing in Lake Victoria, in a bid to stamp out
fishing with poison under cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which took effect immediately, was announced
Wednesday by Kenyan Natural Resources Minister Francis Lotodo, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
 Lotoda sounded out a warning that any fisherman caught using
poisonous chemicals to harvest fish would be dealt with
ruthlessly.

<P>
The minister also said the government would provide motor-boats
to the relevant departments to enable them to patrol the lake
more effectively.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the residents living around the lake, the
world's second largest fresh water lake, to cooperate with police
and provincial administration officers in cracking down on fishing
with poison.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government issued a health alert Tuesday over fish
poisoning in Lake Victoria, which borders Kenya, Tanzania and

<HEADLINE> NZ Changing Focus from Building Ships to Conversions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand shipbuilding
industry is changing its focus from building new ships to luxury
refits and conversions.
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper Thursday quoted Northland Port
Chief Executive Vern Dark as saying there is a definite trend
toward luxury conversions and the shipbuilding industry in
Whangarei, the most important shipbuilding base in New Zealand,
is well placed to capitalize on that.
</P>
<P>
"Conversion work is definitely a trend at the moment," Dark
said, adding "We'll be seeing more and more older vessels
transformed into luxury passenger yachts."
</P>
<P>
Whangarei's shipbuilding industry has been hard hit in recent
years due to the economic conditions in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, an emphasis on diversification and specialization to
counter the changing economic environment is beginning to pay off,
Dark said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has the skills to take on specialist projects at
significantly lower cost than shipyards in the United States or
Europe, the Dominion quoted NZ Marine Industrial Project
Management principal Warwick Stevenson as saying.

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Condemn Air-Raids Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Evening Post, a
Wellington-based newspaper, Thursday carried several letters from
its readers, strongly condemning NATO's military aggression
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's attacks on Yugoslavia, using the disproportionate force
of bombers and missiles, constitute unilateral aggression against
a sovereign country, without authorization of the United Nations
Security Council," A. Preskar said in his letter to the editor.
</P>
<P>
The biggest military force on Earth is once again using the
Balkan region for testing its "new weaponry against a small and
helpless, sanctions-struck country", he added.
</P>
<P>
Preskar strongly accuses NATO of targeting water filtering
plants, schools, car factories, housing units and cultural
heritage sites protected by UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has no right to play God. The attacks on a sovereign
country must be stopped. If the world allows this to go on, who
will be the next in NATO's hunger for funds and power?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Robert Moyich said in his letter that NATO's airstrikes against
 Yugoslavia is an "illegitimate act of aggression against a
sovereign country".
</P>
<P>
He condemned NATO for using Yugoslavia as a training ground for
 testing its new weaponry.
</P>
<P>
J. Sanders said in his letter that the bombing of Serbia by the
 United States and Britain is a "crime".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the air-raids by NATO "will solve nothing, but
only sweep the problems under the carpet".
</P>
<P>
Steven Sedley asked in his letter that how can anyone think
that destroying cities, killing people from the air, will resolve
conflicts?

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's key institutions including
the Judiciary and the Attorney-General's Chamber will be the
targets of the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Authority (KACA), according
to the authority's new director Justice Aaron Ringera.
</P>
<P>
Ringera, who was appointed last week by President Daniel arap
Moi, said Wednesday that he would investigate, arrest and
expeditiously prosecute all cases of corruption, with high level
deals receiving priority.

in courts for recovery of public funds which were embezzled or
stolen.

<P>
According to Thursday's Daily Nation newspaper, the anti-graft
director would also target the investigative and prosecution arms

Ringera had personal assurance of President Moi of full support
in efforts to fight crimes and called on Kenyans to shed their

struggle against corruption as a noble and winnable war.
</P>
<P>
The chief also pledged that he would make recommendations,
including adoption of legally enforceable code of conduct, to
enhance management, accountability, transparency and integrity in
the private and public sectors.

BELGRADE, April 1 (Xinhua)-- The Albanian leader of the

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting regulations on a

</P>
<P>
Also under consideration are selection procedures in which the

<HEADLINE> Japan to Develop Spy Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan will develop four information-
gathering satellites on its own and the government plans to launch
by fiscal 2002 to boost the country's reconnaissance capability, a
senior government official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is beneficial to basically develop them by
using our own technology," Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Japan's technology is sophisticated enough to develop the
satellites, and maintenance would be easier if they were developed
domestically, the top Japanese government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had said
that Japan should import satellites to save time.
</P>
<P>
Nonaka said the government established a new panel Thursday to
discuss the basic policies on the introduction of the satellites
and the ways to establish organizations and provide facilities
needed to maintain them.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Japanese government, taking advantage of the
firing of a rocket by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) last August, approved the plan to launch the satellites by
fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
Part of the rocket, which Japan claimed as a ballistic missile,
flew over Japan's territory before plunging into the Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- This is the third in a question
and answer series on the ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
 (3) What are the Chinese Government's basic policies
concerning the Macao question?
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government's basic policies concerning the Macao
question are fully spelled out in the Government of the People's
Republic of China Elaboration on Basic Policies Regarding Macao,
an annex to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on Macao.
</P>
<P>
The policies contain the following stipulations:
</P>
<P>
The MSAR of the People's Republic of China will be established
upon China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Macao;
</P>
<P>
The MSAR will be directly under the authority of the Central
People's Government and will enjoy a high degree of autonomy,
except in foreign and defense affairs;
</P>
<P>
The government and legislature of the MSAR will be composed of
local residents. Macao's current social and economic systems, as
well as the existing way of life, will remain unchanged;
</P>
<P>
Existing laws will remain basically unchanged. The MSAR will
have the authority to formulate policies in the fields of culture,
science and technology, education and protect cultural relics in
accordance with law;
</P>
<P>
The MSAR will have the authority to maintain and develop
economic and cultural relations and in this context conclude
agreements with states, regions and relevant international
organizations under the name "Macao, China";
</P>
<P>
The MSAR will remain a free port and a separate customs
territory in order to develop economic activities. It will
maintain independent finances and be responsible for maintaining
internal public order; and
</P>
<P>
Apart from displaying the national flag and national emblem of
the People's Republic of China, the MSAR may also display its own
regional flag and emblem.
</P>
<P>
The annex clearly stipulates that the policies of the Chinese
Government on Macao will be contained in the Basic Law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region adopted by the National
People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and these
policies will remain unchanged for 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- This is the fourth in a question
and answer series on the ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR):
</P>
<P>
4. Why was it necessary to enact the Basic Law of the Macao SAR?
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Macao Question is
a bilateral international agreement. The Joint Declaration is
binding on both the Chinese and Portuguese governments, but is not
a domestic Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
The basic policies on Macao outlined by the Chinese Government
in the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and Annex I are general
and abstract in nature.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the Chinese Government stated in both the Sino-
Portuguese Joint Declaration and its Annex I that the basic
policies of the People's Republic of China on Macao will be
stipulated in the Basic Law by the National People's Congress and
will remain unchanged for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese Government is committed to enacting the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The purpose is to codify and institutionalize the policy of "
one country, two systems" affirmed in the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration and Annex I in the form of domestic law. So doing will
fully guarantee the implementation of China's basic policies
regarding Macao with the coercive power of law. In this sense, the
policy of "one country, two systems" provides the policy basis for
enacting the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress amended China's Constitution
and added Article 31 in December 1984. The article clearly
stipulates: "The State will establish special administrative

<HEADLINE> Sakyamuni's Sariras Displayed in Beijing's Downtown Lamasery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Relics and remains of Sakyamuni
Buddha and two sariras went on display in the Yonghe Lamasery in
Beijing today as well as ancient genuine stone tablets bearing
religious scriptures.
</P>
<P>
A grand religious ceremony was held to mark the launch of the
exhibition at the Lamasery, China's biggest Tibetan monastery.
</P>
<P>
The two sariras were first found in a cave of the Yunju Temple,
Beijing's suburban Fangshan District, in 1981 and were stored in
the suburban temple for most of the time.
</P>
<P>
Yunju Temple, a well-known Buddhist shrine in north China and
built in 631 during Tang Dynasty (618-907), also houses more than
14,000 pieces of inscribed religious stone tablets that were
inscribed by Chinese monks.
</P>
<P>
Also on display are a number of genuine stone tablets bearing
Khitan Tripitaka -- translated teachings of the Buddha and
translated treatises, mainly commentaries by eminent monks -- as
well as documents, pictures and rubbings.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last until April 15.
</P>
<P>
The Yonghe Lamasery, covering a floor space of 66,000 square
meters, now receives more than 1.3 million visitors and followers
of the Buddhist faith each year. It was established in 1694 and
was designated as a place of worship in 1744 for all Tibetan monks
by the then emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Modernize Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Attorney-General Amos Wako has
published a draft bill designed to replace the current
intellectual property rights law, as an effort to bring Kenya
into conformity with international instruments.
</P>
<P>
The Bill to be known as the Industrial Property Bill is set to
repeal and replace the existing Industrial Property Act,
according to Thursday's East African Standard newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Wako said Wednesday the bill will replace the statute which
deals with registration and protection of intellectual property
rights in patents, utility models, industrial designs and
rationalization models.
</P>
<P>
The need for amending the current law arose from recent
developments in intellectual property law on the international
scene, including a number of treaties and agreements to which
Kenya is a party, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is a signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection
of Industrial Property. But a number of provisions of the present
law relating to the expiry of patents, proceedings for their
forfeiture and grant of compulsory licenses are inconsistent with
the Paris Convention, Wako added.

<HEADLINE> "Atomic Bomb Town" Woos Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Haibei Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture, where China's first atomic and hydrogen bombs were
born, had attracted investment of over two billion U.S. dollars by
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture in northwestern Qinghai Province has set up 20
Sino-foreign and solely foreign-funded enterprises and received
300 domestic and overseas businessmen ever since it was
transferred from military control to local government
administration in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the prefecture received foreign investment totaling
250 million dollars. In a bid to woo more funds, efforts have been
made to build roads, power supplies, telecommunications, transport
and other infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local government has also tried to develop
Xihaizhen, the seat of the prefectural government and also a
retired nuclear weapons development and production base, into a
tourist scenic spot.
</P>
<P>
After years of development, Xihaizhen has been transformed from
a small barren town into a beautiful garden city.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, it has received nearly 200,000 visitors from home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that an exhibition hall will be built to feature
the construction and development of the town, as well as models of
atomic and hydrogen bombs and biographies of some experts in the
field.

<HEADLINE> Snow, Rain Ease Drought In Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The snow and rain that hit the
northern part of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region March 29-31 have helped ease the drought problems of the
warm temperatures of last month.
</P>
<P>
By 8:00 a.m. on March 31, the city of Shihezi had had 17.5 mm
of rain and Urumqi, the regional capital, had had 13.7 mm of snow,
according to the Xinjiang Meteorology Center.
</P>
<P>
The snow and rain are good for the winter wheat and spring
planting, but the low temperatures brought in by the cold front
have made it difficult for livestock in the northern part of the
region to move to other grassy areas.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predict that the temperatures will not change
significantly in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Province Offers Thermotherapy for Tumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A thermotherapy center for
treating tumors recently opened in northeast China's Jilin
province.
</P>
<P>
A tumor treatment therapy system developed by the center has
passed an expert appraisal.
</P>
<P>
Thermotherapy, a widely recognized "safe treatment" for
malignant tumor, is free of side effects generally associated with
other forms of treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy and
radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The treatment involves heating body tissue and maintaining body
temperatures within a specified range in order to kill cancer
cells without harming healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
Clinical tests have achieved noticeable results for 94 percent
of tumor cases after only one or two courses of treatment,
according to researchers at the center.
</P>
<P>
"Thermotherapy not only contains the expansion of tumor cells
in the human body, but also reduces pain and improves both
appetite and sleep, in addition to helping patients regain their
health patients," said Center Director Song Liansheng.
</P>
<P>
Thermotherapy was initiated in the 1960s in a number of
developed countries, including the United States, Japan and some
European nations. China introduced the therapy in 1978.
Thermotherapy is currently offered by a limited number of Chinese
hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Firm to Close Plant in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese subsidiary company will
shut down its 11-year-old plant here on April 30 as the
Philippines remains helpless in stopping the exodus of
multi-national corporations.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here Thursday, Uniden
Philippines Inc.'s plant in Manila, the biggest producer of
telecommunication gadgets, will be closed due to "low demand for
its products, aggravated partly by the financial crisis affecting
Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
Uniden will transfer 80 percent of its equipment at the plant
to its affiliate in Laguna, the central Philippines, while the
rest will be shipped to China, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that there is no room for the 2,800
employees to be left by the closure in its Laguna plant, which is
operating at half of its capacity.
</P>
<P>
The laguna plant produces cordless phones with 3,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Uniden joins a growing list of top multinational corporations
which have decided to relocate their manufacturing operations to
other countries. These corporations include Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
Colgate-Palmolive, Warner Lambert, Philips Lighting and Abbot
Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
They are leaving the Philippines because other countries offer
lower labor cost, better infrastructure and high level of
technological development.
</P>
<P>
Philippine government officials met Uniden officials last week
to convince the Japanese subsidiary company to change its mind.
But Uniden remained firm in its decision because revenues have
fallen behind expenses.

Nick Anderson, Magic's top scorer, who averages 16.5 points per
game, suffered a left hamstring midway through the second quarter
and did not return without a single point.
</P>

However, the Magic (22-10), who had won four of their last five
games, still leads the Atlantic Division by one game over Miami (
19-9).
</P>
<P>
In Boston, the Detroit Pistons continued their winning streak
to five games by beating the Celtics 87-72.
</P>
<P>

talk a lot."
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, Tom Gugliotta had 10 of his 21 points in the third
quarter and grabbed 11 rebounds as the Suns romped the Golden
State Warriors 93-78.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta hit 5-of-6 shots in the third period, including a tip-
in that triggered a 22-6 burst to close the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Suns entered this contest with two straight home losses and
six in their last eight games at America West Arena while the
Warriors have won just twice in their last 27 games to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
Rookie Antawn Jamison had 16 points and 15 rebounds for Golden
State, which fell 1 1/2 games back of Phoenix for the eighth and
final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Warriors were
coming off Tuesday's stunning 93-90 win over the league-leading
Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, Damon Stoudamire scored 21 points as the Trail
Blazers beat the Chris Webber-absent Sacramento Kings 100-86

<HEADLINE> France to Grant $30M to East African States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- France will grant some 30
million U.S. dollars for development activities in the three East
African Cooperation (EAC) countries and has also committed one
million U.S. dollars to each of the states for setting up project
preparation funds.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding on this has been signed in the
Arusha town, north Tanzania, where the EAC secretariat is based,
press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony Wednesday, Antoine Pouillieute,
managing director of the French Development Agency (AFD), said 54
million dollars will be injected into the private sector in Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda, the members of East African Cooperation,
which was founded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Pouillieute expressed France's desire to see vibrant regional
cooperation, assuring that Paris will further strengthen economic
ties with east of African countries.
</P>
<P>
The three countries plan to sign a treaty on July 1 this year
to revive the defunct East African Community which collapsed in
1977 due to divergent economic and political policies.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at establishing a single market and
investment area competitive in the global market, said Francis
Muthaura, executive secretary of the Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between EAC and AFD will focus on the development
of economic infrastructures, including cooperation in development
of telecommunications, energy, water resources, rail, roads and
civil aviation, Lake Victoria, rural and pastoral areas, national
parks and border towns, tourism, natural resources and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
AFD was established in 1941 as the key executing agency of
French overseas development assistance. In 1997, the agency
extended its operations in east Africa by opening a regional
representative office in Nairobi responsible for development
projects in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Republic of Korea Promotes Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A move by the government of the
Republic of Korea (ROK) to encourage foreign investments by small-
to medium-sized enterprises is expected to sharply increase
related investments in China.
</P>
<P>
A leading ROK official in charge of related businesses recently
visited northeast China's Liaoning province and noted increased
investments in China will help his nation overcome current
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"China offers vast market potential which facilitates expanded
production and will create good opportunities for ROK businesses
suffering from the depressed domestic economy and overproduction,
according to the official from the Presidential Commission on
Small and Medium Business.
</P>
<P>
ROK-based Trigem Computer Inc. will launch its largest PC
manufacturing base in China this October. The new venture will
have an annual production capacity of 1.2 million PCs.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to attract an additional 30-odd small-
to medium-sized ROK enterprise producing compatible products and
will in turn facilitate the development of a large computer
industrial park in Shenyang, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The official added that small- to medium-sized enterprises
represent a major driving force in the ROK economy, with the vast
majority of over 120,000 related enterprises planning to expanding
overseas.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Stop the Bombing, Stop the War" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His paper-turned placard reads "NATO: Stop Your Aggression!" It
looks just like a small tree in the colorful forest of placards,
which bear varying slogans denouncing the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Yugoslav people took to the street in Manhattan,
downtown area of the New York City, to protest against the U.S.-
led NATO attacks on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent member
of the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
Two Serb girls painted their faces, arms and shirts in red,
imitating the image of bloodshed in the wake of the NATO attacks
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Clad in a black robe, Rev. Demetrios Cantos, Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of America, told Xinhua, "It's terrible for NATO to
bomb my country, the United States must stop the bombing and
return to peaceful negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Wearing the image of a shooting target on the back, protesters
intend to tell the U.S.-led NATO, "Come, and bomb us, we are not
afraid!"
</P>
<P>
"The people of Yugoslavia are not going to be defeated by the
bombing, the people of Yugoslavia are all behind the government in
Belgrade more than ever they have before," said Barry Lituchy, one
of the organizers of the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday demonstration, called by the International Action
Center, followed a huge March 27 protest that drew 7,000 people
who marched through Manhattan chanting "Stop the bombing, stop the
war" and "Kosovo is Vietnam."
</P>
<P>
On March 27, there were also demonstrations of 2,000 in Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Washington D.C. Earlier, protesters
also took to the street in Sacramento, Boston, Chicago, Columbus,
Teledo, Seattle, Madison and other cities across the United States.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
started air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24, a move seen as
a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also accused U.S. media, such as the New York
Times, one of widely-circulated newspapers in America, of lying in
the coverage of the conflict of Kosovo, a Serbian province in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, have been fighting with Serbs for
independence.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill "Clinton portrays this bombing as a
humanitarian gesture on behalf of the Albanian national minority
that resides in Kosovo, a region of Yugoslavia. That is a lie,"
said Lituchy, who has been teaching Modern European History for
almost 10 years at the City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
"It is war propaganda designed to justify and conceal the real
objective of this war of aggression," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The real U.S./NATO goal is to break up Yugoslavia into ever-
smaller pieces and bomb its people into submission," Petrovich
said, "The Balkans is a key strategic region, a crossroads between
Western Europe and the oil-rich Middle East and Caspian basin."
</P>
<P>
"We are here to tell the American people that the war is not
justifiable and the U.S. government is wasting their money to
create bloodshed in our country," Lituchy said.
</P>
<P>
As the Yugoslav people demonstrated in New York, NATO was
intensifying its air assault on Yugoslavia, pounding targets on
Wednesday near a major Kosovo city. Eight people, including
civilians, were killed on the same day by NATO bombing in Belgrade
area.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to demonstrate every week until the bombing
ends," Lituchy said. "Serbian people have a long history of
fighting foreign aggression, fighting colonialism, fighting
imperialism, and they are not going to back down."

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Privatize 51 State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
privatize 51 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in 1999, a report in
The Independent daily newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at an inter-ministerial meeting early
this month, which also decided to sell the state's shares in 19
other enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 51 enterprises, nine are under the Bangladesh Textile
Mills Corporation, seven under the Bangladesh Jute Mills
Corporation, five under the Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries
Corporation, six under the Bangladesh Steel and Engineering
Corporation and four under the Bangladesh Chemical Industries
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Kazi Zafrullah, chairman of the Privatization Board, proposed
names of 60 enterprises for privatization, but the meeting
finalized a list of only 51 enterprises for transfer to the
private sector, the report said. The board was set up in 1993 to
privatize the loss-making SOEs.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 SOEs in the country, with the total value
of output accounting for about 6 percent of the gross domestic
product and incurring a loss of about 568 million U.S. dollars
every year.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Board has handed over a total of 17 SOEs to
private entrepreneurs since 1993, with 12 of them up to 1996 and
five in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The board, which issued letters of intent for handing over five
projects in 1997 and four enterprises in 1998, failed to hand over
any SOEs last year though 87 enterprises were enlisted, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Zafrullah as saying on Wednesday that the
process of privatization of the SOEs was "very lengthy and
complicated" and that the performance of the board should be
judged on the basis of the number of enterprises privatized.
</P>
<P>
He said the board has succeeded in creating public opinion in
favor of privatization and has established good relations with
labor in respect of privatization.
</P>
<P>
New laws to expedite privatization in the country are to come
into force soon and new legislation would facilitate foreign
investors to buy the SOEs, he added.

<HEADLINE> Prices of Hides, Skin Low in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The prices of hides and skin in
Bangladesh after the Eid-ul-Azha, one of the country's major
religious festivals which falls on late March, are lower this year
than last year.
</P>
<P>
Trading at Postagola in the old part of the capital city, the
country's largest wholesale market for raw leather, was "dull"
this year, because of a smaller number of buyers, a tight loan
disbursement policy of banks and lower demand for finished leather
in the international market, The Daily Star newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The price of an average size of cow hide is 600 to 800 taka
(about 12.5-16.7 U.S. dollars) this year against 800 to 1,000 taka
(about 16.7-20.8 dollars) last year, and the average price of a
goat skin is 110 to 135 taka (about 2.3-2.8 dollars) against last
year's 125 to 150 taka (about 2.6-3.1 dollars), Alhaj Azizur
Rahman, president of the Bangladesh Hides and Skin Merchants
Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the prices declined as most of the tanneries are
not buying leather due to less cash flow and a ban on export of
wet blue leather.
</P>
<P>
They added that if the prices go down further, huge quantities
of raw leather would be smuggled to India, where traders would buy
raw leather at higher prices and could export half-processed wet
blue leather.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of the total procurement of leather in the
country is made during the Eid festival.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said the market would pick up if the government withdrew
the ban on export of wet blue leather and banks increased loans to
tanners and leather traders. The four nationalized commercial
banks disbursed around 1.75 billion-taka (about 36.46 million
dollars) in loans this year for procurement of leather, against
last year's 2.5 billion taka (about 52.08 million dollars), he
said.
</P>
<P>
Out of 170 godown owners at Postagola, only around 30 have
started buying leather. "The rest are inactive due to crisis of
fund," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the leather industry, an important
foreign exchange earner of Bangladesh, earned 160 billion taka
(3.3 billion dollars) in foreign exchange from 1972-1997.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Demands U.S. Compensation for Halting Missile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) is demanding compensation from the United
States for lost earnings if it halts its missile exports, said a
spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth round of missile talks in Pyongyang on Monday
and Tuesday, the DPRK insisted that only after Washington accepted
this condition could the two sides discuss the halt of missile
exports, the spokesman told the Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the DPRK was only willing to negotiate
on the issue of missile exports, but not activities involving the
development of missiles.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK insisted during the talks that "the development,
production, test and deployment of missiles fall completely within
the category of our sovereignty and we will never enter into
negotiations with anybody over such activities," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides discussed the proposal put
forward by the DPRK and decided to continue the negotiations in
future, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The date and venue for the next round of talks will be fixed
and chosen through the contact channel in New York, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denounced for NATO Airstrikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A noted Finnish expert on
international issues said that the ongoing NATO airstrikes on
Yugoslavia have brought to light once again the U.S. attempt to
seek hegemony in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
Carl Fredrik Sandelin said in a commentary which was published
in the Wednesday issue of Hufvudstadsbladet (Capital Daily) that U.
S. President Bill Clinton and NATO are waging a war of aggression
on Yugoslavia, an independent and sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
NATO military action is totally unacceptable as Yugoslavia has
never attacked the United States or NATO, nor has it posed a
threat to them, said Sandelin, who was former president of the
Finnish News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He criticized NATO for launching military strikes on Yugoslavia
without the authorization of the United Nations, describing the
airstrikes as a flagrant intervention in Yugoslavia's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Some European countries yielded to the U.S. hegemonic moves to
take part in the aggression of Yugoslavia even though they are
clearly aware that military strikes can not bring a solution to
the Kosovo issue, Sandelin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Kosovo issue should be solved through
diplomatic channels instead of force, adding the United States,
the only superpower in the current world, has become used to
applying to arms to carry out its foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Sandelin warned Europe's NATO countries not to let Washington,
who calls the current war of aggression on Yugoslavia a
humanitarian mission to protect ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, make a
new mistake in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO airstrikes in the past few days failed to
force the Yugoslav government and people to back down, but would
rather cause more casualties to innocent civilians.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian police cracked an
international drug trafficking gang and seized seven kilograms of
cocaine on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"After a long surveillance in Panama City, our units performed
an operation in the airport of Tocumen, and finally captured nine
members of the gang, of whom five are Colombians," said the head
of the Anti-Drug Unit of the Judicial Technical Police (JTP),
Ruben Reina.
</P>
<P>
The gang was going to send the cocaine to Spain, he added.
</P>
<P>
Drug smugglers often employ "mules" to traffic the drugs, most
of whom are young women, who carry the cocaine strategically
hidden in small bags in purses and in shoes with double soles.
</P>
<P>
"This criminal organization previously introduced the cargo of
drugs into Panamanian territory, to be sent later to the markets
of high consumption in the U.S. and Spain," said Reina.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Allow Access to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government will allow
access to the Internet, which will be used more widely in
education, health and electronic commerce, said a high-ranking
communications official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar here Wednesday on economic benefit through
electronic commerce technology on the Internet, sponsored by a
private company, Brigadier-General Win Tin, minister of
communications, posts and telegraph, said, "The world becomes a
global village due to information technology (IT). We are now in a
knowledge era beyond IT era."
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been trying to formulate a master plan for the
development of the country's IT, importing annually tens of
thousands of computers with very little tariff and classifying
them as education aids and priority items.
</P>
<P>
The access to the Internet for the private sector is also being
striven.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar computer associations are also trying to get
support from regional and international counterparts, especially
those from Singapore and Malaysia, to enhance the country's
systematic IT development.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar held the first symposium on IT initiative in June last
year to promote the development and advancement of computer
technology in the country.
</P>
<P>
For systematic development of IT, the Myanmar government
promulgated the Computer Technology Development Law in September
1996 and later founded the Computer Technology Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, three associations of Myanmar computer technicians,
entrepreneurs and enthusiasts were also respectively formed.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Three U.S. Army Soldiers Missing in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. Army soldiers on a
reconnaissance mission on the Macedonian-Yugoslav border were
missing Wednesday night after being surrounded and fired upon, the
U.S. Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
An immediate search and rescue mission was launched, involving
ground and helicopter teams, Defense Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
The three-man reconnaissance team had been traveling in the
Kumanovo area of Macedonia near the southern Yugoslavia border
when they reported they received small arms fire and said they
were surrounded, the Pentagon quoted a NATO statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement didn't say who had them surrounded. Pentagon
spokesman Richard Bridges said, "We believe they have possibly
been abducted. Right now, there's a search and rescue effort on."
</P>
<P>
At the White House, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
advised President Clinton of the missing "and will keep him
informed as the information becomes available," said National
Security Council spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
"We're still determined to push forward on our sustained air
campaign and the operation will continue" against military targets
in Yugoslavia, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Leavy declined to provide further details "that could
potentially jeopardize the safety or well being of these guys."
</P>
<P>
NATO forces, including ground and helicopter teams, and
Macedonian police immediately launched an immediate search for the
missing team, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Army reconnaissance team was part of the former U.N.
peacekeeping operation in Macedonia called "Able Sentry," which
ended in February, Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
The force of about 1,200 troops included about 350 Americans,
who remained in the region following the March 24 start of NATO
airstrikes on Yugoslavia.

YANGON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar gained a total of 1.135
billion U.S. dollars in customs duties in 1998, according to the

Organization.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total, import duties amounted to 1.118 billion

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Speed Up Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Senior Thai government officials
said various ministries have received orders from Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai to speed up public spending in the 1999 fiscal year
in a bid to stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
"The premier wants us to speed up government spending as only
30 percent of the budget has been disbursed as of March 20,"
Supachai Pisitvanich, the Finance Ministry's permanent secretary,
said in remarks made public on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan issued the order after the cabinet on March 30 approved
a 130-billion-baht (3.5 billion U.S. dollars) stimulus package to
kick-start economic recovery by increasing domestic demand and
spending.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister convened a meeting of permanent secretaries
from all ministries on Wednesday to ensure that the package will
render good results. There have been reports about expected delays
in disbursement of the national budget as well as offshore loans.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year, starting October 1, 1998, to September 31,
1999, the government hopes that it would be able to disburse up to
89 percent of the total budget of 825 billion baht (22.2 billion
dollars). So far, the spending is at a slow pace.
</P>
<P>
So far, disbursement delays are being partly given as a reason
for the prolonged economic recession. But Supachai insisted that
the delays are mainly because of contractors' financial problems,
which have made them unable to complete projects as planned.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said 53 billion baht (1.4 billion dollars) out of the
130-billion-baht package would soon be disbursed to rural
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said offshore loans will be disbursed faster due to the
small size of projects and the shortening of bureaucratic
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Rural officials will be in charge of spending, without having
to wait for the central government's decision. The Interior
Ministry will give each village 100,000 baht (2,700 dollars) for
job creation.
</P>
<P>
To speed up disbursement, every ministry has 15 days to submit
all details of projects to the Budget Bureau. The bureau will take
only 10 days in examining the projects and the
Comptroller-General's Department will dispatch the funds within a
day if asked, according to Satit Limpongphun, the Finance
Ministry's spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmakers Strongly Condemn NATO Action in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federation Council (
upper house of the parliament) issued a statement Wednesday,
strongly condemning NATO's air attacks against Yugoslavia as an
aggressive act.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the lawmakers expressed support to the
efforts by President Boris Yeltsin and the government to
immediately stop the bombings and settle the crisis as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed that the purpose of NATO's air raids
against Yugoslavia, which has lasted for eight days by Wednesday,
is to impose its own will on a sovereign nation and to set up in
the 21st century a unipolar world ruled by Washington.
</P>
<P>
The behavior of NATO undermines the reputation of the United
Nations, noted the Federation Council, which first appealed to the
international community to stop NATO invasion last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Those who have hatched and carried out the aggression should be
held responsible for its consequences, and the legislators of NATO
member nations who authorized it should also be blamed, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that Russian president and the government call for
an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the issues
of NATO's violation of the UN Charter and of lifting the U.N.-
imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed that the Russian government discuss the issue
of providing for the invaded country necessary economic aid as
well as military technology that could be used for defensive
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The statement appealed to such organizations as the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),
European Union, Inter-parliamentary Union and Black Sea Economic
Cooperation Organization to act to halt immediately NATO's
aggression, and to bring the Kosovo crisis back to the track of
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also called on their counterparts of the
Commonwealth of Independent States to stand by Russia's stance of
peacefully resolving the crisis in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the current gloomy political and military situation
in Europe, the council proposed to re-examine the basic
principles of the security concept concerning the CIS countries,
and to take steps to strengthen their national defense in a quick
manner.
</P>
<P>
The council backed the CIS countries to give humanitarian aid
to the Yugoslav people and at the same time to establish a fund
for the victims of the invasion.

<HEADLINE> IMF Forecasts Quick Recovery in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- An Asian economic recovery, which
is under way in several of the key regional economies, will gain
momentum later this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
said in a latest report received here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that virtually all countries in the area will
show positive growth next year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF forecast shows that Thailand and South Korea will
record 1-percent and 2-percent overall economic growth
respectively while China's economy will continue to grow 7 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong are forecast
to remain in negative growth territory in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The IMF figures show that Japan's GDP will contract 1.1 percent
this year, after a 1998 contraction of 2.8 percent. Japan is
forecast to grow 0.3 percent in 2000. Indonesia, meanwhile, will
see a contraction of 3.9 percent in 1999 after a 1998 reduction of
13.6 percent. Indonesia's economy is forecast to grow 3.3 percent
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF, Malaysia will see a GDP contraction of
1.6 percent in 1999 after a 1998 reduction of 7.5 percent. It is
forecast to record growth of 1.1 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
While the IMF did not specifically mention the export recovery
of Asian economies, the 1999 outlook is unclear for Thailand as
well as other Asian countries. However, the outlook for solid
export recovery is clearer in 2000, according to Thai government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export recovery, targeted to grow 4 percent this
year in dollar terms but with actual shipments in January and
February down 5.6 percent, is one of the twin engines of growth
along with the recovery of domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo May Need Surgery for Tendinitis in Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Soccer star Ronaldo may need surgery
to eradicate the tendinitis in his right knee, said his
physiotherapist in Milan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility, but surgery would be the very last
solution," Nilton Petrone said. "We will do everything possible to
avoid it and recent improvements let us believe that Ronaldo's
knee can be cured."
</P>
<P>
Petrone said the injury has been troubling the Brazilian star
since the World Cup, and Ronaldo, who plays for Internazionale of
Milan, will have to work harder than teammates to recover his form.
</P>
<P>
"He still feels some pain in his right knee, while the left
knee is OK now," Petrone said at Inter's training camp.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian physiotherapist, a longtime friend of Ronaldo,
has been added as a member of the Milan's club's medical staff to
personally tend to the Brazilian striker, a two-time FIFA World
Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo, who has been repeatedly sidelined by knee problems
this season, has played only portions of matches in the European
Champions League and Italian Serie A.
</P>
<P>
"He still is at 50 percent, but he's improving," Petrone said.

TIRANA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- More refugees from Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province continued to pour into Albania and Macedonia on
Wednesday, with their number in Albania alone exceeding 100,000,
the Albanian news agency ATA reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said
the situation in Macedonia was also very serious after more than
35,000 refugees entered the country.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian government said Macedonia could accept 20,000
refugees to the maximum.
</P>
<P>
An European Union (EU) delegation led by State Minister of
German Foreign Ministry Gunter Verheugen and EU Commissioner for
Humanitarian Affairs Emma Bonino visited Albania and Macedonia on
Wednesday, preparing to help shelter the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The exodus of refugees from Kosovo came as a result of NATO
airstrikes on Yugoslavia that started on March 24.

<HEADLINE> Financial System Reform To Move Into New Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's financial system reform
needs to be raised to the next stage, said Chinese economist Zhao
Haikuan in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
First, the People's Bank of China should be turned into a more
standard central bank, Zhao said in a signed article.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, quota management of credit was removed and the
People's Bank of China turned to economic methods instead of a
mandatory plan for macro-economic control.
</P>
<P>
It reformed its institutional structure, abolished its branches
at provincial and municipal levels and established transprovincial
branches in nine major regions, including Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore faced with creating new work rules to fully
bring into play the advantages of the new structure and to
strengthen financial supervision.
</P>
<P>
Second, conditions should be created to implement a
shareholding system in State-owned banks, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Despite various measures taken by the State, including closer
control of assets-to-liabilities ratios, reform of State-owned
banks still lags far behind the set goals.
</P>
<P>
Form time to time, major State-owned banks are still required
to grant loans based on public policy criteria.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans, a problem worsening over time, have not
been effectively resolved.
</P>
<P>
A shareholding system would push the wheel of reform forward,
said the article.
</P>
<P>
It would facilitate the separation of government and commercial
activity in the whole banking sector.
</P>
<P>
With such a mechanism, banks will belong to the shareholders.
Although the State may become the biggest shareholder and control
the direction of a bank's development, it cannot maintain complete
control.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders will use every possible means to force banks to
improve their management and pursue maximum profits.
</P>
<P>
As a result, credit channels will be boosted and non-performing
loans can be partly alleviated.
</P>
<P>
China's financial market should be further opened and
standardized, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Renminbi in capital accounts should be made freely convertible
when conditions are ripe.
</P>
<P>
Conditions include the further expansion of China's economic
strength and the emergence of capable bankers who are skilled in
international financial business operations and proficient in
handling international financial strategies.
</P>
<P>
The Renminbi could then become one of the most important
currencies in the world, said the article.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns US-led NATO Plan to Separate Kosovo from Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Wednesday condemned the US-led NATO for planning to
separate Kosovo from Yugoslavia and stressed that Russia would
take more measures to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Ivanov said Russia has got
accurate information that NATO is actively planning to separate
Kosovo from Yugoslavia, and to send in ground forces to reinforce
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
Refuting Western media reports that the Russian peace mission
to Belgrade failed, he said the mission led by Premier Yevgeny
Primakov had received a clear message from Yugoslavia for a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
But NATO rejected the peaceful message, showing it has no
intention for such a solution, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said on the same
occasion that in view of the current situation in Yugoslavia, his
ministry plans to propose to the state leadership to "take more
resolute measures."
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian military is now moving to raise its combat
readiness to safeguard Russian and its allies' security.
</P>
<P>
NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia has proved a conclusion by
his ministry long ago that NATO is a military alliance used by the
United States to implement its power policies, he added.
</P>
<P>
He warned what is happening in Yugoslavia now could repeat in
any other independent and sovereign country in the future.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Send Warships to Mediterranean in Response to NATO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia will send seven warships to
the Mediterranean in the nearest days in response to NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, said Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the first warship, one military
reconnaissance vessel of the Black Sea Fleet, will leave Friday "
to sail through the Bosporus to monitor NATO actions to enhance
Russia's security."
</P>
<P>
Russia had sent the Turkish government an application for their
transit permission, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's foreign ministry Wednesday granted permission to the
Russian warships to transit through the Bosporus strait. Ankara
informed NATO of its decision.
</P>
<P>
Russia has said repeatedly that its military will not become
involved in the conflict in Yugoslavia. Sergeyev's statement came
amidst Russian press reports that a squadron of seven ships,
including missile frigates and anti-submarine frigates from the
Black Sea Fleet, will be sent to the Mediterranean in early April.
</P>
<P>
The appearance of a Russian naval squadron in the Mediterranean
would cause concern among NATO commanders. U.S. and allied
warships are deployed in the region for operations against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov returned to Moscow Wednesday
after his diplomatic mission to Yugoslavia failed to produce a
breakthrough. He said Moscow would continue efforts to revive
talks on ending the Kosovo dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military has suspended contacts with NATO in
protest over the alliance's action in Yugoslavia, and recalled its
general who represents the Defense Ministry at NATO headquarters.

<HEADLINE> China Formulates Child Welfare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China is mapping out a new
development program for the well-being of its children as the
nation prepares to enter the new millennium, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Li Qimin, an
official of the National Working Committee for Children and Women
as saying that the new program will promotes child-related
development projects focusing on health care, elementary education
and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that despite a national average
immunization rate over 95 percent, the rate in some remote and
impoverished regions still hovers around 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new ten-year program will be drafted by a number of
departments, including the ministries of health, education, and
labor, co-ordinated by Li's office.
</P>
<P>
China's current program for children's development, adopted in
1992, is a China-oriented version based on the guidelines set by a
summit on the issue of international children in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to a November report, China had reached 14 of the 24
global standards set by the conference, including providing safe
drinking water in rural regions, reducing the death rate of
infants and children under five by one-third, and promoting
breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
Six targets, such as the building of hygienic public toilets in
rural areas, the elimination of iodine deficiency disease, and the
control of AIDS, are not likely to be met by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Some 78 percent of China's 340 million children live in rural
areas, where economic development is relatively slow and health
knowledge is not wide-spread.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Condemns NATO Airstrikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's state-run news
agency, Notimex, on Wednesday issued an editorial accusing NATO of
violating international law with its airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The attacks by NATO, which had a predominant contingent of U.S.
forces, lacked the approval of the United Nations Security Council
and were unequivocal interventionism and inadmissible, Notimex
said in the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The article said the airstrikes violated the principle of

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Reduce Transient Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government
has vowed to slash the size of the city's transient population,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
This applies to all those Chinese who work in Beijing but who
do not have a residence certificate, a municipal official was
quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Quanfu, Beijing now has 2.859 million residents
from other parts of China who do not have residence certificates
and 1.8 million of them are working in the city.
</P>
<P>
"And the number is still increasing, which exceeds our needs
and imposes too great a burden on the city's infrastructure and
services," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to reduce the number from 1.8 million to 1.
5 million, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the goal, Beijing will expand its 5,000-strong
Special Administrative Team by another 7,000 to supervise the
transient population, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, since these people mainly live in leased housing,
Beijing will further strengthen supervision of such housing this
year.
</P>
<P>
New measures in this field include establishing files for all
of Beijing's leased housing and closing all illegally leased
housing in the city before June, it reported.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Plans to Random Test Olympic Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The world's athletes are likely
to have random drug tests in the two weeks before the 2000 Games,
as Sydney Olympic organizers announced (SOCOG) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Organizing Committee sports commission chairman John
Coates said the two-week period prior to a major event is crucial
for supervising drugs cheats.
</P>
<P>
The organizers want to test athletes staying in the Athletes
Village and at training camps in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Coates said he hoped the new International Anti-Doping Agency
would provide the funding for the out-of-competition testing if
agreement could be reached with the international sporting
federations and national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
Under current rules, athletes are the responsibility of their
sports' federations until the start of an Olympics when the IOC
takes over.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG plans to drug-test 2,200 athletes during the Games.
</P>
<P>
Coates said he was hopeful that reliable tests would be found
for human growth hormone and the red blood cell stimulant EPO
before the Games.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia Facing Deflation Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Asia is facing the threat of
deflation, which, economists suggest, would harm the region's
economy and slow down the pace of a recovery if it fails to get
out of the mess.
</P>
<P>
What is deflation? It is a decrease in the amount of money
being used in a country that leads to weak demand for goods, less
industrial activities and lower prices. That is the explanation of
experts.
</P>
<P>
To consumers, however, falling prices for goods and services
mean more purchasing power although they also suggest slack
demand, over-supply and lower income and high unemployment. All
these problems could harm the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The deflation trend in Asian began from mid-1997 to mid-1998
when some East Asian currencies devalued by 30 to 80 percent. The
crushing devaluations helped lower the dollar prices of many Asian
exports.
</P>
<P>
Some people said the International Monetary Fund's original
cure of compelling governments to produce austerity budgets should
take some of the blame.
</P>
<P>
Signs of deflation have started to appear in Asia during the
last two years: Real estate prices across Asia have been depressed
and market capitalization on the region's bourses has been
slashed, by 40 percent in Seoul, 63 percent in Bangkok and 81
percent in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumer prices, from housing to food, telephone
services to television sets, have been falling in many Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, consumer prices have been retreating since last
June while in Japan, prices have been falling for about six years.
</P>
<P>
In some Asian countries, consumers almost have stopped buying
to wait for further price drops while companies are laying off
more workers because they can not sell their goods.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, unemployed workers have little spending power and are
making the downward spiral take another turn. In Japan, February's
unemployment rate climbed to 4.6 percent, a record high, while
retail sales were down 3.5 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that as prices drop in an industry facing glut,
companies may have to cut capacity and work force to stay
competitive, and in some sectors, firms will have to close.
</P>
<P>
As the inflation rate in many Asian countries has become almost
negative and over-supply of goods further lowered prices,
deflation could prolong Asia's economic recovery process, they
warned.
</P>
<P>
To combat the threat of deflation, Asian countries have
initiated big spending programs to prevent the economic recovery
process from derailing.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian governments have increased public spending to
stimulate the economic growth and avoid deflation. Since the
second half of 1998, East Asian countries have abandoned the
International Monetary Fund's austerity programs and increased
budget deficits by spending more on infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Most Asian countries have also cut interest rates to push
consumption demand higher and stimulate production. In the
Philippines, the central bank has lowered its key interest rates
seven times to 12.5 percent so far this year, close to the
pre-crisis level.
</P>
<P>
But some experts said that under the pressure of falling prices
and over-supply, the best way to cure deflation is to abandon
old-fashioned technologies and unprofitable factories.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, in Asia, only Japan has displayed signs of serious
deflation. Japanese consumers have begun to factor an expectation
of falling prices into buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
However, economists said Asian governments should recognize the
seriousness of the deflation threat and adopt more measures to
prevent deflation from occurring.

<HEADLINE> China to Tap Tourism Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's tourism industry should be
considered a new, large-potential economic growth sector, suggests
a senior tourism official.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the industry can tap into China's vast
countryside, and underdeveloped central and western regions, notes
Wei Xiao'an, director of the Policy and Regulation Department of
China National Tourism Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
Villages, China's main support base for sustainable development,
have natural, tourism-based resources, Wei was quoted by China
Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
With improvements in people's living standards, more urban
citizens prefer visiting villages because they have fresher air
and cleaner water, said Wei.
</P>
<P>
Most rural areas are more accessible due to improved
transportation conditions in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
For example, each prefecture in Yunnan Province has a modern
airport , and the province earned 264 million US dollars in
tourism revenues in 1997, up from 13 million US dollars in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces have applied to establish local ecological
tourism development zones, such as Hulunbeier grasslands in Inner
Mongolia and Linzhi Guogao Lake Resort.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of travelers to China's population jumped from
23.7 percent in 1990 to 52.4 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"As a pillar industry in most provinces, tourism can play an
important role in increasing investments, expanding demands and
enlarging exports," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
The number of domestic tourists grew 10 percent annually during
the past 14 years, indicate official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Some 694 million people traveled throughout China last year.
</P>
<P>
The domestic tourism sector reported 239.1 billion yuan in
earnings last year, despite the severe flooding.

MADRID, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Raul Gonzalez scored three goals
to pace Spain for a 6-0 victory over San Marino in Serravalle on
Wednesday, claiming the Group 6 leadership for the European
Championship qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
Raul who scored four times for the Spaniards in a 9-0 victory

Fran Gonzales opened the scoring in the 20th, and Raul Gonzalez
made it 2-0 in the closing minute of the first half.

<HEADLINE> Italy Draws Belarus in Euro 2000 Qualifier </HEADLINE>

<P>
ROME, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Italy needed a penalty kick to
prevent its home defeat against Belarus as both squads parted away
with one point each as either side netted in one goal in Ancona on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Valentin Belkevich gave Belarus a 1-0 lead in the 24th minute,
with a diagonal right foot volley off a long cross from Maxim
Romashchenko that Paolo Maldini missed in the European
Championship Group one qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, Italy was awarded a penalty which Filippo
Inzaghi converted after Antonio Conte was fouled close to the net.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team, which also beat Wales, Switzerland and
Denmark in the previous qualifying matches, was often put in
trouble by the fast counter attacks of the visitors who captured
their second draw in four matches, including two defeats.
</P>
<P>
Belarus had an apparent goal by Vladimir Makovsky voided in the
53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Belarus well deserved the draw against the favored Italians,
showing a better teamwork and physical condition.
</P>
<P>
Italian keeper Gianluigi Buffon made a decisive save in the
closing minutes on a short range shot by Vasily Baranov.

Eion Jess scored on a header off a long throw-in to draw
Scotland within 2-1 in the 68th.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs look almost certain to win the group and advance to
the final 16. Even a stumble would leave them as the best runners-

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Irish President Mary
MacAleese arrived in Honduras Wednesday to learn about the Central
American country's plan of reconstruction after the hit by
hurricane "Mitch" last October.
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour meeting with Honduran President Carlos Flores
Facusse, MacAleese said Ireland planned to provide 5 million
dollars for Honduras' rehabilitation projects over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
Ireland promised Honduras an aid of 1.5 million dollars
immediately after the disaster, which killed at least 9,000 people
and wrecked numerous homes, roads and bridges. The money will be
distributed this year.
</P>
<P>
"Honduras has maintained strong links with Ireland since 1974
and now after "Mitch", we have seen an increase of Irish
cooperation towards the areas most severely damaged," said
President Flores.
</P>
<P>
During her stay, MacAleese will visit the Northern and Atlantic
regions of Honduras, where the two countries are cooperating in
projects aimed to improve the life of indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
MacAleese will end her visit Friday and leave for Mexico to

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Germany topped Group Three with
nine points after it scored an easy 2-0 victory over Finland in
Nuremberg, Germany, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jens Jeremies and Oliver Newville, who scored their first
international goals in the first half, ensured the reigning
European champions' returning form and moving on the top of their
qualifying group.
</P>
<P>
Germany now levels Turkey, who didn't play Wednesday while
Northern Ireland and Moldavia drew 0-0 and stay at the rear of the
group.
</P>
<P>
Germany's first home game in their Euro 2000 campaign started
well, because the Finns were nervous, with their captain Jari
Litmanen a shadow of himself.
</P>
<P>
The Ajax star had just one shot on goal in his side's only
threatening move and Paris Saint Germain defender Christian Worns
cleared Litmanen's shot off the line.
</P>
<P>
Jeremies, Bayern Munich defender, charged through the middle
and slammed the ball home from close range as the Finns backed off
from the challenge in the 31st minute.
</P>
<P>
Germany bagged their second just five minutes later when Oliver
Neuville converted Marco Bode's angled-back cross.
</P>
<P>
German captain Oliver Bierhoff, sporting a black eye after an
accidental clash of heads with teammate Bode against Northern
Ireland on Saturday, had two dangerous headers but otherwise had a
quiet match.
</P>
<P>
The Germans relaxed the tempo after the break but coach Erich
Ribbeck was well satisfied with his men's showing.
</P>
<P>
"That was the best we have played for a long time," Ribbeck
said.

ZHEJIANG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The '99 China International Young

Exchange opened at Xiandu in east China's Zhejiang province today.
</P>
<P>
Xiandu, one of China's major scenic spots, is situated in
Jinyun County in Zhejiang Province, and has more than 300 places
of interest including Dinghu Peak, Niweng Cave, Red Cliff, and the

More than ten international volunteers from countries
including Britain, the Netherlands, Singapore and Japan will
gather there to attend The '99 China International Young
Volunteers Work Camp.
</P>
<P>
The idea of work camps was established in 1920 by the youth of
Germany and France to reconstruct the buildings destroyed in their
countries during World War I.
</P>
<P>
The work camp, a kind of volunteer service for youth,
generally lasts two to three weeks, and participants take part in
activities of environmental protection, public service, and
cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers pay for their own registration and
transportation, but board and lodging are provided free.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third time the All-China Youth Federation (
ACYF) conducts this event in China, since it attended the meeting
of the Coordinating Committee for International Voluntary Service
(CCIVS) in 1997 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The CCIVS includes 68 member states and organizes 1,600 work
camps annually worldwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- About 250,000 census enumerators and

the Census, recently said at a press conference here, "This is a
large and important census aimed at collecting information to
reflect the current status of population and housing condition for
the country as a whole and its local areas, responding information
need to formulate socioeconomic development plans in the period
from 2000 to 2010."
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese population and housing census, which will
conclude on April 7, is to collect information on population by
sex, age, ethnic group, religion, urban and rural areas; levels
and trends of migration; education and qualification; Labor force

Yugoslavia.
</P>

world war three."
</P>
<P>
"We demand the end of the bombings and the start of diplomatic
talks," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also noted that the writers are against the
attitude of the large powers "which are establishing themselves as

<HEADLINE> France Struggles 2-0 to Beat Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- World Cup champion France struggled
to beat lowly Armenia 2-0 in a Group 4 European championship
qualifier in Saint-Denis, France, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sylvain Wiltord shot his first international goal in the third
minute and Nicolas Anelka weaved through two challenges before
letting the ball run to the Bordeaux striker, who stroked the ball
past goalkeeper Roman Berezovski from 15 meters.
</P>
<P>
France had to wait until first-half stoppage time for its
second goal, headed in by Christophe Dugarry after Laurent Blanc
had nodded a left wing corner onto the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
In the last 15 minutes, Berezovski did well to save long-range
efforts from Robert Pires and Alain Boghossian.
</P>
<P>
The rusty France, which drew 0-0 with Ukraine here last
Saturday and could only beat tiny Andorra 2-0 in November, lacked
width and was normally too labored in its approach play to create
chances against a packed Armenian defense.
</P>
<P>
Armenia couldn't match the physical presence of Didier
Deschamps and Patrick Vieira in midfield, but was always quick to
pack its defense to keep the score respectable.

<HEADLINE> Czechs Keeps Winning Streak in Euro 2000 Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic was the only
country that has won five straight games for a perfect record in
its hunt for a European title after its runner-up finish to
Germany in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs won their fifth straight by beating Scotland 2-1 on
Wednesday in one of 16 European 2000 Championship qualifiers
across the continent.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Latvia and Spain, with a hat trick by Raul Gonzalez to
give him seven goals in the last two games, overtook the lead in
their groups, while powerful Ukraine stayed on top despite a 1-1
draw with Iceland.
</P>
<P>
World Cup champion France struggled to a 2-0 win over Armenia,
while Italy, Group 1 leaders, was held to a 1-1 draw by lowly
Belarus, the first draw for the Italians after three victories.
</P>
<P>
Group 1:
</P>
<P>
In Ancona, Italy drew 1-1 with Belarus for 10 points from four
matches. Valentin Belkevich gave Belarus an early lead in the 24th,
but was equalised by Italy with a penalty kick six minutes later
after midfielder Antonio Conte was fouled. Belarus has two draws
in four games.
</P>
<P>
Stephane Chapuisat scored twice to propel Switzerland to a 2-0
victory in Zurich over Wales, boosting its hopes of reaching the
finals, at least as a runner-up as the Swiss have seven points
against six for Wales.
</P>
<P>
Group 2:
</P>
<P>
A scoreless draw between Greece and Latvia enabled the latter
to overtake Norway on goal difference as group leader as Latvia,
which began playing internationally only eight years ago, upset
Norway earlier 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Group 3:
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Germany scored two goals through Jens
Jeremies in the 31st and Oliver Neuville in the 36th to beat
Finland 2-0 to take the group lead on goal difference from Turkey.
Finland has never beaten Germany in 76 years in a full
international.
</P>
<P>
In its away game, Northern Ireland drew 0-0 with Moldova in a
lackluster match. Moldova has only two points in five games and
Northern Ireland has five in as many games.
</P>
<P>
Group 4:
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was also cornered for a disappointing 1-1 draw with
Iceland but still held onto the group leadership on goal
difference over France. Ukraine's Vladyslav Vaschuk got his side a
1-0 lead in the 57th, but Iceland equalized in the 66th on Larus
Sigurdsson's goal. Iceland has nine points in five games and
Ukraine and France has 11 in five.
</P>
<P>
World Cup champion France lacked firepower as it struggled to
beat lowly Armenia 2-0 on first-half goals by Sylvain Wiltord and
Christophe Dugarry, while Russia got its second victory
dispatching Andorra 6-1 as striker Vladimir Beschastnykh scored
twice.
</P>
<P>
Group 5:
</P>
<P>
Sweden won its away game over Poland 1-0 on Fredrik Ljungberg's
goal in the 36th, to strenching its winning streak to four, and
Bulgaria still kept its slim hopes as it beat Luxembourg 2-0
through captain Hristo Stoichkov in the 17th and Ivailo Iordanov
in the 37th.
</P>
<P>
Group 6:
</P>
<P>
Spain whitewashed San Marino 6-0 as Raul Gonzalez made his hat
trick for seven goals in the last two games, overtaking Cyprus for
the group top position on goal difference. Gonzalez scored four
goals in a weekend 9-0 win over Austria.
</P>
<P>
Group 7:
</P>
<P>
Romanian won a hard away game against Azerbaijan through a
lonely goal from Florentin Petre in the 49th, thus scored 11
points from five games, while Slovakia failed to exploit its home
advantage to settle for a scoreless draw with Hungary.
</P>
<P>
As no games played in Group 8 due to war in Kosova, Portugal
kept the Group 9 lead with a 5-0 victory over winless
Liechtenstein.

</P>
<P>
As NATO air strikes have shut air passage over Yugoslavia, the
delegation had to fly to Hungary first, and then drive to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov held talks
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Milosevic agreed to reduce the Yugoslav forces in
Kosovo and let refugees return homes in exchange for a halt to
NATO offensive, which was rejected by NATO.

<HEADLINE> Missile Falls Near Bulgarian Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A missile fell early Wednesday
morning near the village of Elovdol of Per Nik Region in western
Bulgaria close to the border with Yugoslavia, the press office of
the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The missile was found 500 meters from the village, which is
some 20 kilometers away from the border with Yugoslavia, and has
caused a hole in the ground measuring 6 meter in diameter, the
press office said.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary data, it was a missile similar to the
one which fell near the western Bulgarian city of Trun on March 26.
The warhead exploded in the air, causing no damage.
</P>
<P>
After the March 26 incident, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry
contacted the U.S. charge d'affaires ad interim to Bulgaria to
express uneasiness over the matter. The U.S. diplomat promised to
report the incident to the U.S. government in order to take
measure against the occurrence of similar incidents in future.
</P>
<P>
Both incidents are apparently related to NATO's ongoing
airstrikes on Yugoslavia that started on March 24.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Dialog on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China urged the United States
to hold dialogs rather than resorting to confrontation on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
"The only way is to have dialogs rather that resorting to
measures of confrontation, because facts or history have already
proved that confrontation will get nowhere," said Li Zhaoxing,
Chinese Ambassador to the United States, in an interview by C-SPAN
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If we sit together and discuss patiently, and on the basis of
equality and mutual respect, we can reduce and eradicate some of
our differences," he said, "and that's good for all sides."
</P>
<P>
"But if you go to confrontation, it will not get anywhere. It
will cause damage not only to others but also to yourselves, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the UN Conferences on Human Rights in
Geneva in the past have indicated that to resort to confrontation
will always lead to failure.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 90s, the United States has supported
anti-China resolutions at the Geneva human rights conferences for
seven years in succession, but each time it failed.
</P>
<P>
The Unites States announced that it will table an anti-China
bill in the 55th UN Conference on Human Rights, which was strongly
opposed by China.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the U.S. side reverse its erroneous decision
immediately, and abandon its practice of interfering in China's
internal affairs," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun
Yuxi in Beijing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing said that in general, China and U.S. have a lot in
common with regard to human rights, and the common grounds could
be expanded.
</P>
<P>
"But we also have differences, then we can sit down and
discuss," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this is a post-Cold-War period, "so we
should do well not to let the cold-war mentality" hamper the
understanding and friendship between and among peoples of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"We should work together to make the world more prosperous and
beautiful," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls Again After Close Above 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average fell again in the second day after closing above 10,000
as traders continued to get worried about the company earnings
and take profits.
</P>
<P>
The Dow finished down 127.10 at 9,786.16, retreating from an
88.80 gain in the first hour of trading. The index lost 220.62
points in the past two days after it crossed the five digit
milestone, finishing at 10,006.78 for the first time Monday.
</P>
<P>
The further retreat of the Dow index today was pushed by the
sign of distressed corporate profits. The Commerce Department
said in a report that for all of 1998, corporate profits slipped
2.2 percent, the first drop since 1989, when profits fell 4.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The market was also affected after a jury in Oregon ordered
Philip Morris to pay 81 million U.S. dollars to the family of a
man who died of lung cancer after smoking Marlboros for four
decades.
</P>
<P>
Investors also adjusted their holdings to lock in earnings
ahead of the long weekend, driving the market down.
</P>
<P>
 Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 14.38 at 1,286.37 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 18.53 at 2,461.76.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index was down 5.06 at 603.59 and the American
Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.33 at 710.30. The
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.15 to 397.63.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,422 up, 1,661 down and 488
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 922.06 million shares from 725.53
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches Nigeria '99 Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Postal Service
Wednesday launched the commemorative stamps for the 10th World
Youth Soccer Championship tagged Nigeria '99 which is scheduled to
start on April 3 in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony, Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar warned in a message that "the government
would not tolerate failure on the part of those responsible for
Nigeria '99."
</P>
<P>
He challenged members of the local organizing committee and
managers of sports in the West African country to brace up to
ensure the success of the championship.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar noted that the championship coincided with the
country's return to the mainstream of international politics after
years of isolation over human rights and democratization.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian media has recently been replete with complaints
from officials of the Federation of International Football
Association (FIFA) and football teams who began arriving in the
country at the weekend about the state of facilities in the eight
centers for the 21-day championship.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, FIFA withdrew the hosting rights from Nigeria over
fears about medical facilities in the most populous African
country.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "charity stamps" specifically produced for sales during
the championship, the postal stamps will come in six different
denominations.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the stamps is football, Head of Media Relations of
the Nigeria Postal Service Jaiye Olaniyi explained, adding that
each of the stamps will carry a surcharge of 5 nairas (about 0.056
U.S. dollars) which is meant to be turned to the local organizing
committee of Nigeria '99 after sales.
</P>
<P>
He said that his establishment's other products and services
include sales of stamps, aerogram services comprising inland and
overseas postage, and philatelic services.
</P>
<P>
Video documentaries on Nigerian cultural heritage in postage
stamps would be played in the official hotels for Nigeria '99 as a
form of entertainment to visitors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service has also planned to release for sale some
specialized postcards which are football related topics.

<HEADLINE> FINA Tightens Rules Against Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- FINA, the world swimming
governing body, will tighten rules against doping, Mustapha
Larfaoui of Algeria, president of FINA, announced in an
extraordinary congress of FINA here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FINA decided that swimmers from any federation will face out-of-
competition tests and the federation will be deprived of its entry
to any FINA swimming tournament for two years if four doping cases
are found in a period of 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Officials from FINA also said swimmers at the world short-
course championships in Hong Kong from April 1 to 4 would be asked
for the first time to give blood samples voluntarily to a group
studying ways to detect illegal use of growth hormones to improve
performance.
</P>
<P>
Urine samples are still normally carried out at the world short-
course championships.
</P>
<P>
FINA listed 2,187 doping tests in 1998, 22 of which turned out
to be positive. Half of the 22 doping cases were the ones
conducted by national federations.
</P>
<P>
FINA conducted 802 out-of-competition tests last year, and
national federations conducted another 1,185, it said.
</P>
<P>
In 345 tests so far in 1999, no positive cases have been
reported, FINA executive director Cornel Marculescu said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expresses Concern Over Russian Ship Deployments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday it was concerned at Russian plans to send up to seven
Navy ships to the Mediterranean to be close to the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously concerned by the signal such a large
deployment might be sent to Belgrade and other countries in the
region," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Russia had told Turkey that seven ships from the
Black Sea fleet would transit the Bosphorus in two groups in early
April.
</P>
<P>
He said: "While the Russian Foreign Ministry has made it quite
clear that Russia does not intend to become entangled in the
conflict in the Balkans... the deployment of these ships we don't
see as a particularly helpful gesture."
</P>
<P>
Moscow's move came as Russian leaders unleashed another barrage
of criticism of NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia after Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov came home empty-handed from a peace
mission to Belgrade, officials here said.
