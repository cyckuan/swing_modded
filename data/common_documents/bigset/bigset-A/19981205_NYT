DINING TIP: L.A. EATING NOT A BAD BARGAIN, GLOALLY SPEAKING

   LOS ANGELES _ Stop whining about your restaurant tab.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost you more if you lived in Chicago or San Francisco.
It would cost you a heck of a lot more if you found yourself dining
out in London or Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Parisians pay more than twice as much as Los Angeles residents
for their meals, according to the latest Zagat Survey. It puts the
average per-person cost here at $24.86 compared to Paris at $50.81.
</P>
<P>
   And when the whining includes good French wine at a haute
restaurant, the disparity is evidently even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Zagat tells us that the average cost at the 20 most expensive
restaurants in Paris is almost $130, while in New York it's around
$92. But get this: In L.A. it's less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Parisians would probably say their food is better.
Ditto for those haughty Manhattanites.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has more middle-range restaurants, explains local
Zagat Survey co-editor Merrill Shindler.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has more high-end,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if you ask an L.A. gastronome where he or she eats, the
likelihood is that Cafe Bizou in Sherman Oaks, an L.A.-area suburb,
would be a popular answer. And the tab would just about hit the
Zagat average on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Bizou, you see, is the second-most popular restaurant in
Los Angeles in the 1999 Zagat Survey, knocking Chinois on Main in
Santa Monica out of second place while slipping in just behind the
perennial favorite, Patina.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the average cost of an upscale French-style dinner at
Bizou at $25, co-owner Philippe Gris points out that this includes
salad, entree, dessert _ ``everything, even a glass of wine,'' he
said. &QL;

LACKLUSTER DEVILS HAPPY WITH A TIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Who could blame Devils' supporters for
being inspired as the Atlantic Division leaders came home after
notching four victories in a five-game road trip? And who could
blame those fans for being disappointed Friday night by the team's
uninspiring performance against the Montreal Canadiens, who are in
last place in the Northeast Division?
</P>
<P>
   Playing down to Montreal's level until the latter stages of the
third period, when they finally raised their intensity, the Devils
salvaged a 1-1 tie before a crowd of 16,268 at Continental Arena,
and said afterward that they considered themselves lucky to escape
with the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Andreychuk scored the tying goal for the Devils with 1
minute 53 seconds left in regulation, when his shot from the top of
the right circle found its way behind Montreal goaltender Jeff
Hackett, who faced 38 shots, including four in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' letdown came after a trip in which they registered
victories at Carolina, Dallas, Colorado and Washington, and lost at
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all mental,'' said Andreychuk, who scored his
seventh goal of the season. ``You come home and you think it's
going to be easy. You got your fans behind you and you sleep in
your own bed, but it doesn't work. I wish I had an answer for it.
All I know is we got away with a tie and that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston was also happy with the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well,'' he said. ``We weren't on top of our
game. We played well only late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Malakhov scored for the Canadiens (9-13-2) against
Martin Brodeur, who faced 22 shots, including one in overtime,
while keeping the Devils (14-8-1) in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo appeared to have scored a goal with 1:47 left in
overtime for the Devils, but the goal was disallowed as the video
replay showed that the puck was kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams played with little intensity around each other's net
in the scoreless first period. Each goaltender faced nine shots,
none too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was making his sixth start in the seven games since he
and Eric Weinrich joined the Canadiens from Chicago in exchange for
Jocelyn Thibault. Hackett looked sharp in the first two periods
with 21 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Making his ninth consecutive start, Brodeur looked sharp, too.
His only blemish was Malakhov's goal with 4:55 left in the second
period on a shot in which Brodeur was screened by two Devils and
never saw the puck.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils played the last two periods with five defensemen
after Kevin Dean, who came off the injured reserve list after
missing three games, reaggravated his groin injury. With Dean out,
the other New Jersey defensemen saw plenty of ice time, with Scott
Stevens leading the way. Stevens was the best defenseman for the
Devils on the five-game trip, especially in the victory at Denver,
where he broke up several rushes by the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   The Devils will visit the Islanders Saturday night for the
second time this season. The game will be the 934th in the National
Hockey League for KEN DANEYKO, tying JOHN MACLEAN's Devils record. &QL;

UCLA POISED FOR OKLAHOMA ST.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's no longer considered much of a classic and no
longer nationally televised, but it still carries John Wooden's
name and includes UCLA, so there remains some level of prestige for
today's Wooden Classic at the Pond in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-ranked Bruins might be the local draw, but even their
highly anticipated matchup with 11th-ranked Oklahoma State took a
hit this week when the Cowboys lost their first game of the season
to lowly Florida Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a recruit call us the other night and say, `Florida
Atlantic beat you? That sounds like an airline,' '' Oklahoma State
coach Eddie Sutton said. ``Our team is really overrated. If we were
playing in a 6-6-and-under league, we would have a really good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 83-81 loss to Florida Atlantic in Stillwater, Okla., broke
the Cowboys' 80-game home winning streak, which had been the
longest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised, but when you look across the country at
scores, that's a real example of the parity that exists,'' UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   But once Lavin began discussing Oklahoma State, one had to
wonder how much parity exists between the Bruins (3-2) and Cowboys
(4-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie Sutton is one of the top five coaches in the country. We
have the youngest coaching staff in America,'' Lavin said. ``It's
going to be a grinder game. Like the Green Bay Packers, three yards
and cloud-of-dust type of game. If it gets to an up-tempo game,
maybe our athletes can keep us in it.''
</P>
<P>
   That last remark prompted an unsolicited remark from John
Wooden, who was sitting next to Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a coach talks about the opposing team, they sound so
good, it's like you shouldn't even be playing the other team,''
Wooden said. ``When they talk about their own teams, you only hear
the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin did please Wooden, at least for one day, when he said the
Bruins would not wear their controversial new black uniforms
against Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like them at all,'' Wooden said. ``But it doesn't make
any difference what I think.''
</P>
<P>
   If today's game is significant, it marks another progress point
for UCLA point guard Baron Davis. He will play 20-22 minutes today,
in his second game back after being sidelined with a torn anterior
cruciate ligament. Davis said his left knee feels about 90 percent
recovered after being injured last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in the rehab process,'' Davis said. ``I feel real
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the knee bothered him following Friday's practice at
the Pond, Davis said, ``Not at all. Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin said Davis will probably be allowed to play in five-minute
intervals.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first meeting between UCLA and Oklahoma State since
the 1995 Final Four, when the Bruins won 74-61 in a semifinal game
en route to the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Note: About 2,000 tickets remain for today's games, mostly for
the terrace level, at a cost of between $30-$50 apiece. Some $75
seats on the floor level are also available.

LAPD, MARINES PAY TRIBUTE TO FALLEN FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention Houston editors.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before the first words of praise could be said for
slain LAPD Officer Brian Brown on Friday, police officers at his
funeral broke down sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 law enforcement officers stood at attention in
the chapel at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills,
fighting to contain their grief.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their grim faces began to fill with tears.
</P>
<P>
   One officer broke down and rushed through the assembly, taking
refuge near a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' she sobbed, before being consoled by fellow
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Then the eulogies began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had courage, was devoted to his duty, his son and upheld
his highest honor,'' said Los Angeles Police Department Officer
Mike Ventura, a close friend of Brown's.
</P>
<P>
   Before the assembly stood a flag-draped coffin that held the
body of the 27-year-old former Marine and LAPD training officer who
was gunned down Sunday in a shootout with gang members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Brian has been relieved from walking the point and has
been reassigned with other Marines to stand guard at Heaven's
Gate,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   A battery of officers came from across California to pay their
final respects to Brown, the third LAPD officer to die in the line
of duty this year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's parents, Dennis Brown and Emily Calvert, and his son,
Dylon, held each other and covered their faces as Los Angeles
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks handed them the folded flag from the
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   California Highway Patrol Chief Ed Gomez presented Dylon with a
California flag. Mayor Richard Riordan and District Attorney Gil
Garcetti were also in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an unbuttoned Marines jacket, Dylon sat quietly next to
his grandparents during the service.
</P>
<P>
   The morning began with a procession of squad cars and emergency
vehicles through the Hollywood Hills, blue and red lights flashing,
leading the way to the cemetery's Old North Church.
</P>
<P>
   The service commenced as Marines and LAPD officers set Brown's
coffin on a pedestal under the noon sun. Surrounded by flower
arrangements, dignitaries and family members, a portrait of the
slain officer looked out over the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who was in the Marines with Brown, was the first of
four to eulogize him. He recounted events in Somalia on Feb. 25,
1993, that led to Brown earning the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spotting one individual with a rocket-propelled grenade
launcher, Cpl. Brown engaged him and neutralized the threat,''
Ventura said. ``He and another Marine were then struck by
gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was further eulogized as a man full of love, pride and
devotion to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a patrolman is a hard job to do. It involves risks on a
daily basis, dealing with shootouts, carjackings, home-invasion
robberies, rapes and death investigations,'' said narcotics Officer
Keith Krallman, an academy classmate of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of work you can't learn from a book or by
getting a master's degree in criminal justice. It takes guts,
backbone and a desire to help others,'' Krallman said. ``Brian had
all of these traits.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Mike Hillmann, a commander at the 77th Street station,
called Brown a ``silent warrior,'' the kind of person who is
``competent yet humble, has the heart of a lion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is committed to his chosen profession. He is respectful,
courageous and willing to defend his community. The silent warrior
is experienced in conflict and reaches out to people (who) are in
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when it's time to act, he acts reasonably, with precision,
commitment, accuracy and certainly compassion,'' the captain said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 27, died Sunday when a gunman believed to be responsible
for a drive-by shooting opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's partner shot and killed the suspect, a 23-year-old gang
member from Rancho Cucamonga. Officers also shot a
still-unidentified second suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was born in Texas, will be buried at the Houston
National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, trumpeters filled the hall with taps and
helicopters flew overhead in the missing man formation. &QL;

CIA IS FOCUS OF INQUIRY IN CHINA ROCKET CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS.: This article is a late add to the front page of the New York
Times.)  
(js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department is investigating whether the
CIA may have obstructed justice by giving a U.S. electronics
corporation information about a congressional inquiry involving
that company, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigation involves Hughes Electronics
Corp., the officials said. The company has been under congressional
scrutiny regarding the transfer of sensitive U.S. space technology
to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cooperating fully with the Justice Department,'' a CIA
spokesman, Bill Harlow, said Friday evening. He declined to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   As many as eight high-ranking CIA officials, including its
general counsel, Robert McNamara, have agreed to testify next week
before a federal grand jury in Washington about data that the spy
agency supplied earlier this year to Hughes, officials familiar
with the Justice Department operation said.
</P>
<P>
   A threshold question for Justice Department investigators is
whether the CIA, in giving some information to Hughes about the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's inquiry into technology
transfers, might have enabled the company, a division of General
Motors Corp., to anticipate the next moves of the panel's
investigators, thereby thwarting the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the Justice Department's investigation into Hughes
were first reported in Saturday's editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   One CIA official, speaking on condition that he not be
identified, said some agency officials had themselves called
attention to the possible improper transfer of data. Therefore,
that CIA official contended, the agency's culpability may be less
than suggested by the words ``obstruction of justice,'' and may
amount to little more than carelessness or a mix-up in
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The latest investigation, however it turns out, casts yet
another spotlight on the murky terrain where high-tech commerce and
national-security issues intersect.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, which has supplied the CIA with satellites and
ultra-sensitive communications equipment for decades, has been
under increasing scrutiny in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Like other aerospace firms, Hughes launches commercial
satellites atop Chinese rockets because they are much less
expensive than many Western launchers. But some intelligence
experts have been concerned in recent years that Hughes has been
too aggressive in selling high-tech equipment in China, which for
decades was an adversary of the United States and which has key
differences with the United States on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee asked the Justice Department
to begin an investigation after committee staff members became
uneasy about the nature of information the CIA shared with Hughes,
said those officials who confirmed the outline of the Justice
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators have been looking into Hughes in
part because it and another aerospace company shared extensive data
with Chinese engineers after two failed rocket launchings in 1996.
The congressional investigators were sensitive to possible
national-security implications involved in the accident
post-mortems.
</P>
<P>
   When separate suspicions later arose that Chinese interests may
have tried to use campaign donations to meddle in the 1996 U.S.
elections, dealings with Chinese business interests became ever
more sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   While not playing down the significance of the Justice
Department inquiry, one government official cautioned Friday night
against premature conclusions. ``It may look worse than it is,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another official characterized the relaying of information by
the CIA to Hughes as unsurprising, if unfortunate, in view of the
extensive routine business contacts between the spy agency and a
major contractor.

GORDON S. RINGER, 69, JUDGE WHO ORDERED NIXON TO TESTIFY IN '74 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gordon S. Ringer, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge who
tried to force President Richard Nixon to testify in his court in
1974 about a case linked to the Watergate affair, died on Nov. 20
at his home in Long Beach, Calif. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ringer, who retired last year, said on Jan. 29, 1974, that he
would order Nixon to testify in person at the trial of three aides
on charges stemming from a break-in at the office of a psychiatrist
who had treated Daniel Ellsberg, a former government official.
Ellsberg has said he made the Pentagon Papers, a secret history of
the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, available to the
press in 1971 as a way to fuel opposition to U.S. conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The three aides being tried on state charges in Ringer's court
were John Ehrlichman, formerly chief domestic adviser, and David
Young Jr. and G. Gordon Liddy, who were members of a group called
the ``plumbers,'' which was formed by the Nixon White House to
investigate security leaks in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants were charged with conspiracy and burglary
for their role in a break-in in September 1971 in the office of a
psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis Fielding, in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Ehrlichman was in charge of the ``plumbers'' at the time of the
break-in, which was carried out in hopes of finding Ellsberg's
psychiatric history.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said he had established ``the plumbers'' after the
publication of the Pentagon Papers in The New York Times and of
articles elsewhere saying that Ellsberg had been the source of
those documents.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, 1974, Ringer signed legal papers ordering Nixon to
testify at a pretrial hearing and then at the trial itself, on
April 15. Legal experts said they believed the papers were the
first ever issued by a state court to compel the personal testimony
of a president. But, as things turned out, the case was supplanted
by a federal case that led to convictions and prison terms for
Ehrlichman and Liddy.
</P>
<P>
   Ringer was assistant state attorney general in charge of the Los
Angeles office before being appointed to the judgeship in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He married Virginia Hartt in 1953, and she died in 1991.
Surviving is his son, Mark, of Manhattan.

7-ELEVEN: CHILI DOGS, NACHOS, SLURPEES ... FINE WINES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' Californai news file.) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ White goes with chicken and red with beef. But
what's a gourmand to serve with nacho cheese and a microwave
burrito? The answer lies no further than the corner 7-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   To grab a slice of the nation's multibillion-dollar retail wine
market, America's biggest convenience store chain recently started
stocking its shops with up to 30 different wines.
</P>
<P>
   The company is quick to note that these are not the bottles of
Thunderbird and Night Train Express favored by low-budget imbibers.
With price tags ranging from $6 to $15 a bottle, and labels from
the likes of Beringer and Ecco Domani, the 7-Eleven wines are aimed
squarely at the dinner crowd. Racks include educational information
on wine and menu suggestions for different bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for people on their way home from work or on their way
to a special dinner who want to stop by and grab a bottle of
wine,'' said 7-Eleven spokeswoman Dana Manley. ``They can park
right in front of the door and run in.''
</P>
<P>
   From a financial standpoint, analysts say, it's a natural
pairing for 7-Eleven and its parent company, Dallas-based Southland
Corp. U.S. wine sales last year topped $16 billion and wine is the
second-fastest growing beverage category behind soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes a lot of sense,'' said analyst David Maura at First
Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C. 7-Eleven is already the
nation's largest beer retailer. If its roughly 3,200 stores
licensed to carry alcohol sell just a few bottles of wine a week,
it would mean tens of millions more dollars on the company's top
line.
</P>
<P>
   And though its wine sales are never expected to approach that of
beer, by virtue of the chain's size 7-Eleven could quickly become a
major force in the retail wine market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that wine is becoming more mainstream,'' said
Gladys Horiuchi, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based Wine
Institute, a public policy advocacy group for California wineries.
``It's always good to have it in more outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   7-Eleven officials say the rollout of their campaign is under
way and should be complete by early 1999. And for the record,
7-Eleven's Manley said, microwave burritos go best with a chilled
chardonay.

CLINTON LAWYERS SEEKING 3 DAYS FOR HIS DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 5th graf to add timeframe for impeachment vote. )  (th/js) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House Judiciary Committee just a week away
from a scheduled vote on articles of impeachment against President
Clinton, the White House challenged the panel's inquiry Friday
night by requesting several days to present a defense that would
slow the committee's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the committee's invitation to appear next Tuesday,
the president's lawyers sought to broaden the impeachment inquiry
while raising doubts in the public mind about the proceedings'
fairness and scope. They asked for three or four days to call
witnesses and raise questions about the legal and constitutional
basis for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening passage of a letter sent to the Judiciary
Committee on Friday evening, the two top White House lawyers
dealing with impeachment, Charles Ruff and Gregory Craig, said the
stakes were extraordinarily high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of a declaration of war,'' they wrote, ``there is no
more significant or grave constitutional process than the
impeachment inquiry currently under way in your committee. Should
the House of Representatives approve an article of impeachment
against the president and send it to the Senate for trial, the
impact on the national government and on the American people as a
whole would be profound. For that reason alone, this process must
be deliberate, thorough, fair and expeditious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the Illinois Republican who heads the Judiciary
Committee, hopes to have it vote on impeachment late next week. He
did not immediately respond to the White House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the White House letter signaled an effort to present
a vigorous defense of the president against accusations of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power raised by Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel. Many in the White House assume that the
politically polarized committee will vote along party lines to
approve at least one article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The counterarguments the White House hopes to present next week
appear aimed at moderate Republicans who are still trying to decide
whether to vote for impeachment on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision that we want to go up and demonstrate
that these proceedings have not been fair,'' said Joe Lockhart, the
White House press secretary. ``None of the allegations that have
been made rise to the standard of impeachment. It's that simple.
This is not a bank shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart denied that the White House proposal was a delaying
tactic. He said the committee could still vote on articles of
impeachment by the end of next week if the president's lawyers were
allowed four days to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House letter echoes complaints that Clinton's
partisans have raised throughout the process. They maintain that
the committee's Republican majority has conducted a partisan
inquiry that has not provided Clinton an adequate opportunity to
defend himself against the charges raised in Starr's referral.
</P>
<P>
   With the committee rapidly approaching a vote on impeachment,
the White House clearly wants to slow the process and raise issues
it says have been given short shrift in the panel's accelerated
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it wanted to present three panels of
witnesses over three to four days to discuss what constitutes an
impeachable offense, the standards for prosecution of the acts that
Starr has attributed to the president, and prosecutorial
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is essential to the president's defense that we be
able to call our own witnesses and present our own arguments to
address these important questions,'' Clinton's lawyers wrote to the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposed a daylong seminar on each of those
questions but did not disclose any list of witnesses it intended to
call to make its case. The president's lawyers said they would
present a summation of Clinton's defense at the end of the panel
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has contended all along that Clinton's
misleading statements under oath about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky do not constitute perjury, and therefore do not justify
impeachment. The president has steadfastly denied tampering with
witnesses or otherwise obstructing justice, and has also said that
nothing he did constituted abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said the letter to the Judiciary
Committee reflected ``enormous frustration in this building'' with
what this official called the headlong pace and one-sided nature of
the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its defense, the White House wants to use the
hearings next week to showcase once again what it calls Starr's
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr appeared before the committee two weeks ago,
Clinton's lead private lawyer, David Kendall, grilled him for more
than an hour on what Kendall contended were leaks from the
independent counsel's office, intimidation of witnesses, selective
presentation of testimony and deceptive investigative techniques.
Kendall did not raise a single point in defense of the president's
actions, however.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says Kendall was not given enough time to defend
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of one hour of time provided to us for
questioning Mr. Starr at the end of his appearance before the
committee,'' the letter Friday evening read, the White House has
been ``foreclosed from playing any role'' in the impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate,'' the letter concluded, ``that we will require
no more than three to four days of the committee's time to deal
with the topics identified above, at which time counsel for the
president will present a final argument as to why, given the law,
the facts and these circumstances, this committee should not report
out articles of impeachment to the full membership of the House of
Representatives.''

7-ELEVEN: CHILI DOGS, NACHOS, SLURPEES ... FINE WINES?
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: Stresses stores sold wine before in 2nd

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ White goes with chicken and red with beef. But
what's a gourmand to serve with nacho cheese and a microwave
burrito? The answer lies no further than the corner 7-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   To grab a slice of the nation's multibillion-dollar retail wine
market, America's biggest convenience store chain recently started
expanding its selection, and will stock its shops with up to 30
different wines.
</P>
<P>
   The company is quick to note that these are not the bottles of
Thunderbird and Night Train Express favored by low-budget imbibers.
With price tags ranging from $6 to $15 a bottle, and labels from
the likes of Beringer and Ecco Domani, the 7-Eleven wines are aimed
squarely at the dinner crowd. Racks include educational information
on wine and menu suggestions for different bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for people on their way home from work or on their way
to a special dinner who want to stop by and grab a bottle of
wine,'' said 7-Eleven spokeswoman Dana Manley. ``They can park
right in front of the door and run in.''
</P>
<P>
   From a financial standpoint, analysts say, it's a natural
pairing for 7-Eleven and its parent company, Dallas-based Southland
Corp. U.S. wine sales last year topped $16 billion and wine is the
second-fastest growing beverage category behind soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes a lot of sense,'' said analyst David Maura at First
Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C. 7-Eleven is already the
nation's largest beer retailer. If its roughly 3,200 stores
licensed to carry alcohol sell just a few bottles of wine a week,
it would mean tens of millions more dollars on the company's top
line.
</P>
<P>
   And though its wine sales are never expected to approach that of
beer, by virtue of the chain's size 7-Eleven could quickly become a
major force in the retail wine market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that wine is becoming more mainstream,'' said
Gladys Horiuchi, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based Wine
Institute, a public policy advocacy group for California wineries.
``It's always good to have it in more outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   7-Eleven officials say the rollout of their campaign is under
way and should be complete by early 1999. And for the record,
7-Eleven's Manley said, microwave burritos go best with a chilled
chardonay.

MUHAMMED FLIES TO U.S. MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Sabir Muhammad, 22, set an American
short-course record of 52.42 seconds in the 100-meter butterfly
last night at the U.S. Open Swimming Championships.
</P>
<P>
   In the four days of the FINA World Cup and U.S. Open, Muhammad
has set two American records and one meet record, but he's not
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   He won't be for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've learned is that this is all really
insignificant,'' Muhammad said. ``My main goal right now is the
Olympic Trials and representing the United States in Sydney. If I'm
able to do that, I've accomplished my greatest goal.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Muhammad became only the fourth African-American to
make the U.S. National Team, but a disastrous Olympic Trials
prevented him from representing the United States at the Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad now trains with USA Swimming's resident training team
in Colorado. He finished second to Australian Geoff Huegill (23.73
seconds) in the 50-meter butterfly at the World Cup earlier in the
week, but still set an American record with his time of 23.75.
</P>
<P>
   His goal yesterday was another record in the 100 fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I dove into that final, the first thing that hit my mind
was, `Wow, I'm really tired,' '' said Muhammad who has been
competing for four days. ``I said, `Keep going, you're not as tired
as you think.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A total of six American records have fallen during two days of
U.S. Open action. Last night, a U.S. Open mark and two American
records fell.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Davis, 26, picked up his third American record in three
days when he won the 200-meter freestyle in 1:45.24, breaking the
record of 1:45.54 set 10 years ago by Troy Dalbey.
</P>
<P>
   It was Davis' 21st race in four days, and the exhausted Austin
resident was happy to be heading home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than I could hope for,'' Davis said. ``I've been
on the National team for eight years,and these are my first
American records. Tonight I thought ... I could command the
race,and I went out a little slower so I'd have more coming back.
It paid off. Those were the three-tenths I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Coughlin, 16, won the 100-meter backstroke in 58.59,
setting a U.S. Open record, but it was her dramatic .14-second
victory over Olympian Cristina Teuscher, 20, in the 400-individual
medley that grabbed attention.
</P>
<P>
   On the butterfly and backstroke, Coughlin, a Kansas City
resident, was a body-length ahead of Teuscher, but the Olympian
made an attack on the breast stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the breast and freestyle, I was just trying to hold her
off as much as possible and spin my arms and make it to that wall
before her,'' said Couglin who won in 4:36.24. She also won the
200-meter backstroke in U.S. Open record time the night before. ``I
was really excited because she's such a good swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open concludes today at the Texas A&AMP;M University
Student Recreation Center.

REELING KINGS TO FACE BIG TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings have lost 10 of their past
11 games, have scored three goals in their past four games, have
scored one goal in their past nine first periods, and on and on the
litany of misery goes. And tonight at the Forum, the Kings (6-16-3)
will try to shake themselves awake enough to face the NHL's best
and deepest team since Wayne Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do about it but start preparing for
it,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson said of tonight's meeting with the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings. ``We'll
be ready for them at home. That's all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Kings suffered a 3-1 setback to the Ottawa
Senators in Kanata, Ontario. They outshot Ottawa 32-18, and if not
for an outstanding performance by Senators goalie Ron Tugnutt, the
Kings might have sealed a victory in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first game in 15 or 16 games where we gave
ourselves a good chance to win,'' defenseman Mattias Norstrom said.
``I don't think we did that earlier. Instead of going after teams,
we were waiting for things to happen and things went downhill.
(Against Ottawa) we showed a different attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are going bad and you're playing without
confidence, that's typical,'' said Norstrom, who teamed with Sean
O'Donnell on the blunder that resulted in Ottawa's first goal, by
Andreas Johansson. ``We played strong, didn't have a lot of
turnovers, and we had one there and boom, it's in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   But playing well in defeat will not get the Kings into the
postseason. In fact, it is reaching a point where it almost is
imperative that the Kings begin their turnaround if they are to
qualify for the playoffs for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western
Conference went to the San Jose Sharks, who finished the season
with 34 victories and 78 points. For the Kings to match those
modest totals, they would have to go 28-22-7 (a .553 winning
percentage) in their final 57 games. Including the final 25 games
last season, four playoff losses and the first 25 games this
season, the Kings are an abominable 17-33-4 (.352) in their last 54
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like playoff time,'' left wing Luc Robitaille said,
referring to the final four-plus months of the regular season. ``If
we want to make the playoffs, we've got to win this month. We've
got to fight every game like it's the last game.''

TEEN-AGER CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER IN PARK SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A teen-ager was found guilty of first-degree
manslaughter Friday in the grisly slaying of a 44-year-old Upper
East Side man who was stabbed, eviscerated and left floating in a
lake in Central Park in May 1997. The teen-ager, Christopher
Vasquez, was acquitted of a more serious charge, second-degree
murder, and faces a sentence of 3-and-one-third years to 10 years
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict meant that neither of the two teen-agers accused in
the killing _ Vasquez and Daphne Abdela, both 16 _ was found guilty
of intentionally murdering Michael McMorrow, even though he was
stabbed 34 times during the attack and suffered six stab wounds to
the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, who showed little emotion when the verdict was read,
will be sentenced in January.
</P>
<P>
   The question of which teen-ager delivered the fatal blows
dominated Vasquez's trial. Arnold Kriss, Vasquez's lawyer, accused
Ms. Abdela of carrying out the murder and using Vasquez as a
scapegoat. But in deciding to try Vasquez, prosecutors made clear
that they accepted Ms. Abdela's statements that Vasquez inflicted
the fatal stab wounds and that she played only a minor role in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea bargain that was criticized by jurors, prosecutors
allowed Ms. Abdela to plead guilty last March to first-degree
manslaughter but did not require her to testify against Vasquez at
his trial.
</P>
<P>
   A juror, speaking Friday night on the condition of anonymity,
said the failure of Ms. Abdela to testify complicated their efforts
to decide whether Vasquez had committed the murder..
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest problems was that Daphne Abdela was not
available and there was nothing to guide us through it,'' the juror
said. ``We just felt that we couldn't be sure what happened and
were not 100 percent positive that he committed a murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, who spoke Friday night on the condition of
anonymity, said some of the jurors felt that Ms. Abdela was the
murderer. The juror said that an outright acquittal of Vasquez was
debated during ``extremely emotional, extremely painful''
deliberations over three days. Four jurors wept as the verdict was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The juror, who said the panel felt great sympathy for McMorrow's
family, called the decision to allow Ms. Abdela to enter a plea
without testifying at a trial wrong and offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone walked away without being convicted'' of murder, the
juror said. ``The jury had the opportunity to try Christopher
Vasquez and acquitted him. The jury did not have the opportunity to
try Daphne Abdela.''
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was announced, relatives of McMorrow said they
believed that Vasquez had escaped justice. Matthew McMorrow, the
victim's 19-year-old nephew, said: ``There is no doubt in our minds
that Christopher Vasquez killed Michael in cold blood. All the
evidence points to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vasquez's relatives, while expressing sympathy for the
McMorrow family, praised the verdict. Michael Tantillo, Vasquez's
uncle, said that Vasquez did not carry out the killings and thanked
the jury. ``They did the right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Who is responsible for delivering the fatal blows may never be
known.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez and Ms. Abdela met only three weeks before the killing
while watching a fight in Central Park, friends said. The two
teen-agers, now forever linked by the killing, could not be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez spent most of his childhood at home in his family's
walk-up apartment on the Upper East Side after agoraphobia _ a fear
of public places _ was diagnosed when he was 9. Ms. Abdela, by
contrast, grew up in a wealthy family on Central Park West and was
brash and aggressive, according to friends of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Recriminations over who was responsible for the killing
continued after the verdict was announced, focusing on a series of
statements Vasquez reportedly made to psychiatrists and
psychologists after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez's statements in those evaluations were sealed, and would
have been made public only if his lawyer, Kriss, chose to adopt a
psychiatric defense.
</P>
<P>
   But two law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that in those interviews with the psychiatrists and
psychologists, Vasquez confessed to the killing, giving an account
that matched Ms. Abdela's. The officials said the fact that
Vasquez's account, as well as evidence from the scene, corroborated
Ms. Abdela's account led to the plea bargain.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kriss said that the psychiatric reports were sealed material and
that he would not disclose their contents. He angrily criticized
law enforcement officials for commenting on Vasquez's statements
after the trial concluded. And he warned that Vasquez's state of
mind at the time should be taken in context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people say things at one point in time when they are
under a lot of different stresses,'' he said, adding that police
reports and the evidence at the scene did not match Vasquez's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence produced at the trial included a cut finger and
facial bruises that Vasquez suffered on the night of the murder.
Vasquez's blood was found at the scene and a knife was found in his
bedroom that had his DNA and McMorrow's DNA on the blade.
</P>
<P>
   The defense suggested that Vasquez may have injured himself in
ways other than an assault. Investigators failed to test the handle
of the knife, which created some doubts on the panel, a juror said.
``There were a lot pieces that did not point conclusively to him,''
the juror said of Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   The cut on Vasquez's hand, the juror said, pointed to at least
some involvement by him in the attack and led them to conclude that
manslaughter was the proper verdict.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Kriss hammered away at the fact that an abrupt
attack did not fit the actions of Vasquez, who witnesses described
as shy and passive. Witnesses said Ms. Abdela tried to pick fights
with several adults on the night of the murder before the two
bumped into McMorrow. Kriss also repeatedly pointed out that Ms.
Abdela had McMorrow's blood on her Rollerblades and Vasquez did
not, as evidence that she carried out the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that according to Ms. Abdela, the
fatal confrontation erupted on the night of May 22, 1997, when she
kissed McMorrow in the gazebo on the lake in Central Park as
Vasquez looked on. Law enforcement officials said they believe that
Vasquez was romantically interested in Ms. Abdela and that the
evidence backs her account.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Abdela, Vasquez flew into a rage and began
attacking the older man with a knife. Ms. Abdela said she joined
the attack and twice kicked McMorrow's feet out from under him.
</P>
<P>
   Kriss said he wished he had had the opportunity to cross-examine
Ms. Abdela on the stand and prove that the account of the killing
she and law enforcement officials are putting forward is incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors appeared to shift their position on the issue of Ms.
Abdela's testimony. In March, an assistant district attorney, Sarah
Hines, agreed to the plea agreement that did not require Ms.
Abdela's testimony. But another assistant district attorney,
Matthew Bogdanos, who prosecuted the case against Vasquez, met with
Ms. Abdela in prison this summer to try to talk her into testifying
voluntarily at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, the prominent defense lawyer who negotiated
Ms. Abdela's plea agreement, said she would not testify in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael Corriero ruled that prosecutors could introduce as
evidence portions of Ms. Abdela's statement blaming Vasquez. But he
also allowed Kriss to introduce other material that called into

   SANTA BARBARA _ A couple nights back, maybe last week, this
wouldn't have been the situation Elias Ayuso wanted to find himself
in _ his USC team struggling, the Trojans needing him to hit clutch
shots with a game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   But Ayuso shed his shooting slump and found his shot at just the
right moment Friday, and his barrage of second-half 3-pointers
helped the Trojans hold off scrappy UC Santa Barbara, 79-73 before
4,563 at the Thunderdome.
</P>
<P>
   The winless, but clearly inspired Gauchos had the undefeated
Trojans off-kilter, and had tied the game at 60 with 6:43 left. But
Ayuso hit a quick pair of 3s and scored 10 of his 21 points in the
last 5 minutes to help the Trojans (5-0) avert catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just gives you a lot of confidence, when down the stretch
you come in and knock shots down,'' Ayuso said. ``I've been
struggling. Go and look at my stats.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at the stats showed Ayuso wasn't exaggerating.
Coming in, he had shot 37.5 percent from the field, and 5 of 20
from 3-point range. His struggles continued Friday, as he hit just
2 of 7 in the first half. He stepped up his game just in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to step it up from the beginning. Like coach said, they
can't wait for me to get warmed up at the end of the game,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ayuso could shoulder the blame for a surprisingly close
contest. The Trojans were outrebounded 48-38 and shot just 41.3
percent as a team. Their failures didn't result in a loss only
because the Gauchos shot 38.6 percent from the field and 66.7
percent from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what kind of game we would be in,'' USC coach Henry
Bibby said. ``This team that we played tonight is better than their
record indicates. They gave us everything they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara's B.J. Bunton had his way in the paint all night,
scoring 22 points to go along with 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trojans eventually overwhelmed the Gauchos (0-6) with a
superior perimeter game, as Ayuso and Brandon Granville combined to
hit 10 of 19 3-point attempts. Granville finished with a
career-high 22 points, and Jeff Trepagnier also hit a career best
with 19.
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier scored 15 in the first half. ``Unbelievable,'' Bibby
said. ``One of the best first halves I've seen in college
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans needed it. They played without starting forward
Jarvis Turner and reserve guard Quincy Wilder, both suspended one
game for missing classes this week.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Turner, averaging 9.2 points and one of only two
senior starters, was certainly evident in the first half, when the
Trojans squandered a double-digit lead and settled for a 43-40,
margin.
</P>
<P>
   So eager was Bibby to leave the floor after the first half, he
took his team into the locker room before the half even ended.
Brian Scalabrine had fouled Bunton at the buzzer, and rather than
watch, Bibby ushered the Trojans off the floor before Bunton made
both foul shots to cut the lead to 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   The game hadn't been that close since the opening five minutes.
USC held a creaky two-point lead early on before mounting an 11-2
run to make it 22-11. The Trojans would push the margin to 12
points, 36-24, before the Gauchos made it a game again.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara outscored USC 16-7 to close out the half, and 9-3
in the last four minutes, with Bunton scoring six of his 10
first-half points in that span.

Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-ASSESS (New Delhi, India) _ News analysis: The Hindu
nationalists who lead India's government were trounced in state
elections last week because of their failure to deliver on
pocketbook economic issues, but the defeats, which weakened their
already tenuous grip on power at the national level, are also
likely to make it more difficult for them to sign the nuclear test
ban treaty. By Celia W. Dugger.

   NIGERIA-VOTE (Lagos, Nigeria) _ Nationwide local elections will
be held on Saturday, the first step on the road that's to lead to a
free presidential election next year. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-BEERWAR (Nairobi, Kenya) _ There is a beer war on in East
Africa. South African Breweries, the biggest brewer in Africa, has
decided to take on Tusker, a local Kenya brew, and in early October
began churning out half-liter bottles from a new plant outside
Nairobi. Tusker is in turn nearly half owned by Guinness, the giant
brewer and producer of clever marketing. In two months, the battle
has become about more than beer: it touches on Kenya's tenuous
sense of nationalism. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-POLITICS (Taipei) _ In a country that has enjoyed
democracy for less than a decade, an epic mayoral battle is being
fought here in the capital between two rising political stars. The
battle has drawn the attention of Beijing and Washington, where
officials worry that the result could upset Taiwan's precarious
standoff with mainland China. By Erik Eckholm. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   TERRORISM-SUSPECT (Munich, Germany) _ The reasons Mamdouh Mahmud
Salim gives for coming here a few months ago are at once prosaic
and touching: he wanted to buy a Mercedes, and find a wife. To U.S.
authorities, Salim is an international terrorist who came to
Germany to carry out an attack on the U.S. consulate in Hamburg.
The Americans also say he is a member of Al Qaeda, the terrorist
group led by Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of organizing the
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August. By

</P>
<P>
   EVERGLADES (Miami) _ The way some neighbors tell it, the area on
the edge of Everglades National Park known as East Everglades has
all the charm of a swamp, but the same neighbors describe the
bright side of this lifestyle with words like ``magical'' and
``breathtaking.'' That way of life is about to end. The rural
neighborhood stands in the way of a multi-billion-dollar effort to
repair the vast expanse of unique wetlands that is the Everglades.
Last month, officials with the South Florida Water Management
District voted to spend up to $100 million to buy out about 1,400
landowners and clear out the 8 1/2-square-mile East Everglades area
by the year 2002, part of an $8 billion project to save the
Everglades. By Mireya Navarro. (With photos and map.)

<P>
   CENSURE (Washington) _ President Clinton's fate in the House now
hinges on the decisions of a small group of Republican moderates
who could tilt an impeachment vote either way. With Republican
leaders likely to prevent any vote on censure, both Republicans and
Democrats who are trying to count votes say that a House vote on a
single count article of impeachment, on perjury, is too close to
call. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH (Washington) _ With the House Judiciary Committee just a

   HEALTH-INSURANCE (Washington) _ The 16 million people under 65
who have to buy their own health insurance are facing increases of
40 percent or more this fall. Self-employed, unemployed, working
for small employers who do not offer health insurance, or retired
early, often because of poor health, these people are a step away
from joining the nation's 43.4 million uninsured, too young for
Medicare, the federal insurance for the elderly, not poor enough

SUPPORT GROWING FOR CANCELING CENTRAL AMERICAN DEBT  
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
As Nicaragua and Honduras begin the long, herculean task of
repairing the damage from Hurricane Mitch, they will be hobbled by
a much bigger burden: their foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   This multibillion-dollar obligation was tough enough even before
the storm wrecked the two nations, which have long been among the
poorest in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, politicians and civic leaders in the region _ and in
foreign lending countries _ are saying the debt is unpayable and
must be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras, which has total foreign obligations of $4.7 billion,
paid $539 million in debt service last year, about one-third of the
country's total export earnings. Nicaragua, which owes $5.9
billion, paid $349 million last year, nearly one-half of exports.
</P>
<P>
   After the hurricane, France, Cuba and Spain canceled bilateral
debts (those owed directly from one country to another) held by
Honduras and Nicaragua. The United States is allowing the two
countries to postpone bilateral debt payments for the next two
years, and the International Monetary Fund has said it will try to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers demand more, saying foreign donors must give
their aid as unconditional grants rather than loans that are
conditioned on adherence to budget-cutting, free-market economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to make debt payments and adhere to IMF-imposed
austerity measures helped degrade (Nicaragua's) emergency response
capacity,'' said Alejandro Bendana, director of the Center for
International Studies, a Managua think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of budget cuts, our civil defense agency is woefully
understaffed and has no units whatsoever in at least one-third of
the municipalities. Even the national police, which forms the
backbone of any emergency response, got less than one-third of what
it had requested during the most recent budget agreement. We need
immediate cancellation of this unjust, unpayable debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The donors will give their answer next week, at a conference in
Washington of Central American leaders and officials of the IMF,
the World Bank, the United States and other major lenders and
donors.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expects the Central Americans to be offered more than
a tiny fraction of the $4 billion they need to rebuild. Although
some new aid may be announced, international financiers have made
clear their belief that more belt-tightening, not debt
cancellation, is the cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great wisdom and courage, this government decided that
however great the dimensions of this disaster, it would not heap
disaster upon disaster by abandoning its course,'' IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus said after meeting Nicaraguan President
Arnoldo Aleman in Managua, whom he praised for sticking with an
IMF-designed austerity plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, support for writing off all the Honduran
and Nicaraguan debt is growing. Former President Jimmy Carter has
voiced support, as has Jubilee 2000, a coalition of major churches
and nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, has taken a leading role in
Congress in supporting long-term U.S. reconstruction aid and debt
cancellation. As the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign
Appropriations Subcommittee, she will play a crucial role in
winning support for the new aid package, which is expected to be
introduced in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States would show great leadership by forgiving the
Honduran and Nicaraguan debt,'' said Pelosi.
</P>
<P>
   But two big hurdles exist: The Republicans are demanding that
any new funds for hurricane aid or debt cancellation be subtracted
from other countries' allotments, and total U.S. aid to Latin
America has already been cut by half since 1988, to $570 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the money going to come from?'' Pelosi asked. ``It's
going to be hard, but we'll do whatever we can to find it.''

NOAM CHOMSKY DID IT, NOW HE'S UNDOING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing)  
(th) 
 By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Noam Chomsky is spinning a fable.
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky, linguist, teacher, author and social critic, is sitting
in a pose so customary it has been captured in scores of
photographs taken since he upended the study of language 40 years
ago. He leans slightly back in his chair, one foot propped on the
pulled-out bottom drawer of his desk, hands aloft.
</P>
<P>
   His office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology exudes
both a Spartan asceticism and a pleasant disorderliness: the
primary decor consists of piles of paper on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Chomsky says, that some divine superengineer, in a
single efficient stroke, endowed humans with the power of language
where formerly they had none.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of a single, brilliantly designed language mechanism
is the cornerstone of Chomsky's newest _ and most unconventional _
approach to the discipline he founded in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky, who turns 70 on Dec. 7, is the father of modern
linguistics and remains the field's most influential practitioner.
Although he has revised his theoretical framework over the years,
no modification is as dramatic as the present one, called the
Minimalist Program, in which he largely breaks with the last four
decades of his own work.
</P>
<P>
   The Minimalist Program, said the linguist Morris Halle,
Chomsky's longtime colleague at MIT, ``is the most radical thing
I've ever heard anybody say in linguistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Chomsky's method has changed, his fundamental mission has
remained the same: to construct a symbolic representation of the
``language faculty'' _ the inborn mental endowment that allows
human beings to acquire, use and understand language.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike its predecessors, the Minimalist Program (or
Minimalism for short) seeks to do this in the most streamlined way
possible, dispensing with concepts that were more or less canonical
in Chomsky's earlier work, like ``deep structure'' and ``surface
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the properties which were explained in terms of deep and
surface structure were really mistakenly described,'' Chomsky said.
``And they ought to be explained, and maybe can be explained
better, without postulating these systems.'' Linguists hope his new
approach is the start of a major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   A slender, sharp-featured man with graying wavy hair and
wire-rimmed glasses, Chomsky was dressed casually on this morning
in a sweater, running shoes and corduroy trousers. His voice is
soft and measured, and he speaks as he writes, in perfectly formed
sentences that spin out into page-long, reasoned paragraphs. To be
in Chomsky's presence, a colleague once said, is to see ``the
overwhelming picture of Rational Man standing before you.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory of language that Chomsky introduced in 1957, often
called the Chomsky revolution, has been equated with Darwin's
theory of evolution and Freud's theory of the unconscious in terms
of its importance in the history of ideas: it was the first
concerted approach to investigating the human mind through a
systematic study of how people produce and understand sentences.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of this century, structural linguistics
reigned as the field's dominant methodology. Structuralism viewed
language as a purely social phenomenon, like tool making or table
manners. Deeper questions of language and mind, including how young
children can dope out their native language from the wash of adult
talk surrounding them, were never considered.
</P>
<P>
   But Chomsky was deeply troubled by this account. In the
mid-1950s he began wrestling with questions he felt the
structuralists could not answer: If language was simply learned
behavior, what gave people the ability to produce and understand an
infinite number of sentences, including those that had never before
been uttered? How did children acquire language seemingly
spontaneously, without being overtly taught?
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky was by nature a questioner _ and, where he deemed
necessary, an exploder _ of received truths. Over the years, this
trait became evident in his political work, including his early
opposition to the Vietnam War, his outspoken condemnation of U.S.
policy in Central America, East Timor and elsewhere, and his
castigation of the mainstream news media in general (and The New
York Times in particular) for what he describes as complicity with
governmental and business interests.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to taking on 50 years of structural linguistics,
Chomsky was singularly well suited for the task. Growing up in
Philadelphia, he was exposed to language scholarship firsthand
through the work of his father, William, an eminent Hebraist. As an
undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, Chomsky studied
linguistics, mathematics and philosophy, setting the foundation for
his novel perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Language, Chomsky came to believe, was rooted not in behavior
but in biology _ in an inborn set of principles that speakers
unconsciously draw on whenever they produce or understand
sentences. The goal of linguistics, he argued, should be to
reproduce these principles.
</P>
<P>
   Since one couldn't go mucking around in people's brains, the
linguist would attempt to mirror the workings of these inborn
principles with a set of abstract, quasi-mathematical rules
intended to generate the range of possible sentences in a given
language _ in other words, a generative grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, the aim of linguistics was to formulate not
just the grammars of specific languages but a ``universal grammar''
as well _ a model of the shared properties that underpin all human
language. It is these universal principles, Chomsky argued, that
all people are ``born knowing'' and that allow children to acquire
whatever native language they're exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Chomsky ushered in modern linguistics with
the publication of the monograph ``Syntactic Structures'' (1957),
which set forth the theory of generative grammar.
</P>
<P>
   But early generative grammar was a rococo device. It posited an
unconscious level of linguistic knowledge (the deep structure),
which was distinct from what people actually say (the surface
structure). It also contained a vast set of grammatical operations,
called transformations, used to produce the range of constructions
found in actual speech: questions, statements and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But this thicket of rules presented a major obstacle to the
development of universal grammar. A true universal grammar, Chomsky
argued, must satisfy two conditions. The first requires it to be
detailed enough to describe any possible construction in any human
language: questions in Navajo, passive sentences in Japanese,
relative clauses in Urdu. This is called the condition of
``descriptive adequacy.''

   For years, linguistic research was snagged between these two
competing demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire development of Chomskyan generative grammar is a
history of tension between descriptive and explanatory adequacy,''
said Howard Lasnik, a professor of linguistics at the University of
Connecticut and a frequent collaborator of Chomsky's. ``In order to
have a descriptively adequate theory of language, you need to have
a rich variety of descriptive devices available. But here's the
kicker: The more devices available, the harder the child's task in
sorting through the maze of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   This impasse persisted until the early 1980s, when Chomsky
partly resolved it with a more streamlined framework called
Principles and Parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were discovering completely new and unexpected
properties of languages,'' he said. ``It was beginning to become
possible to find what at some level we know must be true: that
they're all cast in the same mold, otherwise you couldn't learn any
of them. And though they look extremely different, you began to see
how they really were variations on the same theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of this work, the Minimalist Program emerged in the early
1990s. Minimalism takes as its point of departure an essential fact
about language: it is a system of communication connecting sound
and meaning. Now comes the unorthodox part: Minimalism speculates
that this system has been optimally designed _ that the connection
of sound to meaning was forged as simply as possible, as by the
divine superengineer of Chomsky's fable.
</P>
<P>
   Any theory of language, therefore, should reflect this simple
design. To that end, Minimalism jettisons most of the baggage of
early Chomskyan grammar. What remains is a single, multipurpose
mechanism used to generate the same rich array of sentences that
transformations did.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the Minimalist Program will do what earlier models
could not: be both simple and complex enough to fulfill the
competing demands of a true universal grammar. Some linguists say
it holds out at least a tentative promise.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, find Chomsky's new program difficult to work
in, and they continue to use alternative models that have sprung up
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a whole lot of linguists who have adopted it
and seem _ for reasons that are incomprehensible to me _ to find it
attractive,'' said James McCawley, a prominent linguist at the
University of Chicago. ``There are others, like me, who find it
completely unintelligible.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chomsky is quick to point out, Minimalism is years away from
being a full-fledged theory (hence the term program). ``It's
difficult, and it's also a shot in the dark,'' he said. ``You don't
have any particular reason to believe that it's going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Should it succeed, however, he will be that much closer to
realizing the goal he set for his field 40 years ago. ``The
subject,'' Chomsky said, ``is trying to find out how humans really
work.''

NOAM CHOMSKY DID IT, NOW HE'S UNDOING IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Repeating for all needing. This story originally moved Friday,
Dec. 4, in the ``e'' news file.) 
(th) 
 By MARGALIT FOX    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Noam Chomsky is spinning a fable.
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky, linguist, teacher, author and social critic, is sitting
in a pose so customary it has been captured in scores of
photographs taken since he upended the study of language 40 years
ago. He leans slightly back in his chair, one foot propped on the
pulled-out bottom drawer of his desk, hands aloft.
</P>
<P>
   His office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology exudes
both a Spartan asceticism and a pleasant disorderliness: the
primary decor consists of piles of paper on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Chomsky says, that some divine superengineer, in a
single efficient stroke, endowed humans with the power of language
where formerly they had none.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of a single, brilliantly designed language mechanism
is the cornerstone of Chomsky's newest _ and most unconventional _
approach to the discipline he founded in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky, who turns 70 on Dec. 7, is the father of modern
linguistics and remains the field's most influential practitioner.
Although he has revised his theoretical framework over the years,
no modification is as dramatic as the present one, called the
Minimalist Program, in which he largely breaks with the last four
decades of his own work.
</P>
<P>
   The Minimalist Program, said the linguist Morris Halle,
Chomsky's longtime colleague at MIT, ``is the most radical thing
I've ever heard anybody say in linguistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Chomsky's method has changed, his fundamental mission has
remained the same: to construct a symbolic representation of the
``language faculty'' _ the inborn mental endowment that allows
human beings to acquire, use and understand language.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike its predecessors, the Minimalist Program (or
Minimalism for short) seeks to do this in the most streamlined way
possible, dispensing with concepts that were more or less canonical
in Chomsky's earlier work, like ``deep structure'' and ``surface
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the properties which were explained in terms of deep and
surface structure were really mistakenly described,'' Chomsky said.
``And they ought to be explained, and maybe can be explained
better, without postulating these systems.'' Linguists hope his new
approach is the start of a major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   A slender, sharp-featured man with graying wavy hair and
wire-rimmed glasses, Chomsky was dressed casually on this morning
in a sweater, running shoes and corduroy trousers. His voice is
soft and measured, and he speaks as he writes, in perfectly formed
sentences that spin out into page-long, reasoned paragraphs. To be
in Chomsky's presence, a colleague once said, is to see ``the
overwhelming picture of Rational Man standing before you.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory of language that Chomsky introduced in 1957, often
called the Chomsky revolution, has been equated with Darwin's
theory of evolution and Freud's theory of the unconscious in terms
of its importance in the history of ideas: it was the first
concerted approach to investigating the human mind through a
systematic study of how people produce and understand sentences.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of this century, structural linguistics
reigned as the field's dominant methodology. Structuralism viewed
language as a purely social phenomenon, like tool making or table
manners. Deeper questions of language and mind, including how young
children can dope out their native language from the wash of adult
talk surrounding them, were never considered.
</P>
<P>
   But Chomsky was deeply troubled by this account. In the
mid-1950s he began wrestling with questions he felt the
structuralists could not answer: If language was simply learned
behavior, what gave people the ability to produce and understand an
infinite number of sentences, including those that had never before
been uttered? How did children acquire language seemingly
spontaneously, without being overtly taught?
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky was by nature a questioner _ and, where he deemed
necessary, an exploder _ of received truths. Over the years, this
trait became evident in his political work, including his early
opposition to the Vietnam War, his outspoken condemnation of U.S.
policy in Central America, East Timor and elsewhere, and his
castigation of the mainstream news media in general (and The New
York Times in particular) for what he describes as complicity with
governmental and business interests.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to taking on 50 years of structural linguistics,
Chomsky was singularly well suited for the task. Growing up in
Philadelphia, he was exposed to language scholarship firsthand
through the work of his father, William, an eminent Hebraist. As an
undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, Chomsky studied
linguistics, mathematics and philosophy, setting the foundation for
his novel perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Language, Chomsky came to believe, was rooted not in behavior
but in biology _ in an inborn set of principles that speakers
unconsciously draw on whenever they produce or understand
sentences. The goal of linguistics, he argued, should be to
reproduce these principles.
</P>
<P>
   Since one couldn't go mucking around in people's brains, the
linguist would attempt to mirror the workings of these inborn
principles with a set of abstract, quasi-mathematical rules
intended to generate the range of possible sentences in a given
language _ in other words, a generative grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, the aim of linguistics was to formulate not
just the grammars of specific languages but a ``universal grammar''
as well _ a model of the shared properties that underpin all human
language. It is these universal principles, Chomsky argued, that
all people are ``born knowing'' and that allow children to acquire
whatever native language they're exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Chomsky ushered in modern linguistics with
the publication of the monograph ``Syntactic Structures'' (1957),
which set forth the theory of generative grammar.
</P>
<P>
   But early generative grammar was a rococo device. It posited an
unconscious level of linguistic knowledge (the deep structure),
which was distinct from what people actually say (the surface
structure). It also contained a vast set of grammatical operations,
called transformations, used to produce the range of constructions
found in actual speech: questions, statements and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But this thicket of rules presented a major obstacle to the
development of universal grammar. A true universal grammar, Chomsky
argued, must satisfy two conditions. The first requires it to be
detailed enough to describe any possible construction in any human
language: questions in Navajo, passive sentences in Japanese,
relative clauses in Urdu. This is called the condition of
``descriptive adequacy.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the second condition, known as ``explanatory
adequacy,'' required the grammar to be simple enough to reflect the
small set of inborn principles that allow humans to acquire and use
language.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For years, linguistic research was snagged between these two
competing demands.

COMMENTARY: WHEN TRUTH MATTERS LESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Most of the suspects hauled into the treacherous
confines of the criminal justice system are guilty. They are not
all treated fairly, but for the most part they have committed the
crimes for which they are prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But some are innocent. And the system _ a huge, grinding
bureaucracy dominated by politicians and other officials anxious to
show they are tougher than Dirty Harry _ does a terrible job of
identifying and protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor in New Jersey once told me: ``I can't go to the
voters and tell them the evidence is ambiguous. When a crime is
committed, somebody has got to pay. Most of the time we get the
right guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want to hear the word, ``guilty.'' They don't want
to hear, ``You've got the wrong man, or the wrong woman, or the
wrong kid.''
</P>
<P>
   So you get cases like that of Lacresha Murray, an 11-year-old
girl who was arrested and subsequently tried, convicted and
sentenced to 25 years in prison for the beating death of a
2{-year-old girl, despite the absence of any witnesses or physical
evidence linking her to the crime, and despite the strong
likelihood that she was physically incapable of inflicting the
fatal injury, namely the splitting of the child's liver.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, in an editorial Friday on the Sam Sheppard
case, referred to the ``evil of a legal system when it is blind to
innocence.'' In that case, despite DNA evidence indicating another
man killed Sheppard's wife, the prosecution continues to fight
efforts to exonerate Sheppard. ``Rarely,'' the editorial said, ``do
prosecutors admit that devastating mistakes were made even in cases
decades old.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha's first conviction was overturned by the trial judge,
John Dietz, who said, ``I had a question as to whether justice was
done.'' In the period between the first and second trials, the
prosecution produced an ``expert,'' Dr. Vincent DiMaio, who looked
at photos of the dead child, Jayla Belton, and determined that
certain bruises ``matched'' the tread on tennis shoes worn by
Lacresha.
</P>
<P>
   No mention of the tennis shoes had been made at the first trial.
None whatsoever. Prosecutors acknowledged during interviews on
Thursday that they had no idea the tennis shoes might have been
involved until DiMaio declared, ``Here is your murder weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's testimony at the second trial was crucial because
officials at the state crime lab said they could see no match and
declined to testify.
</P>
<P>
   It would later be revealed that DiMaio's idea of a match differs
from that of the average person. In a letter to Keith Hampton, the
lawyer who is handling Lacresha's appeal, DiMaio explained what he
meant by a match. The letter is quoted in Hampton's appellant's
brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a match may be unique, as in the case of a fingerprint,
it does not have to be,'' DiMaio wrote. ``The analogy that I gave
was that if a convenience store was robbed by two individuals
described as `white males,' then both White (a colleague of
Hampton's) and you `matched' that description because you both were
white males.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that? If two white guys held up a store, any two white guys
would constitute a ``match'' of the holdupmen. This is the kind of
kindling that blazes into miscarriages of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were never made aware of DiMaio's incredibly broad
definition of a match. When I asked Ronnie Earle, the district
attorney of Travis County, and several of his assistants if they
had known about DiMaio's analogy, they expressed puzzlement. They
apparently had never heard it. One of the assistants continues to
refer to the sneakers and the bruises as ``a perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   I recently asked Dietz if, after presiding over two trials, he
was convinced that Lacresha Murray was guilty. There was a long
pause. And then the judge said he didn't think he should answer
because the case is still on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the case bothered him. He noted,
among other things, that Derrick Shaw, Jayla's stepfather, ``was
not a paragon of virtue, and neither was the mother.'' Referring to
the fact that Jayla weighed only about 20 pounds, the judge said:
``It wasn't just that she was small. I just don't think she was
being cared for very well. But anyway.''

   WASHINGTON _ If only we could order self-sacrifice from the
Sharper Image catalog. If only it could arrive by UPS next-day,
along with the exfoliating foot cream and the portable shoulder &AMP;
neck massager and the designer dog-biscuit mix.
</P>
<P>
   Your very own landing on Omaha Beach, just $3,999.99, for the
man who has everything. Or maybe just some of the sand, for $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, we baby boomers are content fooling around with the
accessories and amenities of our life style. But every so often, we
get that queasy feeling that we have become too much like ourselves
_ indulged too much, challenged too little. We are overmarketed,
oversophisticated, overspun, overspinning. We need a shot of
medicinal grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, it was our turn. We put a primary specimen of ourselves
in the White House. And what did it amount to? A marathon fight
over foreplay and targeted cuts. Not exactly an auspicious debut
for the Age of Aquarius.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have decided to give a grateful nod to the sacrifices our
parents made to create a world where yuppies can agonize over
whether to install a home gym, a home spa, a home casino, a wine
cellar, a smoking room or a $15,000 gas plasma high-definition TV
with a 160-degree viewing angle.
</P>
<P>
   Retro patriotism has become the hottest trend since Martha
Stewart introduced the perception of molding. Surrounded by
politicians baked in hypocrisy, self-pity and self-indulgence, we
yearn for those old verities _ heroism, duty, honor, loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. They are following up
their ``Private Ryan'' success by making a 13-part HBO mini-series
based on the Stephen Ambrose book ``Band of Brothers,'' about a
group of World War II paratroopers. The big Christmas movie is
Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line,'' based on James Jones'
novel about the Allied campaign on Guadalcanal. Peter Jennings' new
coffee-table book, ``The Century,'' features a raft of grainy
black-and-white pictures of that era before we get to those who
have made a mark at the end of century: Oliver North, Bill Gates,
Dr. Jack Kevorkian. A top Washington Post editor, Rick Atkinson, is
leaving his job to write three books on World War II called ``The
Liberation Trilogy.'' Tom Brokaw has written a paean to Americans
who lived through the Depression and the Second World War called
``The Greatest Generation.''

<P>
   ``Their generation didn't fumble it,'' Brokaw says. ``And they
had such an extraordinary generosity of spirit, whether it was
rebuilding their enemies, taking care of each other, not doing any
of this kind of public self-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his subjects from the strong, silent generation
regarded their children from the weak, chatty one, the NBC anchor
replied: ``They're bemused. They think there are too many toys, too
much play time, too little concentration on what really counts.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that Americans will engage in ``a huge rejection of
slickness and packaging. There has been a lot of artificiality in
both political camps. The World War II generation was all about
authenticity. Whatever else happened in their lives, they faced
death on a daily basis. And that is something that cannot be
duplicated in a weekend white-water rafting trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomers came of age promoting big things _ civil rights, social
justice, feminism, an end to an unjust war, an end to a crooked
presidency. But now we seem bogged down in petty things. And
cultural recycling _ from ``The Parent Trap'' to ``Psycho'' to
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the slough of reading glasses and Pepcid AC, boomers fear
missing the chance to test their mettle. Our idea of warfare is
opposition research. We're nagged by the suspicion that we're just
material boys and material girls.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will record that our generation's contribution was to
be the generation that worried about its contribution. Our parents
are growing old and dying, and we feel small. But in fact, our
smallness is just our latest conceit.
</P>
<P>
   If you hurry, you can still have Neiman Marcus deliver before
Christmas a British Ferret Mark 1 armored scout car. ``Coming
exclusively to Neiman Marcus from the British Army Reserves, the
Ferret ... carries a crew of two; one or two `friendly' people may
be added to the commander's seat area for cruising around the ranch
... Used by more than 30 countries: 1953 _ Desert Storm. $25,000.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GO HUSBAND! GO BEAR! 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a frontier woman heard a frightful commotion
right outside the log cabin. Seeing her loutish husband and a
vicious bear locked in mortal combat, she paused for a moment and
then blurted: ``Go husband! Go bear!''
</P>
<P>
   That's how I feel these days watching a few epic struggles in
our own crude little wilderness called sports. I see people
grappling with thumbs on each other's windpipes, and I don't know
where my sympathies lie. More accurately, I don't have any
sympathies at all.
</P>
<P>
   Take the impasse between George Steinbrenner and Charles Dolan.
George was negotiating to sell control of the Yankees to the man
from Cablevision. But George could not restrain himself, and he
opened his big yap and roared that he would be the boss of all
bosses for the foreseeable future, maybe even at Madison Square
Garden, and I'm kind of glad he did.
</P>
<P>
   I admit, I got a giggle out of imagining George calling a
practice of the Knicks (when the league resumes next October) and
snapping, ``Look, No. 33, you're leaving your feet on every head
fake! Learn some defense or I'm shipping you to Europe!''
</P>
<P>
   George's bluster got blown up in the headlines and trumpeted
across the airwaves, and Dolan, who likes to do his thing in
private, became alarmed about whether he could control this raving
egomaniac, which of course he couldn't. So the deal is in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Great. I don't really want to see Cablevision engulf the Yankees
because that would just about complete the Dolan stranglehold on
New York teams, which means my rates would keep rising, and
meaningful games would disappear into the brave new world of pay
television, which I am not going to acknowledge in my lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Chuckie baby, did you hear what George said about you? He
said you were an uptight rustic who had spent too much time out in
Long Island and would get lost in the Big City without your
helicopter and your limousine, so who are you to put the clamps on
a big-timer like him?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, George, did you hear what Dolan said about you? He said you
are a control freak whose word cannot be believed. Oh, yes, he also
said your turtlenecks are going to land you on Blackwell's
Worst-Dressed List.
</P>
<P>
   Go husband! Go bear!
</P>
<P>
   Now let us turn our attention to the spectacle of David Stern
and Billy Hunter rolling in the gutter. These lunkheads could not
figure out how to divide a few billion dollars, so they are now a
week or two from Zero Hour.
</P>
<P>
   Has anybody noticed the lovely weather since these boobs started
throttling their own golden goose? Sure, we might miss the
dunkathons on a few nasty nights in January and February, but if we
can only encourage Stern and Hunter to keep flailing away at each
other, we've got every chance for a healthy and fulfilling
springtime.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, David, did you hear what Billy said about you? He said
you're trying to squeeze blood from a turnip. He said it was you
and your megalomaniac owners who raised the players' salaries in
the first place. Billy also said you paste on the beard every
morning before going to work.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Billy, did you hear what David said about you? He said your
business suit is going to get stretched out of shape from the
strings attached to David Falk's fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Go husband! Go bear!
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are a few other feuds I'd like to instigate.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Ralph Wilson, did you hear what Paul Tagliabue said about
you? He said you're a crotchety old anarchist, and besides that,
you never won a Super Bowl, nyah-nyah-nyah.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Paul Tagliabue, did you hear what Ralph Wilson said about
you and the grim lumbering juggernaut of the National Football
League? Just read the papers. That got it about right.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Governor Rowland of Connecticut, did you hear what Bobby
Kraft said about you? He's laughing behind your back, saying you
remind him of those Sun Belt politicians who think getting a major
sports franchise like the Patriots will make them important. He
hopes you've got a safe house in some other state once the people
figure out what you've given away.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Bobby Kraft, did you hear what Governor Rowland said about
you? He said you're going to become such a pariah in Boston that
people will hoot at you when you walk down the street. He said
you're going to regret your impulsive move, but he's laughing
behind your back that he's got you tied up tighter than a sheaf of
tobacco leaves drying in a shed.
</P>
<P>
   It's our new winter sport.
</P>
<P>
   Go husband! Go bear!

SPORTS COLUMN: THE RELENTLESS, AND CONTRASTING, SYMBOLISM OF
MUHAMMAD ALI 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Post-Apocalypse, when Muhammad Ali's old fight videos become the
graven images of a new religion based on individual reinvention,
one of the sacred texts will surely be David Remnick's ``King of
the World,'' a shrewd and lively retelling of Cassius Clay's two
fights with Sonny Liston.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the book should solve plenty of holiday gift-giving
problems, certainly among sports fans, Ali fans, '60s fans, boomers
in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali is an American myth,'' writes Remnick in his epilogue,
``who has come to mean many things to many people: a symbol of
faith, a symbol of conviction and defiance, a symbol of beauty and
skill and courage, a symbol of racial pride, of wit and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in decline, Ali is symbolic; now he mirrors our fears of
aging, of falling ill, of being vulnerable, writes Remnick, ``to
the unpredictability and danger of life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this relentless symbolism that makes Ali both a seemingly
accessible object of almost universal adoration and a tantalizingly
remote human being.
</P>
<P>
   Other than his best friend, the photographer Howard Bingham, no
one seems to have stayed close to Ali for a long time unless there
was money involved. At 56, he is married to his fourth wife. The
Ali that we think we know _ the crowd-pleasing, crowd-displeasing,
always crowd-assembling entertainer and moral prism _ may actually
be, by now, who he really is. That persona took form in the two
main years of Remnick's book, 1964 and 1965, in which Ali first
began to ``shake up the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during those two years that Cassius Clay, the classic
artist-athlete, passionately devoted to his craft and to his
career, began to transcend boxing, the sport he briefly ennobled
and then left seamier than ever, if only by comparison. A champion
at 22 (though much younger in many ways), Ali was shaped by
attention, controversy, scorn; there was more time to become a
world figure than a fully realized person.
</P>
<P>
   But he was clearly a person of his time. Remnick sets the early
'60s scene of racial change and confusion, in which the model of
the black athlete with which whites were comfortable _ Joe Louis _
was no longer in stock. And the new version, Floyd Patterson _ a
troubled youth salvaged by public school psychologists and a
father-figure manager, a grateful Christian, an integrationist _
wasn't really a full-fledged heavyweight. His humiliating defeats
by Sonny Liston, who was depicted by the press as the stereotypical
``Bad Negro,'' became a national problem, for the NAACP, for Frank
Sinatra, for liberals, for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Cassius Clay, Olympic light-heavyweight champion,
handsome, extroverted, ingratiating. Boxing hyped him because he
was, literally, fresh blood. Most of the press treated him
contemptuously, but at length, because he was easy copy. (Remnick's
treatment of the leading sports columnists of the time is cool,
fair and devastating). Clay was handed a decision he did not
deserve (against Doug Jones) so that he could go on to a title shot
at 7-1 odds.
</P>
<P>
   The traditionalists who dubbed him braggart and clown did not
think he was ultimately much better for the game than was Liston,
but the kid had the cross-over appeal to boost the closed-circuit
gate. Few recognized that he was the real goods, as a boxer and as
a seeker.
</P>
<P>
   Once he became champion, he began to reinvent the title and
himself. The heavyweight champion, Mr. Man, had tended to be a thug
(John L. Sullivan, Jack Dempsey, Liston) or a defender of the faith
(Gene Tunney, Louis, Patterson). The rare individualist, such as
Jack Johnson, was isolated and discarded. Ali not only challenged
white, Christian America, but replaced its values. He discarded
Christianity, the local plantation folk who originally sponsored
him as a pro and the customary rituals of his title, including
joining the Army to cheerlead the troops. Having built him up,
establishment America had to strip him of his title and deny him
corporate endorsement to try to break him down. But by the time the
antiwar movement and Howard Cosell caught up with Ali, the ``white
power structure'' was stuck with him.
</P>
<P>
   For all that we know about Ali, and ``King of the World''
smartly packages those critical two years, there are still
mysterious pockets. We could know so much more about the
fascinating infusions of fearfulness and self-confidence he
received at home. What emotional needs were served by the Nation of
Islam that did not come from boxing or the civil-rights movement?
How could he have betrayed Malcolm for Elijah Muhammad? And now,
trapped in the prison of Parkinson's disease, is he truly as serene
a soul as he seems when he says: ``God's showing me that I'm just a
man like everyone else. Showing you, too. You can learn from me
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps all we need to know right now is from one
old enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to love Ali,'' Patterson told Remnick. ``I came to see
that I was a fighter and he was history.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WILL BILLS SECEDE FROM THE NO-REPLAY NINE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're the No-Replay Nine _ the nine National Football League
clubs that voted ``no'' last March on reinstalling instant replay
as an officiating tool. But now Ralph Wilson, the owner of the
Buffalo Bills, already annoyed at Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's
intention to fine him $50,000 for critical comments about
officiating, is leaning toward voting for instant replay next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly will look at it,'' Wilson said. ``Not the way we
had it before, but a modified form, maybe with some sort of
coaches' challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was still steaming over two controversial calls in the
Bills' 25-21 loss to the Patriots last Sunday in New England _ a
fourth-down completion when a replay showed the Patriot receiver
out of bounds, and pass interference in the end zone that enabled
Drew Bledsoe to throw the winning touchdown pass after the ball was
put on the 1-yard line with no time on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instant replay would not have applied to the pass-interference
call,'' Wilson said, ``but it would have negated the fourth-down
completion on that final drive. We would've had the ball. And the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the value of instant replay: to right a wrong. It is
easy to say that officials' mistakes are part of the game, but if
some of those mistakes can be corrected, they should be. If that
means the game takes a few more minutes, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   With its eight-year, $17.6 billion television contract through
2005, the NFL never mentions how television timeouts for
commercials stall and lengthen a game.
</P>
<P>
   At the NFL meeting last March, the vote was 21-9 in favor of
instant replay, but at least 23 yes votes were needed for the
required 75 percent. In addition to the Bills, the No-Replay Nine
were the Giants, Arizona, Chicago, Cincinnati, Kansas City,
Oakland, San Diego and Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion Cleveland Browns franchise voting next year,
24 votes will be needed, but the Browns' hierarchy (the former 49er
executives Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark) cast the 49ers' vote for
instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   If all the yes votes remain yes, instant replay would need only
the Bills, the Browns and another member of the No-Replay Nine to
switch votes. But the vote also would depend on the form of instant
replay up for approval. Last March, it involved each coach being
able to challenge two calls in a game; if a call was not reversed,
the challenging team lost a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will pass this time,'' one NFL executive said on
the condition of anonymity. ``Most of the coaches want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although instant replay is not used to correct calls during a
game, officiating executives at NFL headquarters use it to review
the calls in every game. In viewing this season's first 165 games,
they cited 42 calls that deserved to be reversed, according to Greg
Aiello, its vice president for public relations. That's an average
of approximately one every four games.
</P>
<P>
   Over the six-season span from 1986 to 1991 when instant replay
was used, 376 calls were reversed, including 38 calls that were
judged later to have been reversed incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I disappointed at our Super Bowl losses? Yes,'' Wilson
said, ``but we lost to better teams. But last Sunday, I was really
distressed because we deserved to win that game. You're not
supposed to say anything, but I don't want to be a Mr. Milquetoast.
Oh, a tough break, again. And there have been some other calls the
last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the real issue: the calls that instant replay might have
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who lives in the Detroit area, mentioned the Lions'
end-zone interception (replays showed the Lion cornerback bobbling
the ball as he went out of bounds) that contributed to knocking the
Jets out of a spot in the playoffs last season. He also cited some
questionable calls, not merely the controversial overtime coin
toss, in the Lions' 19-16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching pro football since the Lions came to
Detroit from Portsmouth, Ohio, in 1934,'' the now 80-year-old
Wilson said. ``I've always believed the game should be officiated
on the field, but now I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills' loss was another NFL embarrassment. After the
Indianapolis Colts lost, 34-31, in San Francisco earlier this
season, the NFL publicly ``apologized'' to Coach Jim Mora and the
Colts for incorrect pass-interference and defensive-holding
penalties against the Colts that contributed to the 49ers' rally.
</P>
<P>
   Those calls against the Colts would not have been subject to
further review on instant replay. And the apology didn't alter the
result, but the NFL was embarrassed. And now the Bills' loss has
embarrassed it again. The No-Replay Nine is watching.

SPORTS COLUMN: EL DUQUE'S STORY IS STILL A GREAT YARN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This just in. Orlando Hernandez, it has been learned, did not
escape Cuba as originally believed, on the fin of a shark. There is
also no truth to reports that El Duque survived for days on sand
and dental floss; he actually gorged himself at the media buffet at
the Caribbean baseball championships held on Anguilla Cay. Which,
it turns out, is not a tiny, uninhabited island but the bustling
home of a Yankee farm team.
</P>
<P>
   So says one of the men who sailed with Hernandez on a
triple-decked luxury fishing liner, the Castro Convertible. ``We
played shuffleboard, drank wine and bet on the Yankees in the
casino lounge,'' said one of these men, who claimed El Duque lost
much of the $3 million he earned while pitching for the Cuban
national team.
</P>
<P>
   Through his agent, Joe Cubas, Hernandez denied this latest
version of his journey, though he admitted that there may have been
a 75-and-over shuffleboard tournament during the four days he and
his party were stranded on Anguilla Cay.
</P>
<P>
   Whom, exactly, are we to believe? During the playoffs and World
Series, it became apparent that Hernandez had been advised to
reveal no further details of his celebrated defection last
December, as film and book deals were in the works. Was it really a
leaky raft, tossed by waves, chased by sharks? Everyone was
guessing and no one was divulging until last week, when three of El
Duque's companion defectors told Sports Illustrated and then The
Associated Press that some of the previously circulated material
was the journalistic equivalent of an El Duque curveball, in the
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   No raft, no leaks, no waves, no sharks. No myths left on sale.
</P>
<P>
   One of these sources, Juan Carlos Romero, has reportedly filed a
civil suit in Costa Rica, alleging Hernandez reneged on a promise
to financially secure Romero and his wife, and in the process
raised the notion that the only insufferable codition on board was
Hernandez himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was lying in the cabin, not paying any attention to where
we were going,'' Romero, the pilot, told The A.P. ``He got seasick
and vomited.''
</P>
<P>
   To which anyone who has made a Hollywood version of a single
true story would say: That'll work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the quintessential rags-to-riches American story,'' said
Alan Swyer, a screenwriter from Santa Monica, Calif., and a rabid
sports fan. ``El Duque's not Rosie Ruiz.''
</P>
<P>
   Swyer was referring to the woman who, a number of years ago,
showed up not far from the finish line of the Boston Marathon, a
complete fake. Conversely, according to the version presented by
Romero, Hernandez's worst critic, the pitcher's tale does include
the following details, which made it still sound like a mighty good
yarn to me.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called raft was actually a wooden, 20-foot boat with a
Russian-built engine (just what seven people want to possibly
outrun a hostile Cuban coast guard in). They survived those four
days on Anguilla Cay on sea conchs fished out of the shallows and
cooked in pans left by previous defectors (most ballplayers
couldn't last four hours without their cell phones). After waving
sticks and being rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard, the ride north to
Freeport, the Bahamas, was through a severe storm (the trip,
apparently, could not be rescheduled as part of a doubleheader).
</P>
<P>
   As for the baseball portion of the upcoming movie, let's just
remember we are not talking Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Cuba to star pitcher in the World Series, how often does
that happen?'' Swyer said. ``I wouldn't be deterred by the fact
that there might be some exaggeration.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whose version he might go with, Swyer said: ``I always
remember the old John Ford line _ `Torn between the truth and the
legend, I'll go with the legend.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was the standard screenplay strategy Swyer used for the
recent Home Box Office film on the late New York playground
basketball legend, Earl Manigault. ``The funny thing,'' he said,
``is that there are guys who knew Earl and know better but now
accept my version as the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the power of Hollywood, where even great fiction gets a
healthy rewrite. As far as who, if anyone, suggested Hernandez
embellish the truth, who cares? His concept was a winner, the
screenwriter's best friend. ``With certain scenes, various events,
you have to take some dramatic license to have cohesive drama,''
Swyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we want to start recalling some Oscars _ I seem to
remember a few liberties taken in ``Schindler's List'' _ my advice
is that we not make too big a deal about El Duque's discrepancies.
It could be worse. They could bring in Oliver Stone to direct, and
we'd find out the Series fix was in.

 &HT;    FAULTY TESTS PROMPT NATIONWIDE FEDERAL REVIEW OF POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS WASTE SITES
 &HT;    Eds: Repeating a story first movbed Friday in advance for
Sunday, Dec. 6.
 &HT;    By JANET JACOBS and ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The federal government is re-examining the danger
posed by hundreds of hazardous waste sites nationwide after the
discovery that two Texas labs provided thousands of incorrect test
results over a six-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The labs tested for cancer-causing chemicals in the soil, water,
air and tissue. Such tests are routinely used by government and
industry to determine if toxic wastes are, for example, leaking
into drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Federal environmental officials said they have opened a criminal
investigation into operations at the two labs, which were owned by
Intertek Testing Services, a British company that specializes in
various kinds of testing. Intertek discovered the faulty tests a
year ago. Both labs are now closed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials would not name specific sites involved in the
investigation. But Mary Adler, head of criminal enforcement for the
Environmental Protection Agency, said that the government has not
yet found any instances where the public was placed in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, an attorney for Intertek, also said that the
company's review has not turned up a single case where the faulty
test data resulted in any danger to public health. However, Kelly
acknowledged that the company has reviewed data from only about 25
percent of the affected sites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite company and government assurances, the faulty test data
already has become an issue in at least one lawsuit involving the
defunct Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in Karnack, Texas. Because
it is considered among the most dangerous toxic waste sites in the
country, EPA says part of the cleanup costs will come from its
so-called Superfund.
</P>
<P>
   A group of people near the abandoned plant has sued the federal
government and numerous contractors in federal court in Marshall,
Texas, asserting that leaking toxic chemicals from the Longhorn
facility made them ill and killed 27 people over the last ten
years. A lawyer for the group alleged that a number of these people
died of cancer or lupus, a disease that attacks the kidneys and
liver.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says residents were repeatedly told by state and
federal officials that contamination from the plant could not have
caused these injuries. However, lawyers filing the suit argue that
because of the unreliable testing, the government doesn't know how
bad the contamination is.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly denied in an interview Thursday that the Karnack case
represented an instance where Intertek's test data missed a major
environmental threat. He said that the company's tests there, which
were performed for the Army Corps of
</P>
<P>
   Engineers, proved to be accurate and showed ``extremely high
levels of pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   This was disputed by an Army spokesperson who said tests done by
Intertek and other companies have repeatedly shown only limited
pockets of high pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Intertek and government officials face a substantial challenge
as they try to reconstruct how decisions were made, which tests
were relied upon and what risks were run in hundreds of complex
pollution cases dating back to the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of tests is in the thousands,'' said Dave Barry,
spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas. ``It
was pointed out that the (questionable test data) goes back to
1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the company traced its current troubles back to one
employee who allegedly ``cut corners'' to speed up the time it took
to complete various tests.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the employee began working at the lab in the early
90's, the environmental testing service consisted of four
laboratories run by a company called Inchcape. When Intertek
purchased the Inchcape labs in December 1996, Kelly said the
company had no idea tests were not being properly performed. In
fact, Kelly said the labs were certified by several professional
organizations, as well as by some states, to do environmental
testing and were routinely audited.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that the faulty testing procedures were discovered in
December 1997 by new managers from Intertek. Kelly said that
Intertek immediately notified its clients and the EPA. While the
lab never did work for EPA itself, whoever was responsible for the
cleanup would submit the lab's test results to the EPA to be used
in deciding how to deal with toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
   While Kelly said the ``shortcuts'' caused only minor variations
in the test results, Barry said the faulty data may have caused the
government to do too little or too much pollution cleanup at some
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials declined to talk about exactly how serious the
situation might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A criminal investigation is ongoing,'' Adler said. ``The
agency would not at this point want to comment on the extent of the
data integrity problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the agency is doing right now is conducting a systematic
review of its case files and action files to try to identify where
we might have relied on its (Intertek's) data and then make an
assessment of how that data
</P>
<P>
   was used.''

<P>
   SHOULD THE METS HAVE WAITED?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets traded Todd Hundley to Los Angeles last week,
liberating their loyal catcher and themselves from a sticky
situation. Should they have waited until spring training so that
Hundley could have demonstrated that his elbow was sound and thus
may have brought a better price? No.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets in no way could have gone to camp with Hundley still on
the team. First, he could not have demonstrated anything by playing
an occasional exhibition game. Mike Piazza, after all, will have to
prepare for the season because he is the team's catcher. The Mets
could have scheduled `B' games for Hundley to play, but for teams
to see what they would have wanted to see, it would have required a
steady diet of `B' games, and teams just don't play that many.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Hundley's presence at Port St. Lucie, Fla., would have
created a major distraction that could have undermined the Mets'
chances for starting the season smoothly and successfully. Piazza
and Hundley in camp together? It might been reminiscent of the
Yankees' good old days. The same people who have criticized the
Mets for trading Hundley now would have criticized them then for
creating the distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the idea that the Mets could have secured a better
package for Hundley had they waited until next spring sounds good,
but it is flawed. Teams seeking a catcher might have made other
moves in the meantime, and they might also have spent their money
and had nothing left to pay Hundley's $5.2 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Mets owed Hundley, and by trading him now instead
of making him wait until a few days or weeks before next season
started, they did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMENS HAS STRINGS ATTACHED
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right trade for Roger Clemens will not be as easy as
it might seem. Because he would be traded in the middle of a
multiyear contract _ he has two years left on his Toronto contract
_ Clemens would have the right to demand a trade after next season,
unless his new team signed him to a new contract or a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have assumed all along if this scenario played out, part of
it would be a contract discussion,'' said Gord Ash, the Blue Jays'
general manager. Some general managers suspect that by asking to be
traded, Clemens wants to boost himself onto the $12.5 million-plus
salary level populated by Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson and soon
to be by Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding Ash's task, Clemens also has the right to veto a
trade. He has already said he does not want to play for a West
Coast team. ``Gord is supposed to do the best deal he can,''
another general manager said. ``Then when it's done, he calls the
Hendricks brothers'' _ the pitcher's agents _ ``and says, `I have a
deal to go to this city; are you OK with it?' They say yes or no.''
</P>
<P>
   AVOIDING COLLUSION II
</P>
<P>
   In trying to solve the growing problem of payroll disparity,
Commissioner Bud Selig has to avoid leading the owners into
Collusion II. Ten years ago Collusion I cost the owners $280
million (which still has not all been paid out to affected
players), and any future collusion would result in treble damages.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig did tell owners in Chicago last Thursday that all
clubs had to begin complying again with the 60-40 rule. That rule
requires clubs to have a ratio of no less than 60 percent assets to
40 percent liabilities, or debt.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who proposed the 60-40 ratio about 15 years ago, has not
enforced it in recent years. He did not portray it to the owners as
a panacea, but that is where he is going to start.
</P>
<P>
   The players association filed a grievance against the rule in
1983, feeling it could inhibit salaries, but an arbitrator allowed
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Another instrument that was aimed at discouraging lavish
spending was the luxury tax that emerged from the 1994-95 labor
dispute. High-spending teams, however, remain high-spending teams.
</P>
<P>
   The final assessments have not been sent to the clubs, but
preliminary figures show Baltimore owing $2.9 million, Boston $2.2
million, Atlanta $696,000, the Yankees $651,000 and Cleveland
$39,000. &QL;

FEEDING THE FREE-AGENT FRENZY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the span of three days, 35 free agents signed contracts worth
$225 million, and there went the winter meetings. This was in
December 1992, in Louisville, Ky., and the free-agent frenzy sent
officials home reeling. Never again, they said, vowing not to
provide agents with that kind of opportunity in subsequent
Decembers. It was like shooting fish in a barrel, the officials
decided, the general managers being the overmatched swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, however, have not suffered in the absence of the
winter meat market. In just one recent week this off season, five
free agents signed contracts worth $330 million. Inflation and
escalation contributed to the cascade of dollars, but clubs proved
they did not have to be a captive audience to spend lavishly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most interesting about the signings of Mo Vaughn, Bernie
Williams, Randy Johnson, Albert Belle and Rafael Palmeiro was that
the agents did not wait for this week's return of the winter
meetings to stir up another feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the meetings are back, six years later, officials having
decided that enough time has passed to make it safe to go into the
water again.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the sport could always count on was that the
meetings would generate a week's worth of talk about baseball.
Teams would make trades that would command huge amounts of
newspaper space and television time, and even if they did not
complete player swaps, speculation about possible trades would
serve the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Without the meetings, general managers became accustomed to
making deals before December, and this year, players like Bobby
Bonilla, Charles Johnson, Todd Hundley, Ron Gant, Bret Boone and
Denny Neagle have already been traded. Roger Clemens will join that
group if the Toronto Blue Jays meet their own timetable.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that general managers will not find trades to
make at these meetings, which will begin Friday in Nashville and
run through the following Tuesday. When they gather in one place,
general managers spend most of their time talking with each other _
in pairs, of course, as they feel each other out to determine
whether they have a match for a trade. But there is always far more
talk and speculation than business conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Some clubs may not have any business to conduct at the revival
meetings. Assuming Clemens is traded before Nashville, the Yankees
figure to be observers. They have already had a solid off season
because they have kept their World Series championship team
together while their chief competitors have stumbled and bumbled
their way out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets sign Rickey Henderson in the next few days to be
their leadoff hitter and left fielder, they will join the Yankees
on the sideline except for perhaps some money-saving moves, like
the Willie Blair trade Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have had a good off season because they retained the
players they wanted to keep (Mike Piazza, Al Leiter, Dennis Cook)
and they have added two run producers (they hope) in Robin Ventura
and Bobby Bonilla, and a hard-throwing relief pitcher, Armando
Benitez, who someday could grow into John Franco's closing role.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks have had a good and expensive off
season, adding six free agents, including Randy Johnson, Todd
Stottlemyre and Steve Finley (to be announced), but committing
about $119 million in doing it. If the dollars don't translate to
vast improvement, the expansion team will be viewed as the epitome
of excess.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams have had a dreadful six weeks since the World Series.
The San Diego Padres, who played in the World Series, have lost
third baseman Ken Caminiti and center fielder Finley and are on
their way to losing Kevin Brown, their No. 1 pitcher. The Chicago
White Sox have lost Belle and Ventura, who drove in 28 percent of
their runs last season.
</P>
<P>
   For awful off seasons, though, who can top the Yankees' rivals?
The Baltimore Orioles have signed Belle, B.J. Surhoff and Delino
DeShields, but they failed to sign three free agents they wanted,
Ventura, Brian Jordan and their own Palmeiro. Roberto Alomar and
Eric Davis also departed as free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, though, at least had various plans. The Boston Red
Sox incredibly let Vaughn walk away without having a reasonable
alternative plan in mind. They tried to sign Williams as Vaughn's
replacement in their lineup, but they had to know he would be a
long shot at best, and they had no clue where to go once Williams
took the Yankees' $87.5 million instead of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles and the Red Sox have been reduced possibly to going
head to head for Will Clark to fill their hole at first base, but
the diminished Clark will not replace Palmeiro's 43 home runs and
121 runs batted in or Vaughn's 40 and 115.
</P>
<P>
   Although anything is possible, it is highly unlikely that either
team can trade itself out of its plight at the meetings, but the
Orioles and the Red Sox will try because they don't want to concede
the division to the Yankees this early. The Orioles may even be
tempted to overpay for Kevin Brown, the best free agent still on
the market. For six years and more than $80 million, the dominant
pitcher could be theirs.

ALREADY, PLUMMER HAS PUT HIMSELF ON A COMEBACK TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Arizona Cardinals publicity staff has begun to
compile a list of ``Jake Plummer Game-Saving Comebacks.'' It's the
sort of thing done for a Joe Montana or a John Elway, but in only
19 National Football League starts _ Sunday's game with the Giants
will be his 20th _ Plummer has already brought the Cardinals from
behind in the fourth quarter seven times.
</P>
<P>
   There has been nothing run-of-the-mill about any of them. It's
hard, in fact, to choose a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Was it when Jake the Snake moved the Cardinals 50 yards in 5
plays and 27 seconds to set up the game-winning field goal over the
Redskins?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it when he moved the Cardinals 55 yards in 6 plays and 34
seconds for the game-winning field goal as time expired against the
Ravens?
</P>
<P>
   How about 98 yards on 14 plays against the Eagles?
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was Plummer's first Eagles-Cardinals game. In
the second, he finished with an 86-yard, 9-play drive that put the
game away in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best comeback was the one that came up short _
with the help of a controversial official's call. That was the game
three weeks ago against Dallas when the Cardinals charged at the
Cowboys from 28 points down. In the second half, Plummer threw for
314 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals lost, 35-28, but Plummer finished with 465 yards
passing _and that did not include his pass to Rob Moore on the
final play. It was ruled incomplete, although television replays
appeared to show that the Cardinals deserved a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The budding legend of Plummer, who is 23 years old, only
blossoms when Jake talks about himself. He is as calm then as he is
exciting to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rush,'' Plummer said in explaining the key to his
late-game heroics. ``The game won't end until that clock runs out.
Relax and have fun with it. Believe in yourself. If I didn't
believe in myself and instead listened to everything that was said
about me _ you're too small, too skinny and your arm's not strong
enough _ I'd be cleaning pools in Arizona. Or something.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a quarterback with unusual accomplishments and attributes.
Whenever Plummer has stepped on the field for the first time with a
new team _ in high school in Idaho, in college at Arizona State and
in the National Football League at Arizona _ he has led his team to
a touchdown on his first drive at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Giants Coach Jim Fassel was the offensive coordinator for the
Cardinals in 1996 when Plummer, who is 6 feet 2 inches and 197
pounds, was leading Arizona State to a Rose Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was right there in town so I heard all the talk and
commotion about this guy,'' Fassel said. ``But I looked at his
height and weight and read the scouting reports about his arm
strength and speed and I said: `I don't know about this guy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All the measureables weren't that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel then got some tape of Plummer's games at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put in one reel of film, watched it and I said: `This guy
can play,''' Fassel said. ``I watched another reel and I knew
definitely that he can play. He's the kind of guy you have to watch
him play to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Giants fans have yet to see the Plummer
everybody else is talking about. In Plummer's rookie season last
year, he threw for 388 yards in a 19-10 loss to the Giants, but he
also threw two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In a 17-point loss at Giants Stadium two months ago, Plummer
again threw two interceptions, was sacked seven times and fumbled
once.
</P>
<P>
   Said Plummer of such down days: ``You're not going to be perfect
every day, not just as a young quarterback but throughout your
whole career. Remember, if it was an easy job, everyone would be
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has been likened to Montana, a comparison that,
surprisingly, does not seem to irk or astound anyone in the
football community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are similar looking,'' Fassel said. ``The way he drops
back and moves in the pocket. Jake is an extremely good thrower on
the run _ a great thing to be these days. His build is slight like
Montana's. He seems to be one of those guys who can avoid or slip
past big hits and if you can do that, you avoid injuries even if
you're not big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake needs to play a lot more before we know more, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer accepts the Montana comparisons, to a degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did watch him constantly growing up,'' Plummer said. ``He's
my favorite to watch on film. For one, he was a smaller guy and
they said things about him that they've said about me in terms of
size, arm strength and all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was a leader. He went out there and guys believed in
him. I'd like to be thought of like that some day. But I'm just
starting out.''
</P>
<P>
   As Plummer has become a bigger story nationally, he has also got
the attention of his opponents. The legend is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Giants, who have beaten the Cardinals 7 of the last 10
times they have met, seem to know that Plummer is to be feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really tricky,'' the Giants' Pro Bowl defensive end,
Michael Strahan, said. ``He scoots and slides by people. You may
think you've got him, but you don't. You can't judge him by looking
at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call him Jake the Snake for nothing.''

FOR THE 49ERS THE BAD NEWS KEEPS COMING, EVEN IF THE LOSSES DO
NOT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One moment, San Francisco 49ers tackle Bryant Young was arguably
the best defensive player in football; the next, after a brutal
collision with a teammate, he was in the back of an ambulance,
speeding toward Stanford Hospital with two broken bones in his
lower right leg and damaged knee ligaments. By his side was the
49ers' owner, Eddie DeBartolo, holding Young's hand, telling him
everything would be all right.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Young was yet another blow to what has been one of the
most successful sports franchises of the last 20 years. Any
legitimate chance the 49ers had of making a deep playoff run
probably evaporated when Young's leg was crushed under a mass of
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the m.v.p. of this team,'' running back Garrison Hearst
said. ``We're definitely going to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the franchise has suffered its share of devastating
news in the last two years _ and losing Young for the rest of the
season, and possibly part of next season, is about as bad as it
gets _ it has shown impressive resilience. There are other teams
that would have crumbled under the pressure, but the 49ers remain
in the thick of the playoff race at 9-3, and with three of their
last four games against bad teams _ at Carolina and at home against
Detroit and St. Louis _ they could still get a home post-season
game.
</P>
<P>
   The team is almost assured of a 10-victory season, which would
be its 16th in a row, extending its own National Football League
record.
</P>
<P>
   And all this despite more bumps in the road than Jerry Rice
career touchdowns. ``We've been through some tough times
recently,'' Coach Steve Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   _ DeBartolo, who has five Super Bowl rings, is still not
involved in the daily operation of the team after turning over
control to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York. The 49ers' owner was
the target of federal prosecutors this year in a Louisiana gambling
probe _ he pleaded guilty in October to failing to report a felony
_ and the league asked him to remain inactive until its own
investigation is concluded. The 49ers have been rudderless without
him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carmen Policy recently stepped down after spending seven years
as chief executive officer. Considered one of the best salary cap
specialists in football, he now runs the new Cleveland franchise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dwight Clark, the director of football operations, resigned
this month to join Policy with the Browns. He earned respect as a
personnel man in just four seasons. Clark had hoped to be team
president one day, but he had been given indications by ownership
that that would not happen, so he left. John McVay is now in charge
of personnel decisions and player signings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mariucci, who has proved to be one of the bright young coaches
in the league, has been offered a multiyear contract extension, but
he has yet to sign it. Why? Mariucci wants to have a more active
role in certain decisions, like the final say on the draft, and
wants some safeguards built in to protect him against the club's
uncertain future. Look for Mariucci to sign an extension through
2005 any day now, in which case Green Bay's Mike Holmgren would
probably not return to the 49ers in any capacity. ``I've been asked
to do a job and coach this football team,'' Mariucci said. ``So
that's the A-No. 1 priority. If the club expects or hopes that I
would take on additional responsibilities, then I'm willing to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ As if the 49ers have not had enough problems, now comes worry
over the psyche of linebacker Ken Norton. It was his helmet that
hit Young's leg, while Norton was diving for Giants quarterback
Kent Graham. Norton is not to blame, but teammates say he has been
extremely disturbed all week.
</P>
<P>
   Norton was also involved in hits on the former Oakland Raiders
running back Napoleon McCallum and the former 49ers defensive
lineman Richard Dent. Each of those player's careers was never the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I guess I don't want to see it ever again,'' Norton said
when asked if he would look at the replay of his collision with
Young. ``The way he screamed, the pain I knew he was in, that was
enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through all these dizzying events, the 49ers have churned along.
They have not been dominant, but they have been good. Over the past
two years under Mariucci, the team is 22-6. The 49ers are also 15-0
at home in the regular season with Mariucci as coach. That's
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the 49ers is how long they can stay at this
high level with so much chaos around them. The next several drafts
could determine their immediate future on the field. The team
definitely needs to draft a quarterback to replace Steve Young, who
is 37. Last year's No. 1 draft pick, quarterback Jim Druckenmiller,
has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in the front office is even more important. They
need to find the next guru, another Bill Walsh. Whatever happens,
this summer could be the most crucial off season in 49ers history.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Theodore Roosevelt plotted the beginning of the end
of John D. Rockefeller's oil empire at a secret meeting at the
White House on a summer night in 1906. Surrounded by his attorney
general and other key cabinet members, he mapped out the antitrust
suit against Standard Oil that prompted steel baron Henry Clay
Frick to complain on behalf of his fellow oligarchs, ``We bought
the son of a bitch, and then he didn't stay bought.''
</P>
<P>
   It took five years for Roosevelt's case to be won in the Supreme
Court, breaking up Standard Oil into 34 companies. And for the
better part of the next 70 years, Washington's economic agenda was
dominated by the high-stakes politics of curbing the power of big
enterprises: The regulatory zeal of the New Deal, the oil cartel
cases of the 1950s and '60s, the failed _ and now foolish-looking _
13-year pursuit of IBM, the breakup of the Bell System.
</P>
<P>
   But something has changed in Washington in the past decade or
so, something that has taken the issue that Woodrow Wilson called
``these vast aggregations of capital'' off the country's political
agenda, even as it lives on in courtroom arguments about the
legality of Microsoft's strategies to dominate the electronic
ether.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when two of the biggest remaining parts of the old
Rockefeller empire, Exxon and Mobil, were recombined in the world's
largest merger, Washington yawned. House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, the pro-union, pro-consumer voice of the Democratic
Party's left wing, spent the day complaining loudly _ about the
Clinton impeachment inquiry, and he has yet to say anything about
the deal, according to his office. In fact, scarcely a politician
of any stripe headed for the cameras to question whether the $75
billion deal was good for the country, for workers or for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The same silence greeted the deal that created Citigroup, which
was the largest financial services company for a few minutes until
Deutsche Bank bought Bankers Trust Corp., earlier this month, and
Cargill Inc.'s move to snap up Continental Grain, one of the few
huge concerns that farmers could turn to if they didn't like the
prices Cargill was offering for their harvest.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, only steps away from the room where Roosevelt
held forth 92 years ago, was hardly pounding the podium. ``My
position on mergers,'' he said, ``has always been that if they
increase the competitiveness of the company and bring lower prices
and higher quality services to the consumers of our country, then
they are good; and if they don't, they aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fence-sitting reflects the odd politics of an era of
prosperity tinged with uncertainty. A few years ago downsizing was
a brewing political issue; though layoffs continue _ last week the
Asian economic crisis claimed another 28,000 workers at Boeing _
job growth has been so strong that that the issue has been defused.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, when Japanese corporations snapped up
New York's Rockefeller Center and two Hollywood studios, many in
Congress were in an uproar over the sale of American icons to
foreigners. But these days, with the Dow bobbing at record levels
and analysts declaring the triumph of American-style capitalism,
neither the Deutsche Bank acquisition or Daimler-Benz's purchase of
Chrysler Corp. last spring has yielded a similar furor.
</P>
<P>
   Many theories have been offered to explain this new passivity
about the evils of Big Everything: the pace of technological
change, or the realities of borderless competition in a year of
global tumult, or the confusing business currents that at once
celebrate the global reach of U.S.-based multinationals and the
entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it's just temporary _ if prices start going up again
at the pump, or if the U.S. economy falters, there could be a
renewed clamor to reign in corporations viewed as too big, too
powerful or too heartless. But whatever the reason, noted Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., who is among the few in Congress still
exercised about the concentration of corporate power, ``Once upon a
time this was a burning issue, and now it's not even on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's current antitrust case against Microsoft seems
at first blush be the notable exception: It's hard to turn on the
television these days without hearing about the company's supposed
scheme to dominate the Internet browser market, or its secret
strategies to flatten competitors. (Imagine the muck Ida Tarbell
could have raked with access to e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   But among politicians, the case is rarely mentioned. No one ran
for office on a platform of Gates-bashing the way Roosevelt once
called Rockefeller's crowd ``the biggest criminals in the
country.'' At a rare high-profile hearing this year on the
long-term effect of mergers, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan argued that the government was inept at determining in
advance those mergers that would create competitive problems and
would be wiser to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel very uncomfortable if we inhibited various
different types of mergers or acquisitions on the basis of some
presumed projection as to how markets would evolve, how technology
would evolve,'' he said, ``because history is strewn with people
making projections that have turned out to be grossly inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's view was challenged at the hearing, chiefly by Joel
Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust, and
Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,
which will review the Exxon-Mobil merger and presumably force the
company to divest some assets. Pitofsky noted that undoing the
damage after employees of an acquired company have been fired,
after its plants have been closed and after top management has
moved on, ``is enormously expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that few lawmakers dare to venture deep
into this territory, even though it sustained generations of their
predecessors. ``The biggest reason is the mix of money and
politics,'' says Wellstone, who is intensely focused on the issue
as he decides whether to run for his party's presidential
nomination. ``For both parties, these are the heavy hitters, the
monied interests who have a huge impact on the tenure of people in
Congress. Not too many people want to challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was also true in Roosevelt's day, even if Frick
and other monopolists came to regret their support of the
president. But Wellstone notes a second reason: the quiet arrival
in Washington of ``a set of shared assumptions about what is
necessary these days for survival in a global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first is that while bigger is not always better, it may be
the only way to extend one's reach abroad. ``The ability to be a
global player and to be competitive anywhere in the world has
become more important as all the traditional walls of regulation,
state ownership and time barriers have come down,'' said Daniel
Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The second assumption is that technology moves faster than
antitrust cases. When the government began its push against IBM in
the late 1960s, the microprocessor had just been invented. By the
time the case was abandoned, the microprocessor was revolutionizing
the computer industry, and IBM was missing the boat. It caught up,
but market dominance was no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   And the breakup of the Bell System, while leading to lower
long-distance rates and helping to promote technological advances,
has also driven millions of consumers up the wall. For many, the
only thing more annoying than trying to figure out how to get a
phone fixed is answering dinner time calls from solicitors trying
to sign up customers for a new phone service nobody has ever heard
of.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, today's trust-busters are no longer politicians but
technocrats and regulators who, over the next few months, will be
reviewing neighborhood-by-neighborhood what to do about streets
that have both a Mobil and an Exxon station. Almost no one is
talking about blocking the merger itself, a merger that a decade
ago Exxon would not have dared to think possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated and embittered by their failure to stop abortions _
and by a federal law protecting clinics _ fringes of the
anti-abortion movement are linking up with a new ally: the
right-wing militia movement.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by religious zeal and radicalized by events, these
splinters have adopted a violent, insurrectionary style that has
been associated with seven murders in the last six years. In much
the way gun control legislation mobilized the right-wing militias'
anti-government politics and the Vietnam War shaped the leftist
Weather Underground, these groups have formed a shadowy ``Army of
God,'' which is not so much an organization as a shared set of
ideas and enemies. In recent years this ``army'' has claimed
responsibility for scores of bombings and other attacks on abortion
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Militia types have shown more and more interest in the
abortion issue, while the anti-abortionists are becoming more and
more militant and allying themselves with the militia movement,''
said Dallas Blanchard, chairman of the University of West Florida's
sociology department, who has written on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The overlapping of abortion with the anti-government agenda, say
law enforcement officials and researchers, is most clearly seen in
the case of Eric Rudolph, who is accused by the FBI of bombings at
the 1996 Olympics, a gay bar and an abortion clinic near Atlanta,
and the bombing this year of a Birmingham abortion clinic in which
an off-duty policeman acting as a guard was killed. Rudolph
disappeared into the North Carolina woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Rudolph personifies the convergence of these issues,''
said Frederick Clarkson, author of a study for the Southern Poverty
Law Center on the ties between the anti-abortion fringe and the
militias. The Olympics, he said, represented ideas of
internationalism and racial integration _ the so-called New World
Order _ which are anathema to the extreme right, particularly to
the white supremacist, anti-Semitic Christian Identity movement.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the same conclusion is voiced on a fiercely
anti-abortion Internet Web site maintained by the Rev. David
Trosch, a Catholic priest in Mobile, Ala., who was one of the
signers of a ``justifiable homicide'' declaration in 1993 after the
first murder of an abortion provider, Dr. David Gunn.
</P>
<P>
   Listing the four bombings, Trosch's Web site declared: ``The
common link _ all of the bombings were against people highly
offensive to God.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, white supremacists calling themselves the Phineas
Priests robbed a bank and bombed a newspaper office and an abortion
clinic in Spokane, Wash. Larry Pratt, the head of Gun Owners of
America, who was a co-chairman of Pat Buchanan's 1996 presidential
campaign until his ties to militias and racist groups became known,
helped raise nearly $150,000 to pay the court fines and other debts
of Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion group. When the
authorities arrested the Arizona Patriots, another militia band,
they found plans to blow up hydroelectric dams, synagogues _ and
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the vast majority of abortion opponents, many of whom
still conduct regular protests outside clinics, do not advocate or
condone murder. It is a small band of protesters, many of whom
hardened their beliefs in prison during the 1988 Operation Rescue
activities in Atlanta, who claim biblical justification for killing
abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   The Operation Rescue protests of the late 1980s and early 1990s
represented a high-water mark for the radical anti-abortion
movement. Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested for weeks on end
as they tried to block clinic entrances in New York, Atlanta,
Wichita and other cities. But in 1994, Congress passed the Freedom
of Access to Clinic Entrances law, which made it a crime to
obstruct clinics and provided tough penalties if anyone was hurt
during demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics kept by the National Abortion Federation, a
pro-abortion group, show that the clinic blockades dropped off
sharply with the passage of the law to only 2 with 16 arrests this
year from a high of 201 with 12,358 arrests in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1993, there have been seven murders of doctors and
other clinic workers _ something previously unheard of _ along with
14 attempted murders and many incidents involving bombing, arson
and vandalism. In the latest, the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett
Slepian near Buffalo, N.Y., in October, the FBI is seeking to
question James Kopp, a longtime itinerant protester with a Catholic
group called the Lambs of Christ. He is yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Horsley, who maintains an anti-abortion Web site with a
logo of dripping blood and a list of doctors who perform abortions
_ their names are crossed out if they are killed _ blames the
federal law as ``the step that made it inevitable to see a
crescendo of violence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government made up its mind to block any
nonviolent attempt to stop abortion,'' Horsley said in an
interview. ``The federal government literally drove men mad, moved
them to execute abortionists. When a federal monolithic government
begins to crush the rights of a minority, if the issues truly
matter, fighting men rise up and do the things fighting men do. In
the life and death struggle to stop this unjustified slaughter,
Christian men are looking down the barrel of a rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion
Federation, a pro-abortion group, said: ``There has truly been an
evolution of violence. They started with peaceful demonstrations,
and then as the protesters became frustrated, to invasions and then
blockades, and then some became so frustrated they decided the only
way to stop abortions was to murder providers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now Internet links between the Web site of the
neo-Nazi Aryan Nation and Horsley's Web site. And the anti-abortion
movement has its own underground literature of apocalyptic
revolutionary novels, similar to the ``Turner Diaries,'' which
inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. In one titled
``Rescue Platoon,'' protesters rise up against the government.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the anti-abortion movement has created its own
version of the milieu in which the far right operates, where
leaders _ mostly male _ set forth an ideology and scattered
individuals or small groups act on their own to carry it out. A
former Ku Klux Klan leader and prominent rightist, Louis Beame, has
called this strategy ``leaderless resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly must be some underground network,'' said
Blanchard. ``It couldn't happen without a community of support.
They split into smaller and smaller groups, and as the groups got
smaller, they got more violent. They tend to limit their own group
_ becoming encapsulated, it's called _ and this does reinforce the
tendency to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson and Chip Berlet, another researcher, said claims of
biblical justification for the killings come from three fringe
theological traditions: Christian reconstruction, which grew out of
conservative Protestant splinter groups, particularly
Presbyterianism, and seeks to establish a theocratic government;
apocalyptic Catholicism, and the racist, anti-Semitic Christian
Identity sects that view abortion as a threat to the propagation of
the white race.
</P>
<P>
   An undercurrent running through much of the violence is the
mysterious Army of God.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated and embittered by their failure to stop abortions _
and by a federal law protecting clinics _ fringes of the
anti-abortion movement are linking up with a new ally: the
right-wing militia movement.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by religious zeal and radicalized by events, these
splinters have adopted a violent, insurrectionary style that has
been associated with seven murders in the last six years. In much
the way gun control legislation mobilized the right-wing militias'
anti-government politics and the Vietnam War shaped the leftist
Weather Underground, these groups have formed a shadowy ``Army of
God,'' which is not so much an organization as a shared set of
ideas and enemies. In recent years this ``army'' has claimed
responsibility for scores of bombings and other attacks on abortion
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Militia types have shown more and more interest in the
abortion issue, while the anti-abortionists are becoming more and
more militant and allying themselves with the militia movement,''
said Dallas Blanchard, chairman of the University of West Florida's
sociology department, who has written on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The overlapping of abortion with the anti-government agenda, say
law enforcement officials and researchers, is most clearly seen in
the case of Eric Rudolph, who is accused by the FBI of bombings at
the 1996 Olympics, a gay bar and an abortion clinic near Atlanta,
and the bombing this year of a Birmingham abortion clinic in which
an off-duty policeman acting as a guard was killed. Rudolph
disappeared into the North Carolina woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Rudolph personifies the convergence of these issues,''
said Frederick Clarkson, author of a study for the Southern Poverty
Law Center on the ties between the anti-abortion fringe and the
militias. The Olympics, he said, represented ideas of
internationalism and racial integration _ the so-called New World
Order _ which are anathema to the extreme right, particularly to
the white supremacist, anti-Semitic Christian Identity movement.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the same conclusion is voiced on a fiercely
anti-abortion Internet Web site maintained by the Rev. David
Trosch, a Catholic priest in Mobile, Ala., who was one of the
signers of a ``justifiable homicide'' declaration in 1993 after the
first murder of an abortion provider, Dr. David Gunn.
</P>
<P>
   Listing the four bombings, Trosch's Web site declared: ``The
common link _ all of the bombings were against people highly
offensive to God.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, white supremacists calling themselves the Phineas
Priests robbed a bank and bombed a newspaper office and an abortion
clinic in Spokane, Wash. Larry Pratt, the head of Gun Owners of
America, who was a co-chairman of Pat Buchanan's 1996 presidential
campaign until his ties to militias and racist groups became known,
helped raise nearly $150,000 to pay the court fines and other debts
of Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion group. When the
authorities arrested the Arizona Patriots, another militia band,
they found plans to blow up hydroelectric dams, synagogues _ and
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the vast majority of abortion opponents, many of whom
still conduct regular protests outside clinics, do not advocate or
condone murder. It is a small band of protesters, many of whom
hardened their beliefs in prison during the 1988 Operation Rescue
activities in Atlanta, who claim biblical justification for killing
abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   The Operation Rescue protests of the late 1980s and early 1990s
represented a high-water mark for the radical anti-abortion
movement. Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested for weeks on end
as they tried to block clinic entrances in New York, Atlanta,
Wichita and other cities. But in 1994, Congress passed the Freedom
of Access to Clinic Entrances law, which made it a crime to
obstruct clinics and provided tough penalties if anyone was hurt
during demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics kept by the National Abortion Federation, a
pro-abortion group, show that the clinic blockades dropped off
sharply with the passage of the law to only 2 with 16 arrests this
year from a high of 201 with 12,358 arrests in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1993, there have been seven murders of doctors and
other clinic workers _ something previously unheard of _ along with
14 attempted murders and many incidents involving bombing, arson
and vandalism. In the latest, the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett
Slepian near Buffalo, N.Y., in October, the FBI is seeking to
question James Kopp, a longtime itinerant protester with a Catholic
group called the Lambs of Christ. He is yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Horsley, who maintains an anti-abortion Web site with a
logo of dripping blood and a list of doctors who perform abortions
_ their names are crossed out if they are killed _ blames the
federal law as ``the step that made it inevitable to see a
crescendo of violence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government made up its mind to block any
nonviolent attempt to stop abortion,'' Horsley said in an
interview. ``The federal government literally drove men mad, moved
them to execute abortionists. When a federal monolithic government
begins to crush the rights of a minority, if the issues truly
matter, fighting men rise up and do the things fighting men do. In
the life and death struggle to stop this unjustified slaughter,
Christian men are looking down the barrel of a rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion
Federation, a pro-abortion group, said: ``There has truly been an
evolution of violence. They started with peaceful demonstrations,
and then as the protesters became frustrated, to invasions and then
blockades, and then some became so frustrated they decided the only
way to stop abortions was to murder providers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now Internet links between the Web site of the
neo-Nazi Aryan Nation and Horsley's Web site. And the anti-abortion
movement has its own underground literature of apocalyptic
revolutionary novels, similar to the ``Turner Diaries,'' which
inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. In one titled
``Rescue Platoon,'' protesters rise up against the government.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the anti-abortion movement has created its own
version of the milieu in which the far right operates, where
leaders _ mostly male _ set forth an ideology and scattered
individuals or small groups act on their own to carry it out. A
former Ku Klux Klan leader and prominent rightist, Louis Beame, has
called this strategy ``leaderless resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly must be some underground network,'' said
Blanchard. ``It couldn't happen without a community of support.
They split into smaller and smaller groups, and as the groups got
smaller, they got more violent. They tend to limit their own group
_ becoming encapsulated, it's called _ and this does reinforce the
tendency to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson and Chip Berlet, another researcher, said claims of
biblical justification for the killings come from three fringe
theological traditions: Christian reconstruction, which grew out of
conservative Protestant splinter groups, particularly
Presbyterianism, and seeks to establish a theocratic government;
apocalyptic Catholicism, and the racist, anti-Semitic Christian
Identity sects that view abortion as a threat to the propagation of
the white race.
</P>
<P>
   An undercurrent running through much of the violence is the
mysterious Army of God.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly Birmingham bombing attributed to Rudolph was claimed
in notes signed by the Army of God. Its underground manual gives
detailed instructions for attacking abortion clinics, including how
to manufacture homemade explosives and cut off doctor's hands or
thumbs; it also contains an effusive tribute to protesters using
their jail-house nicknames, including Kopp, who is called ``Atomic
Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who or what is the Army of God?'' Clarkson wrote in his study.
``That question has plagued investigators for years. Whether it is
a concept _ a handy moniker for whoever takes up the cause _ or a
permanent underground group is not yet clear.''

   NEW YORK _ To the surprise of almost no one, the New York Stock
Exchange has agreed to stay in New York. Whether its well-heeled
officials really, truly, turn-blue-and-die meant their many threats
to move to New Jersey will probably never be known.
</P>
<P>
   After years of negotiations, the exchange finally muscled city
and state officials into coming up with $900 million in cash and
tax breaks for a new trading complex in lower Manhattan. The
exchange's board still has to vote, but by Friday, it was virtually
a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   But buckets of money aside, there are certain intangibles that
add up to a strong case that they were never really serious about
leaving. There are, after all, some things that you just can't put
a price on.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the name problem. The New Jersey Stock Exchange. The
Jersey City Stock Exchange. Actually, officials had anticipated
that problem long ago and secured the right to call themselves the
New York Stock Exchange wherever they might land. Still, there
would be the inevitable jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use the phrase Wall Street around the world,'' said H.
Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association. ``It's
a brand name and a marketing image. It's Coca-Cola; it's Scotch
tape. The New York Stock Exchange would jeopardize its enormous
psychological and marketing value if it moved very far away from
Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will move part of their operations to less
expensive space in New Jersey or elsewhere, Shostal said. For an
institution like the New York Stock Exchange, however, there is an
incalculable value in being in New York, where the financial
industry is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Shostal made his living luring New York companies
to Jersey City for Cushman Realty. He jumped through hoops putting
together a deal to build a broadcasting headquarters for NBC in
Jersey City, only to see NBC snap up a $100 million tax break to
stay at Rockefeller Center. ``We knew Tom Brokaw was not going
anywhere,'' he said. ``The people in the bright red suspenders and
the silk ties are not going to go to Jersey City.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, New Jersey is off the beaten limo track. Could the
masters of the universe have handled the logistics? The trip from,
say, Greenwich would border on indignity. The train to Grand
Central, then the subway to Times Square, then a transfer to a
subway to Penn Station, a walk through the tunnels to get the Path
train for the trip under the Hudson River to Jersey City. Then a
taxi or who knows what to the new quarters.
</P>
<P>
   And could they really leave behind the headquarters of Morgan
Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney, or
the restaurants, or the recognition of having made it in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Shostal did get Merrill Lynch to move several thousand back
office workers to Jersey City. But, he said, the tax breaks and
subsidies on either side of the river are merely icing on the cake.
``The vast majority of tenants locate where they need to for
business reasons,'' Shostal said. ``The bidding war between the
states is really a milking of the public sector, rather than a
determining factor in where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the New York Stock Exchange, which
pays about $51 million a year in a variety of taxes, is cramped at
its 100-year-old home on Wall Street. On an average day, 680
million shares are traded on the market, up from 160 million 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange chairman Richard Grasso, who lives on Long Island,
always maintained that he wanted to remain in New York. Yet, new
construction is always a difficult proposition in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In playing the relocation card, the Stock Exchange was no
different than Mercedes-Benz, Nebraska Beef, Intel Corp. or any
company that has pitted one state against another, from Alabama to
Maine and California. Corporate relocation has had as much to do
with the chairman's comfort as with economics. In a study of 38
companies that left Manhattan in the 1970s, urban planner William
Whyte found that 31 moved to within 8 miles of the chairman's home.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the flight to the suburbs ends in a crash landing.
Whyte found that 17 of the 38 departed companies were later bought
out or raided, or merged with a dominant partner. A majority posted
lower-than-average profits, while a comparable group of three dozen
major companies that remained behind saw their stock valuation jump
an average of 277 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an old movie. In 1990, New Jersey offered to build
New York's five commodity exchanges a $100 million complex at the
Harborside Financial Center before New York offered a more generous
deal. Five years later, the Cotton Exchange signed a letter of
intent to move to New Jersey, but New York countered with a higher
bounty and the traders stayed put.
</P>
<P>
   Even the developers in New Jersey who talked to the the New York
Stock Exchange privately acknowledged long ago that they had little
chance of luring away the Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New
York University, said the New York Stock Exchange needs to be in
Manhattan to retain its crown as the world's largest equity market,
especially with Frank Zarb's Nasdaq moving to New York and merging
with the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey may be a better place to live but it's not a better
place to work,'' said Moss. ``There is more of a chance of
schmoozing and acquiring random information in an hour in the
hallways, on the streets, at lunch or on the concourse at Grand
Central Terminal in New York than there is by spending a week in a
parking lot in New Jersey.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ They sell bread on the streets in Russia, from the
windows of little roadside kiosks identified by signs proclaiming a
single beloved word: bread. White bread, black bread, delicious
Georgian bread laced with cheese, braided loaves and loaves baked
in the shape of big brown domes, and much more. The average
Russian's consumption of baked goods rose 5 percent from 1990 to
1995. In 1996 he ate 143 pounds of bread _ 6.4 ounces every day,
365 days a year. Russians even have a saying: ``Bread is the
beginning of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So why have they begun lately to eat less bread? The answer says
a lot about the state of Russia and its people. What it says most
is ``chaos.'' And not just bread, either: The entire Russian diet
is lurching through a perestroika that mirrors the bust-and-boom,
future-versus-past nature of the nation's economy and mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Like the country itself, Russian cuisine is a messy scene.
Russia today is a society caught somewhere between tiny torts
exquisitely topped with kiwi and a predominant national dessert,
the deep-fried apple. It is a place where subway vendors hawk cases
of Pringles to a population whose principal source of protein is
real potatoes, lifted fresh from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wavers today between Tyson chicken, the pricey pinnacle
of frozen fowl displayed in better markets, and the plate of hot
sausage of indeterminate origin that was free when Leonid Brezhnev
was in charge. At the moment, sausage, boiled potato and fried
apple are in the ascendancy. Nationalism may be part of it;
Russians are bridling at Western influence over their culture and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But to the experts, the overwhelming factor is money. Russia and
Russians are broke, and prices are rising. The ruble lost
two-thirds of its value in a single week in August. Bread costs
more _ 10 percent of the average Russian's food bill, compared to 4
percent just a few years ago. It is enough to make some Russians
long for Brezhnev's steady socialist hand on the tiller, at least
until they remember the iron grip that came with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between today and the '80s,'' said Alexander
Baturin, deputy director of the Institute of Nutrition at the
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, ``is that then the shelves
were empty, but people who could buy a bit of fish were satisfied.
It was enough. Today you can find almost everything in every store.
The question is whether people can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   A relative few can. In prosperous Moscow, two Western-style
supermarkets stocking both Russian and European brands opened last
month alone. Given enough money, you can now buy Haagen-Dazs and
Tony's frozen pizza in Moscow. In a few places, one can even find a
real luxury _ fresh milk, from Finnish cows.
</P>
<P>
   But Muscovites are less than 10 percent of Russians. The rest of
the country briefly flirted with lowfat milk and skinned chicken
breasts and ugli fruit, now found even in parts of Siberia. But it
sleeps with traditional Russian cuisine, the comfort food that saw
it through Brezhnev and Gorbachev and, now, the lean years of Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   This means fatty fried meats, fried potatoes, fried apples,
pancakes, cabbage soup topped with mayonnaise, fermented cabbage,
butter and dense black bread. And tea. Without milk, but perhaps
with a little jam. Preferably bought in bazaar-style markets, from
stalls crawling with live crawdads and dripping with cattle blood
and groaning with produce, none of it freshness-dated or
shrink-wrapped by clerks with plastic gloves.
</P>
<P>
   To a lot of Western palates, this tastes, well, heavy and
greasy. Heavy and greasy is the norm in a climate better suited to
reindeer than humans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes greasy is good: glorious onion-and-hamburger-filled
pancakes, or blinis, that surely were lifted from White Castle
recipe banks; tasty vinaigrette salads of cabbage and carrots and
oil; a good borscht. The key word here is sometimes. The downside
of Russian cuisine is that it is not especially healthy; three
daily helpings of sausage is bad for the heart. Three daily
helpings of potatoes and bread can lead to obesity, and half of all
Russian adults are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does freedom from Communist shackles seem to have helped
much. Post-Communist Russia has been flooded with Western meats and
groceries _ up to half of all food sales _ yet a recent study by
one expert concluded that the vitamin content of Russian diets has
not appreciably improved. Virtually every Russian suffers from
vitamin deficiency. Among Russian children, half of whom do not
regularly drink milk, the shortage of B vitamins, which promote
bone growth, is catastrophic, Baturin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our way of life is a violation of the norms from the very
beginning,'' said Yuna Popova, an administrator at the government's
premier center for treating food-related disorders.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Russians ate better when the Kremlin
played mama, ordering its subjects to eat what was put in front of
them or go hungry. But turning the Russian diet over to the market
has been a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for instance, the free, hot lunch. Under Soviet rule,
virtually every factory and office worker got one, either free or
nearly so, as part of the state's cradle-to-grave package of social
benefits. In modern Russia, there is no such thing as a free lunch
_ and many people simply do not eat as a result. Most Russians eat
twice a day _ morning and late evening, Ms. Popova said.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping a meal could be seen as a good thing. A few years ago,
the average Russian packed away 3,000 calories a day by some
measures, a quarter more than is recommended. And the calorie
intake has dropped during the 1990s. But the dropped calories came
largely from costlier foods that are important to a healthy diet.
Baturin's institute periodically asks thousands of Russians about
their eating habits, and some conclusions are disturbing. Fruit
consumption dropped one-third between 1990 and 1995; meat,
one-quarter; vegetables, a fifth. Fish consumption was halved.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, less meat means less fat _ and some Russian doctors
point to that to explain a slow decline in heart ailments that
began in 1994. But it also has immediately led to an increase in
iron deficiencies among women; a third of pregnant women lack
enough iron. The decline in fruit consumption now means that 20
percent of Russians are critically low in vitamin C _ so low they
risk getting rickets.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is one factor, Baturin said, but another is inertia. Most
fruits and vegetables have never grown well in Russia; cabbage is
the primary source of vitamin C. People eat what they know. Just as
western Russians eschew one southern appetizer _ donkey-meat jerky
traditionally cured by several weeks beneath the saddle of a sweaty
horse (it tastes like a Slim Jim) _ others are repelled by sweet
peppers. Or artichokes. Or pears.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone. Baturin tells of coming across a report of
Russian family that loved pears, despite living in a remote
Siberian town where pears were uncommon. Delighted by their healthy
eating habits, he decided to find out what led them to add fruit to
their diet. The answer was simple and telling. The husband was
jobless; the wife worked but had not been paid in months. To
survive, they unloaded fruit trucks _ and were paid part of their
salary in castoff pears.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ They sell bread on the streets in Russia, from the
windows of little roadside kiosks identified by signs proclaiming a
single beloved word: bread. White bread, black bread, delicious
Georgian bread laced with cheese, braided loaves and loaves baked
in the shape of big brown domes, and much more. The average
Russian's consumption of baked goods rose 5 percent from 1990 to
1995. In 1996 he ate 143 pounds of bread _ 6.4 ounces every day,
365 days a year. Russians even have a saying: ``Bread is the
beginning of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So why have they begun lately to eat less bread? The answer says
a lot about the state of Russia and its people. What it says most
is ``chaos.'' And not just bread, either: The entire Russian diet
is lurching through a perestroika that mirrors the bust-and-boom,
future-versus-past nature of the nation's economy and mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Like the country itself, Russian cuisine is a messy scene.
Russia today is a society caught somewhere between tiny torts
exquisitely topped with kiwi and a predominant national dessert,
the deep-fried apple. It is a place where subway vendors hawk cases
of Pringles to a population whose principal source of protein is
real potatoes, lifted fresh from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wavers today between Tyson chicken, the pricey pinnacle
of frozen fowl displayed in better markets, and the plate of hot
sausage of indeterminate origin that was free when Leonid Brezhnev
was in charge. At the moment, sausage, boiled potato and fried
apple are in the ascendancy. Nationalism may be part of it;
Russians are bridling at Western influence over their culture and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But to the experts, the overwhelming factor is money. Russia and
Russians are broke, and prices are rising. The ruble lost
two-thirds of its value in a single week in August. Bread costs
more _ 10 percent of the average Russian's food bill, compared to 4
percent just a few years ago. It is enough to make some Russians
long for Brezhnev's steady socialist hand on the tiller, at least
until they remember the iron grip that came with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between today and the '80s,'' said Alexander
Baturin, deputy director of the Institute of Nutrition at the
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, ``is that then the shelves
were empty, but people who could buy a bit of fish were satisfied.
It was enough. Today you can find almost everything in every store.
The question is whether people can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   A relative few can. In prosperous Moscow, two Western-style
supermarkets stocking both Russian and European brands opened last
month alone. Given enough money, you can now buy Haagen-Dazs and
Tony's frozen pizza in Moscow. In a few places, one can even find a
real luxury _ fresh milk, from Finnish cows.
</P>
<P>
   But Muscovites are less than 10 percent of Russians. The rest of
the country briefly flirted with lowfat milk and skinned chicken
breasts and ugli fruit, now found even in parts of Siberia. But it
sleeps with traditional Russian cuisine, the comfort food that saw
it through Brezhnev and Gorbachev and, now, the lean years of Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   This means fatty fried meats, fried potatoes, fried apples,
pancakes, cabbage soup topped with mayonnaise, fermented cabbage,
butter and dense black bread. And tea. Without milk, but perhaps
with a little jam. Preferably bought in bazaar-style markets, from
stalls crawling with live crawdads and dripping with cattle blood
and groaning with produce, none of it freshness-dated or
shrink-wrapped by clerks with plastic gloves.
</P>
<P>
   To a lot of Western palates, this tastes, well, heavy and
greasy. Heavy and greasy is the norm in a climate better suited to
reindeer than humans.

   WASHINGTON _ Richard Nixon's political advisers were eerily
prescient when they named his 1972 campaign organization the
Committee to Re-elect the President: It wasn't too long before his
critics dubbed it CREEP, a moniker that proved hard to shake,
especially after the Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, when nearly everything in politics is market-tested by
polls, focus groups and consultants, it would be unthinkable for a
presidential candidate to blunder into an acronym like CREEP.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is flirting with another
run for president in 2000. The wholesome, uplifting name Kerrey
chose for his political action committee, Building America's
Conscience &AMP; Kids PAC, has an equally wholesome and uplifting (and
even cute) acronym, BACKPAC.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts estimate that to be competitive in
2000, presidential candidates will need to raise a minimum of $22
million _ or $50,000 a day _ before the selection of delegates
begins in early 2000. So the hopefuls are building war chests even
before they declare their candidacies, and most are turning to
political action committees to raise money. Like corporations,
labor unions and advocacy groups, congressional leaders and
prospective presidential candidates are allowed to operate such
groups under federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   In today's fund-raising frenzy, candidates and organizations
have to be increasingly inventive in thinking up ways to separate
donors from their money. Although the evidence is anecdotal, there
are signs that patriotic, optimistic or catchy names help political
action committees raise more cash. Emily's List, for example, whose
memorable name stands for Early Money Is Like Yeast, has become the
biggest PAC of them all, raising money for women candidates in
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to identify themselves with positive terms such as
hope, future and family,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor of
government at the University of Virginia. ``Would you rather give
to Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity or the Committee for
Steve Forbes?''
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity is the name chosen by
Forbes for the nonprofit group he founded to raise money and help
promote his free-market agenda. ``The name is his mantra,'' said
Joel Rosenberg, an aide to Forbes, the wealthy publisher who made a
surprisingly strong showing in his upstart bid for the Republican
nomination in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a bit of a mouthful, Rosenberg conceded. ``Some of us
said the name was going to be hard to fit around a mug,'' he said.
But Forbes liked it, and the organization has managed to pull in an
impressive $13 million from 140,000 donors.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who also ran for the Republican
nomination in 1996, has two committees: Campaign for a New American
Century and We the Parents. According to an aide, Brian Kennedy,
Alexander chose the names himself. In fact, aides to all of the
prospective 2000 candidates insist that their bosses chose their
PAC names themselves without the help of polls or consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander already had a PAC from 1996, the Republican Fund for
the '90s, but that wouldn't do for 2000, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is for Republicans to provide leadership for the
new American century, so that's how he picked the name,'' Kennedy
explained. We the Parents, he added, was chosen because of
Alexander's desire to put ``government and schools and the culture
on the side of parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a conservative leader making his first bid for
national office, chose Campaign for Working Families. ``It
underscores our Main Street focus,'' said Tim Goeglein, a spokesman
for Bauer. The PAC has already pulled in millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner,
hasn't set up a committee for 2000. In the most recent election
cycle, though, the vice president set up a PAC on behalf of
Congressional candidates that was blandly named ``Leadership '98''
(Friends of Albert Gore Jr. Inc.). As for this time around, ``We're
more concerned with the purpose than the name,'' said Marla Romash,
a political adviser to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Some PAC names are unabashedly direct, like the recently created
Friends of Newt Gingrich. Others strive for a can-do flavor; last
spring, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani unveiled Solutions
America, a national organization to finance his out-of-state travel
and give money to other Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups don't need stirring acronyms or language to stand
out in the crowd: In the last election cycle, a PAC set up to
defeat the effort by former Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., to regain
his House seat called itself The Deranged One Has Been Dumped
Committee.

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Most wars in Africa since the end
of colonialism have been civil wars. Even though their borders were
drawn by Victorian imperialists, African states have generally kept
their armies inside them, no matter how flagrantly those long-dead
European males ignored tribal affinities and natural landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Congo, the huge central African country formerly
known as Zaire, is changing all that. Troops from as far south as
Namibia and as far north as Chad are fighting inside the vast
equatorial basin of the Congo River. Would-be presidents, waiting
to step forward if Laurent Kabila is overthrown, are preening in
hotel rooms from Cape Town to Brussels. Mining companies from South
Africa to Canada are holding their breaths _ and checkbooks _
waiting to see how things turn out.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Congo is a single country in name only. Because the
interior is so impassable and the hinterlands so ungovernable, it
has functioned for years like three _ the east imports and sells
through Uganda and Kenya, while the south does so through Zambia
and South Africa; only the west and the interior answer to the
capital, Kinshasa. Now, this war is threatening to make the
informal state of affairs into a formal division.
</P>
<P>
   Every force in the Congo fights for a different reason. Sadly,
greed and hatred are the two strongest.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, what has developed is a tribal war along lines
that are almost biblical _ rulers from Nilotic ethnic groups in
Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda against Bantu peoples of central and
southern Africa in league with Arab rulers of northern Chad and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But the old adage ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend'' also
applies. The Sudan is involved, for example, because it hates
Uganda, which supports guerrillas in southern Sudan. Zimbabwe and
Namibia say they are defending Congo's sovereignty, but they are
reported to have been promised mining deals by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   In brief, with Congo as weak as it is, it is simply too big, too
central and too rich in resources for its neighbors not to encroach
on. And the deeper some go in, the more likely their rivals are to
join the fray. The war has become a continent-wide free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   By various estimates, Kabila started with some 15,000 effective
troops, half of whom defected to the other side. He is aided by
6,000 Zimbabweans, perhaps 5,000 Angolans, 3,000 Sudanese and
Chadians and 300 Namibians. The war also reflects the ethnic split
between central Africa's Tutsi and Hutu groups. Up to 12,000 poorly
organized Hutus, chased out of Rwanda in 1994, are said to be
helping him, even though his own Tutsi-led forces slaughtered
fellow Hutus in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed against them are an unknown but probably larger force of
rebels. Many of these are Banyamulenge Tutsis who were born in
Congo but were denied citizenship both by the former dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko and by Kabila. These Tutsi are backed by Rwandans
and Ugandans fighting to defeat Hutu raiders based in eastern
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides use Soviet-bloc weapons, but the rebels are said to
have better U.S. communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the scale of fighting must be kept in mind. The former
Zaire is about the same size as the portion of today's United
States that was involved in the American Civil War, and its
population, 40 million, is roughly the same as that of the Union
and Confederacy combined. But while 2.9 million Americans on both
sides were under arms between 1861 and 1865, the whole of Congo is
being fought over by fewer than 70,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   What they are fighting is only barely a mechanized war. Tanks
were used briefly in the far west, some Zimbabwean and Angolan jets
have bombed rebels and the most dramatic move of the war was the
hijacking of three cargo planes to carry rebels 1,300 miles from
the eastern border to the Atlantic for an abortive assault on
Kinshasa. Mostly, though, it is a war of men slogging down dirt
roads with AK-47s, sometimes helping armored cars through the mud.
When Zimbabwe claimed recently to have bombed a ``rebel supply
column,'' it said the column comprised 1,500 cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces in Congo have to be small _ they're living off the
local population, stealing food and extorting money,'' said Richard
Cornwell, a South African military historian. ``The units aren't
really a coherent force, and there isn't really a front line. It's
more like a series of dots with skirmish lines blocking the
roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Looting is endemic. Angolan troops, Cornwell said, agreed to
fight only in return for booty, and cargo planes are flying home
their gains, including cars and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   And even if a winner emerges, ruling Congo is no piece of cake.
Poverty, illiteracy and disease are endemic. There are rich lodes
of diamonds, gold, cobalt and copper, but millions of dollars worth
of equipment and roads are needed to extract them. The Belgians
profited here in the early part of the century, but they governed
only through astonishing brutality; at one time, piles of preserved
hands bore witness to the policy that a quota of villagers had to
be killed to maintain rule by terror. Then, in the 1970s, '80s and
'90s, Mobutu amassed an immense fortune but ignored his desperate
people until Kabila's forces overthrew him last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is some pressure for peace. Zimbabwe, facing
bankruptcy, can ill afford to stay. Angola needs its troops at home
as its 25-year-old guerrilla war flares anew. Discontent with the
war has been voiced in Uganda. And even if other countries, greedy
for Congo's underground wealth, keep interfering, they cannot win
more than a hollow victory. Mining contracts are worthless without
a guarantee of political stability, which neither side can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   So there have been rumors of cease-fires, the latest reports of
an impending truce having come just last week. But not once have
all members of both sides sat down to talk. Until that happens,
Congo's flaws will still make it as prone to fracture as its fabled
gems.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Most wars in Africa since the end
of colonialism have been civil wars. Even though their borders were
drawn by Victorian imperialists, African states have generally kept
their armies inside them, no matter how flagrantly those long-dead
European males ignored tribal affinities and natural landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Congo, the huge central African country formerly
known as Zaire, is changing all that. Troops from as far south as
Namibia and as far north as Chad are fighting inside the vast
equatorial basin of the Congo River. Would-be presidents, waiting
to step forward if Laurent Kabila is overthrown, are preening in
hotel rooms from Cape Town to Brussels. Mining companies from South
Africa to Canada are holding their breaths _ and checkbooks _
waiting to see how things turn out.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Congo is a single country in name only. Because the
interior is so impassable and the hinterlands so ungovernable, it
has functioned for years like three _ the east imports and sells
through Uganda and Kenya, while the south does so through Zambia
and South Africa; only the west and the interior answer to the
capital, Kinshasa. Now, this war is threatening to make the
informal state of affairs into a formal division.
</P>
<P>
   Every force in the Congo fights for a different reason. Sadly,
greed and hatred are the two strongest.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, what has developed is a tribal war along lines
that are almost biblical _ rulers from Nilotic ethnic groups in
Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda against Bantu peoples of central and
southern Africa in league with Arab rulers of northern Chad and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But the old adage ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend'' also
applies. The Sudan is involved, for example, because it hates
Uganda, which supports guerrillas in southern Sudan. Zimbabwe and
Namibia say they are defending Congo's sovereignty, but they are
reported to have been promised mining deals by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   In brief, with Congo as weak as it is, it is simply too big, too
central and too rich in resources for its neighbors not to encroach
on. And the deeper some go in, the more likely their rivals are to
join the fray. The war has become a continent-wide free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   By various estimates, Kabila started with some 15,000 effective
troops, half of whom defected to the other side. He is aided by
6,000 Zimbabweans, perhaps 5,000 Angolans, 3,000 Sudanese and
Chadians and 300 Namibians. The war also reflects the ethnic split

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In June, the House of Representatives voted to
condemn, by name, the three white men in Texas who were charged
with murdering a black man by dragging him behind a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of dozens of resolutions adopted in the 105th
Congress expressing the approval or disapproval of lawmakers. Other
resolutions involved happy matters, like the one congratulating
Mark McGwire on breaking the home-run record; grave ones, like the
one expressing condolences to the families of those killed in the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and matters
over which the Congress has no control, like the one urging
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Republicans who had no compunction about voting to
express strong opinions on these far-flung topics say now that
Congress has no business passing a resolution censuring President
Clinton for personal conduct that the lawmakers find deplorable.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, who has
been on television day after day arguing for impeachment and
against censure, say that censure would be unconstitutional because
the Constitution does not specifically give Congress the authority
to punish the president in any manner other than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's opponents also argue that censure would be a
meaningless slap on the wrist, particularly in the case of a
president who seems to have a limitless capacity to endure shame,
and would not address adequately the disgrace they feel he has
brought to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To many politicians, the arguments against censure seem
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be strange,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., if
lawmakers could freely pass resolutions stating their views on
almost every kind of behavior but not on conduct ``that has
threatened the Clinton presidency and stirred broad and deep
emotions among the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in most cases, congressional expressions of opinion _
whether in resolutions about new baseball legends or corrupt
African dictators _ are in fact meaningless, even frivolous. There
have been instances, however, when resolutions stating the views of
Congress have indeed carried weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf of Tonkin resolution of 1964 was used for years by
supporters of the Vietnam War as evidence of congressional
concurrence with the military commitment. Similarly, the Persian
Gulf resolution of 1991 was seen as a stamp of bipartisan political
approval of the war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution explicitly directs Congress to discipline its
own members, and the House and Senate have passed censure
resolutions occasionally over the years. Sometimes, as in the case
of Sen. Thomas Dodd, D-Conn., in 1967 or Sen. Dave Durenberger,
R-Minn., in 1990, both of whom were reproached for ethical lapses,
the action had little consequence other than to dissuade relatively
obscure politicians from running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate's condemnation of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis.,
in 1954 for conduct that brought ``the Senate into dishonor and
disrepute'' marked the end of an era of what the Senate called
distortions and misrepresentations, sent one of the most dominant
political figures of his time packing and led to a Democratic
majority that lasted 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   And the House's vote last year to reprimand and fine Speaker
Newt Gingrich for ethical violations was an indication that seeds
of opposition to Gingrich were sprouting among his troops.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., argues that an official, public censure
would indeed be a severe blow to someone like Bill Clinton, who
worries about his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the underlying reason for the opposition to censure
among most Republicans in the House is neither the constitutional
question nor the issue of whether the punishment would be
meaningful. It is that DeLay and most of his fellow Republicans in
the House are determined to press ahead with a vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If censure becomes an option, it could drain votes from their
cause. Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., called censure ``nothing more than
a political out.'' That, presumably, is why Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La., the speaker-designate, will not say whether he will even
allow a vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many politicians agree, censure is the most likely
outcome. There may not be enough votes in the House for
impeachment. There certainly is not the two-thirds majority needed
in the Senate for conviction. And if Congress fails to remove the
president from office, many Democrats as well as Republicans will
still want an official way to express their disapproval of his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to envision how Congress gets from here to there.
The waters are uncharted.
</P>
<P>
   The only time a president has been censured or otherwise
officially reproached by Congress was in 1834 when the Senate voted
to denounce President Andrew Jackson in a policy dispute involving
the removal of the secretary of the Treasury. The resolution did
not actually contain the word censure, but most authorities treat
the vote as amounting to the same thing. The resolution was revoked
three years later when Jackson allies gained control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, Congress considered censuring several other
presidents, and censure resolutions involving lower-ranking
executive branch officials were adopted by the House in a few
instances. But until now, no censure resolution against someone
other than a member of Congress has been seriously discussed in
this century.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the paltry record of precedents, a small band of
moderate Republican representatives opposed to impeachment, led by
King, assembled a censure proposal last week and circulated it at
the White House to get the president's reaction. The measure would
condemn his conduct, require him to acknowledge that he had
deceived the American people and impose a fine. The authors
described it as a way short of impeachment to express Congress'
disapproval and prevent the president from getting off unpunished.
Democrats worked on their own censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Censure could take the form of a concurrent resolution, meaning
that it would express the views of Congress but not require the
president's signature. Or it could be a joint resolution, a measure
resembling an ordinary bill, which would be approved in identical
form by the House and Senate and signed by the president and thus
carry the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonkin Gulf and Persian Gulf measures were joint
resolutions, and some lawmakers who favor censure see a parallel
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, just
as it gives Congress the power to impeach. These resolutions were
steps short of a declaration of war, just as censure would be a
step short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would not discuss its reaction to these
proposals other than to say, as the press spokesman Joe Lockhart
did Friday, that the president's advisers were ``aggressively
listening.'' But the discussions were a clear indication that the
president was interested in a back channel as an alternative to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most authorities agree that Congress cannot require the
president to pay a financial penalty. To do so would be a bill of
attainder, a legislative punishment of an individual, which is
forbidden by the Constitution. So the president would have to agree
to the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there would be no one to challenge its legitimacy. The
question is, if the president goes along, would it really amount to
punishment?

president was interested in a back channel as an alternative to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most authorities agree that Congress cannot require the
president to pay a financial penalty. To do so would be a bill of
attainder, a legislative punishment of an individual, which is
forbidden by the Constitution. So the president would have to agree
to the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there would be no one to challenge its legitimacy. The
question is, if the president goes along, would it really amount to
punishment?

RIGHT TO ABORTION QUIETLY ADVANCES IN STATE COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Alaska, Tenn., Texas)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abortion rights advocates have slowly and quietly
been winning victories in state courts to make abortions more
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing what they see as an increasingly conservative federal
judiciary, groups that favor the right to abortion have been
focusing on state constitutions that often contain greater privacy
rights than the U.S. Constitution or that have equal rights
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   They have racked up victories even as federal courts have
limited the right to abortion established by the Supreme Court in
Roe vs. Wade in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent decision, the New Mexico Supreme Court
unanimously ruled 10 days ago that the state's Equal Rights
Amendment required the state to use Medicaid money to pay for
abortions that are deemed medically necessary for poor women.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits have also been filed seeking Medicaid financing of
abortions in Alaska, Florida, Tennessee and Texas. And Catherine
Weiss, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project, which brought the New Mexico case,
said abortion rights advocates were exploring the possibility of
filing suits in two additional states, which she declined to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have started looking more at the state constitutions
because the issues have been foreclosed by the decisions in the
federal courts,'' said Louise Melling, associate director of the
Reproductive Freedom Project.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico represents the latest in a line of victories for
abortion rights advocates in state courts on the issue of public
financing for abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates have also been successful in striking down so-called
parental notification laws. In the last two years, measures
requiring that at least one parent be notified when a girl under 18
is seeking an abortion have been thrown out by courts in Montana,
California and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The decision last month in New Mexico made it the 16th state to
pay for medically necessary abortions using state Medicaid money.
Federal Medicaid money is not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been really significant decisions,'' said Janet
Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.
``Poor women have been just constantly squeezed in the whole issue
of access to abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those states now paying for abortions for poor women under
the Medicaid program, 12 are doing so as a result of legal
challenges brought by abortion rights advocates who cite provisions
in state constitutions to back their case. Four states _ New York,
Hawaii, Maryland and Washington _ voluntarily pay for abortions
under Medicaid. Abortion rights advocates have lost legal
challenges to compel North Carolina and Pennsylvania to pay for
abortions for poor women.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion groups are making their own gains, winning bans in
28 states since 1995 of what they call partial-birth abortion,
enabling them to gain some political momentum. But federal and
state courts have blocked most of the bans, so they have prevented
few abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the victories for the abortion rights movement have
come without huge political battles, but have resulted in
government-paid abortions for 200,000 women a year, about 14
percent of the total number of abortions performed annually,
according to a 1994 study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the
most comprehensive one to date.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for abortion rights organizations say they have chosen
their states carefully, looking not only for states whose
constitutions have broader privacy rights than the federal
Constitution or that have an Equal Rights Amendment, but also for a
state supreme court that has been willing to act independently of
Supreme Court doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to compile a series of victories in a number of
states that can then be used as precedents to convince the high
courts in other states. ``The best legal argument to make is `Look
how many we've won and how few we've lost,''' said Ms. Weiss of the
civil liberties union. ``So you certainly don't want to start
racking up losses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New Mexico the Supreme Court ruled that the state's Human
Services Department had discriminated against women by denying
money for abortions to poor women while paying for any medically
necessary procedure for poor men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the department's regulations, there is no comparable
restriction on medically necessary services relating to physical
characteristics or conditions that are unique to men,'' Justice
Pamela Minzner wrote. ``Indeed, we can find no provision in the
department's regulations that disfavor any comparable, medically
necessary procedure unique to the male anatomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion denounced the New Mexico ruling, saying it
was a sign of what could happen if a federal Equal Rights Amendment
for women should be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``These five judges apparently see no moral distinction between
removing an unborn child and removing an enlarged prostate gland,''
said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee. ``Once they've adopted that premise, it's hard to
see how any limitations on abortion can survive, including
abortions in the last stages of pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents note that they have prevailed in several
state court cases. For example, a ruling in Ohio upheld a state law
requiring a waiting period for women seeking abortions, and
mandating that doctors tell women seeking to end a pregnancy about
adoption agencies and show them pictures of a fetus at various
stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a trend,'' James Bopp, general counsel for
the National Right to Life Committee, said of the state court
decisions. ``It's been an effort that has sprung up in individual
states periodically over the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the medical insurance program for low-income people,
is financed jointly by the federal government and states. In 1976
Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, named after Rep. Henry Hyde,
that barred federal Medicaid payments for abortions unless the life
of the mother was threatened, or the pregnancy resulted from rape
or incest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Supreme Court, in Harris vs. McRae, upheld the
constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, prompting abortion rights
advocates to file several lawsuits in state courts to compel states
to use their own money to pay for abortions for poor women. They
won six of those.
</P>
<P>
   A second wave of lawsuits in state courts was spawned by the
Supreme Court's 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, which
gave states more latitude to restrict abortions. That case
persuaded a number of abortion rights advocates to take their
chances in state courts. Since then, abortion rights groups have
won six more lawsuits regarding Medicaid.

<P>
   GERMANY-ENGLISH (Berlin) _ English encroachment on Deutsch has
assumed epic proportions, giving rise to a form of speech widely
known as ``Denglisch.'' By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-CHAVEZ (Caracas, Venezuela) _ Hugo Chavez, who tried
to storm the presidential palace in a failed coup attempt six years
ago, is the front-runner in elections for the presidency on Sunday.
In some half-dozen voter surveys, he is leading by upward of 15
points over his nearest opponent, a silver-haired two-time governor
of Carabobo State, Enrique Salas Roemer. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ATTACKS (Tehran, Iran) _ An attack on visiting American
businessmen and the assassination of a prominent dissident here
have caused fresh unease among critics of the government, who say
they fear a campaign of violence by conservative forces. By Douglas
Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   ARMENIA-PIPELINE (Yerevan, Armenia) _ Throughout the Caucasus
and Central Asia, the most excited conversations and debates these
days are about the coming Caspian energy boom. Everyone wants to
know who's up and who's down, which wells have come up dry and
which are gushers, and most of all where the vital oil and gas
pipelines will be laid. Armenia is the exception. By Stephen
Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   KAZAKHSTAN (Almaty, Kazakhstan) _ With his open, unlined face,
Nursultan Nazarbayev talks like a man without a care, as might any
entrenched ruler of a resource-rich nation courted by powerful
world leaders. Yet one thing does plainly bother the dapper former
Communist Party leader who rules here. He is puzzled by recent
foreign accusations that he is a power-hungry leader who terrorizes
opponents. ``Fifteen hundred companies are working here and no one
wants a different president,'' he said recently. ``Do you
understand this? Write about it.'' By Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-VOTE (Lagos, Nigeria) _ Five months after the death of
Nigeria's longtime military dictator raised the prospect of greater
political openness here, Nigerians cast ballots Saturday for local
government officers across the country. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-KOSOVO (Oslo, Norway) _ Diplomats from 60 countries meeting
here last week pushed to speed the deployment of 2,000 monitors to
Kosovo province in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-NUKES (Washington) _ With North Korea refusing to allow
inspection of a huge underground construction site that could be
used to hide a nuclear reactor, Clinton administration officials
acknowledge that a four-year-old agreement meant to freeze North
Korea's nuclear weapons program could collapse within weeks. By
Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-CONSTITUTION (Madrid, Spain) _ Spain's celebration last
week of the 20th anniversary of its Constitution was supposed to be
a big congratulatory moment to mark the longest period of democracy
in the nation's history. But instead tensions are rising. By Al
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS-SALES-DISPUTE (Vienna) _ The United States and 32 other
countries concluded four days of arms control meetings here with a
public commitment to exercise ``maximum restraint'' before selling
weapons to regions of conflict. For at least two Wassenaar
countries, Russia and Bulgaria, the pledge of restraint seems
somewhat hollow. By Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   LIBYA-U.N. _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan went to Libya on
Saturday to throw his weight behind American and British efforts to
have two Libyans turned over for trial in the bombing of a Pan Am
jetliner over Scotland 10 years ago this month. By Barbara
Crossette.

<P>
   WYNN-GAMBLING-LOBBY (Las Vegas) _ In a modest office building
across the street from the Deja Vu nude showgirls lounge, 15
workers, most of them elderly, spend their days in a long, narrow
room lined with cubicles, computers and telephones. The telephone
room does not belong to a political party, a candidate or a
consulting firm. It belongs to Stephen Wynn, the chief executive of
Mirage Resorts, the driving force behind the new $1.9 billion
Bellagio casino hotel here, the man most responsible for reshaping
the way the nation perceives casinos. By Brett Pulley.

decades were dominated by males are becoming the place where the
boys are not. By Tamar Lewin. (With a graphic.)

   ILL-PULLMAN-FIRE (Chicago) _ Through its storied history, the
Pullman rail car factory has stood for a lot. But after a
spectacular fire destroyed its old clock tower and several adjacent
buildings on Tuesday, hopes of turning it into a transportation
museum were stood on end. By Andrew Bluth.
</P>
<P>
   ILL-NORTHWESTERN (Evanston, Ill.) _ It is reading week, the week
before exams, and the students at Northwestern University are
actually reading. Besides Proust and organic chemistry, they are
looking at headlines: ``4 are indicted in N.U. football scandal.''
By Bill Dedman.
</P>
<P>
   NH-PRIMARY-FRENZY (Concord) _ While the rest of nature has gone
quiescent for the winter, the mating rituals here in the
first-in-the-nation primary state are just now heating up. The next
presidential primary here is a good 14 months away, but this is the
season when local officials find themselves ever-more-ardently
wooed by smiling out-of-staters who figure that without the opinion
leaders of New Hampshire, they can forget about the White House. By
Carey Goldberg.

   IMPEACH-MOOD (Washington) _ Things were odd enough here when the
roses started blooming in December. But then the White House
started complaining that people were not paying enough attention to
the possible impeachment of President Clinton. Indeed, they are
not. The House of Representatives may be gearing up to vote as
early as midmonth on the impeachment of a President _ for only the
second time in history _ but history does not exactly hang heavy on
the air. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUSTAKER-PROFILE (Washington) _ Milton Kaufman never planned
on a government career when he was growing up in Coney Island in
the 1920s. But after he graduated from the City University of New
York with in 1933, the government was the only place hiring. A
tall, gentle man, who wears a suit and tie on the job and off,
Kaufman retired this fall after 64 years of service at the Census
Bureau.

   As the years pass, the number of survivors of the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor dwindles. The strike, on the quiet Sunday
morning of Dec. 7, 1941, killed 2,403 of the 65,000 people
stationed at the base.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor, Henry A. Lachenmayer, of Oxon Hill, Md., recorded
his thoughts and observations, including rumors that turned out to
be false, in his diary the next day. Lachenmayer says he wrote his
account on a Royal portable typewriter, long since gone, which he
kept in his berth aboard the battleship Pennsylvania. He says he
made the entry on pages that he stored in a typing book that zipped
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Lachenmayer, who moved to the Bronx from Germany as a child, was
a 22-year-old musician second class at the time of Pearl Harbor. He
doubled as a medic when bombs raked the Pennsylvania, but not
before having the presence of mind to stow his trombone.
Lachenmayer, now 79, retired from the Navy in 1960 after having
risen to the rank of band master aboard the battleship Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from his diary, adapted from a longer
version that appeared in 1991 in his local newspaper, The
Enquirer-Gazette in Upper Marlboro, Md.

   It was Sunday again, you might say just another Sunday, but to
us in the fleet it meant more than that, it meant the one day of
the week that granted us true relaxation, the one day apart from
drills maneuvered and work of all sorts. A day for church, and a
day for play.
</P>
<P>
   We, the band on the Pennsylvania, had a strenuous day on
Saturday. A landing force inspection in the morning and a dance
band contest in the evening which, incidentally, we won. We were
still speaking of this same contest the next morning as we heard
band call go at 10 minutes of 8 and we proceeded to the quarter
deck in preparation for morning colors. . . .
</P>
<P>
   At exactly three minutes of eight, looking over toward the Naval
Air Station on Ford Island, we could see a group of planes
proceeding gently from a high altitude and then leveling off about
150 feet from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   To our unsuspecting eyes it was just another drill, though it
was somewhat peculiar that they would pick Sunday morning for
maneuvering. Not until we saw the flames shoot out of the large
hangar at the head of the small island did we realize the
significance of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Lachenmayer scrambled to reach his battle
station, where he helped put out a fire ignited by an explosion in
the main deck and in the case mate, the enclosure where
anti-aircraft shells were stored: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The bandmaster marched us back on the double and the officer of
the deck screamed for all hands to man their air defense stations.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   A plane that looked half like a Stuka and half like one of our
own dive bombers was just leveling off and I could see the bombs
dropping out of its bottom. It was a silver-gray plane with a
reddish gold ball or sun painted on its side. I still don't know
how I got my instrument in my case and back to the shelf in the
band room but I must have made Superman's speed look amateurish. By
this time all hands were manning their battle stations and I
proceeded towards mine, stopping on the way to get my gas mask.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at my station, which incidentally is the second deck
patrol and repair station where I am a stretcher bearer, I
commenced the process of . . . closing all ports and hatches which
would be highly detrimental if left open. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Down below once more, I was asked by an ensign to assist him in
reaching some of the officers on shore leave by telephone and this
was my job for the next half hour. I succeeded in reaching
Commander Holden, who almost refused to believe the inevitable but
once convinced, arrived on board ship with the greatest of speed.
</P>
<P>
   For the next part I returned to my station and found work
enough; a fire had broken out on the second deck and had to be
attended to with haste. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The fire was precipitated by the bursting of a 500-pound bomb in
the case mate and the main deck. The havoc created by this one bomb
hit can never be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   All our fire extinguishers were used up in no time. . . . Due to
the cooperation of all hands concerned, the fire was eventually put
out. . . .

</P>
<P>
   Ahead of us in dry dock were two destroyers also under repair,
despite their wonderful barrage and cooperation; (they fought like
wild cats) a number of bomb hits were scored and their crews were
forced to abandon. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Directly aft of us, moored at ten-ten dock, were the U.S.S.
Oglala and the U.S.S. Helena. These two vessels, the former a mine
layer and the latter one of our latest 10,000-ton cruisers, were
tied or moored together. An enemy torpedo plane headed directly for
the Oglala . . . and launched its torpedo. The old ship, severely
injured, immediately turned on its side, and sank.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the harbor . . . our battleships were
receiving a merciless pounding. The U.S.S. Arizona received two
bomb hits amidship and a great number of torpedoes. She split in
half and her forward magazines burst. Directly forward of her, the
U.S.S. Oklahoma received many torpedo hits and capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Next to her the U.S.S. West Virginia received a tremendous
amount of bomb hits and her whole port battery was wiped out. . . .
The U.S.S. Tennessee stood up fairly, or rather, remarkably well
considering the pounding she took. The U.S.S. Maryland stood as
solid as a piece of granite and fought the enemy. She remained in
one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Directly forward of the Maryland, though some distance away . .
., the U.S.S. California received torpedo hits and listed on her
port side. The U.S.S. Nevada, in a daring attempt to reach the open
sea through the channel, was torpedoed and her wary skipper
grounded her on the right side of the harbor in order to keep the
channel clear.
</P>
<P>
   One destroyer in the floating dry dock on our starboard was hit
and went on fire, burning right at the bridge.

<P>
   Now to the casualties, and I write this with a heavy heart. On
our own ship, the one bomb hit pierced the boat deck abreast of No.
7 A.A. gun and tore through the No. 9 case mate and down to the
main deck. All this area exploded with vigor. The Marine division
suffered the severest losses.
</P>
<P>
   First Lieutenant Craig, standing near the three-inch gun, had
both legs blown off and received other injuries; he died almost on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Rall, a lieutenant junior grade, and a pharmacist's mate
were mangled and killed instantly. This information I received from
one of the musicians, Andrew Lambert, who, standing near by, saw it
happen and was shell-shocked. His fellow stretcher bearer, Musician
S.W. Craig, survived with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   I wandered around the dressing station, my eyes not believing
what they saw. I gave a drink here and loosened an article of
clothing there; there was not much else I could do.
</P>
<P>
   Many were badly burned and screamed for relief of pain; they had
already received drug injections, and a glass of water to the lips
was in many cases the only human assistance possible. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day I assisted in taking the dead off the ship and
in bringing on board many rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   As far as other casualties are concerned I am in complete
ignorance, though I know that they were severe. In the case of the
capsized Oklahoma I have heard that there were from 500 to 1,100
men trapped inside her hull, I believe that the majority of them
were extricated.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud to say that the U.S.S. Pennsylvania was the first in
action and that we accounted for not less than eight enemy planes.

</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the rumors passing amongst us, none of us
having real solid information. Some of the enemy planes were
piloted by German fliers. The enemy tried to land troops at Nanakuh
and Waikiki beaches, but were repulsed. We sank two enemy aircraft
carriers some distance from the islands. Wake and Midway islands
are in Japanese hands. Saboteurs land in great numbers on the
island. In reference to this last fact I must admit that quite a
large number of prisoners were taken here in the Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   We had two more alarms yesterday, but these proved to be only
scares. Our men are now and forever on the alert, and woe to the
enemy if they try it again.

PROSPECT OF IMPEACHMENT BRINGS YAWNS IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Things were odd enough here when the roses started
blooming in December. But then the White House started complaining
that people were not paying enough attention to the possible
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't taking it seriously,'' fumed Joseph Lockhart,
the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they are not. The House of Representatives may be
gearing up to vote as early as midmonth on the impeachment of a
president _ for only the second time in history _ but history does
not exactly hang heavy on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you talking about?'' asked Patrick Sabatier, the U.S.
bureau chief for the French newspaper Liberation, when asked
whether he thought Americans were paying sufficient attention to
the weighty doings. ``The NBA lockout?''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 months of hype, the impeachment hearings are drawing
mostly shrugs and yawns from Washington's mandarins: political
operatives, journalists, lawyers, lobbyists and even Clinton
administration officials. Chastened by the Democrats' strong
showing in the midterm elections, elite Washington appears to have
caught up with the views held by most Americans for months.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is indifferent. Many conservatives in Congress are
bent on impeachment. And as a result, the strategists who are paid
to be terrified for Clinton worry that while Washington rolls its
eyes, the House may actually vote against him. The Senate would
then try him, a potentially lengthy process that would require a
two-thirds vote to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But there are few outward signs of this inward turmoil. No
candlelight vigils flicker outside the White House, no horns honk
in demand of the president's resignation _ the hallmarks of an
uprising that Leonard Garment remembers from his days as counsel to
President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what else? Who cares?'' said Garment, a lawyer here, as he
described the current attitude. ``That's the general sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   A lone sign-toting protester who appeared outside the White
House last week was gone by Friday, when Cassie Waite, 15, jostled
with her ninth-grade government class for a smiling photograph
against the tall iron fence. Visiting from McKeesport, Pa., she had
expected to see at least some demonstrators handing out leaflets,
but instead saw only badged government workers and tourists
strolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the news constantly, and it makes it seem like
everything's going on here,'' Cassie said. ``And we get here _ and
there's nothing. People are going on about their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused and although, moments before, she had been
criticizing Clinton as a lawbreaker, added, ``And I think that's
the way it should be.'' She was, she said, ``sick of hearing about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a reporter raised it, the subject of impeachment hearings
had simply not come up during the government class's visit to
Washington, said Cassie's teacher, Ray Beard. ``The overall feeling
of the students is not to be bothered discussing Clinton's
problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the fence, one official said he and his
colleagues were not following the hearings. It was as though, he
said, ``there's something you don't want to watch on your favorite
channel but you know it'll be over. Every now and then you flip
over to see: `Hey, is that thing off yet? C'mon already.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among some officials, the mood is light enough that they are
literally dancing in the halls. At the senior staff meeting at the
White House on Friday morning, Gene Sperling, the director of the
National Economic Council, and Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, used a novel approach to announce
that unemployment had dropped to 4.4 percent in November: They
stood up, put their hands over their heads and spun around in a
synchronized shimmy that one White House official called ``The
Nerd.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the strategists who are trying to devise Clinton's legal
and political defense, impeachment is a darkening cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eerie,'' a senior White House official said of the
environment in Washington. Few are taking the hearings seriously,
he said, but ``next week we're going to have these final days, and
it's going to be very reality-based in this country that this is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, the press secretary, described the attitude in
Washington as ``kind of suspended disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll wake up and they'll find out that their elected
representatives have for reasons well short of legitimate moved to
take a step to remove the president,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   Tom Korologos, a Republican operative who was Nixon's Senate
liaison, said that as the House impeachment vote drew close in 1974
the Senate had already devised exacting plans for its subsequent
duties. Nixon resigned before the House vote, after becoming
convinced that the Senate would convict him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the sense that anybody is taking it that
seriously at the moment,'' Korologos said. ``It could sneak up on
them really quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Several causes lie behind federal Washington's new indifference:
fatigue from multiple, mutating investigations; resignation in the
face of the public's defiant liking for Clinton; a belief that no
stirring revelations are in the offing, impatience with the
bewildering swerves by the hearings and the president's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   So when the unpleasant subject of the hearings comes up _ and
this is not often _ Washington's wealthy and powerful cluck and
invoke Marx, saying history is repeating itself as farce. Those who
are more knowing wonder how many more times it might repeat itself
this way in the future, with these hearings as the new precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that provoked this clash between the executive and
legislative branches are less threatening to the Constitution than
those in Watergate, say some who lived through both. ``There was a
sense of awe and of great drama,'' recalled Elizabeth Drew, a
journalist who covered Watergate for The New Yorker. Now, she said,
``the issues involved are nowhere near the scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Eastland, the publisher of the American Spectator, said
people simply did not want to follow a story when they thought they
knew the end, and they believed that the Senate would not convict
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Garment, the lawyer, saw something deeper, an anesthesia and
amnesia producing a ``dazed Disneyland'' in modern politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the Cold War ended a sense of apprehension that
major political events can affect our lives in a very serious
way,'' he said. ``There's a collapse of a sort of emotional memory
about vital, energetic, pointed, pungent politics. It's just all
games, dirty jokes.''

BERLIN HAS A WORD FOR ITS AMBITIONS: ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The fight to be the leading newspaper of the city with
ambitions to be Europe's new capital is a ferocious one, so when
executives at the Berliner Morgenpost sat down recently to dream up
a new advertising slogan, they thought long and hard. What they
came up with was: ``Simply the Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Not ``Einfach besser,'' German for the same idea, but ``Simply
the Best,'' as in Tina Turner's popular song. ``Our target group
was young people,'' said Rolf Buer, the paper's marketing manager,
``and this slogan was young, fresh, simple and sure to get people
talking. German words are just too long.''
</P>
<P>
   That may seem an unjust accusation to level at ``Einfach
besser,'' but it is true that if precision is a hallmark of the
German vocabulary, brevity is not. In any event, the issue is
clearly a broader one, for the English encroachment on Deutsch has
assumed epic proportions, giving rise to a form of speech widely
known as ``Denglisch.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this city, whose passion for reinventing itself is very
much of the New World. As you drive past posters advertising
Volkswagen's ``New Beetle'' (not ``Der neue Kafer''), you may hear
a radio advertisement for an Audi that gives you ``die power,''
only to see a newspaper headline about Germany's lack of ``jobs''
(forget ``arbeit''), as the radio turns to a discussion of
Berliners' growing attraction for ``the American way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   English, of course, is advancing everywhere, propelled by the
Internet and the dominance of American popular culture. It is the
most widely studied foreign language in German schools, where most
children start learning it at age 11. Its advance appears
particularly marked here, strong enough to set off a debate on what
it is to be a German.
</P>
<P>
   Language, of course, is a paramount expression of identity, and
German identity has been a delicate issue ever since Hitler
perverted the notion with disastrous consequences for those he
considered un-German. Not for nothing have many Germans embraced
the idea of being ``Europeans'' or ``cosmopolitans'' or ``citizens
of the world.'' And of course the language of such world citizens
is English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to think in terms of national borders,'' said
Ulrich Veigel, head of the Bates advertising agency in Germany. ``I
live in Germany, and was born here, but I'm a citizen of the world,
and that is the way we should all think. In the medium-term,
nationalities have no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   English, Veigel continued, is a wonderful language precisely
because it is the most cosmopolitan. ``I look forward to the day,''
he said, ``when I go to France and do not have to speak French.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that day _ some way off if the Academie Francaise has
anything to do with it _ Veigel will be pushing his message in
Germany, where the Bates agency is responsible for the current
campaign of the cargo division of the national airline, Lufthansa.
Slogan: ``Thinking in new directions.'' It is also promoting a new
German telephone company called ``First Telecom'' with the jingle
``You can't beat the First.''
</P>
<P>
   Such catchwords clearly reflect a perception that Germans see
English as more contemporary or modish. ``New Beetle sounds more
hip than neue Kafer,'' said Sabina Metzner of Volkswagen. ``We
wanted to make clear that the Beetle might have some resemblances
to the old Kafer, but it is very much a modern car.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Germans, though, the abandonment of the language of
Heine and Rilke is too high a price to be hip. Wolfgang Kramer, a
professor of economics at the University of Dortmund, said
``Denglisch'' is a monstrosity, ``a cowardly means for many Germans
to disentangle themselves from German history, a way out of being
German.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he read a profile of Jil Sander, the
Hamburg-based fashion designer, in the magazine of the daily
newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In a single paragraph,
Ms. Sander explained how her life was ``giving story,'' talked of
the need to be ``contemporary,'' extolled the virtues of
``coordinated concepts,'' referred to her ``audience,'' and
ruminated on the ``effortless magic'' of her styles.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for the professor. He founded the Society for
the Protection of the German Language (Verein zur Wahrung der
Deutschen Sprache), instituted an annual linguistic booby prize for
the ``Sprachpanscher'' (``language diluter'') of the year, and gave
the 1997 accolade to Ms. Sander.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This year, his society has seen its membership soar from 200 to
4,000 and last month, Kramer announced that the 1998 award for
``spineless conformity to modern pseudo-cosmopolitan attempts at
showing off'' had been awarded to Ron Sommer, chief executive of
Deutsche Telekom, the main telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer had distinguished himself by advertising ``moonshine''
and ``sunshine'' tariffs, and listing calls on bills under the
categories of ``Citycall,'' ``Germancall'' and ``Globalcall.''
</P>
<P>
   Until July, the German translations only appeared on the back of
the bills, but have now been moved to the same line after what Hans
Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, called ``some
inquiries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chief executive pays no attention to this so-called
prize,'' Ehnert said. ``We are a global player in a modern,
high-tech world, and English expressions are part of this future
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the success of Kramer's association suggests a reaction may
be gathering pace. ``Shame explains why English does so much better
here than in France, or Spain or Italy,'' he said. ``But I refuse
to let the history of our country be condensed into the 12 years of
Hitler's terror. I was born much later and have no reason to be
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   This message is also that of the new government of the Social
Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, which devoted much of a recent summit
meeting with French leaders to the issue of defending
``Franco-German culture'' against the cultural pull of America
through the establishment of a new Franco-German university in
Saarbrucken and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, France and Germany have a basic problem: the
unfettered, dynamic, creative culture of California is more
attractive to many young people than European societies often
identified with high unemployment and rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young want to hear English,'' said Buer of the Berliner
Morgenpost. ``It's seen as free and flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he noted, if the Berliner Morgenpost had chosen
``Einfach besser'' instead of ``Simply the Best'' as a slogan, it
might have violated the German law known as the ``Unzulassige
Alleinstellung,'' which forbids sweeping assertions of superiority
in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have had to answer a lot of questions,'' Buer said.
``Better than who? Better than what? Why better? Better in what
precise respect? It was just too much bother, whereas in English we
could do what we wanted.''

 By TAMAR LEWIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly but surely, college campuses that for decades were
dominated by males are becoming the place where the boys are not.
</P>
<P>
   In a trend that is reshaping everything from recruiting to
social life, women increasingly outnumber men at colleges and
universities. Even if the imbalance never becomes extreme, it
raises concerns about the consequences of fewer men getting
advanced education, and the sense that the liberal arts education
may become a women's domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why there are more women here, but I know that in
high school I always felt women did better and cared more about
doing well,'' said Catherine Gang, a sophomore at New York
University, where there are nearly six women for every four men, a
ratio shared by, among others, Fordham University, the University
of California at Santa Cruz, the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and Beloit College.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the population of students enrolled in higher
education tipped toward women more than a decade ago, and the skew
is growing, year by year. Although census figures show that there
are slightly more college-age men than women, according to U.S.
Department of Education statistics, there were 8.4 million women
and only 6.7 million men enrolled in college in 1996, the last year
for which statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   The number of men enrolled in college has declined each year
from 1991 to 1995 but rose in 1996, while the number of women has
risen steadily. And by 2007, the department projects, that gender
gap will be larger, with 9.2 million women and only 6.9 million
men.
</P>
<P>
   Women outnumber men in every category of higher education:
public, private, religiously affiliated, four-year, two-year. And
among part-time students, older students and African-Americans, the
skew is much larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are just not as interested in higher education as women,''
said Alan McIvor, vice president of enrollment services at Beloit
in Wisconsin, who two years ago began urging the Associated
Colleges of the Midwest, a group of 14 liberal arts colleges, to
study the issue. ``They have these nonacademic interests: the
butcher, baker, the candlestick maker. But at a residential liberal
arts college, where kids learn as much from each other as from
their professors, I think we should be concerned about the mix of
students, about gender balance, about attracting more young men who
are as strong as our women applicants.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear consensus on what men are doing instead of
college, and why they are less committed to higher education. But
education experts say it is probably a confluence of factors, from
girls' greater success in high school to a strong economy that may
give boys a sense that they can make their way without higher
education, whether in computer work or the military.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when the country's high school graduation rate is
lagging behind the rates in other industrialized nations, boys are
more likely to drop out than girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start with who does well in high school, and girls are
ahead there, which some people say is because they tolerate boredom
better,'' said Patricia Albjerg Graham, president of the Spencer
Foundation of Chicago, which specializes in educational research,
and past dean of the Harvard School of Education. ``Then there are
racial and ethnic differences; black girls persist in school more
than black boys. Those differences account for part of what's going
on, but I think the larger difference is that men feel it easier to
get a job that can support them. This tilt to women has a great
deal to do with what people of modest means do or don't do
educationally, and whether they see higher education as necessary
to their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the widening income gap between high school graduates and
those with advanced degrees, though, many education experts worry
that men's failure to pursue higher education will seriously limit
their life choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be concerned that higher education is losing poor
and minority men, that more African-American men are going to
prison than to college,'' said Arthur Levine, the president of
Columbia University's Teachers College. ``It's also worth thinking
about what it means if our broadest education, the liberal arts, is
increasingly being reserved for one sex.''
</P>
<P>
   For college admissions officials, the under-representation of
men poses a challenge. Most say they are aware of the gender
imbalance, but not overly concerned _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to be a consensus that somewhere beyond a 60-40
split, there comes a moment when a school ceases to be a
comfortable place for both sexes. ``We do have some concern about
the skew going too far,'' said Jerry Lucido, director of admissions
at the University of North Carolina. ``How far is too far? I guess
that would be if students here thought it was a problem. We
certainly don't want the reputation that Chapel Hill is not a place
for men, because that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The threshold at which colleges start to worry has shifted in
the last few years, said Levine, a former liberal arts college
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you worried at 55 percent women, but the
new wisdom is that anything up to 60 percent is OK,'' he said.
``Probably nobody will admit it, but I know that lots of places try
to get some gender balance by having easier admissions standards
for boys than for girls. Recently, at a school where I was giving a
speech, I asked `How far down the list are you going for boys?' and
the answer was `All the way.' The problem is that if you take men
who are not of the same caliber as the women, the
highest-performing women leave, because the men aren't as
interesting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Admissions policies are not the only ways to address the issue,
though. Many schools are repackaging themselves to attract more
male interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had researchers, in-house and independent, help us shape
the messages we use in our letters to the individual candidates we
contact through the College Board,'' said John Buckley, the dean of
admissions at Fordham University. ``For women, the messages we're
stressing are small classes, personal attention and access to
professors. For men, we're talking about internships and
intercollegiate sports.''
</P>
<P>
   When Buckley arrived at Fordham 15 years ago, the student body
was split evenly between men and women, but a skew became
noticeable about five years ago, and now incoming freshman classes,
he said, run about 59 percent women, 41 percent men.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor University in Waco, Texas., which like Fordham is
religiously affiliated, has also taken steps to entice male
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a liberal arts school with a large education school and
we know we're heavy toward women, so we've fought it a little, by
adding some majors that we thought would appeal to guys, and an
engineering school,'' said Stan Madden, vice president of
university relations. ``We're having our recruiting literature
redesigned, and we've been thinking about what's a feminine look,
and what's a masculine look. We had a picture of a library with a
lot of stained glass, and people said that was kind of a feminine
cover. Now we're using a picture of the quadrangle.''
</P>
<P>
   While the colleges that were formerly for men only have had no
trouble finding large numbers of female students, many former
women's colleges are still struggling to attract enough qualified
men to reach the 40-60 threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about it a lot, that we're at 33 percent and until we
reach the 40 percent threshold, we haven't completely made the
transition,'' said Gail Berson, the dean of admissions at Wheaton
College, in Massachusetts. ``You need to have that critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   And some, like Vassar and Sarah Lawrence, admit a higher
percentage of male applicants than female ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no preset criteria for men or women, and we review
them one at a time, but we do take slightly more men,'' said David
Borus, director of admissions at Vassar, which accepts not quite 40
percent of the women who apply, and slightly more than half the
men. ``Because we want to try and have some gender balance, I think
there is a bit of a mindset that may be a bit more generous to the
men.''
</P>
<P>
   At most engineering and technical schools, including the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon, men are
still the majority. Harvard, Yale and Princeton still have a male
edge, as do the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   But at most liberal arts schools, women are the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a bias against the liberal arts, a feeling that
real men don't speak French, that in the 20th century these are
women's topics and men do economics and engineering,'' said
Catharine Stimpson, a feminist scholar who is dean of the Graduate
School of Arts and Science at NYU.
</P>
<P>
   At NYU, Matthew Santirocco, the dean of the College of Arts and
Science, said he was untroubled by the gender ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very diverse, very inclusive environment,'' Santirocco
said. ``I'd only be troubled if it got to the point where it was a
majoritarian environment, where the minority was afraid to raise
their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   While the feeling may be absent at NYU, Ms. Stimpson said, some
schools develop a sense of unease as women become the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some places, I've seen trustees worry about the skew,'' she
said. ``Male trustees get worried if the gender balance goes to 48
to 52, and the female trustees say, `Are you crazy, were you
worried when it was 48 to 52 the other way?' I think it's about
money and prestige and an old atavistic fear of tipping. Some
people still believe that if you're a women's institution, you're a
lesser institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at NYU express mixed feelings about the gender
imbalance, with many male students saying they thrive on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were more girls than boys when I applied,'' said
Hugh Curnutt, a junior, ``and I thought it was a positive thing,
because if there's more girls, the dating possibilities go up. I
feel more comfortable in classes where there aren't so many guys.
It's less competitive and intimidating. Guys always want to take
you on. They're really quick to say, `He's all wrong.' Girls might
disagree but they'll say something like, ``He might be right, but I
think ...' In my communications class I think there's 29 girls and
2 guys. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The women tend to be less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many guys to date, and the ones there are have
their pick of so many women that they have a tendency to become
players,'' said Ms. Gang, a drama student. ``I've fallen in love
with more gay guys than anyone should. And in scene classes, we
have to do a whole lot of two-women scenes. But it's not so bad,
because we're in New York City, and you can always find a way to
meet people off campus.''

   LAS VEGAS _ In a modest office building across the street from
the Deja Vu nude showgirls lounge, 15 workers, most of them
elderly, spend their days in a long, narrow room lined with
cubicles, computers and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The door to the room has a sign that reads ``Telephone
Operations.'' Inside, the workers poll voters on coming races,
survey the nation on issues and make get-out-the-vote calls for
candidates. ``I'm going to read you the names of some people in our
community,'' a worker repeatedly recited from a script in the days
before last month's election. ``After each, please let me know if
your impression of them is favorable or unfavorable.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone room does not belong to a political party, a
candidate or a consulting firm. It belongs to Stephen Wynn, the
chief executive of Mirage Resorts, the driving force behind the new
$1.9 billion Bellagio casino hotel here, the man most responsible
for reshaping the way the nation perceives casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the political business now,'' Wynn declared in 1994
after several efforts to expand his company ran afoul of elected
officials in Connecticut, Detroit and Vancouver. And so in Wynn
fashion, he has used campaign contributions, lobbyists and his
corporation's own expertise and manpower to assemble one of the
most powerful political machines in the nation. As he goes about
building casino resorts in New Jersey and Mississippi and enlarging
his Las Vegas empire with the extravagant Bellagio, political
muscle is a vital element in his ambitious plan to transform his
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Wynn's control over politicians is all-encompassing,''
said Steve Miller, a former Las Vegas City Council member who has
frequently been at odds with Wynn. ``It's overwhelming. Either you
work for him or he tries to get you out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Considered by many Nevadans to be the most powerful man in the
state, Wynn gets roadways rerouted, public transportation projects
scuttled and public land deeded over to his company. But he wields
his influence not only to expand his company beyond Las Vegas,
where it owns four casinos plus a half interest in a fifth, but
also to advance the public's acceptance of casinos as he builds
palaces so lush that they become must-see stops on America's road
map.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a change taking place,'' Wynn said in a recent
interview, whispering intimately for effect. His new casinos will
be ``more elegant, more lovely, more complete and fetching than
anything done before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it has nothing to do with gambling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, of course, when a state rejected a Mirage casino
but he was urged to build a hotel and entertainment complex anyway,
Wynn refused. The gambling, he conceded, will ``certainly help us
pay for it all.''
</P>
<P>
   To help realize his ambitions, Wynn has made Mirage one of the
largest contributors among casino companies to federal candidates
and the Democratic and Republican Parties, even though competitors
like Harrah's and Hilton own more casinos in more states. In the
two years leading into the last election, Mirage gave $464,596, at
that level, and it says it contributed $650,000 more to local and
state candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, where its $650 million Beau Rivage in Biloxi
will employ 4,000 workers, Mirage is already one of the largest
contributors to local races. In Biloxi's mayoral race in 1997,
campaign finance records show that Mirage was the largest single
contributor to the successful re-election campaign of Mayor A.J.
Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his deep pockets, Wynn uses his opulent
properties to woo politicians. A 1995 fund-raiser at Shadow Creek,
Mirage's ultra-exclusive Las Vegas golf resort where caviar is
served on the fairway, raised $500,000 for the presidential
campaign of Bob Dole. The casino operator hedged his bets,
attending a $25,000-a-plate fund-raiser for President Clinton and
contributing to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Wynn apart is his polling operation, which enables him
to influence elections and gain the favor of politicians who decide
everything from new roads that lead to Mirage casinos to taxes paid
by the entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of Punam Mathur, Mirage's director of
government and community relations, polls are taken on everything
from local school board races to gambling initiatives in states
where the company might want to do business.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone operation also conducts marketing and corporate
surveys. In southern Mississippi, for example, where the labor
force is very tight, Mirage conducted telephone surveys of
residents to learn what job benefits would make its casino
attractive to potential employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company shares its polling data with preferred candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be able to call a candidate and say, `Whatever
you're doing, keep it up,' or `You better start working because
your opponent is beating you,''' Ms. Mathur said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn also conducts voter registration drives for his 26,000
employees and their families in Nevada, where Mirage has its
corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He and his staff personally meet with as many as 350 candidates
in an election year before deciding whom Mirage will support. Then,
before Election Day, he issues his employees a voter guide with
stars next to the names of candidates who have received his ``seal
of approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mirage telephone operation pays dividends in many ways. For
example, when Yvonne Atkinson Gates, chairwoman of the Clark County
Board of Supervisors in Nevada, wants to hold a community meeting,
she calls the Mirage telephone room to have it place calls to
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They record a telephone message with my voice on it and do the
dialing for me,'' said Ms. Gates, who, as head of the county board
that must approve casino development along the Las Vegas strip, is
a vital link to Wynn's continued success.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To the envy of many other casino owners, Wynn has gotten what he
wants from the county board, as well as from other local entities.
To expand his Golden Nugget casino, he persuaded city officials to
deed him a downtown street. In developing the Bellagio, he struck a
deal with the county board of supervisors that enabled Mirage to
build a nine-acre lake with 1,100 fountains in front of the hotel,
despite a local ordinance barring new artificial lakes in the
desert city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the county fathers with a business proposition that
would be hard for them to refuse,'' Wynn recalled with amusement.
He offered to trade water rights attached to his property in
exchange for an ordinance allowing his lake. The ordinance,
however, allowed new lakes in terms so specific that only the
Bellagio could benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was referred to as the Mirage ordinance,'' Wynn said,
laughing. ``For obvious reasons, it can't be duplicated.'' And, he
noted, ``It passed without opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, with its strange brew of
magnolia trees, antebellum mansions and high-wattage casino lights,
Wynn's Beau Rivage is quickly becoming a force in local politics.
``These Beau Rivage people, they want to control everything,'' said
one Biloxi city official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
One of Mirage's first moves in Biloxi was to hire the same law firm
that represents the city on casino matters.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Mirage built one of the most expensive and dramatic
buildings the region has ever seen, but by contributing campaign
money and lobbying local politicians, the company has been able to
include unique features that distinguish its casino from the dozen
others here.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mirage officials vigorously lobbied the state
Legislature to enact a law allowing restaurants to feature
micro-breweries. As a result, the Beau Rivage will have
Mississippi's first micro-brewery. To get clear and free title to
the huge waterfront parcel needed to build the casino hotel, Wynn
spent $1.9 million to buy 4,225 acres of coastal wildlife habitat
throughout Mississippi and swapped it for a critical 6.8 acres that
were owned by the state.
</P>
<P>
   One powerful Mississippi resident whom Wynn has made a special
effort to court is Republican Sen. Trent Lott. The Mirage
contributed $10,000 this year to Lott's political action committee,
according to an analysis of political contributions, and last year
Lott, the majority leader, flew to Las Vegas on Wynn's corporate
jet to attend fund-raising events sponsored by the gambling
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where until a few years ago the industry had only
a scattered presence, Wynn was instrumental in forming the American
Gaming Association, which pays $800,000 a year to Frank Fahrenkopf
Jr., a former Republican National Committee chairman, to lead the
industry's lobbying efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Steve is doing what he does best,'' said John Smith,
author of ``Running Scared,'' an unauthorized biography against
which Wynn has a defamation lawsuit pending. ``He has been most
effective at making the gambling industry a legitimate industry
that does things like lobbying and contributing to candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before Wynn graduated from the University of Pennsylvania
in 1963, his father, a gambler and Maryland bingo parlor operator,
died of heart disease at age 46, leaving the family with huge debts
from his gambling losses. Stepping in to take over the bingo
parlor, the young Wynn was on his way to helping build the
country's fledgling casino industry.
</P>
<P>
   He soon moved to Las Vegas, invested in the mob-tainted Frontier
casino, ran a liquor distributing company and entered into a real
estate investment involving Howard Hughes that netted Wynn more
than half a million dollars in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Charming Wall Street as he now does politicians, Wynn first took
control of the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, and then with the aid of
Michael Milken, the junk bond financier, he built the Golden Nugget
in Atlantic City in 1980 for $140 million. He hated New Jersey's
heavy regulation of casinos, though, and sold the casino in 1987
for $440 million, vowing never to return to the state.
</P>
<P>
   As Wynn refined his ability to negotiate with politicians, he
reversed that position. After the industry successfully lobbied New
Jersey officials to relax casino regulations, Wynn then persuaded
them to provide $220 million in public money _ in addition to $110
million of Mirage's _ for a roadway and tunnel that will lead to Le
Jardin, a $1 billion casino development planned by Mirage. Last
month, the state broke ground on the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey law prohibits casinos from contributing to local
politicians. So in 1996, while Wynn was trying to win acceptance of
the roadway and tunnel, which was causing an uproar among other
casino operators as well as among residents who would be displaced
by the project, he pumped $31,000 into the state's U.S. Senate
race, according to an analysis of the company's contributions. He
gave $17,000 to the eventual winner, Robert Torricelli, a Democrat,
and $14,000 to his Republican opponent, Richard Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he dined at the governor's mansion with Christie
Whitman, and directed his largess at community leaders in Atlantic
City. To build support, he flew a group of public housing officials
and tenant association leaders to Las Vegas for a tour of Mirage
properties, all accommodations paid.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Wynn persuade local officials to build the roadway
and tunnel, but the city also gave him the 170-acre site for his
project, in the marina district north of the boardwalk, and the New
Jersey Legislature passed a bill to repay him up to 75 percent of
the money he spends to clean up the site, part of which had been a
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is very smart,'' said Alan Marcus, a spokesman for
Donald Trump's casinos, which adamantly opposed Wynn's Atlantic
City plans. ``He's so smart he took their pants off. He got
everything he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Wynn has not pulled it all off alone. He is widely
credited for surrounding himself with talented people, and his
reputation for treating his employees well is legendary. He once
surprised his 400 managers and executives in Atlantic City with new
cars. Last year, Fortune magazine named Mirage as one of America's
``most admired'' companies, second only to Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who have worked closely with Wynn know there is a
mercurial side. His temper, people who know him say, can erupt as
fiercely as the volcano in front of his flagship casino, the
Mirage. During one telephone call, Miller, the former Las Vegas
City Council member, recalled, Wynn was ``breathing hard and
calling me names.''
</P>
<P>
   During his negotiations with New Jersey officials, Wynn once
called Whitman and complained that he was unhappy with the terms
she had announced for the roadway and casino project. Angered by
her refusal to change the terms, Wynn delivered a biting last shot
over the governor's speaker phone, says one of the people who were
listening. ``This is Steve Wynn,'' he said. ``I don't accept this
deal. Good night, ladies and gentleman.'' And he hung up.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wynn, Mirage has grown into a $1.5 billion-a-year company,
its stock rising an average of 28 percent a year since he took over
the company 25 years ago. Wynn controls more than 15 percent of the
stock, and his wife and brother also own substantial shares. Wynn
and his wife, Elaine, first married in 1963, had two children, then
divorced, then married each other again.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn, 56, pals around with celebrities like Michael Jordan,
Kenny Rogers and Quincy Jones. And he is often treated with more
reverence than any casino operator could expect. Last month's
groundbreaking for the Atlantic City roadway was attended by more
than 500 people. As guests crowded inside a huge tent and waited
for Wynn to arrive, one man quipped, ``There's going to be a mad
rush when God arrives.'' Afterward, an elderly couple dressed in
matching Elvis jackets clamored for Wynn's autograph.
</P>
<P>
   One day during Bellagio's opening festivities in October, as he
finished lunch and headed off through the resort, Wynn bumped his
shin on a low stone wall. His expression was pained, but he
instantly recovered, only to take two more steps and stumble over
the base of a metal pole. The Mirage employee accompanying Wynn did
not appear to be accustomed to the subtleties of leading the boss
without being obvious: Despite a degenerative eye disease, he is
determined to appear in public as if his vision is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Wynn cautiously walked past the Bellagio's $300
million art gallery, where masterpieces by van Gogh, Renoir and
Monet hang on the walls, and through the hotel's conservatory, with
its 50-foot ceiling and explosion of flowers. On through the lobby
he went, with all heads spinning in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   As he gingerly walked onto the casino floor, he was met by a
close friend, the singer Paul Anka. Throwing his arm around the
shoulder of the diminutive Anka for guidance, Wynn moved quickly
now, through the rows of blackjack tables, past the four-star
restaurants with their world-renowned chefs, beyond the high-roller
slot area where gamblers such as Julius Erving, the retired
basketball star, were playing slot machines at $100 a spin, and
toward the $95 million theater that is home to a new original
Cirque du Soleil production.
</P>
<P>
   This was just the atmosphere that the Mirage chairman had
envisioned for all of his new properties, and as customers stared
and marveled at him, he beamed with the confidence befitting the
unofficial king of this gambling kingdom. ``Smell this place,'' he
said, pursing his lips and squinting his eyes with sheer delight.
``Feeeeeel this place.''

<P>
   Everyone has heard about the LSD-soaked stickers given away to
schoolchildren. The stamp-size tabs are reportedly decorated with
blue stars or pictures of Superman, butterflies or clowns.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the story of the child who is dying of cancer and
wants postcards sent to him? Or how about Neiman Marcus' $250
cookie recipe?
</P>
<P>
   They are all urban myths, of course, stories that refuse to die
no matter how many times they are roundly debunked.
</P>
<P>
   Science is different, right? Study results become part of the
annals, authenticated by weighty papers and validated by panels of
experts. This is the usual route to credibility. Then there are the
myths.
</P>
<P>
   Take the ``Hawthorne effect,'' which is much embraced in social
psychology. It refers to a study from 1927 to 1933 of factory
workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne Plant in Illinois. It
showed that regardless of the changes made in working conditions _
more breaks, longer breaks or fewer and shorter ones _ productivity
increased. These changes apparently had nothing to do with the
workers' responses. The workers, or so the story goes, produced
more because they saw themselves as special, participants in an
experiment, and their inter-relationships improved.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds very compelling. ``The results of this experiment, or
rather the human relations interpretation offered by the
researchers who summarized the results, soon became gospel for
introductory textbooks in both psychology and management science,''
said Dr. Lee Ross, a psychology professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   But only five workers took part in the study, Ross said, and two
were replaced partway through for gross insubordination and low
output.
</P>
<P>
   A psychology professor at the University of Michigan, Dr.
Richard Nisbett called the Hawthorne effect ``a glorified
anecdote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've got the anecdote,'' he said, ``you can throw away
the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Myths happen in medicine, too. Dr. Robert Buckman, a cancer
specialist at the University of Toronto, discovered an urban legend
when he tracked the story of a spectacular cancer treatment to its
source.
</P>
<P>
   Buckman first heard the story on June 25, 1990, in Toronto in a
lecture given by Dr. Bernard Siegel, a doctor who has written
popular books on the power of the mind over cancer. Siegel told of
two oncologists chatting about a study they were participating in
to test a combination of four chemotherapy drugs, which had the
initials EPHO.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor's patients were doing spectacularly well; three
quarters of them were responding to the drugs. But only a quarter
of the other doctor's patients were improving. Then the first
doctor explained that he had simply rearranged the letters of the
drugs so they spelled HOPE.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's audience was overwhelmed. ``If hope did that, then it
was the most powerful anti-cancer agent the world had ever known,''
Buckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was skeptical. He knew by the initials of the drugs
that the treatment must be for small-cell lung cancer, which is
very difficult to treat. Why had he not heard of the study before?
</P>
<P>
   Buckman asked Siegel for his source, which turned out to be a
book by Norman Cousins, who had referred to an article published in
a 1988 Western Journal of Medicine. Buckman telephoned the writer,
a cancer specialist in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor told Buckman that he had invented the story. It was a
parable meant to tell doctors that there was more to treating
cancer than merely doling out drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Are scientists as credulous as the parents who worried about the
LSD stickers? Perhaps urban legends take hold, Ross said, because
``sometimes a story deserves to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may be no different from lay people when it comes a
message that strikes a chord in them. The Hawthorne effect had an
enormous appeal for many social psychologists, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study became a symbol initially for arguing that change
itself is good or that anything you do produces positive effects,''
he said. Then it was interpreted to mean that people who take part
in experiments behave differently simply because they are taking
part in an experiment, he added. That, too, appealed to many
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us kind of believe that subjective factors matter a
lot in medicine,'' Ross said. ``We want there to be demonstrations
that make that point. And so we may ignore flaws and deficiencies
in a study if it is saying something we believe to be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, if some naysayer takes note of the paucity or absence of
data, Ross said, ``it's like seeing a magician's trick and then
having the magician tell how he did it.''

NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR PACT REPORTED NEAR BREAKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With North Korea refusing to allow inspection of a
huge underground construction site that could be used to hide a
nuclear reactor, Clinton administration officials acknowledge that
a 4-year-old agreement meant to freeze North Korea's nuclear
weapons program could collapse within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 agreement, which the administration has hailed as among
its proudest foreign policy achievements, was supposed to end the
threat that North Korea would build a nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery of the vast underground installation and North
Korea's continued development of ballistic missiles have led many
administration officials to wonder whether the agreement will have
to be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Under the so-called Agreed Framework, the North Koreans were
promised billions of dollars in energy assistance, including two
new nuclear reactors, the waste from which would be far harder to
turn into warheads. In return, North Korea agreed to shut down its
nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans, frustrated by delays in the construction of
the two new nuclear plants and by economic sanctions that have
worsened a famine there, have described the administration's threat
to break the agreement as virtually a declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the usual standards of its overheated language, recent
statements on the issue by the North Korean government have been
fierce. ``The U.S. imperialists are driving the situation to the
brink of war,'' the official spokesman for the North Korean army
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials say that the North
Koreans will be told in negotiations this month that the agreement
will unravel unless North Korea allows a team of dozens of U.S.
inspectors complete access to the underground installation that is
being built 25 miles from the North Korean nuclear complex at
Yongbyon. Aerial photographs show thousands of North Korean
laborers working at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans insist that the project is intended for
civilian use. But a senior State Department official, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, said last week that U.S. intelligence
information offers ``very convincing'' evidence that the
mountainside facility will be used by North Korea to recreate its
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they are also alarmed by intelligence
evidence suggesting that North Korea is making preparations to
test-fire a medium-range ballistic missile over Japan; a similar
launch last August caused a near-panic in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Koreans are playing with fire,'' said Robert
Gallucci, the former State Department official who negotiated the
1994 agreement and who is now dean of the School of Foreign Service
at Georgetown University. ``The North Koreans are quite consciously
engaging in brinksmanship. They are putting the framework at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gregg, U.S. ambassador to South Korea during the Bush
administration and now president of the Korea Society in New York,
said that U.S. policy toward North Korea was in ``disarray'' and
that there was little time left to salvage the 1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said that the North Koreans may be justified in their
frustration with the United States, especially over the
continuation of U.S. economic sanctions that were imposed on the
North during the Korean War. ``The Agreed Framework said we would
lift sanctions as soon as feasible, and we haven't,'' he said. ``We
have not lived up to all that we said we would do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we don't get our act together in the next three or four
months, Congress is going to take apart the Agreed Framework and
that will remove any inhibition the North Koreans have from going
full bore to develop a nuclear capability,'' he said. ``I think the
problem is that there's really no constituency in Washington for a
sustained serious policy toward North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration announced in October that former Defense
Secretary William Perry would oversee a complete review of U.S.
policy on North Korea. Perry, who left the Clinton administration
to return to private business in California, is scheduled to travel
this week to South Korea, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledge that the appointment was in
part an effort to placate Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, where
Perry is widely respected.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republican lawmakers have threatened to cut off the tens
of millions of dollars required to carry out the 1994 agreement,
citing provocative acts by the secretive communist government in
North Korea, including the construction of the underground site and
the missile launch last August. They have refused to consider
lifting sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any reason to trust them,'' said Sen.
Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs. ``You have a
government that is more like a cult, and that is obviously going
downhill economically.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that without a promise by North Korea to allow
unfettered inspection of the underground site, ``I frankly think we
ought to discontinue our agreement with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In drafting the mammoth government spending bill in October, the
Republicans reluctantly agreed to provide $35 million requested by
the administration to pay for deliveries of heavy fuel oil to North
Korea, as required under the 1994 accord. But they placed tough
conditions on disbursement of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, most of the money cannot be paid out unless the
administration certifies in writing that it has obtained a
satisfactory explanation about the purpose of the underground site,
that North Korea has shut down its nuclear weapons program and that
it has stopped selling ballistic missile technology to nations that
support terrorist organizations, such as Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that it will be nearly impossible
to meet those conditions and that President Clinton will probably
have to invoke national security in paying for the fuel oil _ a
move permitted under the legislation but one that would further
erode support in Congress for the 1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has warned that if Congress cuts off the
money, a move that the North Koreans have suggested would undermine
the agreement, the North Koreans could recreate their nuclear
weapons program almost immediately.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In recent congressional testimony, Defense Secretary William
Cohen said, ``If they can point to that as a breach of the Agreed
Framework, in a matter of weeks they can be back in the business of
producing plutonium.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans have pursued an aggressive program for the
development of ballistic missile technology, which is marketed to
Iran, Pakistan and other countries and which has proved to be an
important source of income for North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has had little luck pressuring North Korea to
abandon the missile program, and administration officials say they
are alarmed by recent intelligence information showing that North
Korea is building new launch platforms for medium-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   While denying Japanese news reports that the United States has
intelligence information suggesting that the North Koreans are only
days away from another missile launch, administration officials
took the opportunity to warn that another missile test could mean
the end of the 1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States views the North Korean missile program as a
serious threat to the region,'' said James Rubin, the State
Department spokesman. ``Any further missile tests would have
serious consequences.''

</P>
<P>
   _ NATIONAL/GENERAL (Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-CENSURE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Advocates of impeachment
say Congress has no authority to pass a resolution of censure
condemning President Clinton. Yet, Congress apparently did have the
authority to pass a resolution congratulating Mark McGwire for his
home-run record. To many, the arguments against censure seem
preposterous. Still, in most cases, congressional expressions of
opinion _ whether in resolutions about baseball heroes or African
dictators _ are in fact meaningless, even frivolous. By David E.
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   ANTITRUST-REVIEW (Washington) _ From trust busters to trust
trusters. For most of this century, Washington's economic agenda
was dominated by the high-stakes politics of curbing the power of
big enterprises. But Exxon and Mobil announced the world's largest
merger, Washington yawned. Many theories have been offered to
explain this new passivity about the evils of Big Everything. By
David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION-MILITIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Frustrated and embittered
by their failure to stop abortions _ and a federal law protecting
clinics _ fringes of the anti-abortion movement are linking up with
a new ally: the right-wing militia movement. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   NY-STOCK-EXCHANGE-REVIEW (New York) _ To the surprise of almost
no one, the N.Y. Stock Exchange has decided to stay in New York.
Whether its officials really meant their many threats to move to
New Jersey will never be known. Government giveaways aside, there
are certain intangibles that add up to a strong case that they were
never really serious about leaving. By Charles V. Bagli.
</P>
<P>
   PACS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In today's fund-raising frenzy,
candidates and organizations have to be increasingly inventive in
thinking up ways to separate donors from their money. Although the
evidence is anecdotal, there are signs that patriotic, optimistic
or catchy names help political action committees raise more cash.

   CONGO-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Most wars in Africa since the end
of colonialism have been civil wars, but not the current war in
Congo. Troops from as far south as Namibia and as far north as Chad
are fighting inside the Congo basin. In one sense, what has
developed is a tribal war along lines that are almost biblical _
rulers from Nilotic ethnic groups in Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda
against Bantu peoples of central and southern Africa in league with
Arab rulers of northern Chad and Sudan. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Milton Kaufman never planned on a government career
when he was growing up in New York's Coney Island in the 1920s.
Working at Steeplechase amusement park, he dreamed of becoming a
mathematics teacher. But after he graduated from the City
University of New York with a master's degree in mathematics in
1933, the government was the only place hiring. Schools could not
afford to hire new teachers in the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I graduated from college, I couldn't get a job anywhere
else,'' Kaufman said. ``At that time, I couldn't even get a job at
Macy's.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, gentle man, who wears a suit and tie on the job and off,
Kaufman retired this fall after 64 years of service at the Census
Bureau. He shared the distinction of having the longest tenure of
any active federal employee, according to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   With a sharp memory for dates and, not surprisingly, numbers, he
is quick to recount his years of service in the government,
recalling specific days and months from the 1940s as if they were
the day before yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   His first job in 1933 was for the Works Progress Administration,
an agency created under President Franklin D. Roosevelt to preserve
job skills and lower the country's unemployment rate. Kaufman and
about 100 other mathematicians conducted actuarial work for the
government, at $18 a week. The WPA work provided Kaufman with a job
when many of his friends were struggling to earn enough money to
buy food for their families.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, 1934, he was hired by the Census Bureau, part of the
Commerce Department, and officially became a government employee.
His 64-year tenure is counted from then.
</P>
<P>
   His professional career mirrors the evolving history of the
country. While he worked at the Census Bureau, the United States'
population more than doubled, rising to 270,913,356 when he retired
from 126,373,773 in 1934. More than 80 percent of the country's
current population had not been born when Kaufman, now 87, was
hired by the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman moved to the bureau's newly formed Foreign Trade
Division in 1942. He remained in the same office for 56 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman vividly recalls his first project for the division, a
daunting job of moving the divisional office from New York City to
its current Washington headquarters. At that time, five people
worked in the Washington office. As perhaps a sign of the times,
now there are nearly 150 employees, Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   After the United States entered World War II, one of Kaufman's
first assignments was to help prepare a classified report with a
detailed listing of export cargo carried on vessels sunk by enemy
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the operations during the War were part of the
Lend-Lease program, giving cargo to allies,'' he said. ``Russia
still owes us billions of dollars they haven't paid back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kaufman's files were photographed and sent to
Russia and archives in the United States. The U.S. government hopes
that someday the report will ``be used to get the payment back,''
Kaufman said, ``but I won't live to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   During this period, the bureau's statistics were tabulated by a
machine, the Remington Rand tabulator, a predecessor to the IBM
computers statisticians use now, Kaufman said. During the 1950s,
the Census Bureau made calculations on a Univac computer that took
up an entire room.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s Kaufman was hired by W. Edwards Deming (who gained
fame as a management theorist) to teach statistics in night classes
sponsored by the Agriculture Department, and Kaufman stayed loyal
for a generation to what had been his first career dream _
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started teaching kids of students I taught, I realized
it was time to leave,'' he said, laughing. Kaufman stepped down
from his second job in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman's work at the bureau focused on economic indicators to
calculate the balance of trade in goods and services. He collected
numbers to compile indicators of the country's exports and imports.
He rose to the rank of senior foreign trade statistician.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for the passing of a repeal on the mandatory
retirement age, pushed for by Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., Kaufman
might have been forced to retire earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After working for nearly two-thirds of a century, Kaufman seems
surprised to find that he enjoys his early retirement. But if he
had not suffered from a heart attack almost a year and a half ago,
he says, he probably would have continued to work. ``I'd have no
reason to stop,'' Kaufman said. ``No Florida for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one day at a time,'' he said. ``I kept on enjoying what
I was doing and kept doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Bruce Walter, a senior statistician in the Foreign
Trade Division, says Kaufman has ``enough energy to work forever.''
Walter assumed Kaufman's position at a young 58 years old and has
no plans to continue his predecessor's legacy. He has already
planned his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman's job advice is simple. ``Always be good to your
employees,'' he said. ``They may be your boss someday. I've seen it
happen over and over again.'' Since he has no plans for the
immediate future, his wife, also in her 80s, is getting used to
having him around the house more often.
</P>
<P>
   And his only son, Hugh, an investigator with the Environmental
Protection Agency, has no plans to follow in his father's
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from the head of the press office, who heard
about my father on the radio,'' he said, laughing. ``So he says to
me, `Are you going to try to do that? Are we going to have 30 more
years of this?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of his enjoyment of life is giving back to people. Having
gone through the Depression, he has a whole different mindset,''
Hugh Kaufman said. ``His generation is a very unique generation and
because he's stubborn, he never changed with the times.''

COMPLACENT NO LONGER, JETS' LEWIS IS A FORCE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mo Lewis didn't make any early-morning trips into the city last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets linebacker usually goes to martial-arts
classes three days a week from 6:30 to 7:30 a.m., but, he said:
``I've stopped now. This is a crucial moment for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Jets (8-4) are entering the crucial point of the
season with four games to go, including Sunday's matchup with the
Seattle Seahawks at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who has started all 105 games he has played for the team,
doesn't want to jeopardize the Jets' chances of making the playoffs
for only the second time in his eight-season career. So he is
temporarily forgoing the lessons that made him a first-degree black
belt in both karate and taekwondo and funneling those skills onto
the football field.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't always been this intense, this focused. Although Lewis
was the Jets' leading tackler from 1992-94, he went into a two-year
tailspin during the disastrous Rich Kotite years. Now, in his
second season under coach Bill Parcells, he is playing at a peak
again. He leads the Jets in sacks with 6, and in solo tackles with
54. He has produced 2 interceptions, recovered a fumble, forced
another, and batted down 4 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Two games ago, Lewis brought down one of the top runners in
football, the Oilers' Eddie George, with a one-armed tackle that
made all of the highlight shows. At moments like that, the
6-foot-3-inch, 258-pound Lewis is an avenging force of pure power.
</P>
<P>
   He is doing all of this with a technique that Parcells _ who
built his career around coaching linebackers _ called unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a funny stance, gets tight, like in a little shell,''
Parcells said. ``I had never seen anyone do that before. Mo lines
up with his hands up front, together. It's a funny appearance. He's
all wound up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a style that Lewis adapted from his martial arts training,
in which many of the moves start from a coiled position. He said he
does it because it helps him react and attack more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Lewis is careful to separate that aggressive football
persona from his life at home with his wife, Christalyn, and his
sons, Morris IV, 3, and Christopher Wiley, 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take my job home to my wife,'' he said. ``People view
football players as aggressive. You hear about some players who
come home angry. She has enough to worry about with my two boys.
The only reaction she knows about a game I just played is when she
drives me home in the car. If we won, I'm smiling all the way home.
If we lose, I don't say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Parcells closed practices, Christalyn often watched. ``I
used to see how aggressive he is on the field, but he wears two
hats,'' she said. ``When he comes home, he's husband and daddy. He
is attentive and passive, especially since the kids were born.''
</P>
<P>
   In the off season, in his home in Marietta, Ga., Lewis doesn't
talk or think football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go bass fishing,'' he said. ``It puts everything in the
past.'' He said he once caught a 10-pounder and this past off
season landed a $25,000 first prize in a bass-fishing competition.
</P>
<P>
   He also pursues his study of the martial arts, a fascination he
has had since he was 5 years old and saw the movie ``Enter the
Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the self-confidence Bruce Lee had,'' Lewis recalled.
``Cowboys carry guns. This was something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' mother wasn't thrilled with his hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said there was too much feet involved,'' Lewis said. ``Too
much kicking and jumping. My father was OK with it. He was a boxer.
He was trying to make a living at boxing but after I was born, he
decided to get a regular job.''
</P>
<P>
   Through high school in Atlanta, Lewis starred in football and
baseball, no doubt using some of the hand-eye coordination
developed in the dojo. He was good enough as a pitcher to be
drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, but Lewis' father, Morris II,
insisted that he go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sherman, who later would become the Jets' offensive
coordinator for one season, tried to recruit him to play as a tight
end at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had big hands and he thought I'd be good at the position,''
Lewis said. ``But growing up in Georgia, there was only one school
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the University of Georgia, and although Sherman
eventually moved there, too, Lewis played linebacker for the
Bulldogs. He developed into an all-Southeastern Conference player,
but he said the best thing about college was ``I met my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Christalyn was a pre-med major and Lewis said her father didn't
want her to get married until she got her degree. ``She switched
majors and graduated sooner and then we got married,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he met the Jets, who selected him in the third round of the
1991 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Who's on the Jets? Where are the Jets?''' Lewis
recalled. ``The only ones I could think about were Freeman McNeil
and Al Toon.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewis flowered in the defense run by Pete Carroll, and in
1994 produced a stunning 114 individual tackles along with 4
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then everything went out of me,'' he said as he considered
the frustration of winning only three games in 1995. The
self-reliant Lewis could not stand losing, and didn't know how to
cope with the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Something else happened that year, just when it appeared he was
going to gain league-wide recognition: he started getting paid like
a star.
</P>
<P>
   The new Jets regime headed by Kotite rewarded him with a deal
that included a $2.1 million signing bonus. It was an
acknowledgment of his consistent team-leading tackling, his
aggressive play, his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players get to a plateau and get complacent,'' he said.
``I got complacent. It lasted two years.''

</P>
<P>
   His 1995 and 1996 seasons were not only debacles for the team,
which went 3-13 and then 1-15, they were aimless years for Lewis.
His weight ballooned into the 290's. He sustained the first _ and
only _ injury that has sidelined him, a torn pectoral muscle that
kept him out of the final nine games of '96. Teammates who had
previously talked of him going to the Pro Bowl now joked that he
had someone else sign in for him when he was supposed to be in the
weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball was my first love, then fishing, and karate,'' Lewis
said. ``But even though football wasn't No. 1, I always wanted to
compete. And when that left me, I knew there was something wrong
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Parcells, the linebacker expert whose Giants and Patriots
teams were defined by the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years before I came here I voted for him for the Pro
Bowl,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the new coach's tough off-season program, Lewis turned
out to be a comparative rookie, and a soft one at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a physical player,'' Parcells said, ``but he came to me
after our first meeting and said he didn't know anything about
weight-lifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed embarrassed about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get insecure,'' said Parcells. ``They walk into that
weight room and see other guys doing it and they don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   After they met for the first time, Lewis said he wanted to
return to the linebacker he had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was challenged again,'' he said. ``Am I going to let
him dictate what I do _ or do I go out there? I dropped my weight.
He wanted me mainly over the tight end. Now I have more chances to
roam. I know I scared a lot people with my size _ at 260 pounds,
they didn't think I could move. But I can move.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells recognized Lewis' explosiveness and quickness and tried
to exploit them. During the 1997 exhibition season, he switched
Lewis from the weakside spot to the more active strongside
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to find the right spot for him,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently has found it. In each of the Jets' last two
victories, Lewis led the defense with 10 tackles and throughout the
season he has been the most stable force on the linebacking corps,
which has gone through a dramatic upheaval. Before the season
started, he and Marvin Jones and James Farrior were the starters.
Then Jones suffered season-ending knee surgery, and Farrior had a
knee injury that sidelined him.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers coach Al Groh and defensive coordinator Bill
Belichick mixed and matched the openings with Bryan Cox and Pepper
Johnson and Chad Cascadden and now that Farrior is healthy, he
can't get his starting job back.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been the constant on the unit. He has been constantly
good, as well, with his pass-rushing, pass defense and tackling.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, with a victory against the Seahawks, the Jets would
remain at least tied for first with Miami in the American Football
Conference East Division.
</P>
<P>
   And those bad days?
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing brings a lot of misery onto anybody,'' Lewis said. ``I
was brought up to believe even when you get kicked down you can
come back. We went from 3-13, the worst club record, and next year
we went 1-15.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, the Jets and Lewis are pummeling opponents,
or, as Lewis likes to say, ``Killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want to waste any more chances.  &QL;

CRITICS OF IRANIAN REGIME WORRIED BY 2 ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ An attack on visiting American businessmen and
the assassination of a prominent dissident here have caused fresh
unease among critics of the government, who say they fear a
campaign of violence by conservative forces.
</P>
<P>
   The same concern is being expressed by foreign diplomats, who
said they suspect that the attacks _ carried out on a single
weekend last month _ may have been staged with at least the tacit
approval of conservative elements in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The assaults have been condemned in strong terms by President
Mohammed Khatami, a relative moderate who commands broad popular
support. But the conservative figures who still wield most power in
Iran have expressed fewer regrets, adding to the view that the
attacks may have been part of an internal power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that there are powerful forces in Iran who are not
going to let their critics go unanswered,'' one Western envoy said.
``And this is not a softie regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami's election 19 months ago, the conservatives who
control Iran's Parliament, judiciary and the post of supreme leader
have battled hard to block his agenda and to silence his allies,
even arresting one of his top supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the attacks, on the weekend of Nov. 21-22, are being seen by
many here as marking a worrying new turn. ``These events have sent
a very great shock through the society,'' said Abbas Shayegan, a
critic of the government who was close to the dissident who was
assassinated, Dariush Foruhar. ``They were well thought-out by the
government with the intention to oppress.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons diplomats and others mentioned as cause for
their suspicions of official acquiescence were the fact Iranian
security forces were uncooperative in responding to reports of the
Nov. 21 attack on the Americans. Their minibus was attacked by men
wielding crowbars who had used their cars to block a hotel driveway
as the group returned from a trip inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 13 Americans in the delegation were hurt, but many
bus windows were shattered in the attack, which one well-informed
diplomat described as a ``meticulous and precise.''
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian police officer ultimately escorted the Americans back
to their hotel, but not before the group was left waiting for more
than an hour for a police response.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, diplomats said, Iranian officials promised that
security forces would escort the group to the airport for a flight
out of the country. But a senior Western diplomat who spoke on
condition of anonymity said that ``no visible Iranian escort'' ever
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian group calling itself the ``Devotees of Islam'' has
taken responsibility for the attack, saying that it was intended to
discourage the kinds of renewed private contacts between Iran and
the United States advocated by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of Foruhar and his wife, Parveneh, who were
stabbed to death in their Tehran home, has prompted a louder
outcry. Foruhar, who was well-known known for his nationalist and
secular views, was prominent among opposition leaders whose
activities are officially banned but usually tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   At a funeral for the slain couple the week before last,
thousands of mourners chanted slogans that included ``Down with
Despotism!'' The Foruhar home was said by Shayegan and other
activists to have been under round-the-clock surveillance by Iran's
ministry of information, the country's intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   They said that surveillance cameras were known to have been
trained on entrances to the home, and that it would have been
impossible for the assailants to enter or leave without the
information ministry's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been arrested in connection with the attack, and no
one has taken responsibility for it. The activists said they feared
the killings were intended as a warning to other opposition figures
critical of the government.

CABLEVISION'S DOLAN MAKES THE DEAL ONLY WHEN HE'S READY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.Y.)   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He can be quiet, cryptic, even difficult to hear
during a negotiation. He grasps minute details, sees the long-term
value of a deal before others, prefers listening to talking and
does not mind waiting to get his way. He lets others fulminate on
his behalf while he maintains his gentlemanly demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision Systems and
pursuer of George Steinbrenner's Yankees, is ruthless or
relentless, scrupulously upright or deeply inscrutable, depends on
to whom you speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't mistake gentlemanliness for being an easy negotiator or
not being tough as nails when he has to be,'' said Tom Rogers, the
president of NBC Cable, who has negotiated with and against Dolan.
``Sometimes, the mistake people make with Chuck is they don't know
how to deal with how creative he is. He is not linear. That baffles
people who mistake it for him being too tough or grabbing too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Dolan, who was born in Cleveland and lives on
Long Island in Oyster Bay with his wife, Helen, founded Cablevision
in 1973 and took it public 13 years later. Despite its size, it
remains a business controlled by family. Dolan's youngest son,
James, is the chief executive officer, ``the ultimate realist, who
brings a sense of the operational necessities that a negotiation
has to keep in mind,'' said Rogers. Two other sons, Patrick and
Thomas, are senior vice presidents and Kathleen, one of the three
Dolan daughters, runs the family foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expanding ubiquity of the company _ it serves 3.4
million cable customers, owns The Wiz electronic retail chain,
operates Radio City Music Hall and recently acquired 76 movie
theaters _ Dolan remains an enigma to the sports market that he
dominates through Cablevision's ownership of Madison Square Garden,
which includes the Knicks and Rangers, and the cable TV rights to
seven local teams. He wants to take further command of the market
by buying the Yankees, a deal that collapsed nearly two weeks ago
but is not dead.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dolan usually gets what he wants. His dealmaking has
made the Woodbury-based Cablevision a $2 billion company and has
transformed it from its roots in cable television systems to an
entertainment conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be panicked into doing a deal,'' said Marc
Lustgarten, a vice chairman of Cablevision who is sometimes
referred to by rival negotiators as a bad cop to Dolan's courteous
good cop. ``He won't do a deal if he doesn't want to. But he'll be
tenacious in trying to find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports who from 1986 to
1988 served on the board that ran Cablevision's Sportschannel cable
networks, said: ``You don't always know where he's going. Sometimes
I'd talk to Chuck, then have to call Lustgarten and ask, `What did
he mean?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan's pursuit of the Yankees has been tenacious because, by
buying the team, he would secure its cable rights in perpetuity.
The Dolan-Steinbrenner pas de deux is riveting because each man has
what the other wants: Dolan wants the Yankees, Steinbrenner wants
his cash. But if a deal to sell all or part of the team to
Cablevision does not occur _ or if talks do not resume before the
Yankees' 12-year, $486 million deal with the MSG Network ends in
2000 _ Steinbrenner could shop his TV deal, at least, to Time
Warner or ESPN, which has mulled the launch of a local sports
service.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's New York City cable system could conceivably carry
Yankee games, but the company has spurned past overtures from
Steinbrenner's emissaries because it refuses to enter a bidding war
with Cablevision over Yankee rights that would push local cable
rates skyward.
</P>
<P>
   But Time Warner could not buy the team, because it already owns
the Atlanta Braves. ``We are not interested or have spoken to
anyone about buying another professional franchise, including the
Yankees,'' said Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner Sports and
a close friend of Steinbrenner's.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to buy the Yankees began when Cablevision and ITT
jointly owned the Garden between 1994 and 1997 and heated up the
last 15 months. Those initial talks were conducted without becoming
known to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But since earlier this year, the talks have become media fodder,
with various prices and provisions filling airwaves and newspapers.
When leaks to the news media about Steinbrenner's proposed role
under the aegis of Cablevision _ that he would have stayed in
charge of the Yankees and perhaps had a seat on the board that
oversees the Garden, but would not have run the Knicks and Rangers
_ grew too fevered and numerous, Dolan closed the talks down.
</P>
<P>
   Ending talks, at least temporarily, is part of Dolan's style
when things aren't going his way, said several people who have
negotiated with him. One Steinbrenner associate said he felt well
treated by Dolan, except for a tactic in which Dolan uses input
from financial analysts to deflect heat from himself when talks hit
snags.
</P>
<P>
   ``When compromise is unacceptable, he doesn't like to go on,''
said a cable industry veteran of numerous negotiations with Dolan.
``But it's a tactic to get the other side to return with a
counterproposal, or for him to revisit with another idea.'' He
added: ``Steinbrenner has met his match. Dolan's very crafty and
rarely concludes a deal unless it's perceived that he came out on
top.''
</P>
<P>
   The view is countered by Dolan's partisans, who said he is a
classic negotiator who wants both sides to win. Said Hindery:
``Transactions when one side clearly dominates are not much fun to
him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   When the National Football League tried to cajole him in August
to raise his bid for the expansion Cleveland Browns from $485
million, he refused unless he was assured that he was the winner.
When he eventually raised his bid _ after the eventual winner,
Alfred Lerner, did _ it was too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands the value of his position,'' said Dolan's
68-year-old brother Lawrence, who would have been the Browns'
general partner. ``You won't take anything from him. And he
understands where George Steinbrenner is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan doesn't care much for talking to reporters _ although he
is proficient, if cagy, when he speaks, and his grandfatherly mien
can be disarming _ but he cares even less for those who provide the
news media with details of talks during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it's rude to leak,'' said Leo Hindery, the president
of Tele-Communications Inc., the giant cable TV company that
acquired one-third of Cablevision last year in a complex swap for
cable systems. ``George runs his whole life through the press. But
Chuck works for his shareholders, not his press. He'll do a deal
with George Steinbrenner, but not a day before it's right. Chuck
will know when it's time. All my deals with Chuck were marked by
thoughtful timing. Steinbrenner will have a deal when it's the
right time for Chuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 15 years, Hindery said he has met Dolan over a negotiating
table numerous times. ``He's very clever and impeccably honest,''
he said. ``While others try to dominate, he just tries to advance
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes their talks have ended with a deal, sometimes they
didn't. ``But they always end with a hug,'' Hindery said.
</P>
<P>
   One negotiation that ended without an embrace occurred in 1988
when the MSG Network, then owned by Paramount Communications, was
taken off Cablevision's Long Island system in a public tussle over
pricing the local sports network. When Dolan's subscribers missed
Knicks and Rangers games, he was cast as an ogre.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision now owns MSG and has merged its operations with Fox
Sports New York (which Dolan created as one of a family of
Sportschannels nationwide). Through the two networks, Dolan
controls the cable telecasts of an unprecedented seven teams _ the
Yankees, Knicks, Rangers, Mets, Nets, Islanders and Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling a critical mass of the local teams' cable rights has
been a Dolan goal for 15 years. ``Being the godfather of New York
sports is what he wants,'' said a cable industry executive. In
1984, Dolan made deals with the Islanders and Mets that gave the
teams 17{ percent of Sportschannel New York's gross revenues,
contracts that have since been rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, Chuck felt we needed content for Sportschannel,''
Lustgarten said. ``The fact that the Islanders did so well was OK
because it meant we were doing well. We don't begrudge them that
they were being overpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Pilson recalled, Dolan came to the
Sportschannel board with a plan to buy Nets rights for seven years
at $43 million. ``I said, `Why? No one else will buy them,''' said
Pilson, a sports industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck was patient,'' he added. ``He said, `You must
understand, you have to get all the teams when you're building a
regional sports network. If you let someone else combine the Nets
with the Yankees, you have competition.'''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, after the deals that have helped him dominate
the local sports market, Dolan is looking to avoid competition by
buying the Yankees. All he needs is the stamina for more dealmaking
with George Steinbrenner.

   Jury Acquits Espy In Corruption Case
</P>
<P>
   Donald Smaltz spent four years investigating former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy, alleging that he had illegally accepted sports
tickets, luggage and other favors from companies he was supposed to
be regulating. A jury took two days to find Espy not guilty of all
30 charges. In the process, the jury provided powerful new
political ammunition for opponents of the law, set to expire in
June, that provides for the appointment of independent prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Espy said he wants to be one of the first witnesses when
Congress takes up the issue of renewing the independent counsel
law, probably in February.

   New Jersey Sniffs At New York's Garbage
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has always dealt with New York City's
problems with elegant simplicity. Pedestrians getting in the way of
cars? Reroute the pedestrians. Too many potholes? Well, fill them.
No place to put the city's garbage? Send it to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It would presumably have violated the spirit of simplicity,
though, to check to see if New Jersey actually wanted it. So when
Gov. Christie Whitman got a whiff of Giuliani's malodorous
offering, she responded with Giulianian simplicity: ``Drop dead.''

   It may be just a temporary truce, but Quebec and the rest of

   In Display of Unity, European Nations Cut Rates

   Eleven European nations cut their interest rates to a nearly

   U.S. to Declassify Some Pinochet Files

   The United States, treading into a political and diplomatic

Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The decision could open ``a can

   An Indulgent Pope
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000, Pope John Paul II has introduced a fast track
to heaven. Throughout the yearlong millennium celebration, Roman
Catholics who quit smoking or drinking for a day can earn
indulgences to avoid punishment in the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences were sold by church officials in medieval times and
the practice helped drive Martin Luther to protest, starting the
Reformation. Indulgences are viewed as atavistic by some liberal
Catholics. But the pope wants penitence to be a major theme in the
third millennium, and he has broadened the criteria for earning
indulgences, allowing sinners to stop smoking for a day or visit a
hospital or prison. It is still no cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so easy for some to give up smoking for a day,'' said
Archbishop Crescenzio Sepe, a top Vatican official. ``It might be
easier to visit a prison inmate.''

world that China is not a multi-party political system, and angrily
telling America to mind its own business.

   Jury Acquits Espy In Corruption Case
</P>
<P>
   Donald Smaltz spent four years investigating former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy, alleging that he had illegally accepted sports
tickets, luggage and other favors from companies he was supposed to
be regulating. A jury took two days to find Espy not guilty of all
30 charges. In the process, the jury provided powerful new
political ammunition for opponents of the law, set to expire in
June, that provides for the appointment of independent prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Espy said he wants to be one of the first witnesses when
Congress takes up the issue of renewing the independent counsel
law, probably in February.

   For a typical suburban family, the monthly bills seem

and $1,100 for utilities.
</P>

   But John A. Gotti, the reputed Mafia leader, insists the
expenses are essential for supporting his wife and their four
children, and for the upkeep of two luxurious Long Island homes and
several rural properties. Gotti cited the household overhead in a
plea to a federal judge for a reduction in his bail supervision
costs. Awaiting trial on a raft of federal racketeering charges, he
was released on $10 million bail in October with the provision that
he pay $21,000 a month for private guards to monitor his activities
at his main home in Oyster Bay, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Because prosecutors have frozen more than $3 million of his
assets, including bank accounts and rents from commercial
properties, Gotti says his monthly income is now a mere $11,000. He
claims that unless his assets are freed or the surveillance costs
lowered, he will be unable to pay his bills or his lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue that the guards are necessary to prevent him
from meeting with other suspected mobsters and assert that Gotti,
34, known as Junior, is running the powerful Gambino organized
crime family for his imprisoned father, John J. Gotti, 58.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the younger Gotti is convicted, prosecutors say, most of
his assets probably will be confiscated as having been obtained
through criminal profits.

   Meanwhile, Gotti laments that he is scraping by with loans from

``the private antipathy of some members of a community.''

PLANS TO RESTORE PULLMAN FACTORY ARE SET BACK AFTER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Through its storied history, the Pullman rail car
factory has stood for much. Once a revolutionary company town, with
housing, churches and schools for its workers, it stood for an
innovative industrial model. After a crippling strike in 1894, it
stood for the struggle of the working man.
</P>
<P>
   It stood for civil rights when long negotiations with the
Pullman Porters, workers who served the nation's elite on the
luxurious sleepers and had included many ex-slaves, finally
resulted in a contract in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   But after a spectacular fire destroyed its old clock tower and
several adjacent buildings Tuesday, hopes of turning it into a
transportation museum were stood on end.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze, which engulfed the former administration building and
gutted adjacent manufacturing structures, finally ran out of fury
after an all-night battle by more than 150 firefighters. The fire
left residents of the neighborhood, many of whom were fourth- or
fifth-generation descendants of original Pullman workers, in tears
at the sight of history going up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're devastated,'' said Robert Fioretti, president of the
Historic Pullman Foundation, whose father once worked in the
factory. ``There are a lot of people in this country who have
connections to the Pullman Works complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Police determined the fire to be arson and arrested a
45-year-old man Wednesday. Sgt. Maurice Sullivan, a detective with
the police bomb and arson unit, said that the man, Anthony
Buzinskas, confessed to setting the blaze at the direction of
voices he heard in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Buzinskas was found near the fire Tuesday, and the police said
he told them what he had done. At a court appearance Thursday,
Buzinskas was ordered to undergo a psychiatric test, and his
brother, Norman Busch, said Buzinskas had a history of mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Along with memories of the past, the fire also damaged hopes for
the future. The factory site, dormant since the last rail car was
turned out in 1982, was purchased by the state in 1991 and was
being considered as a site for a new transportation museum.
</P>
<P>
   Fioretti, whose organization's missions are education and the
preservation of the neighborhood, said plans for the museum would
go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it looks like most of the buildings can be
restored,'' he said. ``Hopefully, from these ashes our dreams can
still come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a middle-class residential neighborhood on Chicago's far
south side, the Pullman site, built in 1880 and anchored by the
factory and the upscale Hotel Florence _ named for Pullman's
daughter and not damaged by the fire _ was a 600-acre planned
community, the grand vision of the company's founder, George M.
Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   With the hopes of creating an environment pleasant for his
workers and efficient for his business, the town of Pullman was
designed to be self-sufficient. Workers lived in Pullman-owned
housing, shopped in a Pullman-owned market and went to work
everyday building the illustrious Pullman rail cars.
</P>
<P>
   The housing, with intricate architecture and indoor plumbing,
not standard at the time, was arranged around the factory. Larger
houses for the executives were the closest to the factory, and the
buildings regressed outward to housing for the foremen, skilled
workers and unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the rent for such housing that led to the great strike of
1894, a time of recession in the country. In an effort to save
money, Pullman cut wages for his workers, but refused to lower
rent. Workers walked off the job and federal troops were eventually
ordered to intervene, but not before 13 people had died in the
strike and the organized labor movement was born. In 1889, the
Illinois Supreme Court ordered the company to sell all
non-industrial property and the land was absorbed by the city.
</P>
<P>
   Fioretti said 70 percent of the country's sleeper cars were once
made here, establishing Chicago as a hub for rail travel. The
company closed in 1969, and Amtrak bought the site, where it made
and repaired rail cars until 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers must still determine the structural stability of what
remains standing after the fire, and rule whether demolition is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But for the residents of Pullman, who have overcome efforts to
raze the buildings, and succeeded in registering the site as a
historic landmark, the fire can be overcome.

   ``When I walked out of my house and saw 30-foot flames rising
out of the clock tower I was simply in shock,'' said Frank
Beberdick, the archivist for the Historic Pullman Foundation. ``But
the residents here are resilient, and if it's possible to bring
people together and start the restoration process, we're going to
do it.''

THE LOSSES PILE UP FOR SEASON YET TO START  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They say they are not bluffing, that the season could
be terminated in the next few weeks. But as players and owners
stare down each other at the bargaining table, how likely is it
that National Basketball Association's 82-game schedule will be
permanently wiped away?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time the players hear someone say the season is gone
will be the day we decide to do it,'' said David Stern, the league
commissioner. ``I will not prematurely cancel the season. That's
not fair to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's hesitancy to issue a deadline for an agreement to
be reached in the five-month-old lockout suggests there is room and
time for compromise. The union's executive director, Billy Hunter,
struck an optimistic tone Friday, saying he was confident a
settlement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   But with not one key economic issue resolved and no further
bargaining sessions planned after a session that lasted more than
10 hours Thursday, the prospects are looking grimmer by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Few believed that the stalemate would go this long. Yet instead
of the Knicks making their first trip to the Meadowlands arena last
Thursday or Stephon Marbury, Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota
Timberwolves making their annual visit to Madison Square Garden on
Saturday, the most calamitous labor dispute in league history
continues.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, teams had lost only 18 to 20 dates from their
82-game schedules. But because nearly a month is needed after an
agreement is reached to resume the season, the two sides are toying
with playing fewer than 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   Observers of the National Hockey League lockout view Stern's
tactics along the same lines as those employed by NHL commissioner
Gary Bettman during the 1994-95 lockout. A settlement was not
reached until Jan. 13 after more than a month of no bargaining. The
shortened season resumed two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the NBA, the NHL did not have more than 200 free
agents waiting to be signed by teams. That dilemma and the need for
at least a three-week training camp dims the possibility of a
rushed settlement in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Hunter deemed Jan. 1 as the cutoff date for reaching an
agreement, a date that would put the start of the season on or
about Super Bowl Sunday. Though NBC lost its Christmas Day
doubleheader, the network does not begin regional weekly coverage
until Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal was signed near the first of the year, NBC would lose
three weekends of telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the players are beginning to talk candidly about
losing an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping for something to happen,'' said the Minnesota
forward Tom Gugliotta. ``But I also know that in the back of my
mind losing the season is a distinct possibility. We hope it won't
happen, but we know the reality is at this point, and we can't rule
it out. It's something that could happen. If it does, it would be
difficult for everyone. But we know we tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Michael Curry, a member of the union's negotiating
committee, ``I've thought of the worst-case scenario. So the
worst-case scenario would be to cancel the season. All you can do
is to give 110 percent to make sure that doesn't happen. Mentally,
you have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   For Patrick Ewing, the union president, that means forfeiting
$18.5 million, the highest salary in the NBA this season. Ewing
loses $243,924 per game, a figure that already brings his estimated
loss to more than $4 million. Karl Malone, the All-Star forward of
the Utah Jazz, will lose his biggest payday ever, $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think other players should prepare themselves to say the
season is over,'' Malone said. ``I think we should get with our
people and go out and start playing games on our own. We should be
playing and putting money away for those less fortunate. I'll lend
my name to games, whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents Arn Tellem and David Falk have finally put the
finishing touches on their All-Star exhibition game, to be played
Dec. 19 in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   They scheduled a press conference for Monday for the game, which
features members of all four Dream Teams _ the 1992 and 1996
Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 World Championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Michael Jordan would play or coach, but
he is expected to be in attendance. The proceeds will go to players
on the low end of the league's salary scale.

<P>
   PARIS _ With allies like France, does the United States really
need enemies? Put another way: With allies like Britain, who needs
France?
</P>
<P>
   More often than they like to admit, exasperated U.S.
policy-makers have asked themselves questions like these over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   But as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright heads for Brussels
and Paris this week for meetings with allied foreign ministers and
a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration on Human Rights, she might reflect that U.S.
disagreements with Britain over the past half century have
sometimes been as rancorous as those with the French.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain clashed over a joint French and
British attempt to grab the Suez Canal in 1956, and did not see eye
to eye about what should be done to stop the fighting in Bosnia
until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since two soul mates named Churchill and Roosevelt
commiserated about their dealings with an individualist named de
Gaulle, the strong underlying assumption of trust that exists
between Washington and London has simply not been there to the same
degree between Washington and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to think the world of the British, and the worst
of the French. Even when France and the United States are in basic
agreement, as they are at the moment on Iraq, there's always
somebody like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to throw a monkey wrench
into the works.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whom the French consider no friend, appeared to suggest
on an American television news show that the reason Saddam Hussein
had been able to avoid Anglo-American bombing last month might have
been that France had tipped him off that the bombers were on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the United States itself had warned Iraq
repeatedly that it faced imminent bombing if it didn't back down
and comply with United Nations resolutions on arms inspection.
McCain denied accusing the French, and officials in Britain later
confirmed that nobody had given the exact timetable to them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Britain and the United States are in basic
disagreement, as they were during much of the war in Bosnia until
1995, American Anglophilia tends to rewrite history. This left the
impression that it was actually the French who didn't want the
United States to start bombing in Bosnia to stop Serbian aggression
and halt attacks on lightly armed United Nations peacekeepers from
Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   France did indeed have to overcome sympathies for Serbia that
date from World War I, but as recently published memoirs by a
British commanding general of the U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia, Sir
Michael Rose, confirm, Britain was strongly opposed to heavy NATO
bombing raids that the Americans kept wanting to launch against the
Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister John Major's conservative government
feared that the Serbs would retaliate by attacking the
peacekeepers. The impasse was not broken until French President
Jacques Chirac came to power in France in 1995 and mobilized
British and U.S. support for a policy with more military muscle,
after the Serbs overran the United Nations ``safe area'' in
Srebrenica and massacred Muslim civilians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did go ahead with a strategic bombing campaign and the
Serbs, after suffering other setbacks on the ground, agreed to a
cease-fire and a beefed-up NATO peacekeeping operation that finally
put U.S. troops, along with others, on the ground alongside the
French and British.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has begun
moving closer to French ideas for making Europe capable of an
autonomous defense within NATO, but it has also made privileged
British relations with the United States a declared strategic
objective.
</P>
<P>
   That is much too abject a policy for France, French officials
say. After all, Louis XVI gave the Marquis de Lafayette 6,000
troops to help George Washington in 1777 not because the king
shared Lafayette's enthusiasm for the revolutionaries but to make
trouble for the British, who were his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, French-U.S. relations have been like a long-running
marriage, frequently warmed by frictions.
</P>
<P>
   De Gaulle restored pride to a nation humiliated by defeat in
World War II, often at U.S. expense. ``The French need to take
pride in France,'' de Gaulle explained to his acolyte Alain
Peyrefitte in 1962. ``Otherwise, they fall into mediocrity, fight
with each other and head for the bistro.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Kissinger understood. ``De Gaulle was not anti-American in
principle,'' he wrote in his book ``Diplomacy'' (Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster). ``He was willing to cooperate whenever, in his view,
French and American interests genuinely converged. Thus during the
Cuban missile crisis, American officials were astonished by de
Gaulle's all-out support _ the most unconditional backing extended
to them by any allied leader.''
</P>
<P>
   De Gaulle dominated Europe, but he didn't want anyone else to _
not the Soviet Union, certainly, but not the United States, either.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, French leaders tend to see the United States in
Steinbeckian terms, as a strong, friendly but unsophisticated giant
whose full embrace might be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   So when the United States says that it really does want a
united, prosperous Europe, and doesn't feel threatened by plans for
the euro, the new common European currency that will used next
month, the French either don't believe it or suspect that what the
United States must really want is a Europe led by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine also worries about a
world in which there is only one superpower _ the United States _
overwhelming all other countries with its military, economic,
technological and cultural strength. ``Their weight carries them
towards hegemonism, and the idea they have of their mission is
unilateralism,'' he told the daily Liberation recently. ``And that
is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   French diplomats tell their U.S. friends that frank advice, not
sycophantism, is the mark of true friendship. By that measure,
France is indeed the most stalwart of allies.

RENEGADE OFFICER FAVORED IN VENEZUELAN ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The podium rose two stories above the
multitude, but ``El Comandante,'' Hugo Chavez, floated higher.
Standing in a box draped to look like a balcony, raised by a
mechanical lift, he swept his arm way over his head, vowing to
throw out Venezuela's legendary corruption in one swift and
forceful toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're witnessing a real revolution, which cannot be stopped by
anything or anybody,'' Chavez, a fiery 44-year-old former military
leader turned presidential candidate, told a crowd of 700,000 at
his closing campaign rally Wednesday night. Many wore the red beret
of the military special forces, as he did, as a sign of support.
``We have a popular avalanche,'' Chavez intoned, predicting he
would win with 60 percent to 80 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   To business leaders and international investors, Chavez is the
red menace resurrected. To the poor, he is the impatient savior who
is already smashing the clubby machine of mutual favors at the top
of Venezuelan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who tried to storm the presidential palace in a failed
coup attempt six years ago, is the front-runner in elections for
the presidency Sunday. In some half-dozen voter surveys, he is
leading by upward of 15 points over his nearest opponent, a
silver-haired two-time governor of Carabobo state, Enrique Salas
Roemer.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez spent two years in jail after the coup attempt, but was
released in 1994, when President Rafael Caldera, who was leaving
office, dropped the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Chavez visited Cuba and praised President Fidel
Castro and ``the Cuban way.'' There have also been reports of
direct contacts with the leftist rebels in Colombia, Venezuela's
neighbor to the west, which Chavez has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chavez and Salas have been vague on economic plans, and
both criticize the traditional party machinery. But Chavez's role
in trying to overthrow the government of President Carlos Andres
Perez, his vitriolic oratory and his support for Cuba have
terrified upper-class Venezuelans, who have been sending their
money and other assets out of the country for fear of a Chavez
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the black shirt and the red beret of the special forces,
Chavez noted his record as a ``warrior'' at the rally. ``Clearly,
today I am a warrior for peace, fighting for true democracy,'' he
said, ``but combatants we are. We are making this war for
Venezuela. We do it in peace, but we are warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has gained in popularity, Chavez has moderated his talk,
in some instances contradicting earlier statements. He more
recently said he is ``neither for savage capitalism, nor socialism,
nor communism,'' but for a gentler kind of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of election-day fraud by the traditional party machinery,
of a backup plan by Chavez to seize power violently and of
post-ballot rioting is rampant here. There have been reports of
opponents listed for reprisals after election day and of another
list of journalists deemed ``shootable'' by the Chavez leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no proof; there are rumors,'' Chavez told a
television interviewer the day after his campaign rally. ``The only
plan that we have is to pull Venezuela out of this mess. All of us
are democrats.'' He said that after election, he hoped the
opposition would ``drop this fear, this dirty war.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has denied him a visa but has said it will
work with whoever wins the election. Analysts close to the Chavez
campaign said his team had made overtures to U.S. officials, and
discussed a post-election visit to New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and detractors of Chavez agree on one point: The rise
of the would-be strongman is a symptom of the Venezuelan
government's sustained neglect of most of the population, something
that has given democracy a bad name here.
</P>
<P>
   Though Venezuela is the leading exporter of oil to the United
States, four out of five Venezuelans live in poverty. Some 40
percent are in dire poverty, which means they are malnourished. For
many Venezuelans, the sole explanation for the overwhelming misery
despite the country's oil wealth is corruption, which has indeed
flowered.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's democracy, which began in 1958, ended 150 years of
dictatorship. Most Venezuelans, however, do not see the elite's
mutual back-scratching as a stage on the road to better government,
but as democracy's final stop. A series of governments has
nourished stability, but little more, say Chavez supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The clarion call of this year's campaign is change, short of
revolution. While Salas promises change, Chavez _ with his booming
denunciations of ``los corruptos'' and his pledge to ``fry'' the
heads of the political bigwigs _ embodies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived under tyranny, corruption and manipulation of the
people for 40 years,'' said Irma Guzman, 56, a journalist cheering
at the Chavez rally. ``A country in which corruption is rooted in
the political leadership is a dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For 40 years,'' she said, ``they've robbed our children's
right to an education, to food, to health care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To life!'' added Efrain Cedeno, the 39-year-old director of a
theater group, who was standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Comandante,'' as Chavez is known, has already caused the
collapse of the entrenched party system, led by the Democratic
Action and Copei parties.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Action, until now the kingmaker in Venezuelan
politics, dumped its longtime party boss and presidential
candidate, Luis Alfaro Ucero, the week before last. Ucero was
defiant, saying he would hold on to the nomination, and was
expelled from the party, which threw its support behind Salas.
Copei also dropped its support for Irene Saez, a former Miss
Universe trailing in the polls, and backed Salas.
</P>
<P>
   Even those terrified at the prospect of a Chavez victory, who
have sent their paintings, jewelry and other treasures to Miami,
concede that there is truth to the popular indictment of Venezuelan
politics, said Eric Ekvall, a political consultant here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This interlocking system of privileges and graft that runs
Venezuela wouldn't last a half-hour with a RICO grand jury,''
Ekvall said, referring to the U.S. law for prosecuting organized
crime. ``It's a racket and has been run like a racket for a very
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has pledged to hold a referendum with the aim of
rewriting the 1961 Constitution, and threatened to jail anybody who
opposed the Constitutional Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The limits of the Assembly's power and mandate, however, have
not been clear. Some fear Chavez may use the Assembly to oust the
Congress and state governors, many of whom have defied him in
backing Salas.
</P>
<P>
   There is also widespread fear of reprisals against critics and
of the possible ending of civil liberties like free expression. But
in the bare-knuckles battle that this election has become, it is
difficult to separate fear from smear.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, Venezuela is reeling, with oil prices under $10 a
barrel, the lowest in 25 years. Chavez has promised to abide by
past oil exploration contracts, but warned that he would review the
terms of any coming privatizations. Critics also fear that he will
raise protectionist barriers and _ in the worst case _ institute
exchange and price controls.
</P>
<P>
   Some are troubled by what they consider the message behind
Chavez's tirades. His speeches attack all of the last 40 years,
even though Venezuela's standard of living rose during the 1960s
and '70s, as the country wiped out malaria and improved literacy
and life expectancy. That makes Venezuelans like Daniel Benaim, the
owner of an advertising and television production concern, wonder
whether Chavez's true enemy is not corruption, but democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Benaim said his ``sixth sense'' went on alert after an anonymous
caller threatened his father, Victor Benaim, a leading gynecologist
and inveterate critic of the political scene. His father, who is
74, had reprinted an article against Chavez and was handing it out
to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Benaim described the incident in an electronic letter that he
sent to 10 friends, some of whom are journalists. It spread widely,
and soon after, he began receiving threats as well.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has obtained a green card and, like many upper-class
Venezuelans, plans to move to the United States if necessary,
leaving behind his house and his company, which employs 40 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already gotten to the point where I know that if I have
to leave, it'll be the Cuban way, with only whatever I've been able
to get into a foreign bank account,'' he said.

ARMENIANS, BITTER OVER ENCLAVE, LET OIL BOOM PASS BY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YEREVAN, Armenia _ Throughout the Caucasus and Central Asia, the
most excited conversations and debates these days are about the
coming Caspian energy boom. Everyone wants to know who's up and
who's down, which wells have come up dry and which are gushers, and
most of all where the vital oil and gas pipelines will be laid.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia is the exception. Ethnic politics has turned this into
the only country in the region that will probably not share in the
energy bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives are expected to decide soon where to lay their
strategically vital pipeline from oil-rich Azerbaijan. The most
direct route to the Mediterranean would run across Armenia. But
politics makes that route impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan will not cooperate with Armenia until the two
countries settle their dispute over the enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh. The world accepts the enclave as part of
Azerbaijan, but it has been held by its ethnic Armenian residents
since 1994, after a war that cost 35,000 lives and forced hundreds
of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan President Heydar Aliyev has offered to support
construction of a ``peace pipeline'' across Armenia as part of a
settlement to the conflict. But Armenians feel a deeply visceral
connection to their cousins in Nagorno-Karabakh, and few would
agree to trade the enclave for a pipeline, even one that promised
them decades of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not on the table,'' Prime Minister Armen Darbinyan
said in an interview. ``Karabakh, its freedom, and the right to
live on your own land is not for trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom cannot be sold,'' he said. ``The right to manage your
own destiny cannot be sold. There is no price.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute say they are
ready to talk, a wide gulf divides them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Armenia would make peace with Azerbaijan, then of course
the export line would run through Armenia instead of Georgia,''
said Nicholas Gvazava, a senior executive of state-owned Georgia
International Oil Corp. ``But we would still consider it a positive
development, because settling that conflict would dramatically
improve the development prospects of the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Armenians support their government's refusal to compromise
over Nagorno-Karabakh. A few, though, wonder what it will mean to
be excluded from the pipeline network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course Armenia is a loser,'' said Mark Grigorian, a
journalist and human rights advocate in Yerevan, the Armenian
capital. ``If you don't get anything, you're losing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Highways and railroads go together with pipelines,'' he said.
``If our failure to get a pipeline means that we are excluded from
plans to rebuild the old Silk Road trading routes, it means forget
about this country. We will be a far distant province, even though
the centers will be very close to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Armenian President Robert Kocharian, however, scoffed at the
suggestion that failure to join the oil boom would consign his
country to isolation or poverty. He said Armenia would develop in
other ways, using its human potential to compensate for its lack of
natural resources and links to its oil-producing neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't set out to get any pipeline,'' Kocharian said.
``You can't lose a game in which you're not even competing.''

SPAIN FETES CONSTITUTION, AS SEPARATISTS CITE ITS FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spain's celebration last week of the 20th
anniversary of its Constitution was supposed to be a big
congratulatory moment to mark the longest period of democracy in
the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions are rising. As the country seeks ways to end 30
years of separatist violence, Basque nationalists are clamoring to
rewrite the constitution. It stipulates that Spain is united while
granting specific broad powers to regions, but nationalists seek
more power _ even independence. And the two big political parties
in Madrid are squabbling over how to comply with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a relatively new situation,'' said Gabriel Cisneros, 58,
one of the seven men who wrote the constitution, which was approved
by national referendum on Dec. 6, 1978. ``One can now speak about a
pressure on the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clearly missing is the spirit of conciliation that
produced the constitution three years after the Franco
dictatorship's end in 1975. The democratic principles enshrined in
its 169 articles paved the way for Spain to join the European Union
in 1986, ending years of isolation from its democratic neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, whose conservative government
stands firmly for a united Spain, insisted at a meeting Tuesday
honoring the constitution that there was no need to revise it, and
he criticized the ``permanent'' demands from nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Basque region is leading the charge, but some nationalists
in Catalonia and Galicia have also hinted lately that the
constitution does not go far enough in its provisions for regional
parliaments, which control such functions as education and police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Basque people do not fit in the constitution,'' Xabier
Arzalluz, president of the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, said
in September.
</P>
<P>
   His party later backtracked, but it is making political deals
with the leftist Euskal Herritarrok coalition, which stands for
Basque Citizens in the Basque language and unabashedly favors
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is considered the political arm of the Basque
separatist group ETA, which since September has observed what it
calls the first ``indefinite'' cease-fire in its 30-year armed
struggle for Basque independence.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after weeks of negotiations following the Basque
parliamentary elections in October, Arzalluz's party announced that
it would govern the Basque region in minority, with support only
from other Basque nationalist parties, ending a decade-long
alliance with the Madrid-based Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The move was expected to increase pressure on Madrid for more
Basque autonomy or independence. The recent Basque moves have been
a hot political issue for weeks in Spain, and last week former
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a Socialist, said he doubted that
Aznar would defend the constitution to the hilt while trying to
negotiate a permanent peace in the Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   That remark added fuel to the fire raging between the Socialists
and Aznar's conservative Popular Party over mutually acceptable
judges to fill four slots on the 12-member Constitutional Court. It
is the highest tribunal in the land, created by the constitution,
and the new appointments _ finally made on Friday _ come nine
months past deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay is most harmful to the image of the court,'' said
Alvaro Rodriguez Bereijo, the Constitutional Court's presiding
judge. ``Citizens could see it as a center of political
in-fighting. The small interests of the parties shouldn't be above
matters of state.''
</P>
<P>
   While politicians bicker over the constitution, 22,000 ordinary
Spaniards braved long lines in cold weather last Tuesday and
Wednesday for a special visit to Parliament. There they received a
free copy of the Constitution and got a rare chance to sit in the
ornate neoclassical chamber where the 350 legislators convene.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the visitors gazed up at the painted ceilings, still
pocked by holes from bullets fired on Feb. 23, 1981, when
rebellious Civil Guard troops stormed the building in a coup
attempt. It failed after the intervention of King Juan Carlos, who
also visited Parliament last week to open an exhibit on the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as fellow visitors filed past, Ernesto Sampere,
78, stood up from a seat normally occupied by a government minister
and made an impromptu speech extolling Spain's democratic
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went off to fight Franco in the civil war,'' he nearly
shouted, adding that he was jailed during the dictatorship. ``I'm
happy this place exists to serve Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd broke into hearty applause.

NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY RITUALS ALREADY UNDER WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Pure political Scarlett O'Hara, Barbara Russell
could not immediately say how many presidential hopefuls have
recently asked her on the equivalent of a date, seeking the support
she might deign to cast their way as assistant chairwoman of New
Hampshire's Republican State Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, two, three, four, five,'' she counted slowly, running in
her mind through suitors she was too discreet to name, but
described as ``top-tier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They like to take you out to dinner, meet with you one on one
to talk about message and money,'' Ms. Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of nature has gone quiescent for the winter, the
mating rituals here in the first-in-the-nation primary state are
just now heating up. The next presidential primary here is a good
14 months away, but this is the season when local officials find
themselves ever more ardently wooed by smiling out-of-staters who
figure that without the opinion leaders of New Hampshire, they can
forget about the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like before a baseball game _ they're choosing up
sides,'' said Jean Wallin, a prominent Democrat who was co-chairman
of Jimmy Carter's successful campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians considering a run ``have to meet with the usual
suspects,'' Ms. Wallin said, ``or at least contact them so no one's
nose is out of joint.''
</P>
<P>
   A friendly passel of such usual suspects was on hand Thursday in
the Legislative Office Building to help with a recount left over
from last month's elections, and some seemed lighted by happy
anticipation that very soon, things were going to start getting
politically interesting again. Perhaps it will be even more
interesting than usual, given the growing tendency among other
states to set their primaries earlier and earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, California and several other Western states are
expected to move their primaries up to early or mid-March, soon
after New Hampshire's usual date in mid-February. Some political
analysts say such ``front-loading'' will divert attention from New
Hampshire. But others say it makes New Hampshire all the more
critical for candidates who lack the money and organization to take
on a giant state like California.
</P>
<P>
   This election cycle, said Hugh Gregg, a former New Hampshire
governor and one of its foremost authorities on the primary, the
new round of courting effectively began the day after the 1996
vote, when former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander put out bumper
stickers advertising his bid for the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has started earlier than any one we ever had,'' Gregg said
in an interview in his Nashua office, noting that Alexander had
already held two gigantic lobster bakes for a thousand or two.
``Usually they start right after Christmas the year before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg keeps a list of all the people he considers likely to be
candidates and those who have already visited the state. As of
Thursday, among 26 likely Republican candidates, 18 had visited,
with Texas Gov. George W. Bush the most notable Republican no-show.
Among eight Democrats on his list, seven had visited. Vice
President Al Gore has been up a half-dozen times, Gregg said, and
is expected to be back again later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month's election, however, many of the visits carried
something of an altruistic character: the national candidates were
largely lending their room-filling appeal to local colleagues in
need of help. At least that was the official line.
</P>
<P>
   George Bruno, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic
Party and a Gore backer, said he believed such active help from
leaders like Gore helped tip the state Senate from Republican to
Democrat this year for the first time since 1912. It is a nice
two-sided system, he said, in which local candidates get help
``from national candidates in whose interest it was to make sure
there was a Democratic network in the state from which they could
later call in their favors.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are certain people the candidates can depend on: those
they hire. That process, too, is already beginning. Republican
officials say at least five potential candidates, including Steve
Forbes and Dan Quayle, have paid staff members in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the courting of New Hampshire pols begins
small-scale, from the congratulations and condolence calls Gore
made to state lawmakers who won and lost in last month's elections
to Christmas cards from Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   For those who back a winner, the rewards can be large-scale. The
path from New Hampshire to Washington and beyond is well-trodden by
the likes of former Gov. John Sununu, who became White House chief
of staff for President George Bush after helping engineer his 1988
primary comeback. Bruno, who was co-chairman of Clinton's 1992
campaign here, was later appointed ambassador to Belize.
</P>
<P>
   While all the back-scratching might seem cause for cynicism, the
opportunity for up-close-and-personal political pitches to even
obscure officials and party stalwarts is part of what enthusiasts
say makes the New Hampshire primary valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks and months, said New Hampshire Secretary of
State William Gardner, if you live in New Hampshire and think you
like a candidate, ``If you want to have him to a dining-room or
living-room event and invite 20 neighbors, you pretty much have
that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time the New Hampshire primary is known for,'' he
added. ``It's not the week before,'' when the national media swarm
in.
</P>
<P>
   But this can also be an agonizing time for the hard-core
political workers like Ms. Russell, who was executive director for
Bob Dole's general election campaign here and this time has yet to
decide which candidate deserves her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had nightmares over a pick for a year and a half,'' Ms.
Russell said, ``because when I jump in, I'm going to give it every
hour of my life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mo Lewis didn't make any early-morning trips into the city last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets linebacker usually goes to martial-arts
classes three days a week from 6:30 to 7:30 a.m., but, he said:
``I've stopped now. This is a crucial moment for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Jets (8-4) are entering the crucial point of the
season with four games to go, including Sunday's matchup with the
Seattle Seahawks at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who has started all 105 games he has played for the team,
doesn't want to jeopardize the Jets' chances of making the playoffs
for only the second time in his eight-season career. So he is
temporarily forgoing the lessons that made him a first-degree black
belt in both karate and taekwondo and funneling those skills onto
the football field.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't always been this intense, this focused. Although Lewis
was the Jets' leading tackler from 1992-94, he went into a two-year
tailspin during the disastrous Rich Kotite years. Now, in his
second season under coach Bill Parcells, he is playing at a peak
again. He leads the Jets in sacks with 6, and in solo tackles with
54. He has produced 2 interceptions, recovered a fumble, forced
another, and batted down 4 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Two games ago, Lewis brought down one of the top runners in
football, the Oilers' Eddie George, with a one-armed tackle that
made all of the highlight shows. At moments like that, the
6-foot-3-inch, 258-pound Lewis is an avenging force of pure power.
</P>
<P>
   He is doing all of this with a technique that Parcells _ who
built his career around coaching linebackers _ called unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a funny stance, gets tight, like in a little shell,''
Parcells said. ``I had never seen anyone do that before. Mo lines
up with his hands up front, together. It's a funny appearance. He's
all wound up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a style that Lewis adapted from his martial arts training,
in which many of the moves start from a coiled position. He said he
does it because it helps him react and attack more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Lewis is careful to separate that aggressive football
persona from his life at home with his wife, Christalyn, and his
sons, Morris IV, 3, and Christopher Wiley, 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take my job home to my wife,'' he said. ``People view
football players as aggressive. You hear about some players who
come home angry. She has enough to worry about with my two boys.
The only reaction she knows about a game I just played is when she
drives me home in the car. If we won, I'm smiling all the way home.
If we lose, I don't say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Parcells closed practices, Christalyn often watched. ``I
used to see how aggressive he is on the field, but he wears two
hats,'' she said. ``When he comes home, he's husband and daddy. He
is attentive and passive, especially since the kids were born.''
</P>
<P>
   In the off season, in his home in Marietta, Ga., Lewis doesn't
talk or think football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go bass fishing,'' he said. ``It puts everything in the
past.'' He said he once caught a 10-pounder and this past off
season landed a $25,000 first prize in a bass-fishing competition.
</P>
<P>
   He also pursues his study of the martial arts, a fascination he
has had since he was 5 years old and saw the movie ``Enter the
Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the self-confidence Bruce Lee had,'' Lewis recalled.
``Cowboys carry guns. This was something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' mother wasn't thrilled with his hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said there was too much feet involved,'' Lewis said. ``Too
much kicking and jumping. My father was OK with it. He was a boxer.
He was trying to make a living at boxing but after I was born, he
decided to get a regular job.''
</P>
<P>
   Through high school in Atlanta, Lewis starred in football and
baseball, no doubt using some of the hand-eye coordination
developed in the dojo. He was good enough as a pitcher to be
drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, but Lewis' father, Morris II,
insisted that he go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sherman, who later would become the Jets' offensive
coordinator for one season, tried to recruit him to play as a tight
end at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had big hands and he thought I'd be good at the position,''
Lewis said. ``But growing up in Georgia, there was only one school
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the University of Georgia, and although Sherman
eventually moved there, too, Lewis played linebacker for the
Bulldogs. He developed into an all-Southeastern Conference player,
but he said the best thing about college was ``I met my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Christalyn was a pre-med major and Lewis said her father didn't
want her to get married until she got her degree. ``She switched
majors and graduated sooner and then we got married,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he met the Jets, who selected him in the third round of the
1991 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Who's on the Jets? Where are the Jets?''' Lewis
recalled. ``The only ones I could think about were Freeman McNeil
and Al Toon.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewis flowered in the defense run by Pete Carroll, and in
1994 produced a stunning 114 individual tackles along with 4
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then everything went out of me,'' he said as he considered
the frustration of winning only three games in 1995. The
self-reliant Lewis could not stand losing, and didn't know how to
cope with the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Something else happened that year, just when it appeared he was
going to gain league-wide recognition: he started getting paid like
a star.
</P>
<P>
   The new Jets regime headed by Kotite rewarded him with a deal
that included a $2.1 million signing bonus. It was an
acknowledgment of his consistent team-leading tackling, his
aggressive play, his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players get to a plateau and get complacent,'' he said.
``I got complacent. It lasted two years.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   His 1995 and 1996 seasons were not only debacles for the team,
which went 3-13 and then 1-15, they were aimless years for Lewis.
His weight ballooned into the 290's. He sustained the first _ and
only _ injury that has sidelined him, a torn pectoral muscle that
kept him out of the final nine games of '96. Teammates who had
previously talked of him going to the Pro Bowl now joked that he
had someone else sign in for him when he was supposed to be in the
weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball was my first love, then fishing, and karate,'' Lewis
said. ``But even though football wasn't No. 1, I always wanted to
compete. And when that left me, I knew there was something wrong
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Parcells, the linebacker expert whose Giants and Patriots
teams were defined by the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years before I came here I voted for him for the Pro
Bowl,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the new coach's tough off-season program, Lewis turned
out to be a comparative rookie, and a soft one at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a physical player,'' Parcells said, ``but he came to me
after our first meeting and said he didn't know anything about
weight-lifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed embarrassed about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get insecure,'' said Parcells. ``They walk into that
weight room and see other guys doing it and they don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   After they met for the first time, Lewis said he wanted to
return to the linebacker he had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was challenged again,'' he said. ``Am I going to let
him dictate what I do _ or do I go out there? I dropped my weight.
He wanted me mainly over the tight end. Now I have more chances to
roam. I know I scared a lot people with my size _ at 260 pounds,
they didn't think I could move. But I can move.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells recognized Lewis' explosiveness and quickness and tried
to exploit them. During the 1997 exhibition season, he switched
Lewis from the weakside spot to the more active strongside
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to find the right spot for him,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently has found it. In each of the Jets' last two
victories, Lewis led the defense with 10 tackles and throughout the
season he has been the most stable force on the linebacking corps,
which has gone through a dramatic upheaval. Before the season
started, he and Marvin Jones and James Farrior were the starters.
Then Jones suffered season-ending knee surgery, and Farrior had a
knee injury that sidelined him.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers coach Al Groh and defensive coordinator Bill
Belichick mixed and matched the openings with Bryan Cox and Pepper
Johnson and Chad Cascadden and now that Farrior is healthy, he
can't get his starting job back.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been the constant on the unit. He has been constantly
good, as well, with his pass-rushing, pass defense and tackling.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, with a victory against the Seahawks, the Jets would
remain at least tied for first with Miami in the American Football
Conference East Division.
</P>
<P>
   And those bad days?
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing brings a lot of misery onto anybody,'' Lewis said. ``I
was brought up to believe even when you get kicked down you can
come back. We went from 3-13, the worst club record, and next year
we went 1-15.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, the Jets and Lewis are pummeling opponents,
or, as Lewis likes to say, ``Killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want to waste any more chances.  &QL;

60 NATIONS PREPARE KOSOVO MONITORING MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ Diplomats from 60 countries meeting here last
week pushed to speed the deployment of 2,000 monitors to the
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With 45 foreign ministers in attendance, the formerly low-key
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe issued a
statement bolstering its commitment to the biggest mission it has
ever faced: keeping a lid on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the task of assembling unarmed monitors to hinder clashes
between the Yugoslav military and ethnic Albanian rebels is taking
longer than many diplomats had hoped. The plan was announced in
October as part of a cease-fire agreement that the U.S envoy,
Richard Holbrooke, reached with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia as NATO threatened air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   William G. Walker, an American who heads the European security
group's Kosovo mission, said that the first 500 monitors were
setting up offices in the Kosovo capital, Pristina. The full
mission will be 10 times as large as any previous deployment by the
group, but will not be ready until mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the group's two-day ministerial conference here
Wednesday and Thursday said they were determined to refute critics
who said the peace-keeping job was too big for the Vienna-based
organization, which started in the 1970s as a forum for East-West
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that we get this right, for the sake of the
hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of Kosovo who have been
displaced, who have been deprived of their livelihood and whose
homes have been destroyed,'' said the Norwegian foreign minister,
Knut Vollebaek, who will head the security group through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting began, the Yugoslav government, which was
suspended from the group in 1992, sent a communique to Oslo lashing
out at observers for dealing with ``terrorists, murderers,
kidnappers, bandits and other criminals'' _ their terms for the
Kosovo rebels _ in the search for a political settlement. It said
rebel attacks would be answered ``no matter what the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker disputed contentions that the monitoring mission is
taking too long to start. The monitors are arriving from 30
different countries to find limited accommodations in Pristina, he
said. Some have military or police experience while others are
specialists in human rights; all require training for a unique
mission designed to be intrusive but not provocative.
</P>
<P>
   He said military analysts have warned that ``all hell will break
loose'' in Kosovo next spring, when the snow melts. Walker played
down that prospect but noted that 1,800 NATO troops and a fleet of
helicopters will be stationed in neighboring Macedonia to evacuate
his monitors if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   While the security group's budget this year was $100 million,
the Kosovo operation alone will cost an estimated $204 million in
the first year, officials said. The United States has offered to
provide 143 monitors and will pay about 12 percent.

INSTANT CHECKS ON GUN BUYERS ALREADY PAYING OFF, CLINTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.) (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Saturday that the new system
of computerized, instant background checks on gun buyers, run by
the FBI, had already stopped ``400 felons, fugitives, stalkers and
other prohibited purchasers from walking away with new guns.''
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton also accused the National
Rifle Association, which has gone to court to challenge the new
instant check system, of trying to ``gut the Brady law and
undermine our efforts to keep more guns from falling into the wrong
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, named for James Brady, who was President Ronald
Reagan's press secretary until being severely wounded during an
assassination attempt on Reagan in 1981, narrowly passed in
Congress five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until the new check system was put in place last week, gun
buyers often had to wait days or weeks for a background check
before they could purchase a gun. Under the new system, gun dealers
can call a central number for an immediate background check,
although some dealers complained last week that they had difficulty
reaching operators at the number and in some cases were kept
waiting for lengthy periods.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Saturday that he would press for further
restrictions on gun sales when the new Congress convenes in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my top priorities will be to pass legislation to
require a minimum waiting period before a handgun sale becomes
final,'' he said, arguing that background checks had to be combined
with a ``cooling off period'' that would stop ``rash acts of
violence and give authorities more time to stop illegal gun
purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called for the closing of a loophole in the existing law
that allows juveniles convicted of violent crimes to purchase guns
once they turn 21 years old. Clinton has asked the Treasury
Department and the Justice Department to assure that guns sold at
gun shows are not exempt from the background checks.
</P>
<P>
   When the NRA filed its suit earlier last week to block the new
instant check system, it argued that the FBI was violating federal
laws that forbid the creation of a national register of gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   James Jay Baker, a spokesman for the NRA, said in a statement
issued on Tuesday, ``The clear intent of the Congress was to
conduct the background check unobtrusively at the point of sale,
without delay, and with all respect to the privacy of the gun
purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, that is not what the federal government is
doing. Clearly, the attorney general and the Justice Department are
in violation of that intent and that law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed the NRA's arguments Saturday as a ``desperate
effort to kill'' enforcement of the Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't turn back,'' he said. ``In these last five years
Brady background checks have stopped nearly a quarter of a million
illegal handgun sales. We can't go back to the days when dangerous
criminals walked away from stores with new guns, no questions
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekly Republican radio address dealt entirely with
reforming Social Security, the subject of a long-awaited White
House conference that begins this week. Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr.,
R-Fla., warned that many people paying into the system now may not
get the benefits they are entitled to in 30 years. ``As the
president has said and almost everyone recognizes, Social Security
is headed for crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the problem is the shrinking ratio of workers to
retirees, a situation that will worsen as the baby boom generation
starts to retire in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is among several members of Congress who will meet with
Clinton on Tuesday to discuss ways to strengthen the system, a
politically delicate issue that both parties are approaching with
care, for fear of backlash if benefits are reduced or payroll taxes
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the system should be fair to current and future
retirees and must improve fairness across generations. But he did
not detail the proposals floating through his own party, including
setting aside some portion of Social Security payments for
investment in the stock market or eliminating the cap on annual
Social Security payments that benefits high-income workers.

OUTDOORS: PAYING TRIBUTE TO DEER IN MINNESOTA WOODS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  By NELSON BRYANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEAU , Minn. _ Dawn was still a half-hour away when I reached
the tripod stand on which I was to perch for the next three hours,
waiting for a deer to wander past.
</P>
<P>
   I dawdled a few minutes before making the ascent to the top of
the 16-foot stand, where there was a short board for me to straddle
and sit on. Once ensconced, there was no coming back down until my
vigil was done.
</P>
<P>
   In this region of Minnesota, only a few miles south of the
Manitoba border, most deer hunting is done from stands. Our stands
_ there were eight in our party on the opening day of the deer
season, which ran from Nov. 7-15 _ were scattered along nearly a
mile of brush, small trees and canary grass that forms the western
edge of croplands owned by the Roseau farmer Manfred Holm.
</P>
<P>
   Farther to the west was a long, narrow stand of conifers, mostly
larches and spruce. The drill was to occupy our aeries before the
deer, which go into the fields at night to feed, began to work
their way back into the thickets and woods to bed down for the day.
</P>
<P>
   On other opening days in Minnesota, below-zero cold had been
usual. This time around the weather was almost balmy, with
temperatures in the low 20s, gentle breezes and a dust of snow on
the frozen earth. Just when I was able to start making out objects
on the ground beneath in the gathering light, guns coughed a few
times miles south of me. Silence reigned after that, save for the
mournful wail of a distant freight train.
</P>
<P>
   On previous Minnesota hunts at that hour I had listened to
fusillades both near and far. To one accustomed to the sound of an
occasional shot bouncing off mountainsides in Maine or New
Hampshire during deer season, such salvos are astonishing. The
portion of Minnesota in which we hunt is flat and open, and
multiple shots over long distances at running deer are commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   I had not been with those who had built my stand the previous
day, and I soon realized that it wasn't for someone who shoots
left-handed. There was a clearing that stretched for 500 yards or
more to my left, far out into one of Manfred's fields, but there
was no way I could twist around and fire in that direction with any
degree of competence. My only hope was that a deer would approach
from a different direction. But I needn't have worried. All I saw
was a chickadee and two magpies. On that day and others, some
members of our party were dive-bombed in their stands by great gray
owls.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:15, I descended and walked back to our vehicles, where I
was joined by Gordon Haugen, Manfred's son-in-law, and my brother
Danny. Neither had seen deer. As we were chatting, a single
close-at-hand shot sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounded like a .243,'' I said, adding that it must have
been fired by Glenn Holm, Manfred's son, the only one of us
carrying a rifle of that caliber.
</P>
<P>
   The others agreed, and we were correct _ Glenn had bagged a
four-point buck. He was the only member of our group to see a deer
that morning, although Daniel Tilton, the son of David Tilton, our
deer camp host, had heard one moving through thick brush near his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the elder Tilton's house-trailer deer camp, which is on
a strip of land he owns along the Roseau River, we learned that
David, Whit Manter and Matthew Haugen, Gordon's son, had seen no
deer.
</P>
<P>
   In the three days before the season opened we had refurbished
old stands, built two new ones and erected one prefabricated metal
stand, the first such structure we had ever used _ towing it into
position on a flat-bed trailer hauled by an all-terrain vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   That first afternoon we made two deer drives that produced
nothing, and the same was true of our second day in our stands,
although Daniel Tilton did pass up a chance to shoot a fawn and had
a brief glimpse of a large deer.
</P>
<P>
   I went to a different stand the second morning, even though I
had doubts about climbing it and had momentarily considered asking
Glenn Holm if I could join him in his stand, a penthouse of its
genre, a small walled and roofed building with sliding windows and
a gas heater built 15 feet above the ground on posts. My new stand
had been formed by erecting a platform between three poplars, and
the steps leading up to the platform leaned back toward the climber
at about 15 degrees. It proved negotiable and once in place I was
delighted. I could see and shoot in four directions. Nothing came
by that morning or the following one, however.
</P>
<P>
   Whit shot a seven-point buck the second evening, and on the
third evening, while hunkering down in the puckerbrush with Manfred
beside one of his cultivated fields in which succulent green shoots
of winter rye were emerging, I shot a four-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   We ate high on the hog each day. The menu included baked striped
bass and oyster stew, roast turkey and fried deer liver and bacon,
and throughout our stay there was a flood of pies, biscuits and
pastries from the kitchens of our Minnesota members.
</P>
<P>
   On our fourth and last full day of hunting, a major snowstorm
driven by gale-force winds swept through North Dakota and northern
Minnesota. All save Whit elected to sleep in that morning. Whit
came back to report that he had spotted the tracks of a doe and a
fawn made in the new snow directly beneath my unoccupied stand, and
I regretted being a slugabed. Our party had a number of unused
tags, both buck and doe, and Minnesota law permits any member of
such a group to keep hunting until all the tags are used.
</P>
<P>
   In our short morning hunt the day after the storm, Whit shot a
small doe from the new metal stand. The New Englanders _ the
Tiltons, Whit, Danny and I _ cut up two of the group's four deer in
Manfred's shop and packaged them in insulated boxes for the trip
home. That chore done, we were free to relax and swap yarns with
one another and with the guests that arrived at camp. One such
visitor was Larry Pladson, a Roseau musician and music teacher,
whose renditions, guitar and voice, of ``Danny Boy'' and the
``Kerry Dancers'' filled my heart with tears, an emotion no doubt
enhanced by a sturdy belt of Irish whiskey.

DUKE COACH LOOKS FOR CRACKS IN LADY VOLS' AURA OF INVINCIBILITY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENA VISTA, Fla., Dec. 5 _ After watching Monday night as
Tennessee's women routed previously unbeaten and second-ranked
Louisiana Tech, Duke coach Gail Goestenkors needed a lift. Her
16th-ranked Lady Blue Devils are to face Tennessee here Sunday in
the Honda Elite 4 Holiday Classic.
</P>
<P>
   So Goestenkors flipped on her videocassette recorder and rewound
the tape of Tennessee's shocking 78-68 loss to Purdue last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see that it was possible,'' Goestenkors said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Purdue loss, the third-ranked Lady Vols (5-1) have
started to show why they are the Chicago Bulls of the women's
collegiate game, reeling off five straight victories. They have won
three consecutive national titles and six since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   That does not seem to faze Goestenkors. Her 5-3 team, victimized
early by injuries to a half-dozen players, has mustered a four-game
winning streak. And Goestenkors said at midweek: ``I wouldn't have
scheduled the game if I didn't think we could win. If we do the
things we're capable of, we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois (3-2) and Washington (2-3) open Sunday's televised
doubleheader at 1 p.m. at Disney's Wide World of Sports arena.
Tennessee and Duke will meet at 3:30.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols, coming off a 39-0 season, are led by Chamique
Holdsclaw of New York City, a senior who has been a spectacular
constant in the team's three-year run. Michael Jordan has called
her ``the most exciting women's player ever,'' and she gave some
thought in the off season to turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she felt too much allegiance to the Tennessee
program, particularly to coach Pat Summitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me, `If you buy into me and my system, I'll make you
the best player you can be,' and here I am,'' Holdsclaw is quoted
as saying in ``Raise the Roof,'' a book about Tennessee's 1997-98
perfect season.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a while for Holdsclaw to warm to her coach.
Summitt's intensity and intolerance of mistakes made Holdsclaw
wonder early whether she had made the correct choice in attending
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like she was pushing me too hard, and I thought, `My
God, this lady doesn't like me,''' Holdsclaw said. ``She got on me
left and right. She wouldn't let me breathe. Anything went wrong,
it was, `Chamique! Chamique!'''
</P>
<P>
   Now Holdsclaw has become endeared to Summitt's relentless
nature, realizing it has paid off in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   After the Purdue loss, the Lady Vols ``refocused,'' as Summitt
likes to call it. In other words, practices became more like wars
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned clearly from our loss that we can't just show up
and win,'' Summitt said. ``I take a lot of responsibility myself
for maybe not going into practice and being as demanding as I have
been in past seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss may have been just the jolt the Lady Vols needed,
Summitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt all along that we were going to lose at some point in
time,'' she said. ``I do think it will help our chances down the
road. It takes the monkey off your back, so to speak, and allows
you to go out and play. Now the team feels it doesn't have to have
another perfect year and have that pressure come March.''
</P>
<P>
   Summitt, who is in her 25th season at Tennessee, has won more
games than any women's coach in National Collegiate Athletic
Association history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee had the vision a long time ago for where women's
sports should be, and they went in that direction,'' Washington
coach June Daugherty said. ``I think Pat Summitt is the best coach
in America.''

IN FIRST ENTHUSIASTIC STEP TOWARD DEMOCRACY, NIGERIANS GO TO
POLLS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Five months after the death of Nigeria's
longtime military dictator raised the prospect of greater political
openness here, Nigerians cast ballots Saturday for local government
officers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The voting, viewed as an early test of the new government's
seriousness about reform, appears to have been generally peaceful
and the turnout high, according to government officials and Western
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos, with 8 million people the biggest city, the normally
traffic-choked streets were eerily deserted. Drivers obeyed a
curfew, and teen-age boys transformed streets into soccer fields.
</P>
<P>
   Residents lined up before 8 a.m. at polling places across the
city. Many expressed hope that their votes would lead to what the
president, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has promised will be a
transition to a democratic government in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the elections will be free and fair,'' said Solomon
Ikujuni, 60, at a polling place in the Epetedo neighborhood. ``We
will get a clean government. We don't want a military government
anymore. We've been suffering for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   In Abuja, the capital, Abubakar, in civilian clothes, visited
six polling places and said the high turnout underscored strong
support for a transition to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bound to be some mistakes or problems,'' he said,
``and we have tried our best to put everything in place. It is now
left to Nigerians to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimism, echoed in Lagos, came in sharp contrast to the
anger in July after the death of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the wealthy
businessman whose apparent victory in a presidential election in
1993 was annulled by the military. The optimism was especially
noteworthy in Epetedo, which had given Abiola such strong backing
that he chose it as the site of a ceremony to swear in himself in a
futile bid to claim the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola _ a member of the Yoruba, the ethnic group that dominates
Lagos and the rest of the southwest _ died in government detention,
and his death set off sometimes fatal riots in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   It also further deepened the resentment in the Christian and
animist South toward the predominantly Muslim North, whose military
rulers have controlled Nigeria for all but 10 years since
independence from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   After Abiola's death, Abubakar announced that Nigeria would hold
elections, starting with local races this month and culminating in
presidential elections on Feb. 27. He is not running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups from outside Nigeria monitored the elections and
are expected to release fuller details this week. Voting appeared
to have been orderly in Lagos and elsewhere, although the
Independent National Electoral Commission postponed balloting in
parts of the Niger Delta, where ethnic Ijaw threatened to disrupt
voting to protest the oil-rich region's lack of roads, electricity
and running water.
</P>
<P>
   Local human rights organizations also monitored the voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' said Lanre Ope, a member of the Alliance
for Democracy. As an monitor, Ope was allowed to drive to several
wards in Lagos. ``If you bring in an unknown face in this
neighborhood, we'll know right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Registered voters were required to have their cards stamped
early in the morning by election officials at polling places, each
handling about 500 names. To prevent fraud _ as many as one-third
of the 60 million voting cards disappeared this fall _ voters
entered polling places around 11:30 a.m. and were not permitted to
leave until all had cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to several wards disclosed some problems. At one station
in the Bishop Aggey neighborhood in central Lagos, electoral
officials arrived an hour late and were still accrediting voters at
12:30 p.m. At a station in Ajegunle, voters complained that there
were no ballots for council seats, only for the post of chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters are cooperating,'' said Justina Uzoh, an election
officer presiding over a station in Ajegunle. ``They came out en
masse, although many could not be accredited because they came
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnout seemed to vary widely from ward to ward; nationwide
figures were not available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Votes were supposed to be counted immediately at each station.
But election officials do not expect to have results of broader
voting patterns until Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine parties that presented candidates, only those who
win 5 percent of the votes in at least 24 of the 36 states will be
allowed to take part in the statewide and presidential elections.
Three parties _ the All People's Party, the People's Democratic
Party and the Alliance for Democracy _ are considered the best
financed and include most of Nigeria's political heavyweights.

IS 90 PERCENT OF VOTE SUSPICIOUS? KAZAKH LEADER IS PUZZLED 
</HEADLINE>

   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ With his open, unlined face, Nursultan
Nazarbayev talks like a man without a care, as might any entrenched
ruler of a resource-rich nation courted by powerful world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one thing does plainly bother the dapper former Communist
Party leader, who has ruled since 1989 over this vast republic in
the Caspian Sea region, an area attracting the interest of
Washington and some of the world's biggest companies because of its
huge oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   While the 58-year-old president is firmly in control at home,
where he is expected soon to win a new seven-year term by the usual
90 percent margin, he is puzzled by recent foreign accusations that
he is a power-hungry leader who terrorizes opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen hundred companies are working here and no one wants a
different president,'' he told a small group of journalists on a
recent tour of the northern industrial heartland of this country of
17 million. &QL; 
``Do you understand this? Write about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats agree that Kazakhstan's politics are mild by regional
standards. Across the sea in Azerbaijan, for instance, the police
have repeatedly used violence to disperse opposition rallies. In
November, Parliament set three-year jail terms for taking part in
such gatherings. The New York-based group Human Rights Watch last
week denounced Azerbaijan President Heydar Aliyev's human rights
record as ``dismal,'' and said his recent decrees ordering
improvements ``were merely window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet foreign criticism of Nazarbayev is rising. Last week, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors
voting in the region, expressed ``serious doubts that the
principles for democratic elections'' would be met in Kazakhstan,
and called on Nazarbayev to postpone the Jan. 10 election. Under
the circumstances, the organization said in its statement, it would
not send a full team of election monitors. A week earlier, the
State Department spokesman, James Rubin, accused Kazakhstan of a
``pattern of harassment'' of Nazarbayev's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev probably would easily win a free election, but
Western experts note that he still does not let anyone serious run
against him and has a habit of padding the vote to obtain
Soviet-era victory margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now use the term `the 90 percenters' to refer to the whole
bunch'' of Caspian leaders, said Peter Sinnott, an expert on the
region at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 24, Kazakhstan's Supreme Court excluded former Prime
Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, 46, from the elections because he met
with a political group not registered with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Kazhegeldin, a former prime minister forced from office in
October 1997, is among the few Caspian opposition leaders seen as a
credible alternative to an incumbent president. The ruling against
him came a day after Gore telephoned President Nazarbayev voicing
concern about treatment of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Kazhegeldin has hired Washington lawyers and public relations
people to try to shift the campaign abroad and make Nazarbayev
appear illegitimate to Washington. U.S. political support helps
keep investors coming and hold Russia at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The president counters by contending that Kazhegeldin is tainted
by sweetheart oil and mineral deals he approved in his three years
as prime minister. In the interview, the president charged that his
rival is a ``secret KGB employee, a secret agent.'' He also
asserted that the former prime minister organized the Sept. 26
firebombing of an opposition newspaper and an Oct. 13 incident in
which Kazhegeldin says he came under gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me about Kazhegeldin,'' the president said. ``I very
much wanted that he would run and receive his 3 or 4 percent and be
disgraced.''
</P>
<P>
   The president insists he is not a one-man ruler. He appoints
officials, but they work independently, he said in the interview
with journalists. Some university students may have been forced to
sign petitions supporting his candidacy or risk failing, he
conceded, but that was the work of local bureaucrats who were
``obviously overdoing it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Almaty, there is no tangible fear or tension.
Since the rubber-stamp Parliament voted to hold presidential
elections two years early, however, the government has stepped up
pressure on opponents, and increased surveillance of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and Western businessmen who meet him generally
describe Nazarbayev as charming and relaxed, yet serious, a
strategic thinker with a sharp sense of regional politics.
Foreigners and Kazakhstan's citizens seem resigned to his
maintaining control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't a president anymore,'' said a middle-aged taxi driver
in the industrial city of Aktyube, a city of 300,000 peopled
dominated by Soviet-style concrete structures which Nazarbayev
visited recently. ``He's some kind of a sultan. Nazarbayev is the
only candidate and no one else can win. I don't pay attention to
politics anymore.''

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ ``It's a good time to be out of Washington,''
Bill Bradley was saying two hours after he held a news conference
to announce his yearning to return there as President in the year
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator was referring to the excruciating
year that has put President Clinton on the brink of impeachment,
forcing Bradley and any other candidate to wonder whether a
presidential run is worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As if offering the first chicken-in-every-pot enticement of a
fresh political season, he suggested a way for the next field of
candidates to deal with the Clinton scandal that many Americans
might find refreshing, if the polls are to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't,'' Bradley said. ``You turn the page. You move on.
This is not about the past; it's about the future.'' And, with a
slight, confident smile, the candidate moved on to the issues that
intrigue him: impoverished children, racial divisions, health care,
the working family's life.
</P>
<P>
   For a politician once tagged as a waffler on the subject of
running for president, Bradley seems brimming with certainty this
time, describing his new exploratory committee as the necessary
``training camp'' for the full political season that he firmly
predicts will include him. He has been considering all the factors,
he says, from catching Vice President Al Gore, who has a head start
for the Democratic nomination, to raising the $20 million or so it
takes to make a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He would entertain no doubts as he leaned back in his office,
already kinetic with campaign advisers and clutter, and talked
enthusiastically of forming his team, running his plays,
barnstorming the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the top of my game,'' said Bradley, 55, a former New
York Knick basketball star, his campaign mantra already clear as he
repeats this assertion for one and all, as if answering a skeptical
newspaper headline taped outside: ``He Got Game?'' The
scholar-athlete tensions and self-doubts that some said marked
Bradley as senator seemed determinedly banished; candidate Bradley
talks of running all out, enthusiastic as a gym rat, not a jot of
equivocation in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, you go out and tell the people what you believe,'' he
said, summarizing his uphill task as if diagraming a play. ``You
know why you're doing it. You're at peace with yourself. You
respect the wisdom of the American people. That's the sequence of
the things that you do.''
</P>
<P>
   When he left in 1996 after 18 years in the Senate, the New
Jersey Democrat sourly pronounced the political system ``broken.''
But he talked, too, of personal burnout after a career in which he
twice openly mused about a presidential run but turned away. In the
interlude, he has taught, written, politicked for other candidates
and, he said, regained his competitor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believe you listen to that inner voice,'' said
Bradley, a former Rhodes scholar. ``Now I'm back and it says, `Go.'
So I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   He still harbors some of the old anxieties about the nastiness
and invasiveness of a presidential run that put him off in 1988 and
1992, he acknowledged. In his political memoir, ``Time Present,
Time Past,'' he wrote, ``Sometimes I feel that I'm living during a
political era in which what I value most, character, is endangered;
what I admire most, humanity, is devalued; and what I feel most
sensitive about, privacy, is denied.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he talked, Bradley's wariness about the bear-pit nature
of politics seemed no match for his appetite to finally run plain
and straight for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's either a fever that's going to break,'' he said of the
character vetting and attacking that seem to dominate modern
campaigning, ``or it's an unfortunate continuing aspect of the
environment.'' He seemed to be treating it as a bruising dynamic of
the game that he could handle. ``The way you deal with that is to
be yourself,'' said the man once known for setting stinging body
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's announcement speech, which campaign aides say
Bradley painstakingly composed himself over the last two months,
the candidate promised ``a type of leadership that doesn't stand in
the spotlight as much as call attention to millions of Americans
who shine.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``spotlight'' allusion touched on the marketing challenge
for Bradley's campaign team: how to artfully contrast the
sensational celebrity-cum-notoriety of Clinton with Bradley's
quieter political professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he offers authenticity,'' said one Bradley
strategist, hoping voters sense this as a welcome relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley shrugs off any shortcoming in a celebrity flash. He
promises nothing more than himself and a considerable assortment of
ideas. ``I have a clear sense of what I want to do,'' he said,
``and in a very fundamental sense, it's the right time for me to
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he plunges back in, he flatly states what is wrong with
politics. ``There's too much money,'' he said, ``the media is often
too superficial and sensational, and not enough politicians speak
from their core convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first day of running, Bradley emphasized that his
``exploratory'' status was merely the initial requisite of what he
expects will be a full campaign. ``Been to New Hampshire, been to
Iowa,'' he noted, smiling at the inevitable nuts-and-bolts
questions. He has no operation yet in either place, but his
strategists promise to be ready in time for the front-loaded
primary calendar of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no kind of magic that you use,'' Bradley said,
insisting that he was undaunted at the task of rapidly creating a
credible campaign machine. ``You just go out there and tell the
country what you believe.''
</P>
<P>
   There is far more to it than that, and Bradley has been seeing
to the details for months, with names of more than 300 friends and
operatives, for example, on one special announcement list he
personally attended to, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign manager is Gina Glantz, whose experience goes back
to the Walter Mondale campaign of 1984. Douglas Berman, former New
Jersey state treasurer, is campaign chairman. The deputy manager is
the former chief of staff to North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, Ed
Turlington, who has been scouting the trail on behalf of Bradley's
Presidential bid since he left the Senate. The treasurer is Ted
Wells, a criminal lawyer and longtime Bradley adviser. Already at
the candidate's side is Anita Dunn, who was the senator's chief of
staff, and Eric Hauser, another former staff member.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Iowa, the early caucus stop in the campaign,
Bradley tells of being an 11-year-old Little Leaguer in the
regional championship game in Keokuk. ``I'm on first and we're
trailing by a run,'' he recalled. ``I take a step off the base, the
guy does the hidden-ball trick and, bang, we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the legendary unsmiling competitor, beamed for
perhaps the only time at the memory of losing. ``Ever since, I've
dreamed of going back to Iowa and winning one,'' he said, his
hustings act obviously ready. ``So here we are.''

WEAPONS SALES TO AFRICAN NATIONS CAUSE CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ The United States and 32 other countries
concluded four days of arms control meetings here with a public
commitment to exercise ``maximum restraint'' before selling weapons
to regions of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors, the delegates to the so-called Wassenaar
regime, an arms control organization that came into being after the
Cold War, made clear that the areas they were most concerned about
were Central Africa, where a half dozen countries are fighting in
Congo, and the Horn of Africa, where Ethiopia and Eritrea are on
the brink of full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   For at least two Wassenaar countries, the pledge of restraint
seems somewhat hollow.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Russia will begin shipping the first contingent of
$150 million worth of combat aircraft, helicopters and other
military equipment to Ethiopia. And Bulgaria said last week that it
had recently issued licenses for the sale of tanks to Ethiopia and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not consistent with any commitment to maximum
vigilance,'' bristled a Western diplomat about the Russian sale,
which was not known publicly until a few hours after the Wassenaar
meeting closed here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither sale violates the Wassenaar regime, or any other arms
control treaties, which encourages advocates of greater curbs on
the conventional weapons trade to campaign for new treaties that
would keep weapons out of regional trouble spots. But Washington's
efforts to put a few more teeth into Wassenaar have been thwarted
by countries such as Russia and France, U.S. and European diplomats
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulgarian tank sales were first reported 10 days ago by a
Bulgarian newspaper, Trud, which said that 140 tanks had been sold
to Ethiopia. The newspaper reported that another deal, for 80
tanks, was pending, and these were going to Ethiopia and Uganda.
Bulgaria acquired the T-55 tanks cheaply from Moscow during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In response to written questions, Bulgaria's Ministry for Trade
confirmed on Thursday that licenses had been issued for tank sales
to these countries, but it declined to discuss the details.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda is not in the market for used tanks, U.S. officials in
Africa say, but it had been giving support to the rebels in Congo,
and has been the provider of weapons to rebels in southern Sudan,
who have surprised observers with the remarkable number of tanks
they have managed to come up with in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bulgaria, which has seen its Soviet-era defense
industries plunged into economic misery, has become a prime arms
bazaar, supplying rebel groups, from the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka
to rebels in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopian deal earned the Bulgarian government $4.4 million
in profit, Trud reported. An obviously pleased senior defense
official told Trud that it was the best commercial year for the
ministry since it sold tanks to Yemen in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During the Wassenaar meetings here, Bulgarian diplomats were
chagrined that their defense officials were gloating so openly
about the deal, other diplomats who attended the meetings said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and European diplomats say that the current Bulgarian
government is deeply concerned about the country's negative image
as a result of disclosures, largely in the international press, of
its arms trading, and that the Foreign Ministry in particular would
like to clean up the practices. But it is not clear how much sway
the advocates of change will have over the defense industry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States has largely ignored Bulgaria's arms dealings,
but U.S. officials say that is about to change, and that the U.S.
ambassador in Bulgaria, Avis Bohlen, intends to put it on the
agenda in her meetings with Bulgarian officials.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Clinton administration, while unhappy about the
tank sales to Ethiopia, has not said anything publicly or made any
official protests to the Bulgarian government, said an official in
Washington, who believes that this is what needs to be done. Like
others, this official would discuss Bulgaria's arms sales only on
condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In order to curb the flow of weapons to troubled regions, the
Clinton administration has been trying to strengthen Wassenaar.
During the meetings this week, for example, U.S. diplomats pushed
to name the countries to which arms should not be sold, such as
Ethiopia and Eritrea. A majority of the Wassenaar members supported
the United States, but the organization operates by consensus and
there were objections.
</P>
<P>
   There are 33 members of the Wassenaar regime, which is named for
the Dutch city where agreement was first reached in 1995 to
exchange information on sales, if only after the fact. The
organization has been largely ineffective at stopping any transfers
of conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see what value Wassenaar is,'' said Lora Lumpe,
an arms trade analyst who is currently on leave from the Federation
of American Scientists to work on arms control issues at the Peace
Research Institute of Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Wassenaar meetings, like the one here last week, are behind
closed doors, and it does not release the data it compiles on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the information is not made public, it is hard to
evaluate what it has done,'' said Ms. Lumpe.

HOW RIDERS IN NEW YORK WOULD SPEND TRANSIT SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just before 6 p.m. in the 23rd Street subway station,
an F train was on the track, waiting, and Anthony Williams was
perched on a station bench, watching. The train was heading to
Queens. So was Williams. Five, six, eight minutes, and the train
did not move. Neither did he.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting off of work, I got new shoes, my feet hurt,''
said Williams, 24, a computer technician. ``I'm waiting for the
next train. It will probably be as crowded as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the subways.
</P>
<P>
   The trains are too packed, too slow, too few. The seats, made in
Japan, are too small for American behinds. The platforms are
dangerously narrow, the stations horribly dank, the announcements
unintelligible. Bathrooms are rare, rats common.
</P>
<P>
   While New York politicians are bragging about the city's
friendlier image and the transit system is bustling with half a
million new riders a day, the familiar chorus of complaints
continues from underground.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority projecting a
$379 million surplus and politicians from Gov. George Pataki on
down promising improved service, straphangers are brimming with
ideas about how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime New Yorkers remember far worse days, of stations
reeking of urine and slathered in graffiti, yet the crush of new
riders spawned by the Metrocard has strained the transit system, a
victim of its own success.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of improvements only serve to spike expectations: Can't a
city that chopped its murder rate by more than half make the
express trains stay in the station long enough for people from the
locals to scurry across?
</P>
<P>
   Officials of New York City Transit, a unit of the MTA, released
a broad budget outline last week promising to increase bus and
train service by 4.6 percent on weekdays, and add 6.2 percent more
bus trips and 3.2 percent more train trips on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   They also plan more cleaning crews, expanded station-painting
programs, clearer-sounding bus speakers and $57 million for
maintenance investments.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision on what to do with the surplus will be made
by MTA board members in meetings on Wednesday and on Dec. 19, but
here's a riders' wish list for the windfall based on conversations
with more than 40 passengers on buses and trains in Manhattan,
Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Hire more people to clean the stations. Speed up makeovers like
the one that has left Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn with bright
lights and shiny tiles instead of the pockmarked cement floors and
paint-cracked ceilings of most other stops. A fare cut would be
nice.
</P>
<P>
   People want more frequent service on Sundays so that, for
example, it would not take Lisa Osorio two hours to travel from her
home in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn to Abyssinian Baptist
Church in Harlem. And why not put benches at the bus stops?
</P>
<P>
   How about subway cars whose brakes won't screech, or electronic
bulletin boards like the ones in the London Underground that give
minute-by-minute updates about the next train's arrival? Can't they
automate announcements about transfers, or even hire some
celebrities to do them, as was done for the seat-belt announcements
in cabs?
</P>
<P>
   But the top priority by far is just for more of the same: Won't
they please, please add trains to the F line, the Queens express,
the 4, 5, 6, the Seventh Avenue line, or whichever one a rider
happens to be waiting for at that very minute?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets too close, it's like sardines packed in a can,''
said Jon Elson as he let a stuffed No. 3 train pass him by at 72nd
and Broadway during the Thursday morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   Several riders praised the service, noting how far it had come.
The subway is remarkably quick, especially when compared with the
clogged streets overhead, they said. Safety is no longer a major
concern, and at least renovations are under way. The stations are
clearly cleaner than they were, and at least there are some
announcements now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just notice a friendlier atmosphere,'' said Les Marshack,
57, who was heading downtown on the B train one afternoon. ``It's
subtle, but it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell Elizabeth Block that the system is polite. Sitting on
the end of a Wall Street-bound express train from her home in
Brooklyn on Thursday, Ms. Block, an assistant attorney general,
cursed as she watched yet another door close with a potential
passenger one step shy of getting on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for that,'' Ms. Block said. ``That goes to
the whole attitude thing. They still don't care. I don't know if
that can be improved with money.''
</P>
<P>
   Above ground, critics are just as loud. Buses have suffered from
even greater increases in riders, and the system is groaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an awful long time to get anywhere,'' said Dana
Sherman, 40, as she waited for the M-101 to take her from Lexington
Avenue and 57th Street to her home in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   Stella Shapiro, 82, has been riding New York buses for seven
decades. Nowadays, it can take two hours to go from 34th Street to
Washington Heights on the M-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, they've been terribly crowded and running late,''
she said. ``They need to get out more often and get them to run on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials acknowledge that the system has not yet
adapted to the huge influx of new riders, an estimated increase of
about 30 percent on buses and 8 percent on subways since July 1996.
They admit that more people means more trash, but say the
renovations and better litter pickups are at least a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the system is doing real well compared to the way it
used to be,'' said Larry Feldman, a school administrator from Fresh
Meadows, Queens, who collects Lionel electric trains and takes a
special interest in all things transit. ``It's much cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure it's cleaner. As long as you don't look up at the paint
practically falling off the low-hanging ceilings, with exposed
pipes that suddenly seem rather close to your head. Or down, at the
dingy brown concrete slabs encrusted with black blobs, remnants of
ancient chewing gum. Or at the tiled walls _ were they once white?
_ that look like the world's largest dentures badly stained with
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   At Grand Army Plaza, the cleanest spot on a two-day subway tour,
a uniformed worker sweeps even though there seems to be no trash.
Two stops away at Atlantic Avenue, a frightening station where the
renovations have not dawned, litter has a far longer shelf-life.
</P>
<P>
   Even the newest subway cars are a mess, nearly every window
scratched up with obscure messages whose meanings are unclear:
TWBT, ZOL4, BAAL (it is almost a relief to see SLACK and RATZON on
a Q train, a sign, at least, of some attempt at communication).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the worst-looking subways of anywhere I've ever
been,'' said Max Phillips, an East Village novelist riding the No.
6 who has been to _ among other places _ Chicago, Toronto and
Vienna. ``New York subways are the only place I've ever had to wait
on line to use a staircase.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   On the uptown side of the station at 79th Street and Broadway on
the Nos. 1 and 9 is a trash pile notorious for breeding rats. Nine
bags of garbage and four worn couch pillows sat next to the trash
bin on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm waiting for more than five minutes, there's no way I
won't see rats,'' said Frank Selvaggi, an accountant getting on the
downtown No. 1 immediately across from the trash bin. ``The other
day I was standing here, one came up from the tracks _ where it
says `Do not enter across tracks' _ and it started walking down the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mice, I can deal with,'' he said, ``but rats _ no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodents may be an intractable problem in a system that snakes
underground and on elevated tracks for 656 miles, and is tramped
through each day by 4 million people and all their attendant
sandwiches, candy bars and doughnuts. But what about the noise?
</P>
<P>
   To Alexander Krulic, who lives on the Upper East Side and rides
the Nos. 4 and 5 or the N and R, the rattling of the rails is like
poetry, but the sound of stopping is ``truly damaging.'' And why
can't they make announcements people can understand?
</P>
<P>
   Josh Klein, a computer network manager who lives in Carroll
Gardens, Brooklyn, and takes the F train to work near Rockefeller
Center, said the lack of communication is particularly frustrating
during delays. With a little information, people could plan
alternate routes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two-way street,'' he said. ``But the people running the
system think of it as a one-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Freeman's complaint is simple: The supply isn't keeping
up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be no ventilation; it's a sweatbox,'' Ms.
Freeman, who lives in the Bronx, said as she stopped in the Times
Square station to finish a ``great passage'' in her Bible before
heading to work. ``I like the Metrocard, that's great. But the
conditions have to improve for the people. Otherwise, you'll have a
mob scene here.''
</P>
<P>
   All those people, and no bathrooms. They closed them years ago,
transit officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the nearest restroom?'' an anxious 30-something with a
leather backpack asked the proprietor of a flower shop in the Times
Square station on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is none,'' the vendor replied. The traveler, confused by
the heavily accented response, thought he had been misunderstood.
``REST-ROOM,'' he repeated loudly and slowly. ``I need to use
one.''
</P>
<P>
   George Patouhas, who has run the flower stand since 1976, hates
the question. When he tells people there are no restrooms available
to the public, they ask him, pointedly, where he goes to relieve
himself. Sometimes they ask other things _ like whether they can
use the plastic barrels his flowers sit in as their own personal
toilets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a key, but I can't give the key to them,'' Patouhas
explained. ``It's not my property. The police say if anything
happens, I'm responsible. I have a heart up here. I feel badly.
Might as well tell them no bathrooms, case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, like so many things New York, just a matter of
adjustment. So it's a little dirty, a little smelly, a little slow
_ even very slow. Look at where it can take you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going home like this,'' Feldman said as he sucked in his
stomach to make room for fellow straphangers, ``it's just part of
living life in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as they have $379 million lying around ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it back,'' suggested Doug Ulderg, who commutes from Long
Island to Canal Street and Avenue of the Americas. ``Cut the
fares.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ ``It's a good time to be out of Washington,''
Bill Bradley was saying two hours after he held a news conference
to announce his yearning to return there as president in the year
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator was referring to the excruciating
year that has put President Clinton on the brink of impeachment,
forcing Bradley and any other candidate to wonder whether a
presidential run is worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As if offering the first chicken-in-every-pot enticement of a
fresh political season, he suggested a way for the next field of
candidates to deal with the Clinton scandal that many Americans
might find refreshing, if the polls are to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't,'' Bradley said. ``You turn the page. You move on.
This is not about the past; it's about the future.'' And, with a
slight, confident smile, the candidate moved on to the issues that
intrigue him: impoverished children, racial divisions, health care,
the working family's life.
</P>
<P>
   For a politician once tagged as a waffler on the subject of
running for president, Bradley seems brimming with certainty this
time, describing his new exploratory committee as the necessary
``training camp'' for the full political season that he firmly
predicts will include him. He has been considering all the factors,
he says, from catching Vice President Al Gore, who has a head start
for the Democratic nomination, to raising the $20 million or so it
takes to make a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He would entertain no doubts as he leaned back in his office,
already kinetic with campaign advisers and clutter, and talked
enthusiastically of forming his team, running his plays,
barnstorming the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the top of my game,'' said Bradley, 55, a former New
York Knick basketball star, his campaign mantra already clear as he
repeats this assertion for one and all, as if answering a skeptical
newspaper headline taped outside: ``He Got Game?'' The
scholar-athlete tensions and self-doubts that some said marked
Bradley as senator seemed determinedly banished; candidate Bradley
talks of running all out, enthusiastic as a gym rat, not a jot of
equivocation in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, you go out and tell the people what you believe,'' he
said, summarizing his uphill task as if diagraming a play. ``You
know why you're doing it. You're at peace with yourself. You
respect the wisdom of the American people. That's the sequence of
the things that you do.''
</P>
<P>
   When he left in 1996 after 18 years in the Senate, the New
Jersey Democrat sourly pronounced the political system ``broken.''
But he talked, too, of personal burnout after a career in which he
twice openly mused about a presidential run but turned away. In the
interlude, he has taught, written, politicked for other candidates
and, he said, regained his competitor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believe you listen to that inner voice,'' said
Bradley, a former Rhodes scholar. ``Now I'm back and it says, `Go.'
So I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   He still harbors some of the old anxieties about the nastiness
and invasiveness of a presidential run that put him off in 1988 and
1992, he acknowledged. In his political memoir, ``Time Present,
Time Past,'' he wrote, ``Sometimes I feel that I'm living during a
political era in which what I value most, character, is endangered;
what I admire most, humanity, is devalued; and what I feel most
sensitive about, privacy, is denied.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he talked, Bradley's wariness about the bear-pit nature
of politics seemed no match for his appetite to finally run plain
and straight for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's either a fever that's going to break,'' he said of the
character vetting and attacking that seem to dominate modern
campaigning, ``or it's an unfortunate continuing aspect of the
environment.'' He seemed to be treating it as a bruising dynamic of
the game that he could handle. ``The way you deal with that is to
be yourself,'' said the man once known for setting stinging body
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's announcement speech, which campaign aides say
Bradley painstakingly composed himself over the last two months,
the candidate promised ``a type of leadership that doesn't stand in
the spotlight as much as call attention to millions of Americans
who shine.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``spotlight'' allusion touched on the marketing challenge
for Bradley's campaign team: how to artfully contrast the
sensational celebrity-cum-notoriety of Clinton with Bradley's
quieter political professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he offers authenticity,'' said one Bradley
strategist, hoping voters sense this as a welcome relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley shrugs off any shortcoming in a celebrity flash. He
promises nothing more than himself and a considerable assortment of
ideas. ``I have a clear sense of what I want to do,'' he said,
``and in a very fundamental sense, it's the right time for me to
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he plunges back in, he flatly states what is wrong with
politics. ``There's too much money,'' he said, ``the media is often
too superficial and sensational, and not enough politicians speak
from their core convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first day of running, Bradley emphasized that his
``exploratory'' status was merely the initial requisite of what he
expects will be a full campaign. ``Been to New Hampshire, been to
Iowa,'' he noted, smiling at the inevitable nuts-and-bolts
questions. He has no operation yet in either place, but his
strategists promise to be ready in time for the front-loaded
primary calendar of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no kind of magic that you use,'' Bradley said,
insisting that he was undaunted at the task of rapidly creating a
credible campaign machine. ``You just go out there and tell the
country what you believe.''
</P>
<P>
   There is far more to it than that, and Bradley has been seeing
to the details for months, with names of more than 300 friends and
operatives, for example, on one special announcement list he
personally attended to, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign manager is Gina Glantz, whose experience goes back
to the Walter Mondale campaign of 1984. Douglas Berman, former New
Jersey state treasurer, is campaign chairman. The deputy manager is
the former chief of staff to North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, Ed
Turlington, who has been scouting the trail on behalf of Bradley's
presidential bid since he left the Senate. The treasurer is Ted
Wells, a criminal lawyer and longtime Bradley adviser. Already at
the candidate's side is Anita Dunn, who was the senator's chief of
staff, and Eric Hauser, another former staff member.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Iowa, the early caucus stop in the campaign,
Bradley tells of being an 11-year-old Little Leaguer in the
regional championship game in Keokuk. ``I'm on first and we're
trailing by a run,'' he recalled. ``I take a step off the base, the
guy does the hidden-ball trick and, bang, we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the legendary unsmiling competitor, beamed for
perhaps the only time at the memory of losing. ``Ever since, I've
dreamed of going back to Iowa and winning one,'' he said, his
hustings act obviously ready. ``So here we are.''

BETTING SCANDALS BRING PAIN AND SADNESS TO NORTHWESTERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ It is reading week, the week before exams, and
the students at Northwestern University are actually reading.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Proust and organic chemistry, they are looking at
headlines: ``4 are indicted in N.U. football scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, the indictments of four former
Northwestern football players on Thursday may have appeared to be a
joke: that even one of the great private research universities has
two gambling scandals in a single year. Only a week after two
Northwestern basketball players were sentenced to prison terms of
one to two months for trying to fix three games, the Wildcat
football players were accused of lying to a federal grand jury when
they denied betting on Northwestern games in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern's suspected point-shavers may have higher median
SAT scores than those of other universities' point-shavers, but on
sports-talk radio programs in Chicago, the main word used by
callers to describe the players was ``dumb.'' Sports cheating is
usually seen as a symptom of an overzealous attempt to win at all
costs. But the Northwestern basketball and football players are
accused of trying to lose by more than predicted by the point
spread. One player was accused of fumbling the ball on the goal
line against Iowa to protect a bet.
</P>
<P>
   On Northwestern's leaf-blown campus, beside Lake Michigan and
just north of Chicago, the accusations appeared to pain many
faculty members, students and alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the street from campus at Gary Barnett's sports bar
and restaurant, owned by the school's head football coach, the
women's basketball team gathered on Friday afternoon for an early
supper before their game against Ohio University. On the wall hung
the portrait of the 1995 football team, which lost to the
University of Southern California in the Rose Bowl, many of its
players teammates of the four suspected gamblers who played on a
losing 1994 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad thing for Northwestern,'' whispered Don
Perrelli, the women's basketball coach for 14 seasons, who did not
want his players to hear him. ``We're family. What we're doing
here, having a meal, it's a family thing. As a coach, you could
never think that a member of your family was playing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictments sent the university's athletic department and
what it calls its ``revenue sports'' into a defensive crouch. As an
airline will drape a cloth over its logo on a crashed jet,
Northwestern had no Wildcat logos at its news conference on
Thursday and no purple bunting.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Barnett, who became the football coach in 1992, two years
before the suspected gambling, offered this assessment of the
charges: ``The stain is on the individuals, not on the school. It
doesn't indict a program. It doesn't indict the school. It indicts
the individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The local and national sports pages were aflame with criticism
of Northwestern for deflecting responsibility for the suspected
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Telander, a sports columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, was
angry. An alumnus and former Northwestern athlete, Telander wrote,
``I want out of here'' in a column from the Northwestern athletic
club, where his photo hangs on the wall in football gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not out of the room,'' he wrote. ``Out of the university. Out
of the athletic `family.' Out of any connection with this
two-faced, sanctimonious, smug, holier-than-thou, elitist
university and its athletic department led by
how-could-they-do-this-to-me athletic director Rick Taylor and
know-nothing football coach Gary Barnett.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the university administrators acknowledged,
Northwestern has had its share of student drinkers, drug users and
gamblers. But the university said again and again that it acted as
soon as it caught wind of the gambling, hiring a former assistant
U.S. attorney to investigate, and it turned over its findings to
the federal authorities and the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The university also has imposed a ``zero tolerance'' policy on
gambling by any athlete. Anti-gambling literature from the NCAA is
distributed to athletes six to eight times a year. Starting this
year, every team must watch a video about the perils of sports
gambling. The coaches and players gather once each spring to hear a
speaker like a reformed gambler or a former FBI agent who has
investigated sports gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The columnists want heads to roll,'' said Alan Cubbage,
Northwestern's vice president for university relations. ``Fire the
coach and athletic director after they did what they're supposed to
and reported it immediately to the university administration? Did
they know what was going on? Did they fail to report it? Did they
cover it up? The answer is no, no, no.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Northwestern asked reporters not to interview students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reading week and they need to focus,'' Cubbage said.
</P>
<P>
   But students on campus shared mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the university is definitely responsible,'' said Tracy
Horton, a junior history major from Flint, Mich. ``I read that
Northwestern wasn't getting sanctioned at all. I don't think that's
right at all. It is a family, but in a family you take
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ms. Horton said she would not want the
football coach to be dismissed (except for this year's 3-9 finish)
or for Northwestern's reputation to be damaged. ``I think no one
expected something like this to happen here because we're supposed
to be so smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCoy, a sophomore chemistry student from Topeka, Kan.,
said, ``From what I've heard, the university handled this
absolutely correctly and did everything they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students expressed sympathy for the scholarship athletes,
who apparently got into debt with gamblers. After years as star
high school athletes, they found themselves at the end of another
losing season on a campus where athletes were not much revered.
</P>
<P>
   Other students saw no excuse for athletes betting against their
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no sympathy for them,'' McCoy said. ``It was just a
dumb thing to do. I can imagine how frustrated their teammates must
feel, working so hard all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Several students said they knew of other students who gambled on
sports and would have no trouble finding a place to place a bet.
Another student said he and his fraternity buddies could not find a
bookmaker on campus so they sent a $200 check to open an account in
Antigua and now call a toll-free number to place their bets.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Brei, class of 1983, is an entertainer in Las Vegas and a
rabid Northwestern football fan. ``When I was at the school, it was
the academic ideal that was most important, not sports,'' Ms. Brei
said. ``And now it seems it's the money. And that's not what
Northwestern is supposed to be all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was very, very disappointed that some of our guys would
do something like this,'' she said. ``I mean, people are basically
there to study.''

EDITORIAL: THE IMPEACHMENT BULLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 6:
</P>
<P>
   The decision on whether to impeach or censure President Clinton
is too important to be left to a ferocious partisan like Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, the Republican whip. But that is what the next
speaker, Bob Livingston, and his becalmed GOP leadership team are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   If they continue to tolerate DeLay's bullying, they will be
allowing a single willful legislator to frustrate the public's
desire to settle the Monica Lewinsky scandal by censuring President
Clinton sternly for his lies and failures of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and the Republican hard-liners on impeachment know that
both the public and a majority of House members favor a
condemnation of Clinton instead of impeachment, unless new evidence
emerges. But DeLay calculates that if he can prevent a censure
vote, the House may vote to impeach rather than let Clinton go
unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an insult to duty for any congressional leader to ram
through an impeachment vote by using parliamentary trickery of the
kind more suitable to votes on highway bills.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is taking advantage of the fact that many Republicans of
moderate views were infuriated by the president's hair-splitting
answers to the Judiciary Committee's list of 81 questions. Even so,
Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., is continuing to campaign for censure as
the best way to punish Clinton and let Congress move on to other
problems. He maintains that perhaps 20 Republicans prefer such a
route, and if they stick together to oppose impeachment, it will
likely fail.
</P>
<P>
   While DeLay is saying GOP members are free to vote their
consciences, he is working behind the scenes to make Republicans
follow him, not King. The White House knows that if a vote were put
off until next year, the president would be in a stronger position,
and that may be why it is asking for more time now to present its
defense. But Democrats who have called all year for a swift
procedure are in no position now to call for postponement.
</P>
<P>
   King has had the good sense to offer a censure measure that
would require an admission by Clinton. He is thereby keeping alive
chances of a negotiated settlement that would be stern enough in
its condemnation of Clinton to attract support from both parties.
But King cannot carry the fight alone. He needs help from senior
Republicans, including Livingston, who have enough spine to stand
up to Tom DeLay.

CENSUS MAY   SHORT   CHANGE   THE HOMELESS

By Rick Orlov  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To the U.S. Census Bureau, in the year 2000 there
will no longer be homeless people _ only those without conventional
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a car? Unconventional. A cardboard box?
Unconventional. Two or three families in one apartment?
Unconventional.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the use of government-speak in describing the living
conditions of the homeless, it is a serious question that troubles
homeless advocates and Los Angeles officials.
</P>
<P>
   For them, it's a multimillion-dollar question of how much state
and federal money will come to the city after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general consensus is that the 1990 census was a disaster
in counting the homeless,'' said Doug Ring, a commissioner on the
Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority, a city-county joint agency
that deals with homeless people and their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what that means is a significant reduction in the amount
of funding that comes to Los Angeles and other cities in the
county,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Profant, LAHSA planning manager, said her organization
has been working with the Census Bureau to try to develop better
ways to count the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, they had the idea to go to encampments,'' Profant
said. ``The idea that you identify a site and you count the people
there is unrealistic, because not everyone who is homeless is going
to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they had another problem. The people they hired had to go
to these spots at 2 in the morning and count people, which is very
frightening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was difficult to get workers to go into certain areas
at that hour, officials were unsure if they got an adequate count,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Profant also is concerned about the agency's decision not to
identify the homeless as such.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing is measuring poverty levels rather than
(individuals) as homeless,'' Profant said, adding she wants to see
as many homeless people counted as possible.
</P>
<P>
   LAHSA estimates there are 84,500 homeless in Los Angeles County
_ about the equivalent of the population of Whittier, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   LAHSA is working on a demonstration project to be unveiled in
January on other ways to count the homeless to make sure they are
included in the next national headcount.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials say they want to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mochulski, Census Bureau staff assistant and coordinator
for the program, said the agency has been working with service
providers such as shelters and soup kitchens to try to develop a
comprehensive program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might expect, the homeless are a key group that tends
to get missed in a census,'' Mochulski said. ``We are putting a lot
of thought into our planning and hope to use the homeless
themselves to help us. The key to getting a good count is to have
the homeless themselves and advocacy groups get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the bureau did a pilot program in Sacramento,
targeting outdoor locations, shelters and other programs used by
the homeless to make a sample count.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still evaluating that and hope it proves successful,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bureau not acknowledging the homeless, Mochulski said
effective categorization presents a difficult question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a policy question and deals with definitions,'' Mochulski
said. ``The homeless aren't just the people on the street or living
in cars. It's people doubling and tripling up because they can't
afford their own place or people living in substandard housing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other forms of housing that the bureau does recognize,
such as those who live on boats permanently or travel the country
in recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a separate marina unit, and we also check in at RV
campgrounds,'' Mochulski said. ``This survey is not only about
population, but about population and housing.'' &QL;

HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR FINDSWORDS TO THANK AMERICA

   ``When he stood up there at rehearsal and began singing the
words to `God Bless America' as he conducted, you could just see he
felt every note. They were coming from the heart, just like
(Irving) Berlin wrote them.'' _ Alvin Mills, conductor of the
Brentwood-Westwood Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His suit is pressed, his hair is freshly trimmed
and his nails have been immaculately manicured.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Festinger is ready. Now, all he can do is wait. Wait and
remember.
</P>
<P>
   So he sits in the living room of his suburban L.A.-area home
Friday afternoon, and he closes his eyes to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours from these moments, this 73-year-old
Hungarian immigrant who survived a Nazi concentration camp in World
War II will stand before a symphony orchestra in concert to say
``thank you'' to his country for the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   With absolutely no formal musical training but the feeling in
his heart, he will pick up a baton, look down into the faces of
more than 20 highly trained and skilled musicians, and conduct them
in Irving Berlin's ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   He will sing the words as he conducts because he must. He cannot
help himself, he says. They mean too much to him.
</P>
<P>
   And he will cry because he must do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   When you have been where he has been, and now find yourself
fulfilling a dream that kept death at bay when you were a scared
17-year-old in a concentration camp, you have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   You must sing. You must cry. And you must formally thank the
country that gave you a new life.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Irving Berlin himself did in composing and writing ``God
Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin could never have known it, but a young, frightened
Hungarian boy was singing his song every night before going to
sleep in a German concentration camp from 1942 to 1945, dreaming
one day of coming to America himself.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the boy had to make his other, more pressing dream
come true.
</P>
<P>
   Making it to 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me then, it seemed so very far away, 20,'' Festinger said
as he waited for the hours to pass until today. ``It was all I and
a lot of other boys taken to the labor camps dreamed of and prayed
for. Making it to our 20th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long and into the night, we repaired railroad tracks
bombed by the Allies, and carried steel slabs to the German workers
building train cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, before bed, we had our dreams. Mine was coming to
America, like Irving Berlin. As a child in Hungary, I used to
listen to American records and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the songs I loved the most was `God Bless America.' It
was like every word came from my heart, too. I could picture Berlin
coming into a new country that had invited him, embraced him, and
sitting down later to write this song from his heart to say thank
you.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: `PSYCHO' IS BACK, IN DYING COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a Hollywood studio, redoing a classic is always a risk. For
Universal Pictures, troubled by a recent series of flops, remaking
``Psycho'' was risky, and weird. After all, Gus Van Sant, the
versatile director of ``Good Will Hunting,'' has not merely remade
Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 thriller. He has replicated it shot for
shot, using the same script, the same mesmerizing score by Bernard
Herrmann and the same Saul Bass titles.
</P>
<P>
   The only significant difference besides casting is that the new
movie is in color rather than black and white.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a precedent to Van Sant's odd enterprise, it can be
found in a satiric story by Jorge Luis Borges, ``Pierre Menard,
Author of the Quixote.'' In it, an obscure novelist produces a
masterpiece consisting entirely of parts of the original ``Don
Quixote.'' Analyzing the new work, scholars find many improvements
over the 17th-century version, including subtle references to
Nietzsche, William James and biographical details from Menard's
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' is one of the most influential and carefully analyzed
movies ever made. Maybe Van Sant wants film buffs to have a
Borgesian field day with the remake. No doubt Universal wants the
movie to make money and mop up the red ink from ``Meet Joe Black,''
``Babe: Pig in the City'' and other recent box-office duds that led
to the ouster of the studio chairman last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the director's intent, the audience reaction today
cannot help but be different from that of 1960, in part because of
the movies since then that were influenced by ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   With its graphic depiction of sexual repression, perversion and
madness, the first ``Psycho'' effectively proclaimed the end of the
buttoned-up 1950s. But its scenes of violence are chaste by the
standards of the slasher movies, crazed killers and shock value of
today.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening Friday, I found the new version both off-putting
and seductive, like a new production of a familiar opera. The
dialogue, almost unaltered, seems dated, but the double-entendres
are funnier the second time around. Critics may dwell on the few
minor changes in the new version.
</P>
<P>
   But over all, the images remind you what a monumental film
achievement ``Psycho'' was. There are people, especially women, who
still get nervous alone in the shower thinking of naked and
vulnerable Janet Leigh, slashed to death in a 45-second scene of
horror that took Hitchcock seven days and 70 camera setups to film.
In 1960, he appealed to audiences not to spill the movie's secrets,
especially the female lead's murder halfway through the film.
People remember it the way they remember where they were when
President Kennedy was killed. Yet the new version features the
shower murder (with Anne Heche) in its own lurid ads. When she
undresses in that creepy motel, you wonder why she doesn't remember
the original movie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the shock of ``Psycho'' remains potent. More than the
acting, more than the story, more than the message, Hitchcock
maintained that ``Psycho'' stirred feelings of terror, surprise and
attraction by its camera work, technique and other elements of
``pure cinema,'' carefully preserved in the remake. A few years
after the movie, Hitchcock told French director Francois Truffaut
that ``Psycho'' was, more than his other movies, ``a film that
belongs to filmmakers, to you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Different fans remember different enduring images. For some, it
is the driving rain and slashing windshield-wiper blades that
foreshadow the first murder. Others will always be haunted by the
constant use of the double-image of mirrors, evoking the theme of
split personality, or the way the opening voyeuristic shot through
a hotel window prefigures Anthony Perkins spying on his prey, or
simply the way Hitchcock uses agile camera work to disguise the
mother's identity without making you suspicious of the trick he is
playing.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Van Sant realized he could not remake the movie
without preserving Hitchcock's mordantly elegant story-telling and
the haunting Herrmann music.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, nearly 40 years after the original, the
premises of the plot are more absurd than ever. The psychologizing
about Norman Bates' supposed psychosis seems forced and the clunky
police dialogue sounds like something out of ``Dragnet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental health professionals say that, more than any other film,
``Psycho'' stigmatized mental illness for Americans. Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., an advocate for the rights of the mentally
disabled, even wrote to Edgar Bronfman Jr., principal owner of the
studio, asking for the remake to include a preface noting the great
strides in treating the mentally ill since 1960. Universal turned
Domenici down flat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the remake shows the psychologizing to be more flawed
dramaturgically than scientifically. Just the same, if Hitchcock
were alive, he would be hoping that a new generation of viewers
would always think twice about getting into the shower in a lonely
motel room.

LOS ANGELES:   say thank you. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I wanted so much to be invited in and embraced by America,''
Festinger said. ``But first, I had to make it to 20.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what he was when his camp was liberated, and he
applied to come to this country as a refugee. He had to wait three
years to be invited in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived in New York, there were already so many
refugees in the city that the government was asking anyone with a
profession to speak up so they could be placed outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come from a family of dentists and knew how to work as a
dental technician by the time I was 14,'' he said. ``I was placed
in a job in Waterbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two nights a week, I went to the University of Connecticut to
learn English. Next door, there was an electronics class going on.
I fell in love with it, so two nights a week I took English, and
two nights electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1956, he had his own electronics repair shop in Waterbury
before moving to California in the 1970s to be near friends. He
opened Reseda Television Sales and Service, finally retiring in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   America had been good to him, Festinger knew. But what had he
done for America to say thank you?
</P>
<P>
   Berlin had written his patriotic song, but what could he _ Fred
Festinger, retired television repairman _ do?
</P>
<P>
   There had to be something, he thought this year, on the 50th
anniversary of being invited in and embraced by America.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Mills put down the telephone and pondered the request from
Los Angeles Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski's office. A man by the
name of Festinger, a Holocaust survivor, had written her office
requesting an opportunity to conduct ``God Bless America'' in front
of a full orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   It was a touching, poignant letter. Would Mills, the founder,
music director and conductor of the Brentwood-Westwood Symphony
Orchestra, consider the man's request for an upcoming performance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our program was already set, and I thought, maybe I could let
him conduct at one of our rehearsals,'' Mills said Friday. ``But, I
thought that wouldn't be right, so I put him on the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills quickly saw something in Festinger standing up there on
the conductor's podium at rehearsals that transcended training,
timing and musical experience.
</P>
<P>
   Something that went right to the heart of what Irving Berlin was
trying to tell this country when he wrote ``God Bless America'' in
1918.
</P>
<P>
   It was that special something that too many people born in this
country fail to fully understand or feel because they haven't been
where Berlin or Festinger came from _ countries where the living
was hard, brutal and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the people who have had hardships and get a little
decency in this country who appreciate it the most,'' Mills said.
``Berlin loved this country, just like Fred does. The words and
music come from their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   The program says he comes on today after Chopin's Piano Concerto
No. 2 in F Minor, Opus 21, and Haydn's Symphony No. 104 (London) in
D Major.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's ``God Bless America,'' it says. And in parenthesis _
``Fred Festinger, Holocaust survivor, conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   His suit is pressed, his hair is trimmed, his nails are
immaculately manicured.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Festinger is ready.

   BANGKOK, Thailand _ In a modest televised ceremony, several
hundred Khmer Rouge guerrillas surrendered to the Phnom Penh
government Saturday in what was presented as a final end to the
armed communist movement that tore Cambodia apart for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the last three top leaders at large _ targets of a possible

participate in the surrender. They are known to have moved back and
forth across the border with Thailand for years, and their
whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many fighters were involved Saturday. The
Cambodian general who accepted their surrender, Meas Sophea, said
about 500 fighters would be integrated into the government army.
Another official put the figure at under 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   It did not appear that these last rag-tag fighters would receive
the special deal offered to earlier, more powerful defecting
groups, which have been allowed to keep their territory, political
structure and military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender on Saturday would also allow the return of some
20,000 civilians who had been under Khmer Rouge control along the
northern border. Most of them are now refugees in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held negotiations at Preah Vihear temple yesterday,'' Meas
Sophea said, referring to a location on the Thai border. ``They
agreed to defect and join the government. It's the end of the Khmer
Rouge.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Khmer Rouge has been ending in stages since
mid-1996, when much of its Western command joined the government,
followed by other groups of defectors.
</P>
<P>
   Splits in the top leadership in early 1997 further weakened the
movement. Its founder, Pol Pot, was tried by his comrades and
sentenced to a life term of house arrest in the northern jungles.
He died last April.
</P>
<P>
   It was then only a matter of time before the surrender of the
last holdouts in a brutal 30-year-old revolutionary movement that
caused the deaths of more than 1 million people when it ruled
Cambodia from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts of the Khmer Rouge said it was possible that some
guerrillas remained at large, essentially as roving bandits, and
that some retainers may have stayed with the three top leaders. The
three are Ta Mok, the Khmer Rouge military leader; Khieu Samphan,
its political chief, and Nuon Chea, a top ideologue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't find them on Cambodian territory,'' Meas Sophea said.
``They must be somewhere along the border.'' He has previously said
the leaders had crossed into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a three-member team of international lawyers visited
Cambodia to assess evidence against Khmer Rouge leaders for a
possible trial. They are to present their findings to the United
Nations in January.
</P>
<P>
   Any trial would probably target only a small number of top
figures, perhaps 15 or 20. Political and diplomatic barriers to a
trial must yet be crossed, and there is also the problem of
capturing the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the three leaders who remained at large Saturday,
other leading figures are living in defector zones where it may be
impossible to seize them. These potentially include Ieng Sary, a
close aide and brother-in-law of Pol Pot, who led the first
defections and who is now based in the defector zone of Pailin,
though he spends much of his time in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's surrender was led by Khem Nuon, chief of staff for
the three fugitive leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask for permission from the royal government of Cambodia to
rejoin society and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces,'' Khem Nuon
said during the videotaped ceremony.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like the defectors who have preceded him _ and the participants
at Pol Pot's show trial a year ago _ he publicly denounced the men
he had served for years. ``We have stopped believing the deception
of leaders Nuon Chea, Ta Mok and Khieu Samphan, who are
criminals,'' he said. ``From now on we will follow the government's
platform and respect the orders of the government armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be somewhat easier to do than in the past. At the end
of last month, Cambodia finally formed a new government that for
the moment at least is speaking with one voice, under the
leadership of Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   The former government was an acrimonious coalition under Hun Sen
and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, that competed for the
support of Khmer Rouge defectors. This competition was one factor
in a coup in July 1997 in which Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   For months afterward, some royalist soldiers held out against
Hun Sen's troops in a northern stronghold where they formed a
tactical alliance with Khmer Rouge holdouts. The surrender and
reintegration of these royalist soldiers was also announced last
week.

 &HT;    Florida's anti-smoking ad passes cool test
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As the lights came up last October at a
St. Paul showing of ``Cinema,'' a two-minute trailer for a thriller
about a killer epidemic that wipes out a population the size of
Manhattan, the audience jumped to their feet, applauding wildly.
</P>
<P>
   The subversive plot, the sinister politicians, the conspiring
business executives. Very slick, very Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, what's that at the end? Tobacco? Truth?
</P>
<P>
   Florida's $25 million-a-year ad campaign targeting teens and
attacking smoking had struck again. The commercials, with an MTV
edge wrapped around some very dark humor, are so slick they're hard
to recognize as public service ads. The thousand attendees at the
4th annual National Conference on Tobacco and Health in St. Paul
loved it: what a far cry from the 1970s finger-wagging spots of the
American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told me that happened in a theater, they started
clapping,'' said Peter Mitchell, marketing director of the Florida
Tobacco Pilot Program, the anti-smoking measure hammered out of the
state's $12.7 billion tobacco settlement. ``They say `I thought it
was a movie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months into the campaign, with another spot to be unveiled
next month during Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami, sponsors say the
program is working.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released this week shows the number of teen smokers who
now think smoking doesn't necessarily mean a person is cool _
teen-speak for smart _ rose from 57 percent to 68 percent. And of
the 1,867 teens surveyed, 9 out of 10 recognized the state's Truth
campaign that began airing on television in April and in theaters
in October with the ``Cinema'' spot.
</P>
<P>
   A more conclusive survey will be done in February and include
22,000 teens. The results should be ready in March.
</P>
<P>
   These results come the same day Phillip Morris Inc. _ the
nation's biggest tobacco company _ unveiled its TV campaign, part
of a $100 million program to reduce youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed suspiciously by anti-smoking groups, the cigarette-maker
decided to launch an attack early this year because, ``as a major
manufacturer of an adult product it is the responsible thing for us
to do,'' said Ellen Merlo, senior vice president of corporate
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this for one reason: We, like others in society,
realize youth smoking is an issue that needs to be dealt with and
our goal in investing this amount of money is to see a reduction in
youth smoking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to continue spending $100 million a year ``as
long as youth smoking is a problem, or an issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argue the company is hoping only to improve its
image. In his class-action lawsuit on behalf of Florida smokers,
Stanley Rosenblatt argued this week the industry is trying to argue
its case out of court. Phillip Morris is one of eight defendants in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Truth ads, the tobacco commercials take a direct _ and
some would say lame _ approach, showing teens talking to one
another about smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to smoke to be different. Being ourselves is
enough,'' a boy says in one ad. Says a girl in another: ``I don't
need to smoke to prove myself. My coolness is not on trial here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell groans at hearing this dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could easily create a campaign that sells more cigarettes
to teenagers even though the campaign doesn't say that directly and
that is a big worry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Merlo said Phillip Morris interviewed 6,800 kids between 10
and 14 in malls across the country and determined that a positive
reinforcement approach worked. They also looked at teen programs in
California and Massachusetts in crafting their ads that depict kids
in a stairwell, at a school and getting on a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more un-cool than a school bus?'' asked Jared Perez,
the 18-year-old marketing director for the student arm of the
state's program. ``The whole aim is not to preach, not to lecture
and never to tell anyone what to do. That's why none of ours say
don't smoke because that has the opposite effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In three Florida spots, teens sit around making crank calls to
movie producers and cigarette makers. In another, a spoof on the
Brady Bunch that began airing in July, the classic opening is
replaced by a Mr. and Mrs. Brady inhaling deeply and exhaling
heartily into the boxes containing their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The angle seems to be rather than criticize rebellion and
other sorts of motives that might support smoking, it's to take
advantage of those impulses,'' said Michael Weigold, a psychology
professor at the University of Florida who studies advertizing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the ads work is still hard to tell, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things about the campaign that are potentially
promising. First, they're trying something new, they're not being
preachy and taking advantage of rebellious impulses that contribute
to smoking. Secondly, we're talking about money backing a campaign
that we haven't seen since the required counter advertisements back
in the 1960s and 1970s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds encouraging, but it's worth keeping in mind there
are lots of things teenagers judge as un-cool or express negative
attitudes about, but they do them anyway: drinking to intoxication,
use of drugs, drinking and driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida is one of four states, including California,
Massachusetts and Arizona, with anti-smoking programs. However,
nationally public health lobbyists are hoping to use part of the
national $206 billion settlement for similar programs, said Joel
Spivak, spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone was doing what Florida is doing,'' he said, ``we
could make a serious dent in the dreaded weed.''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Hans Gieskes, the Dutch-born president and chief
executive of Lexis-Nexis, is like the captain who tells his crew
not to worry because waves are breaking over the bow.
</P>
<P>
   Gieskes (pronounced GEES-kes) became head of the Miami
Twp.-based broker of legal and business information and news last
December. Since then, the electronic publishing industry has grown
even more competitive and less predictable. Lexis-Nexis, its
competitors and their parent companies are in a shake-out period
that will likely lead to more consolidation and turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But Lexis-Nexis is fortunate in that it has a well-heeled parent
willing to invest millions in it. Reed Elsevier plc, an Anglo-Dutch
publishing giant, bought Lexis-Nexis from Mead Corp. in late 1994
for $1.5 billion. Since then, Reed Elsevier has invested heavily in
the company to improve its products and services. Perhaps the most
significant investment to date is Reed Elsevier's purchase of
Matthew Bender &AMP; Co., the country's leading publisher of analytical
legal information, and Shepard's Co., the leading U.S. legal
citation publisher. The acquisitions dramatically boosted the Lexis
side of the business, which still accounts for about 60 percent of
the company's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But such large investments, coupled with increased competition,
have impacted Reed Elsevier's earnings. Last week, Reed Elsevier
warned investors that its full-year pretax profit will fall 6
percent because of lower demand for its publishing products and the
weakening worldwide economy. Reed Elsevier also said stronger
competition for online legal and business information in the United
States is cutting revenue growth at Lexis-Nexis.
</P>
<P>
   The news further dampened Reed Elsevier's stock prices. Shares
in Reed International Plc have fallen 29 percent this year, while
Elsevier NV shares have fallen 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety has spread to Lexis-Nexis headquarters as well.
Rumors of pending job cuts and restructurings circulate daily among
the company's 2,400 local employees.
</P>
<P>
   But in a wide-ranging interview last week, Gieskes dismissed
those rumors and said Lexis-Nexis remains profitable, competitive
and strong. He also said he is enjoying steering Lexis-Nexis at a
critical point in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the highlights of the interview:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you expect and what did you actually find when you
became president and chief executive of Lexis-Nexis?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are always surprises, good and bad. Otherwise, life
would be very boring. But on balance, I'm very happy with what I
found. We have gone through terrific change. The Matthew Bender
acquisition, the consolidation within the industry and changes in
technology here have been tremendous. But we have positioned
ourselves well for the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lexis-Nexis is more than a company based in Dayton, Ohio.
We now talk about the Lexis-Nexis Group, a third of which only is
Dayton-based. That means we have more of a group culture arising
here and it's no longer the Dayton culture or the Dayton business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a major culture change occurring here?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The company is changing culture because it's no longer
the only company we have. The influence of our non-Dayton-based
businesses is strong and our outlook is changing. I think the
company has opened up and realized there's a big market out there
(that we must pursue). And we will continue to change.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of changes are you talking about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way we have embraced the browser-based customer
interface, and the way we will move forward in a very focused way,
compared to the way in the past, where we moved in many different
ways, is a big change in our culture. The decentralization that we
started four to five years ago has been very successful in
improving productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you responding faster to the market these days? The
complaint against Lexis-Nexis has been that it moves too slow to
market forces.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we are moving faster. The way our industry is moving,
you want to be much faster to market than ever before, but you want
retain all the good things of the original model. And if you have a
huge customer base, you have a built-in hesitation to launch things
too quickly. But we certainly move much faster, and that's because
of the way we have empowered (people) throughout the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What other accomplishments or goals have you reached so far
during your tenure?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Matthew Bender acquisition was very important,
particularly from a legal market position. But the entire company
is growing and very successful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you meeting your numbers and projections?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh yes. Within Reed Elsevier, we are a highly appreciated
company. The way we are leveraging the Lexis-Nexis know-how and
infrastructure for the rest of (Reed Elsevier) is very important.
This is a core business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are revenues still roughly split 60 percent from Lexis and 40
percent from Nexis?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. But what's interesting is that lawyers are increasingly
using non-legal information, which is why marriage of Lexis and
Nexis is so strong. Lawyers need information from a very broad
spectrum these days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the Nexis (news) side of the business one day surpass
the Lexis (legal) side of the business?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. I don't think so. But Nexis is a very important part of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has the volatility in the on-line industry affected
morale here?
</P>
<P>
   A: Anybody working in a large corporation in this day and age is
affected by global competition and should have some anxiety as to
what could be around the next corner. I would be worried if people
were more complacent. We all should be focused on what's happening
in the world market. If that causes some anxiety, then I think
that's probably not a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Any anxiety is par for the course for any large organization. We
need people who are able to cope with change, create change and
manage change. That's a very important function. It's very
important that we reward those who instigate and manage change.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think the recent rumors about Microsoft (buying
Lexis-Nexis), the failed ($8.8 billion) merger with Wolters-Kluwer
(by Reed Elsevier) and shaky stock prices are contributing to this
anxiety among employees.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. But people here are much more focused on the
stock market than they are in Europe. And if you work for a U.S.
subsidiary of a global organization, and there are changes at the
high executive level, it's bound to affect anybody. People will
worry about things they shouldn't worry about, and when you tell
them not to worry, they will worry even more. These things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give a progress report on the search for a new chief
executive of Reed Elsevier?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I can't because all I know about that is what appears in
the press. But I can certainly understand why some people are
concerned about that. People in this country have an obsession with
leaders. I don't think it's necessarily a good thing, but I
understand it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What makes a good leader?
</P>
<P>
   A: Results. Results and respect, and respect is something you
earn. When you are a leader or a manager, you have to add value
every day. You should not take anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can we expect from Lexis-Nexis in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot. We will continue to battle for leadership of the
various markets around the world as the competition heats up. We
also will make investments in product development and continue to
re-engineer our processes in such a way that, in a changing market
place, we can be as effective a leader as we have been in the past.

 &HT;    `Psycho' rehash misses the point
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The best argument I've heard against Gus Van
Sant's shot-for-shot copy of ``Psycho'' is that with all the
talent, sweat and money required to make the whimsical indulgence,
something fresh and startling could have been made. Something we
might actually need.
</P>
<P>
   I just saw another great argument against it: The movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Van Sant's jazzed-up color replica is awful, per se. It
is after all a near-clone of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic _ a
creepy, brilliantly crafted thriller that works today partially
because it's 38 years old. Appreciating the original necessarily
involves placing it in the context of its age, the same way
``Citizen Kane'' dazzles because it was shot in 1941. The new
``Psycho,'' I'm afraid, is fantastically pointless and a scandalous
waste of resources.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant (``Good Will Hunting'') ratchets up the violence a bit,
gives us some postmodern nudity (read: shapely buttocks) and
splices several hallucinogenic images into the original's two most
famous scream scenes. He's updated Joseph Stefano's script with
contemporary strokes, such as Julianne Moore's trusty Walkman and
Norman Bates' masturbation habits.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the exact plot, speaking lines and shot lengths and
set-ups, Van Sant has also retained Bernard Herrmann's
claws-on-blackboard score (with miniscule tweaking by Danny Elfman)
and Saul Bass' zippy title design.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock could have shot in color if he wanted, but like the
noir masters, black-and-white was a key aesthetic decision. The
pregnant shadows and gloomy textures are rinsed away (in the shower
scene literally) by the contemporary palette of pinks and oranges
and blues, diminishing the subliminal effects of what was a
methodical psychological thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant misses the point (no pun intended) when he luxuriates
on Anne Heche's blood as it smears across the white shower tile.
And for all his talk about shot-by-shot fidelity to Hitchcock, Van
Sant decides to get creative in precisely this most cherished of
terror scenes. I don't recall a shot of rolling thunder clouds in
the original shower scene's crackling montage. Nor for that matter
do I remember quick shots of a naked woman and a cow during the
scene when shriveled Mrs. Bates spins around in her chair, flashing
that big skeleton grin.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of symbolic sorcery Van Sant tossed around in
``My Own Private Idaho.'' But here it comes off as gratuitous, even
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Vaughn acquits himself OK as Norman, but he doesn't have
Anthony Perkins' twitchy, inward-looking carriage that made Norman
such an oozing creep. What Vaughn and the other actors (including
William H. Macy as Detective Arbogast) demonstrate, though, is a
warmer, less wooden acting style that often makes old movies seem
so stagy.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Psycho'' is a passive audience experience, not so much
because many of us are well-acquainted with the original, but
because it's a lot like watching a film student's clever
experiment. You sit there, nod lightly, and say, ``Uh-huuuh.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't buy Van Sant's strenuous apologias for remaking
``Psycho.'' As Norman says, ``We all go a little mad sometimes.''

 &HT;    Cabbie hails writing fellowship at Paisano Ranch
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The story wouldn't work as serious fiction,
because it is too hard to believe. Maybe a contemporary Capra could
make something of it, a fable in the '90s vein of ``It's a
Wonderful Life.'' It begins last January, with a cabbie and a
stranger, a passenger who asked to be driven to the Texas Center
for Writers. The cabbie was an aspiring writer of short stories,
and though he wasn't in the habit of chatting up his customers, he
asked the passenger his name.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger hesitated, then told the driver that he was Denis
Johnson. The cabbie not only recognized the name of the visiting
author at the University of Texas that semester, he was familiar
with his work (which includes the ``Jesus' Son'' collection of
stories and the novel ``Already Gone''), and proceeded to praise
one recently anthologized story in particular.
</P>
<P>
   After bidding each other farewell and good luck, the cabbie took
heart from the chance encounter. He had recently read about the
deadline looming for the Dobie Paisano Fellowship, which includes a
six-month residency at J. Frank Dobie's former Hill Country ranch
and a stipend of $1,200 per month. For a guy who had been spending
a couple of years working seven-day, 70-hour weeks _ driving
everywhere and getting nowhere _ the opportunity to do nothing but
write sounded like an impossible dream.
</P>
<P>
   So impossible, in fact, that he hadn't planned on entering.
Feeling borderline tubercular from months of overwork, he'd lacked
the energy to pull a submissions packet together, until he
interpreted the encounter with Johnson as a sign. This was the life
he wanted, a literary life of self-sufficiency. Recognizing that
his chances were slim, he sent his stuff off. A few days later, he
suffered congestive heart failure, which put him into the hospital
with fears that he might die. A couple of months later, he was
announced as the fall's fellowship recipient. Instead of working so
hard that he couldn't write, he would be paid to write so he
wouldn't have to work. (He also heard that Johnson had left him a
book, after hearing of the cabbie's good fortune).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really lucky to be out here,'' said the 40-year-old Lowell
Mick White, a man of rumpled dress, ruddy complexion and
plain-spoken understatement. ``I'd been living in teeth-grinding
poverty the last couple of years, so I feel pretty lucky just to
have a roof over my head. I wanted a place where I could
concentrate on my work.''
</P>
<P>
   What he discovered is a place where a writer can lose himself in
his work, a 254-acre spread of limestone bluffs and native grasses,
where the main intrusions on one's solitude come from the wild
turkeys who roam the property and the occasional roadrunner (the
``paisano'' that Dobie honored with the ranch's name and adopted as
his personal symbol). Just 14 miles southwest of Austin, it might
as well be the other side of the moon, for the world of difference
it has made in White's daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Dobie-Paisano recipients experience a similarly
dramatic transformation, but the fellowship frequently has provided
a pivotal experience. According to A.C. Greene, a Dobie fellow from
the spring of '68, Paisano Ranch is ``a place where the creative
process can reinvest itself. . . where the artist can return to the
earth, and thus better enable himself to pour out his art for the
world to use.'' It is a place, he writes, of ``seeding and
reseeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Cisneros, fellowship recipient in the fall of '85,
subsequently wrote that ``Dobie Paisano is what altered my
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Paisano's past and promise
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Paisano Fellows regard their time at the ranch as one of
the great experiences of their writing lives,'' writes Don Graham,
president of the Texas Institute of Letters, and chairman of next
year's judging committee, in a letter to prospective applicants.
``The place is part of a powerful tradition, a link with Texas's
past and a promise of its future.''
</P>
<P>
   To be selected is to be enveloped within the inspiration of that
tradition, to live amid Dobie's desk and his books, his walking
sticks and his fireplace; to explore the acres of wilderness and to
scan the starry sky, so deep in the heart of Texas. To be selected
is to have one's work validated, to give it the stamp of
``Dobie-Paisano Fellow'' that sets it apart from the slush-pile
submissions of all the other aspiring writers. To be selected is to
be given the gift that is most precious to a writer: time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to have time is the most valuable of all,''
said Audrey Slate, who administers the program for the University
of Texas (in conjunction with the Texas Institute of Letters), and
who generally receives between 75 and 100 applications a year for
the two fellowships awarded. ``There are no obligations on the
fellow. They don't have to produce or lecture. They are mainly just
given the chance to live out there.''
</P>
<P>
   (Entries for 1999 fellowships must be postmarked before Jan. 22.
Application forms and instructions are available by writing Dr.
Audrey Slate, Dobie Paisano Project, J. Frank Dobie House, 702 E.
Dean Keeton St., Austin, TX 78705.)
</P>
<P>
   At least in theory, a writer who is out there doesn't even need
to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a great disappointment, because they have
projected what they will do (as part of the application),'' said
Slate. ``Sometimes people change their minds, but almost all of the
fellows have produced something.''
</P>
<P>
   With a half-dozen or so stories previously published (from
literary journals to Gray's Sporting Journal) _ and with 30 more
that he has sent out for consideration _ White is using his time at
Paisano to pull together a short-story collection. He also hopes to
finish the first draft of a novel before he leaves the ranch at the
end of February. Stories of the outdoors ``I just like to write
stories,'' says White, who describes his style as ``direct
narrative'' and lists Jim Harrison and Thomas McGuane as two of his
favorites. ``A lot of my stories revolve around the outdoors.
They're not fly-fishing stories, but there's fly fishing going on
in them. The story I'm working on now is about two guys going
squirrel hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing an appropriately natural spur for White's muse,
Paisano was Dobie's weekend retreat for the final five years of his
life. After his death in 1964, it was decided that preserving the
Hill Country expanse as a writer's sanctuary would be a fitting
memorial for the storyteller and humorist and educator, revered as
Austin's patron saint of literary Texana.
</P>
<P>
   With the enthusiastic support of Bertha McKee Dobie, his widow,
and many of his close friends, a fund-raising campaign raised the
money to purchase the property from the Dobie estate and to deed it
to UT. In May of 1966, an auction of donated paintings at a gala
dinner in Houston raised almost $40,000, more than half the
purchase price. In August, the property was established as a
``permanent memorial'' to Dobie, to be preserved in its ``more or
less natural state,'' its house ``kept in a simple style, very much
as it was when Frank Dobie occupied it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, UT has maintained the property while the Texas
Institute of Letters provides the fellowship's stipend. A judging
panel of six _ three chosen by UT, three by the institute _
determines the two recipients per year, either native Texans, those
who have lived here at least two years or have published work
concerning Texas. (In March, White will give way to Amy Adams, a
screenwriter and essayist.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Though idyllic in many respects, there are times and seasons
when the rural facts of (the ranch's) isolation can present
problems to the unwary,'' Graham warns prospective applicants.
``Rain can flood the creek, making the low-water crossing
impassable for days at a time. Rattlesnakes have been seen in the
vicinity, quite near the house; fire ants are a possible nuisance;
skunks and raccoons and deer live in the fields nearby. The point
is not to frighten anyone but simply to state that this is the
country, not the town.''
</P>
<P>
   When so much of the Hill Country flooded this fall, White was
``down to eating oatmeal and dirt'' after two weeks of confinement
to the property. Though the road winding through the ranch to
Dobie's house had been dry upon White's arrival in September, by
the following month it was submerged beneath the raging river that
Barton Creek had become, some 150 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay, White also has needed to call UT to deal with
an increasingly pesky population of mice. His girlfriend proved
resistant to the ranch's rural splendors; she broke up with him, he
says, because she couldn't take the hassle of opening and closing
the two gates with their combination locks that keep intruders from
the property. Paisano isn't a place to be pampered; it's more of a
loner's paradise, an isolated retreat where even the Austin Zoo a
few miles up the road seems like a civilization's remove. And the
routine of an Austin cabbie seems like another lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of urban Texas
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the cab stuff is going to come out in my writing as I
go along,'' said White, who came to Austin from his native West
Virginia in the late '70s to study journalism at UT. ``It's
amazing, until I started driving a cab, I didn't know Austin at
all. I'd been living here for 18 years, and I didn't know where
Highland Mall was. Driving a cab can be pretty rough. People sneer
at you a lot, spit at you, throw things at the cab. You're just
available, especially for drunks. I've definitely enjoyed not
having the pressure of making money every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he tries to write 750 words a day. And he has read Tom
Wolfe's ``A Man in Full.'' Twice in one week. All 742 pages of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many Texas writers look back to sort of a rural past, but
Texas has been an urban state for 50 years,'' he said. ``It's
increasingly urban all the time. You stand out here at night, and
you can see the whole sky lit up with pollution from Austin. Even
here, you're not that isolated. Texas today has more in common with
Tom Wolfe than it does with Larry McMurtry's `Lonesome Dove.' ''

 &HT;    GI Dough: Vet has currency from here to eternity
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Bob Cowan isn't the type who gets teary-eyed
about Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was there 57 years ago today, a young frightened Army
sergeant from New York in charge of anti-aircraft guns on Waikiki
beach. But ask Cowan about his stint in the Pacific and he's more
likely to show off his favorite war memorabilia, gathered in
nightclubs while on leave with other soldiers and sailors.
</P>
<P>
   They played a game of sorts back then, in clubs like the Royal
Hawaiian, the Moana Hotel and later on the Marshall and Gilbert
Islands. Fighting men would sign and trade currency from other
nations, collecting unusual bills as they traveled the globe.
</P>
<P>
   They even had a snappy, 1940s-style name, ``the Short-Snorters
Club,'' though Cowan never did figure out what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   It worked like this: If you met another GI, Marine or sailor in
a bar, you'd ask, ``Hey buddy, are you a member of the
Short-Snorters Club?'' Then they would have to produce a type of
money you didn't already have _ say, an Italian Lire or
military-issued Hawaiian dollar _ sign it and hand it over. The
trading went on from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talked to each other more back then,'' Cowan said. ``It
wasn't the value of the money, it was the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   By war's end, Cowan had a yards-long strip of currency taped
end-to-end _ signed by some of the day's most notable and unlikely
soldiers: actor Clark Gable and band leaders Artie Shaw and Claude
Thornhill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, the chances of meeting celebrities were
extra slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that easy to get out on leave, believe me,'' Cowan
said. ``Most of the time, I kept this rolled up in my foot
locker.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cowan's collection of 37 yellowing bills includes money
printed in Canada, Nazi Germany, France, Nicaragua. There's even
one from wartime Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   All are signed in black or blue ink in tidy handwriting by
people Cowan never saw again. He can only guess what became of some
of those men, as thousands fought and died in the bloodiest battles
of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Now a retired insurance executive living in Jupiter, Cowan isn't
sure he can part with his collection of money and autographs.
Christie's auction house in New York recently showed some interest
in selling it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People collect things like that,'' Cowan said, unrolling and
re-rolling the money. ``I really never thought about that before.''

 &HT;    Method to Van Sant's madness works in new `Psycho'
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``We all go a little mad sometimes,'' Norman
Bates says to Marion Crane over a plate of sandwiches and milk.
``Haven't you ever gone a little mad?''
</P>
<P>
   Gus Van Sant's sanity has been similarly called into question in
recent months over his controversial, shot-by-shot ``re-creation''
of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho.'' The Academy Award-nominated
director of ``Good Will Hunting'' has restaged the 1960 suspense
classic with a new cast and in color, using Joseph Stefano's
original screenplay, Hitchcock's storyboards and Bernard Herrmann's
indelible score.
</P>
<P>
   The audacious concept is as perilous as playing with knives. Yet
Van Sant emerges from the Bates Motel remarkably unscathed _ unlike
the less-fortunate Miss Crane.
</P>
<P>
   With a few notable exceptions _ such as the $40,000 Marion
steals from her employer being adjusted for inflation to $400,000 _
Van Sant's update of Hitchcock's most notorious thriller remains
true to the original. The Saul Bass-designed title sequence now has
green and black horizontal stripes, rather than black-and-white,
but it still leads to an opening helicopter shot of Phoenix, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the rare instances where Van Sant has improved on the
original, his camera zooms continuously from the city skyline
through a hotel window to a couple in bed. Because of the
technological limitations of the time, Hitchcock had to cut the
planned sequence into two shots.
</P>
<P>
   However, the characters, dialogue, blocking and camera angles
all remain the same. So does ``Psycho'' 's rhythm, smartly
maintaining the tension and suspense of the original, even for
those who know where the story is going.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the ``Scream'' generation has little interest in
watching black-and-white movies, and a digitally restored
re-release of Hitchcock's version would probably only appeal to
older fans and films buffs. But by casting such hot young stars as
Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche, and shooting the film in color with a
Dolby digital soundtrack, Van Sant is introducing the film to a new
audience.
</P>
<P>
   And by taking the unprecedented literal approach, he doesn't
hack it up by needlessly changing things around, as Andrew Davis
did earlier this year with ``A Perfect Murder,'' a glossy
bastardization of Hitchcock's ``Dial M for Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense one gets from watching Van Sant's ``Psycho'' is that
of a solid repertory company restaging a familiar production, as
happens in the theater with everything from Shakespeare to
``Brigadoon.'' Musicians also record and perform note-for-note
reproductions of one another's works. It's just novel for the
relatively new medium of film.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cast, which also includes Julianne Moore, Viggo
Mortensen and William H. Macy, has previously worked together in
such films as ``Return to Paradise,'' ``The Lost World'' and
``Boogie Nights,'' lending to the repertory feel.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is much more physically imposing as Bates than the
bird-like Anthony Perkins, obscuring some of Hitchcock's symbolism,
while Heche lacks the sensuality of Janet Leigh's Crane. But both
bring their own frame of reference to the roles. Vaughn is
tremendously creepy, particularly after the film's focus shifts
from Crane to Bates and his invalid mother.
</P>
<P>
   The original's flaws _ a slow opening and 5-minute monologue
finale _ also survive intact. Van Sant's alterations largely
involve making Norman's attraction to Marion more overtly sexual,
and making the legendary shower scene more bloody. Subtlety and
restraint were the keys to Hitchcock's landmark film, but viewers
today have a much higher threshold for sex and violence. Clearly,
there was a method to Van Sant's madness.

completely destroyed contribution limits and created a new
political environment where ``anything goes.'' Some analysts
believe there is some good news here. Unregulated third-party
advertising, the concern of the 1996 elections, has been replaced
by the parties, allowing the parties to reclaim some of their lost
influence in the political process and offering better
accountability to voters. Others such as Sen. Russ Feingold
(D-Wis.) argue that the need for reform has never been greater.

   She started at age 10. She is 35 now. Other addictions have come
and gone _ alcohol, crack, and a cocaine and Dilaudid brew via her
veins. But ``the tol,'' slang for toluene, a potent chemical in
paint thinner, remains with her always. After alcohol, inhalant
abuse or ``huffing'' solvents, gasoline, correction fluid, aerosol
sprays, refrigerants or other chemicals is the addiction of choice
in Tract 19, say police, preachers and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   About 21.6 percent of households reported that dealing with
alcohol and/or drug abuse was the major family problem, according
to the private study commissioned by St. Paul United Methodist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   The addiction has managed to survive competition from pricier
urban drugs, said Dayton Police Officer Mitchell Olmsted, who
conducts community-based patrols in the First District.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love silver and gold spray paint; it's easily
available,'' said Olmsted. ``I've been in places where you can just
tell there's flammable odor.'' Abusing harmful intoxicants is a
fourth degree misdemeanor punishable by fine. So far this year,
there have been only six arrests in Dayton. Police say they are
focused on more serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Huffing can cause violent behavior, hallucinations, convulsions,
drowsiness, unconsciousness, even cardiac arrest and suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   When suburban teen-agers die suddenly from huffing, it makes
headlines. But the slow deaths of lifetime huffers in Tract 19 go
unreported.
</P>
<P>
   Along East Fourth Street and Huffman Avenue, Denise Thomason is
infamous for her addiction and embarrassing arrests for assault and
public-drunkenness. She points to others on ``the tol,'' pronounced
``toil,'' walking through the alley like ghosts, present but not
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tol'' is why Thomason's hand shook as she held a glass of
milk to her lips on a recent afternoon. It's why she has not worked
in years. It's why she receives food stamps. It's why she is
scraping to get $365 to pay last month's rent and $365 more for
this month's. It's why she is among the 48 percent in Tract 19 who
are not in the labor force. It's why she is applying for
Supplemental Security Income benefits for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not stable,'' she says, repeating language a social
worker used to describe her situation. ``I get where I can't
remember things. It deteriorates my system so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an everyday habit. It seems weird not being high
because I've been on it for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, her stomach knots into cramps, she perspires like mist is
falling all the time, her head pounds.
</P>
<P>
   She has tried to quit and currently is attending a rehab
program.
</P>
<P>
   In the meal hall kitchen at St. Paul United Methodist Church,
Thomason talks about her life with slurred speech. Her head hangs
down and stringy blonde hair falls over a limp smile and eyes that
are blank but bright. Like a rag doll, her crossed leg dangles, her
white tennis shoe flops against the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't raise none of them,'' she says of the six daughters,
ages 20 to 11, whom Child Protective Services took away, gave back,
then took away permanently. They have four different fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Two daughters live on their own across town. One lives in
Illinois with a grandparent. ``My 15-year-old, they just sent her
to Texas to relatives. I'll never be able to get her back.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomason doesn't want the 11- and 12-year-olds back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like them to be around me too much because it's got
that really bad odor. It's all I can do to take care of me. I don't
want to go see them and get their hopes up and then not show up for
months and months. So I just keep my distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been through it for 19 years. I try not to think about it
because if I do, that sets me off, depresses me. I get a lot of
guilt and shame from everything I put them through.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know what kind of mother she might have been. But
she says she wouldn't cuss and carry on or call her children ``good
for nothing,'' the way she says her own mother raised her, two
brothers and a sister. About year ago Thomason learned that she had
contracted hepatitis C, an inflammation of the liver common among
drug abusers. ``If it kills me. . .'' she says, her voice fading.
``If it kills me. . .''
</P>
<P>
   She rests her head on the table, dozing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired. I don't get involved with people outside of here
and what they think.''
</P>
<P>
   If somebody called her ``poor white trash,'' she probably
wouldn't put up much of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastor David Beach of St. Paul's would fight for her. He is
encouraged to see her at the church nearly every day, putting in
required hours to receive $125 month in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I need to talk, I can go right in there to Pastor
Dave,'' Thomason says.
</P>
<P>
   And Pastor Dave will tell her once again that she is afraid of
``God's great overwhelming love.'' And he will tell her again that
when she banishes that fear, she will breath in God's love and be
set free from ``the tol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a mind of my own. Nobody forces me to do this,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   That limp, snaggle-toothed smile begins to seep over her face,
and she holds her head up, just for a minute.

 &HT;    Cloudy future looms for poverty-stricken whites in Ohio's Tract
19
 &HT;    WITH TRACT19-DRUG-HUFF, TRACT19-TEENS
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On Tuesdays at St. Paul United Methodist Church,
the listless figures move steadily through the free lunch line
toward a plate of salty beef, noodles and a sweet paper cup of
Kool-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Wilma Jean Griffieth gently guides her 33-year-old mentally
disabled daughter by the elbow. It's the end of the month. The
$1,200 from their two government checks has run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's getting near the end of the month, if I couldn't
come here I don't know where I'd go,'' says Griffieth, her lungs
wheezing on this windy, rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   On another Tuesday, Dona Baker, who danced some nights to buy
Cheerios, milk and McDonald's for her two children while her
husband was out of work, pushes the kids forward. She cautions them
not to be slow pokes. ``These people are hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Watts, a burly man who says he is an out-of-work
pipefitter, is among the procession from the church pantry carrying
bags of groceries and sacks of bread. They file past St. Paul
Pastor David Beach. He nods at each grim face as if bestowing a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like coming here,'' says Watts, 36, and the
father of three grade-schoolers. ``I don't like charity. I was
raised that a man got out and supported his family. Right now I'm
just down on my luck.''
</P>
<P>
   At folding tables, about 150 people dine as Jesus Christ looks
down from a portrait in the center of the meal hall, his arms
reaching out. Beneath the portrait are loaves and loaves of
days-old bread _ sweet rolls, onion rolls, doughnuts, muffins.
</P>
<P>
   The diners are some of the poorest white people in Montgomery
County. They are the citizens of Census Tract 19 in southeastern
Dayton: population 6,000, about 97 percent white; per capita
income, $6,979, nearly a third of the per capita income for the
county ($17,748) and less than half the state ($16,644), according
to the most recent U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
   They are, sociologists say, a peculiar minority, a large
concentration of poor non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, non-Hispanic whites made up 76 percent of the U.S.
population, but were only 23 percent of the population in poor
neighborhoods, according to a Census-based study by the Center for
Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   National media and advocates for the poor often draw attention
to minorities who are poor. And this fall, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
drew attention to the condition of poor whites in rural Appalachia.
He marched, preached and called on Wall Street. But the plight of
poor inner-city whites, many of whom migrated from Appalachia to
urban areas like Tract 19, remains silent and out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   WhiIe many Americans ride a wave of prosperity, the residents of
Tract 19 are stranded by discrimination, a lack of grass-roots
leadership, alcohol and drug abuse, dependence on public assistance
and an economic shift that has left low-skilled white workers
scraping to earn a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from an industrial- to a service-based economy has
left many young, unskilled white males working low-wage fast-food
and convenience store jobs. Between 1973 and 1991, the number of
white workers earning a wage too low to lift a family out of
poverty rose from 20 percent to 28.1 percent. For blacks, the
figure is closer to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a number of trends in the economy that have
hurt low-wage workers, the decline in unions, decline in real value
of minimum wage,'' said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy
Institute in Washington, D.C. ``Those trends have
disproportionately affected minority workers. However, those trends
also hurt low-wage whites. And poverty among blacks is down, while
it is increasing for whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Education levels remain low among many poor whites. In Tract 19,
about 54 percent of residents are high-school dropouts, according
to one study.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an uncertain future, in which marriage and family
do not appear to be viable options.
</P>
<P>
   Substance abuse, teen-age pregnancy and other social ills are
rampant in Tract 19, police and health department officials say.
``Huffing,'' or inhaling aerosol propellants or other chemicals
such as paint thinner, is a preferred addiction.
</P>
<P>
   About 48.5 percent of Tract 19's residents are not in the labor
force, according to a 1997 survey. That figure suggests that a
large percent are disabled in some way and receive welfare, Social
Security, SupplementaI Security Income or some other form of public
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when people are on welfare there is a complacency _
my father did it, my mother did it. `It's good enough for them,
it's good enough for me,' '' said Dean Vickers of the Southeast
Priority Board, which serves Tract 19.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike poor blacks who link poverty to racial discrimination,
whites tend not to politicize and protest their poverty. While West
Dayton has produced grass-roots leaders such as Annie Bonapart, few
have emerged on the east side.
</P>
<P>
   From his humble pulpit at St. Paul, in the heart of Tract 19,
the Rev. David Beach attempts to arouse activism among those who
live in unsparing poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In poor white communities, people are more likely to just
accept this as their lot,'' Beach said. ``Poor whites don't see
themselves as a distinct group with any political clout. So they
don't mobilize or go marching down to city hall. And they ought
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear a progressive, class-based voice coming from
the poor white community,'' said University of Dayton sociology
professor Steven Dandaneau, who serves on the Dayton Poverty
Reduction Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the white leaders who are going to parallel their
black counterparts on poverty issues? Why aren't they with them
fighting the good fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Some outsiders disdain, ridicule and discriminate against Tract
19 residents as ``poor white trash'' with no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They migrated here from Appalachia the way blacks migrated
from the South toward industrial jobs in the North,'' says
Dandaneau. ``They've experienced pretty considerable discrimination
that black Americans experience. They're still treated as less
valuable or second-class citizens of sorts. They're called mountain
folk or hillbillies and sort of ghettoized in their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Just east of downtown, Tract 19 is a stubborn crossroad of urban
hope and despair, a hodgepodge of sagging, battered dwellings and
expensive rehabs with pastel trim. On the north, the Mad River
brooks the poverty. To the east and west are Findlay and Keowee
streets. To the south, U.S. 35 stretches to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1990 census, per capita income was $6,979. But
a 1997 private study of the 2,297 households showed that per capita
income had nearly doubled to $12,445. The survey attributes the
increase to a scattering of middle-class professionals who recently
have purchased aging homes with visions of restoring the area's
architectural splendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentrification is the primary factor in elevating the median
income,'' said Beach, whose church commissioned the survey. ``And
that means we have a lot of tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Tract 19, an autumn wind puffs up ``Huffman
Historic Area'' banners displayed on some renovated porches. The
elegant home of Dayton Mayor Michael R. Turner, an attorney, stands
three blocks from the aroma of free meals served at St. Paul
church.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, 1,321 or 57.5 percent of housing units here are
tenant-occupied. The average property value is $29,288.
</P>
<P>
   And on June, Terry and Ringgold streets, are the four or five
blocks of the poorest whites in Montgomery County: 34 residents
with a per capita income of $2,911, the lowest in the county,
according to the 1990 census. With a median household income of
$5,360, 100 percent lived below half the federal poverty level in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and police say crack houses open, close and reopen
here like ``moveable feasts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not peaceful in the least, but it's not a war zone,''
said Cyndi Johnson, 20, a convenience store worker who lived on
Ringgold Street last summer.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 city nuisance ordinance, which can require landlords to
evict tenants involved in drugs or prostitution, appears to have
lowered residents' tolerance for crack traffic, Dayton Police
Officer Mitchell Olmsted said. Since 1993, calls to police on
narcotics violations in the June Street area have risen from six in
1993 to 54 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe it's bottomed out, hit rock bottom, and it's
turned the corner,'' Olmsted said. Others who live in Tract 19 come
and go, boarding in one room here or there, drifting in and out of
trouble with the law, finding shelter with friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   When it is meal time at St. Paul Church they all fall in line
together. The felons and loafers, the unfortunate, the mentally and
physically impaired. Those pummeled by bad breaks and setbacks. The
people who came this close to being somebody. The fast-food and
convenience store clerks for life. The decent, working folk trying
to hold on to their pride.
</P>
<P>
   Some seem to flinch and twitch with survival worries, no food,
no DP&AMP;L, no job, no insurance, no way. On folding tables, rows of
paper plates run the length of the gymnasium-sized room.
</P>
<P>
   James Dean, a convicted rapist who was released in 1994 after
serving 15 years in prison, is looking for a job. ``You just can't
hold down a job when you can't read and write hardly,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joann Ward, 55, bites into hamburger casserole while explaining
that she has ``no medical'' to cover a gallbladder operation. ``Do
you know where I can get some help for it?'' she asks a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Hess, 45, says she has hurt her knee and is no longer
able to work maintenance jobs. She wants her two grandchildren to
be ``adopted'' by a church for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   When the meal is done they go from the church, down streets to
houses with no heat and empty cupboards, or down alleys to nowhere
in particular, leaving behind the portrait of Jesus with outreached
arms, and beneath it, no bread.

 &HT;    Dayton youth hold out hope for better life provided by
tool-and-die work
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In June, Mark Shade was 16 and back on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
   After a bad year in which he skipped ``way too many days'' of
school.
</P>
<P>
   After a school nurse telephoned his dad because he smelled like
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   After discarding a pretty rough crowd that ended up getting
locked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's LD,'' says William Shade, 47, referring to his son's
learning disability. ``When he tries to read, the letters go
backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark was part of the St. Paul United Methodist Church Youth
Group. Sincere people like program director Monica Huffman were
prepping him and others for summer jobs, driving him wherever he
needed to go to fill out an application and encouraging him to
straighten up because opportunity is out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a numbness, I think, in the youth,'' Huffman says.
``Almost a doomsday atmosphere. They are living day by day. Even
when we talk about violence, it's `So what if I get beat up?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the church basement she hands out crayons for a goal-setting
exercise. ``They may not become an engineer, but at least they can
go beyond where they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than 20 years, between 1973 and 1991, the number of
white workers earning a wage too low to lift a family out of
poverty rose from 20 percent to 28.1 percent, or nearly three in
10. If that trend continues, the odds can turn against kids like
Mark Shade ever bringing home a paycheck that will support a
family.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away at the Southeast Priority Board on East Fifth
Street, community service adviser Dean Vickers says residents in
the Burkhardt-Springfield area within Census Tract 19 are often not
prepared to take advantage of some 17,000 jobs provided by the 600
contract tooling and machine companies in the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a major need for tool-and-die industry (workers),''
Vickers says. ``Part of the city plan for 2,000 addresses educating
people for the tool-and-die industry that's been a staple in Dayton
for years. But people in this community are being overlooked or
aren't taking initiative, or companies are not willing to take a
risk with these people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Mark Shade tried to become a boy worth a
risk, believing that if he ``did good'' at the Patterson Career
Center in the semesters to come, a good manufacturing job would
await him upon graduation.
</P>
<P>
   He worked part time at St. Paul's alongside his father, whom
Pastor David Beach hired three years ago as church janitor.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, blond, soft-spoken and sociable, Mark had a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, Monica and Pastor Dave helped me out,'' he says.
``It's really stupid how I used to smoke weed. It don't do nothing.
A lot say it's addicting, but to me, it ain't. If you want to stop,
you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys I used to hang out with, they're still talking about
going out and doing stupid stuff that they they got locked up for
in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that a teacher at the Patterson Career Center told
him he had skill in putting things together. ``She taught me not to
give up so easily on things 'cause I get frustrated and want to
break it.''
</P>
<P>
   An infant daughter is crying.
</P>
<P>
   Mark peers into the squinty blue eyes of his 1-month-old
daughter, trying to answer the mystery of her tears. He frowns. He
is cradling her, seated on an old sofa in an alcove of the church
basement. Next to him is his ``ex,'' a 15-year-old whose mother
asked that she not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and her mom is not seeing each other,'' he explains. ``We
broke up four months before we knew she was pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark hands the baby to its mother. A pretty, wide-faced girl,
she stares into the blanket. They giggle. Mark shrugs his
shoulders. The mother asks her girlfriend seated nearby, ``Do you
want to hold her? Or is she still too little?''
</P>
<P>
   The friend shudders. ``She's still too little.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, welfare provides for the baby. ``She has everything she
needs. And she is going to have everything,'' Mark says with pride
and protection.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, Mark is all acne and uncertainty. His summer job
at the church is about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Mark sits on a window seat, his silhouette aglow with the
stained glass. He recalls a venture beyond Tract 19 and East Dayton
to suburban Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going in Kroger's and some rich stuck-up people coming
through the door were just staring at us. I could feel it and see
it. It felt weird. Somehow, they could just tell we weren't from
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do look down. They think they are better than us. ``
</P>
<P>
   It's November. Mark is 17. His baby is 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday night, Mark is outside the duplex where he lives
with his father, younger sister and twin brother. Mark grins into
the driver's-side window of a pinkish car caught in the blink of
blue Christmas lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my new girlfriend,'' he says as the car pulls away from
the curb.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the semester has not gone well. Out of 45 days
in the first quarter of the school year, Mark attended 13 days, his
father says.
</P>
<P>
   William Shade is less optimistic now. ``I don't know if he'll
stay in school or not,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has a lot of girlfriends always calling the house. If he
can get some attention, he'll go along with it. He gets in with the
wrong crowd sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Shade is betting on his other boy, Matthew, Mark's
fraternal twin. ``Matthew is the smart one,'' Shade says.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew is short and shy. He works part time after school in the
church computer lab. So far his grades are F's and D's, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Matthew is optimistic about the future. ``Dayton's
got plenty of tool-and-die companies,'' he says. ``I'm pretty sure
I'll be able to get a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark is feeling renewed confidence, too. ``Some kind of
manufacturing job, that's what I want to do. Hopefully having a
house and a family. It's going to be hard, but you know.''

COMMENTARY: THE LURE OF THE ART OF A SUBURBAN BORDELLO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. _ Jennifer Blanken learned about the auction
from the local newspaper and quickly called her friend Sunny Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture belonging to the woman who became notorious last
summer as the Morristown Madam was being sold. Wouldn't it be fun
to preview the very items that helped fire up the office-park
Casanovas who had stolen off to the Madam's 20-room mansion for
what her advertisements promised would be ``An Afternoon Delight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it was fantasy furniture,'' Mrs. Blanken said,
explaining why the remarks of a woman accused of running a bordello
had drawn her to Dawson's auction house. ``I wanted to see what
that whole category involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hersh agreed: ``Someone in that line of business would be
fanciful. You go in and sort of step into another world.''
</P>
<P>
   So there, indoors on a springlike afternoon were the two
suburban mothers peering with scarcely concealed smiles at a
Carrara marble maiden with a breast half bared and a regal chair
cushioned in a velvet that one customer described as ``bordello
red.'' They scrutinized the gaudy late-19th-century stalwarts _ a
carved oak clock valued at $18,000, a towering walnut serving
buffet, a fireplace mantel, all richly decorated with satyrs,
cupids, griffins and dragons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wouldn't go with my stuff,'' said Mrs. Hersh, who
lives in Long Valley, N.J., west of Morristown. ``I have a real
contemporary home in a contemporary suburb _ your basic Long Valley
Colonial.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said she understood the attraction of all those
mythological carvings. ``She didn't want to have the same things in
her house that these men have in their homes,'' Mrs. Hersh said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she works in marketing and not sociology, Mrs. Hersh
put her finger on what it was about Judith Kelly Dempsey's
unorthodox suburban business that has so captivated Morris County
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is happening other than going to work and coming
home,'' Mrs. Hersh said. ``Your neighbor who gets up at 5:30 and
goes into the city? Something's happening other than that.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cheever and John Updike couldn't have put it better. Their
suburban chronicles tenderly delve into the contrast between the
sober, manicured homes and the trouble and angst that sometimes
fester inside. People move to the suburbs precisely because they
are predictable, even humdrum. After urban thieves steal the car
radio, humdrum is good, they figure. They don't expect to find
bookie parlors, terrorist cells or bordellos behind the clipped
hedges. When they do, it's the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Both the auction house and Mrs. Dempsey, whom the auction
catalog discreetly identified only as a former Playboy bunny, were
hoping that publicity about Mrs. Dempsey's case would raise prices
by drawing many bidders to Saturday's auction looking for, well, an
afternoon delight.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about the furniture, though, was a little less
titillating. Mrs. Dempsey, who has rejected a prosecutor's offer of
probation in exchange for a guilty plea to promoting prostitution,
says she was enchanted by mythical figures as a girl and started
buying furniture carved with them long before she opened what she
called her escort service. At 46, she considers herself a suburban
hausfrau just like some of the women ogling her furniture. She
stands out, she said, only because of the unusual business she
started after her husband ran off and stranded her with a $700,000
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was a little more resourceful in my effort to save my
house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to visitors who, to use Mrs. Hersh's term, were
``peeking,'' there were serious collectors, like the lanky
67-year-old squire sporting an Irish country hat who was there, he
said, because he looks ``for quality no matter where I find it.''
</P>
<P>
   A place like Mrs. Dempsey's business, which charged $225 an
hour, would be sure to have elegant things. ``You go to a dump,
you're going to draw a dumpy clientele,'' he said. ``You've got a
fancy place, you're going to draw high prices for services
rendered.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the peekers, one woman joked coyly with a friend that she was
looking at the furniture ``to see which room your husband and my
husband used.'' Another, Helen Reingold, an 83-year-old neighbor of
Mrs. Dempsey's, tweaked the press for its excessive interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you gentlemen,'' she said tartly to a reporter and
photographer, turning the antique tables on them. ``What are you
doing here?''

<P>
   MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. _ Jennifer Blanken learned about the auction
from the local newspaper and quickly called her friend Sunny Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture belonging to the woman who became notorious last
summer as the Morristown Madam was being sold. Wouldn't it be fun
to preview the very items that helped fire up the office-park
Casanovas who had stolen off to the Madam's 20-room mansion for
what her advertisements promised would be ``An Afternoon Delight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it was fantasy furniture,'' Mrs. Blanken said,
explaining why the remarks of a woman accused of running a bordello
had drawn her to Dawson's auction house. ``I wanted to see what
that whole category involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hersh agreed: ``Someone in that line of business would be
fanciful. You go in and sort of step into another world.''
</P>
<P>
   So there, indoors on a springlike afternoon were the two
suburban mothers peering with scarcely concealed smiles at a
Carrara marble maiden with a breast half bared and a regal chair
cushioned in a velvet that one customer described as ``bordello
red.'' They scrutinized the gaudy late-19th-century stalwarts _ a
carved oak clock valued at $18,000, a towering walnut serving
buffet, a fireplace mantel, all richly decorated with satyrs,

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exceptionally warm weather pattern that has led to all-time
maximum temperature records for December in many spots from the
Middle West to the Northeast during the past week will end Sunday
and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will be another very mild day in most areas east of the
Mississippi River. Near-record temperatures will be common from the
eastern Ohio Valley to the Middle Atlantic States, where intervals
of sun will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, mostly cloudy skies and areas of morning fog will
occur from northern Pennsylvania to northern New England. Winds
from the Atlantic will keep eastern New England cool with patchy
drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will accompany a cold front as it moves east from the
Mississippi Valley. Ahead of the front, mild and moist breezes from
the south will prevail. Chilly breezes from the north will follow
the front forcing temperatures down toward seasonal levels in much
of the Plains and northern Mississippi Valley. Low pressure
streaking north along the front will produce a band of cold rain
from the central Mississippi Valley to the western Great Lakes.
Some snow will fall as the precipitation gradually ends from
eastern Kansas to the northern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be cold. Onshore winds will promote
coastal showers and mountain snow in the Pacific Northwest. A jet
stream disturbance will bring scattered lowland showers and
mountain snow to the deserts of the Southwest. Patchy snow and cold
breezes will linger in much of the interior west, especially along
west-facing slopes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WINTER'S HERE
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unprecedented warmth of recent days from the Plains
to the Eastern states, meteorologists would say that winter has
begun. The event that will occur Dec. 21 is the start of
astronomical winter, when the direct rays of the sun shine on the
Tropic of Capricorn, at latitude 23.5 degrees south of the equator.
For the purposes of official climate records, winter began Dec. 1
and will end Feb. 28. In most of the northern states, by another
unofficial measurement, winter began Saturday, which is the
climatological start of coldest 90-day period of the year.

FINDING HOME VALUES ON A FLORIDA COAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALAN S. OSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Explorers are still arriving along the northeast coast of
Florida. Ponce de Leon was looking for the Fountain of Youth when
he reached what is now St. Augustine in 1513. He didn't discover it
_ but maybe Nobuko Koop has come as close as anyone will.
</P>
<P>
   A newly retired financial analyst with the Federal Aviation
Administration in Washington, Ms. Koop has moved into a one-story
ranch house that was built for her on land she bought a year ago in
Grand Haven, a new community in Palm Coast, 30 miles south of St.
Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold my house in June and the next day I headed south,'' Ms.
Koop said. ``I've been playing golf five days a week ever since. If
I had to describe my life in one sentence, I would say I am on a
perpetual vacation, with the convenience and comfort of my own
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Ms. Koop's discoveries was that these indulgences
cost less than they do in comparable communities in southwest or
southeast Florida. It is a point that was made by several other
recent arrivals, golfers and otherwise, encountered on the 65-mile
stretch of the northeast coast from Ponte Vedra Beach in the
Jacksonville area to Daytona Beach to the south. It was echoed by
newcomers even in the very different environment of historic St.
Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koop wound up spending about $200,000 for a three-bedroom
ranch with a lake at the rear and views of the 13th and 16th
fairways of a new golf course. She said she had taken almost all
the upgrades offered by a Palm Coast builder, Arthur Rutenberg. The
house has 1,760 square feet of space and was offered at a base
price of $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   North of central St. Augustine, Donald and Jacqueline Bosley,
retired schoolteachers and avid golfers from Smith Mountain Lake,
Va., near Roanoke, bought a lot for $90,000 on a lake at the new
World Golf Village, the first project at the 6,000-acre Saint Johns
master-planned community in St. Johns County. They are planning to
build a house in the $300,000 to $350,000 range. The land is midway
between downtown St. Augustine and Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosleys said they spent four years looking at golf
communities in southeast and southwest Florida. ``We probably would
have had to spend 20 or 25 percent more to buy in other places we
looked,'' among them Venice and the Fort Myers areas, both in
southwestern Florida, Mrs. Bosley said.
</P>
<P>
   All is not golf, however, in northeast Florida. In the 15-mile
oceanfront stretch running south from Matanzas Inlet to Flagler
Beach along Route A1A _ halfway between St. Augustine and Daytona
Beach _ the appeal is the ocean. Condominium prices are about 40 to
50 percent below those in oceanfront communities in South Florida,
said Robert Follansbee, who runs Wolcott Realty in Flagler Beach.
They range from $75,000 to $145,000, he said. Population density is
thin in comparison with South Florida, and much of the development
that has occurred aims at a moderate-income market.
</P>
<P>
   Lower land prices in a region of relatively lesser market demand
account for the lower price structure. Charles Clark, a real estate
consultant based in Ponte Vedra Beach, estimated that lower land
prices have made it possible for buyers to pay 20 percent to 40
percent less for new homes in vacation communities in the area than
they would pay in the more developed vacation- and
retirement-oriented centers of southeast or southwest Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In and near Jacksonville there is a substantial burst in primary
housing, both rentals and sales, in a wide range of prices, a
result of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   One builder there is Mercedes Homes, based in Melbourne. Cora
Johnston, president of the company's Jacksonville division,
estimated that 5,600 new homes a year were being built in the
Jacksonville metropolitan area and that probably 70 percent of the
buyers were buying in Florida for the first time, an indication of
the region's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As few as 3 percent of our buyers are second-home
purchasers,'' Ms. Johnston said. The Mercedes houses sell for
$180,000 to $280,000, and are generally priced a notch lower than
other new housing in the immediate area. For example, the company's
houses sell in that range at Oceans Edge in Ponte Vedra. Nearby,
the average price in recent sales is $611,000 at the high-end Marsh
Landing golf-course community.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the new master-planned communities of Saint Johns _
with its World Golf Village as the first major phase of development
_ and Grand Haven in Palm Coast that show the region in its
strengthened role as a destination and ultimate resettlement
location for vacationers and retirees.
</P>
<P>
   A golf course designed by Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen has been
completed only within the last year at World Golf Village. The Golf
Hall of Fame opened there in May. A hotel and a midrise time-share
resort hotel have been completed, and now new home construction is
moving forward apace.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 100 house sales so far in first-phase
developments by both national and local builders, with homes
selling for $180,000 to about $600,000, said Rob Kearney, the
marketing vice president. The first occupants arrived in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Haven site in Palm Coast was sold by ITT Community
Development Corp. to Lowe Enterprises, of Brentwood, Calif., two
years ago. ITT started developing Palm Coast in the '70s on
portions of over 100,000 acres of timberland that it owned in
Flagler County.
</P>
<P>
   The development area was ultimately scaled down to 42,000 acres,
and much of it is still undeveloped although many lots have been
sold for future construction. But over 33,000 people live there
already, many year-round, in such neighborhoods as Indian Trails,
Pine Lakes, Sea Colony and Palm Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was ITT that developed Palm Coast's first master-planned
community, the high-end Hammock Dunes, between the Intracoastal
Waterway and the ocean. Lot sales began in 1990, and there are
already 376 completed homes _ single-families and condominium
units. Its unsold single-family home sites _ currently 154 _ are
among the few assets that ITT still retains at Palm Coast, and they
are expected to be sold in the near future to another development
group.
</P>
<P>
   There is nevertheless a sales office on site for developable
lots and completed condominium homes. The condominiums start at
$315,000 and the building lots sell from the mid-$130,000s to
$750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Grand Haven is on 998 acres on the inland side of the
Intracoastal. It will reach a much broader middle-income market
than Hammock Dunes. The master developer, Grand Haven Palm Coast
Inc., a Lowe affiliate, is building the streets and other common
facilities, and last May it completed an 18-hole golf course
designed by Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Home building is proceeding apace. Lowe itself is developing
three single-family-home neighborhoods, with five local home
builders authorized to do custom residential construction. Two
national builders _ Centex Homes, based in Dallas, and Pulte Home
Corp., of Bloomfield Hills, Mich. _ are building in three other
residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for lots range from the mid-$30,000s to the low
$200,000s, the higher prices being for lots along the Intracoastal.
Home construction began 18 months ago, and so far 175 houses are
completed or under construction. There is a golf club, in which
membership is optional at a cost of $150 a month, and a village
center with health and fitness facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Through Centex or Pulte, home-and-lot packages are available
from the high $130,000s to the low $200,000s. One of Pulte's buyers
was Dennis Brydges, an executive with the United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organization in Washington, and his wife, Evelyn. They
closed in October on a $165,000 patio home on a lake, in walking
distance of the golf course. ``In Naples we couldn't have gotten
something like this for under $250,000,'' Brydges said.
</P>
<P>
   If past trends hold true we would expect that 30 to 35 percent
of our buyers will be avid golfers,'' said Bill Haussmann, vice
president for sales. ``The rest will be occasional golfers or they
will be attracted to other amenities.'' Most buyers are retirees
with incomes in the range of $75,000 to $125,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another new golf-oriented project in the area is in Daytona
Beach. Indigo Development Inc., a subsidiary of Consolidated Tomoka
Land Company, a publicly held company based in Daytona Beach, is
developing the LPGA International golf community in cooperation
with the Ladies Professional Golf Association and the city.
</P>
<P>
   Two 18-hole golf courses have been completed, one of them only
last October, and in the first phase of residential development 57
houses are completed or under construction. The entrance to the
site is near a new LPGA Boulevard Interchange on Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   Local builders are producing single-family houses, close to a
completed course designed by Reese Jones, at prices ranging from
$125,000 to $750,000. A 3,000-square-foot home on a third of an
acre on the golf course, with four bedrooms and a pool and a
two-car garage, would sell for about $330,000, said Indigo
president William McMunn.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere does golf enthusiasm ride higher than it does at World
Golf Village. Buyers are paying a premium for condominium units
that offer a direct view of the World Golf Hall of Fame itself.
Ecogroup Ltd., based in Tampa, is developing 200 condominium units
selling for $250,000 to about $500,000 in buildings of one, two and
three stories. They use as a facade element a fieldstone from
Tennessee and Alabama that is frequently used in home construction
in mid-Atlantic states. The style contrasts markedly with the
Spanish or Mediterranean stucco-and-tile-roof look found in
southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The names of golf heroes of the past are embedded in the
cobblestones of a circular walkway, about a mile long, that
connects the major elements at the center of the development:
80,000 square feet of new shops under construction, the completed
300-room World Golf Village Resort Hotel, and the 180-foot tower of
the hall of fame itself.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour, the professional organization of tournament
players and the organization that runs tournaments in the United
States, has had its headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach since 1980.
It had long wanted to have a Hall of Fame, Kearney said, in
collaboration with other national and international golf
organizations. It ultimately joined forces with Davidson
Development Inc., the master developer of the 6,000-acre Saint
Johns site, to develop the World Golf Hall of Fame as the
centerpiece of the project. The location is off Interstate 95 at
International Golf Parkway, near an interchange that the developer
built in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A second golf course _ the first collaboration between Arnold
Palmer and Jack Nicklaus _ is scheduled for completion in spring
2000. Beyond that the master plan calls for still another golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   There are three single-family-home neighborhoods, all in
construction, each of which will have a community facility, parks,
pools and tennis courts. Five local builders and one national
builder _ Panitz Homes, a subsidiary of Beazer Homes, of Atlanta _
are authorized to produce houses in the development. So far 20 are
completed and 50 are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can purchase lots and bring in their own builders, or
build at a future date. About a third of current buyers are
planning to build at a future time, Kearney said. Lot prices range
from $55,000 to $100,000. Buyers who are building now are paying
from $180,000 to $600,000 for lot and house.
</P>
<P>
   Like Davidson himself and other executives of his company,
Kearney was active in the development of Arvida Corp.'s Sawgrass
master-planned community in Ponte Vedra from 1981 to the early
'90s. About 12,000 people live in Sawgrass, which is only 25 miles
from Jacksonville and over the years has become as much a bedroom
community for Jacksonville as an active-leisure retirement
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perfect analogy,'' said Kearney. ``I think that
Saint Johns will eventually evolve into a bedroom community of both
Jacksonville and St. Augustine.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even in the fully developed downtown of St. Augustine, there is
new construction aimed at the inter-regional market. An
Orlando-based hotel owner and developer, Richard Kessler, is
restoring an 1888 Spanish Moorish hotel, the Casa Monica, into what
he says will be a four-star hotel with 137 rooms and an Old World
ambiance, something St. Augustine has lacked in the modern era
despite its wide popularity as a tourist resort. It is a $16
million development project, Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   The Casa Monica was one of three grand downtown hotels once
owned by Henry Morrison Flagler, the one-time business associate of
John D. Rockefeller Sr. who wanted to establish St. Augustine as
the American Riviera. He bought the Casa Monica in 1889, a year
after it was built, and later developed two other hotels nearby.
One is now the home of Flagler College and the other is the City
Hall and the Lightner Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Casa Monica closed in the 1930s and became the St. Johns
County Courthouse. Kessler, whose Grand Theme Hotels chain has
projects in Orlando and Savannah, Ga., bought it last year and
began construction three months ago, with Howard Davis of St.
Augustine as the architect. It will reopen next September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county wanted to reconstruct it as a hotel and they put it
out to bid in 1994 when the hotel market was struggling,'' Kessler
said. The designated builder was not able to close, and the project
long seemed in doubt. ``But they stuck to their guns,'' Kessler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristic as it is of the region as a whole, St.
Augustine offers some of the most interesting old houses and one of
the few places where restoration has become a major business.
``There's not much turnover and there's a waiting list for
houses,'' said Patricia Merritt, a broker who set up shop in St.
Augustine in 1992 after she and her husband moved from Palm Beach
County. ``I was a broker there for 20 years, and when I saw the
opportunity here I decided to open an office.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 75 sales of turn-of-the-century houses a year in
downtown St. Augustine, Ms. Merritt said. Prices are as low as
$120,000, but many houses need substantial upgrading. John Valdes,
a contractor who specializes in custom restorations, said that many
were Mediterranean Revival houses that he has renovated as
bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   But some become primary housing. Jim Jaffre, an international
fast-food consultant, bought a house on Marine Street just outside
the city's historic district for $375,000 in 1997 and had it
restored and enlarged by Valdes at a cost of $250,000. ``This town
is unlike any other part of Florida,'' Jaffre said. ``Everything
else looks like it was built after 1950, whereas this town is older
and more quaint.''
</P>
<P>
   In a section called the Abbot Tract, old houses on heavily
shaded streets sell for $110,000 to $450,000, Ms. Merritt said, and
new buyers will often invest $20,000 to $125,000 to upgrade them.
</P>
<P>
   There is also ongoing home development on a strip of land called
Camachee Island, bordering on its 300-slip yacht harbor, and on
Anastasia Island, reached by the Bridge of Lions from the historic
district. There the Thompson family has been developing a
waterfront community called Pelican Reef, fronting on the Matanzas
River, on land it has owned since 1936.
</P>
<P>
   It took 13 years to complete the permitting process for the 132
home sites, said Paul Thompson. Approval came in 1992. Since then
33 lots have been sold and 22 houses have been built, mainly as
primary homes for local residents. The typical cost of a lot with a
new house is currently about $350,000 to $400,000, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   For Anthony and Frances La Duca, inland roads are as much an
attraction of the region as golf courses, the ocean or a historic
city. La Duca is a motorcycle enthusiast who owns a restaurant
called the Camino del Mar in Deerfield Beach. The couple live in
Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago they bought a beach house for $178,000 in Flagler
Beach. Daytona Beach and its celebrated Speedway are nearby, and
Bike Week, which drew half a million motorcyclists to the city last
March, also brought 15 or 20 visitors to stay with the La Ducas at
their beach house.
</P>
<P>
   But on normal occasions there is more solitude. ``When we're up
there we like to drive our bike on the back roads around the
countryside,'' La Duca said. ``It's so nice and quiet. It's
beautiful.''

WHAT KIND OF GROWTH FOR MYRTLE BEACH? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. _ From his desk on the top floor of the
Founders Building, Douglas Wendel can look out over the expanse of
high-rise hotels that makes up Myrtle Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a $2-billion-a-year resort community that his concern,
Burroughs &AMP; Chapin Co., has shaped as no other entity has. At one
time, Burroughs &AMP; Chapin owned the entire oceanfront. The city's
very name was selected by the company founder's widow, Addie
Burroughs, to honor the wild wax myrtles that lined the dunes.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the company was looked upon as the
grandfatherly overlord that provided land for churches and schools,
developed the first seaside hotel and brought new life to the
region. In recent years, however, the downtown has become
increasingly ticky-tacky.
</P>
<P>
   But now, some of the city's 25,000 residents worry that
grandfather has bought new dentures and is biting away at the very
fabric of the community with regard only for profits. The company
found itself in the center of last year's mayoral election as Mark
McBride, a political newcomer who promised to stand up to the
company, was carried into office by a mere 42 votes over Robert
Grissom, the 12-year incumbent who since died at the age of 76.
</P>
<P>
   The company has aggressively stepped up its development effort
since Wendel was named chairman and chief executive five years ago.
He was the first outsider to head the company, still held and
directed by descendants of the founders, F.G. Burroughs and Simeon
Chapin.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel developed Broadway at the Beach, a 350-acre complex of
theaters, shops and restaurants a few miles from the oceanfront.
</P>
<P>
   The company expected completion in 10 years, but it took just
three. The complex features Planet Hollywood and Hard Rock Cafe,
the first trendy national chains to open restaurants here.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the drawing board is the 2,000-acre Grande Dunes resort
stretching from the largest oceanfront tract remaining to a point
several miles inland west of the Intracoastal Waterway and, about
four miles west of the resort, a 1.3 million-square-foot shopping
mall, which when completed will be the state's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is difficult for anybody and most react in a negative
manner,'' said Wendel. ``If we were a greedy company one option
would have been to take all of our 30,000 acres and parcel it up
and sell it, take our assets and move someplace else. But we want
to make Myrtle Beach as good a resort as it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Myrtle Beach stands at a crossroads. The mayor and local
developers want more projects like Broadway at the Beach to attract
a more upscale clientele rather than a further accretion
body-piercing pagodas and T-shirt shops like those that now line
Ocean Boulevard, the main downtown and oceanfront thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown area's primary tourist attraction, the Pavilion, an
amusement park owned by Burroughs &AMP; Chapin, looks more and more
dated every year as the company has pursued its other projects.
Stores sell vulgar T-shirts and items that could be used for
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   McBride, 34, said the city had taken a major step toward
bringing a family atmosphere back to the downtown with the
council's vote in mid-November to set up a commission to oversee a
$50 million redevelopment. The plan calls for the city to build a
pier, on which Burroughs &AMP; Chapin would build a new version of
their Pavilion amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were not the magnanimous, loving, caring company we are,
we would abandon it (the Pavilion),'' said Wendel. If the Pavilion
were closed, he added, it would just lead to further downtown
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Pavilion/downtown project is not high on the
company's list. Two residential and resort projects, Grande Dunes
and South Beach, take precedence, said Wendel.
</P>
<P>
   The Grande Dunes, which will include a 400-room hotel, will rise
on a one-mile stretch of oceanfront, the last large tract of
undeveloped land within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   It will include two golf courses, oceanfront condominiums with
prices beginning at $450,000, golf villas and three marinas on the
Intracoastal Waterway. In addition, the resort will include an
equestrian center, a golf school, detached homes and a
downtown-like shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of projects like that will change the mix here,''
said Mayor McBride. ``Resorts like that are more family oriented.
You don't see video poker on every corner in Hilton Head.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby residents protested the Grande Dunes project in a hearing
before the City Council, which approved the plan in October. Some
435 acres of the 2,000-acre project _ the prime oceanfront land _
is within the city limits. The protesters were residents of the
Dunes Club subdivision, which was built by Burroughs &AMP; Chapin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too close to us,'' said Dwight Hudson, who lives at
the Dunes Club. Another resident, Robert Hawkins, said, ``Their
attitude seems to be, `Trust us.' Are you kidding me?''
</P>
<P>
   South Beach, the second of the company's new projects, will be
geared for the more traditional budget-minded Myrtle Beach visitor.
Already built as part of the complex is the Crown Reef Hotel and
some miniature golf courses. A meeting and convention center is
planned, as well as amusement activities.
</P>
<P>
   But as Burroughs &AMP; Chapin and other developers bring in
large-scale resorts, the mom-and-pop operations that have been the
mainstay of Myrtle Beach are being squeezed out. Just a few weeks
ago, a wrecking ball and bulldozer took down one of the oldest such
establishments, Harts Villa. The 31 units will be replaced with a
76-unit high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the majority of the people here are not against
development or redevelopment,'' said McBride. ``What people are
against,'' he said, ``is rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents complain that Burroughs &AMP; Chapin donated the land for
the Route 17 Bypass to accommodate their future Broadway at the
Beach and NASCAR speedparks projects, pointing to traffic tie-ups
even on a November weekday.
</P>
<P>
   The company that eventually grew into Burroughs &AMP; Chapin began
in 1857. F.G. Burroughs grew rich from turpentine and retailing in
Conway, S.C., 15 miles to the west of what is now Myrtle Beach. As
his company grew so did his landholdings, eventually some 60,000
acres beside the beach.
</P>
<P>
   He died before it his property became a resort, but his sons
entered into a partnership with a New York stockbroker, Simeon
Chapin, to launch Myrtle Beach Farms, the company that brought
vacationers to the place that was then called New Town.
</P>
<P>
   Benevolence has been the company's motto through the years and
continues today, company officials said. The land on which the
city's minor league ballpark is being built was donated by the
company, as was part of the land on which the Myrtle Beach
Convention Center stands.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach enjoys access to the ocean, unequaled along the
South Carolina coast, because of Burroughs &AMP; Chapin. The street
ends were donated to the city, with parking provided about every
other block along the miles of oceanfront.
</P>
<P>
   The company also donated an oceanfront park and the 320 acres
for Myrtle Beach State Park.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said his relationship has been good with the company
since he ran his campaign to harness it. He says company and city
officials worked diligently to hammer out a compromise on the
Grande Dunes project that reduced the total number of units from
25,000 to 17,000 and the height of the hotel from 180 feet to 80.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautions, ``change comes slowly.''

NEW YORKERS RUSH TO INVEST IN COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LESLIE EATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When state officials announced the creation of New York's
College Savings Program in September to help parents pay for their
children's educations, it sounded like a narrow _ if nice _
election-year initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of investors, some with children who have already
graduated from college, have signed up, drawn by the program's
unusual flexibility and a tax break that is the largest in the
nation for such plans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the program began, more than $15 million has poured into
more than 5,000 accounts, and many more people are likely to sign
up this month to beat the Dec. 31 deadline for getting the tax
breaks this year; 75,000 information packets and applications have
been mailed out, according to TIAA-CREF, a private company that is
managing the program.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they are encouraged by the early response to
the program, which has not been widely advertised. ``This much in
two months _ wow,'' said Robert Maurer, president of the state's
Higher Education Services Corp., which administers grants. By this
time next year, he forecast, the program will have about 50,000
accounts and $350 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The program puts New York on the leading edge of a nationwide
trend, as states try to come up with new ways to help middle-class
residents pay for higher education. More than a dozen states have
similar programs, and at least seven more are developing them,
using New York as one of their models.
</P>
<P>
   New York's program is open to people with a lot of money and
people with just a little, people with a lot of children and people
with none. Investment accounts can be set up for grandchildren,
godchildren, friends, even for the investors themselves. And the
money in these accounts can be spent at any accredited school,
anywhere in the country, so it can be used for an undergraduate
degree, law school or courses in creative writing or cooking. If
the money is not used for education, it will be fully taxed and a 1
percent penalty will be assessed on the earning.
</P>
<P>
   A couple can put up to $10,000 a year into these accounts and
deduct that money from the income on which they pay state taxes.
People in the highest state tax bracket could cut their tax bills
by almost $700, and those who live in New York City could save
almost $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the money stays in the account and is ultimately
spent on education, the state will not tax it or the investment
profits in the account. In addition, federal taxes on the profits
will be deferred until the money is withdrawn. There is no limit on
how much anyone can contribute, though no student-to-be's account
can receive more than $100,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they did not intend to create a stealth tax
break, but admit they may have soft-pedaled the program a little.
``All of us have been so involved in campaigning, and we didn't
want to give the impression that this was a campaign gimmick,''
said H. Carl McCall, who easily won re-election as state
comptroller last month and is now considering a run for the U.S.
Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 states have adopted some kind of tuition savings
plan, according to the National Association of State Treasurers.
And while some of these are the more common, limited programs that
allow parents to prepay tuition at a state school, for example,
many of the newer programs are like New York's and a similar
program that began in New Hampshire in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something between New York and New Hampshire is going
to be the model,'' said Peter Mazareas, executive director of the
Massachusetts Education Finance Authority. Massachusetts is among
the seven states known to be developing one of these educational
investment plans; the state already has a more common prepayment
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed legislation authorizing the states to set up
such plans in 1996. It also gave them a key piece of federal tax
relief: the investment earnings of money in these plans are not
taxed until the money is withdrawn, and then it is taxed not at the
rate of the giver, but at the presumably lower rate of the student.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures, including New York's, began passing bills to
create the plans in 1997, but many are just now getting under way,
in part because the IRS put out the regulations governing these
plans only over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   States justify these programs by saying that it is in their
economic interest to have a well-educated work force. But elected
officials acknowledge that there are political benefits, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what people want, as the soccer moms of America have been
telling anyone who will listen,'' said Mississippi State Treasurer
Marshall Bennett. ``I've gotten more public reaction to this than
anything else that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment programs are open to people with very limited
means _ New York's, for example, accepts annual contributions as
low as $250, which can be paid in $25 installments. But because
these programs rely on tax breaks, they appeal most to those who
pay taxes but find them burdensome: middle-class voters.
</P>
<P>
   And that troubles some critics, who complain that these programs
do nothing for young people whose parents are too poor or too
troubled to save for their educations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a good deal of help to people who really don't need
it,'' said Edward Sullivan, the Manhattan Democrat who is chairman
of the Assembly's Committee on Higher Education, and who voted
against New York's program. ``How many single mothers working as
waitresses can put aside a significant amount? Those are the people
we should be helping.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall dismisses criticism of the program's appeal to
middle-class voters, calling it silly. ``People can always find
some reason to be critical,'' he said, ``but this is being marketed
to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And many backers of such plans say they help the people who need
it most. ``If you've got a lot of money, you can afford to go to
college, and if you're lower-income, you can get grants and
fellowships,'' said Georgie A. Thomas, Treasurer of New Hampshire.
``It's the middle class that gets taken to the cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   The $5,000-a-person tax deduction in New York's plan appears to
be the most generous in the country, although at least one other
state, Missouri, has announced plans to allow an $8,000 deduction.
Some states, like Connecticut, do not give tax deductions for
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the cost to the state is low _ it will forgo
between $20 million and $30 million of the $15 billion it collects
in personal income taxes. The administrative costs of the fund are
covered by a very small annual charge to the accounts. (It is less
than 1 percent, and about half the cost of a similar mutual fund.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Legislators decided to use the tax deduction because they
thought it would entice people to start saving, said Paul Tonko, a
Democratic assemblyman who represents Amsterdam, near Schenectady,
and who is the original sponsor of the plan. ``That way, it is not
only a savings vehicle, but also a springboard to encourage
savings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the immediate tax deduction, rather than the long-term
benefits of saving for college, that is drawing people into the
plan, said Ed Slott, an accountant in Rockville Centre who
specializes in taxes and estates. ``The things people do to save a
buck on taxes,'' he said. ``If the state gave us a tax deduction
for building a new Yankee Stadium, it would be up already.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, Slott said, the tax incentive is pushing
people to participate in a good program that has other benefits.
One of them is that the money in these accounts must be used for
education _ tuition, room, board, books, supplies _ and cannot be
spent on, say, a car. This has a big appeal for grandparents, Slott
said, because ``they like to give money to kids that the kids can't
spend'' on other things.
</P>
<P>
   Some private firms that sell investment products and services
complain that they will not be able to compete against the state's
program because they cannot offer a tax deduction. ``The tax
benefit is so compelling, it will crowd out competition in the New
York market,'' said Peter Roberts, who runs the College Savings
Bank in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But some accountants say the wealthy and the financially
sophisticated may not find the state program very appealing. The
tax deduction, though a great benefit to the average consumer, is
not big enough to be significant to millionaires, said Michael
Kilgallen, a senior supervisory tax specialist at KPMG Peat
Marwick, the big accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   And the program does not allow the donors to control how their
money is invested, Kilgallen noted. To comply with federal rules,
TIAA-CREF handles all the investing, and has set up a system under
which about half the money in an account is invested mainly in
stocks when the beneficiary is young; the investments become less
risky as the child gets closer to age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The program's managers say it is still too early to tell exactly
who is going to participate in the plan. But they do know that the
biggest group of accounts _ a fifth of the total so far _ are being
opened for people who are 16 or older, said TIAA-CREF vice
president Timothy Lane. Although the exact breakdown is not yet
clear, some of these are adults opening accounts for themselves, he
said, while others are parents with teen-age children, for whom
``college is more than a theoretical reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the same account may serve both purposes. Maurer, of the
Higher Education Services Corp., said he had opened an account for
his son, who just graduated from college and may want to go to
graduate school. But if his son decides against it, Maurer said, he
hopes to use the money himself, to take courses at the Culinary
Institute of America in Hyde Park.

 CONVERTING THE FORMER REVLON COMPLEX IN EDISON, N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last 40 years, Revlon Corp. has owned a 63-acre complex
in the heart of the Middlesex County, N.J., township of Edison,
which includes the cosmetics giant's worldwide research and
development center.
</P>
<P>
   It consisted of a vacant 750,000-square-foot manufacturing
plant, a 250,000-square-foot office building and a
100,000-square-foot research component. The property now has a new
owner and a different future as a mixed-use complex for multiple
tenants, including Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago Starwood Heller LLC paid $24 million for the
property, a huddle of office, research and manufacturing buildings.
It then leased back to Revlon the research component as well as
75,000 square feet of space in the office building.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Starwood Heller _ a joint venture of G. Heller Enterprises
of Edgewater and Starwood Opportunity Fund IV, an affiliate of
Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich, Conn. _ is advancing a
$25-million modernization, redevelopment and expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes the introduction of a new retail component for
the complex, a mile and a half southwest of the intersection of
Route 27 and Interstate 287. The redevelopment of the property,
which the partners are financing, will be done in stages and is
expected to take two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for overhauling the four-story office building and
razing all but 140,000 square feet of the 750,000 square feet in
the vacant manufacturing space in two connecting buildings. The
remaining industrial space will be refurbished and the razed space
will be replaced with a 250,000-square-foot warehouse and
distribution structure built on speculation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, discussions are under way with township officials
to turn some 18 undeveloped acres in the middle of the property
into 150,000 square feet of retail space. The initial design for
the retail component was rejected, but the partners are redesigning
it to resemble a traditional town center with a village green
surrounded by shops and a clock tower whose site has not yet been
determined. The village green will be across from Edison's
municipal complex.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Heller president Gene Heller said the hope is that the
retail component, which requires a zoning change and municipal
approvals, will serve as a true town center for the community,
which does not have a traditional downtown, as well as an amenity
for the office and industrial users on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Edison Mayor George Spadaro said the retail concept ``is a
potentially attractive idea if the developers come up with a
workable plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But of the overall concept of redeveloping the property, Spadaro
said: ``Edison is at a point that some of its older commercial
areas have become a bit dilapidated and we are looking hard at them
for redevelopment.'' If successful, he said, this project will
replace empty old factories with new construction, which will
``beautify the neighborhood and bring in additional tax revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Revlon once occupied all the buildings on the site, which it
purchased in the early 1950s from Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the
health-care giant. At that time a single 75,000-square-foot
manufacturing building sat on the property, which Revlon expanded
over time to 10 times its original size. In the 1980s the company
added the office and research buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Early this decade Revlon sold its Max Factor division to Procter
&AMP; Gamble, thus reducing its need for the manufacturing buildings,
which it closed five years ago. In turn the administrative support
staff for the manufacturing operation was relocated to other plants
in Arizona, North Carolina and Florida, decreasing the amount of
office space Revlon occupied to 75,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesperson, who declined to be named, said the sale
of the property had been a purely financial decision and had no
impact on the current or future operations in Edison. There is a
stable workforce in place there and it made sense to keep it there,
the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   Heller said Starwood Heller had purchased the site because ``we
saw the ability to improve the property from an old manufacturing
facility to a higher and better use.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was the site's location on Route 27, not far from
such major roadways as Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway,
the New Jersey Turnpike and Routes 1 and 9. Retaining Revlon as a
tenant also provided ``us with an immediate income stream,'' Heller
added.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex County has 15.6 million square feet of office space,
making it one of the larger submarkets in the 11-county northern
New Jersey office market. As of the third quarter the vacancy rate
for Class A space in the county was 15.8 percent, up from 8.2
percent the same time last year _ the result of AT&AMP;T's vacating
late last year a 420,000-square-foot block of space in East
Brunswick. For Class B space, like the former Revlon office
building, the rate is 19.6 percent, down from 25.4 percent,
according to Grubb &AMP; Ellis, the national commercial brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing more space being leased than is being returned
to the market,'' said Arthur Della Salla, regional director of
research at the brokerage's West Orange office. ``In turn rents are
rising.'' For instance, annual average per square foot rents for
Class B space rose to $20.77, from $19.44 in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heller said the partners expected to lease the remaining 175,000
square feet of office space at the Edison project for about $18 a
square foot ``to beat our competition.'' He said they also planned
to invest $3 million in improvements to the office building.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The work, to begin in 30 to 60 days, includes upgrading the
mechanical systems, lobby and elevators, as well as refurbishing
common areas and enhancing the landscaping around the building.
Heller said the site had 2,229 parking spaces, which he called more
than adequate for the multiple tenants the project intends to draw.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex County is one of the state's largest industrial
markets. It has been accommodating companies looking for regional
locations, with the New Jersey Turnpike corridor, especially the
stretch from Exit 10 south to exit 8A, drawing much of the
attention. The Starwood Heller project in Edison is not far from
Exit 10.
</P>
<P>
   Grubb &AMP; Ellis put the third-quarter industrial vacancy rate in
the county at about 3.4 percent, down from 4.5 percent for the same
period in 1997. In that same time average per square foot asking
rents rose by 29 cents to $4.60 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are competing for the same tenants who are shopping
around,'' Della Salla said, noting that more than 4 million square
feet of warehouse/distribution space was under construction or
proposed in the county in both build-to-suit and speculative
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it is in Edison, where the largest of the speculative
projects is under way. A 1.3-million-square-foot development
consisting of office, warehouse and distribution space in three
connecting buildings is rising on 50 acres in a 410-acre industrial
park at the foot of Mill Road in the eastern sector of the
township. The developer is Heller Industrial Parks of Edison, which
owns the park (and has no connection with Starwood Heller).
</P>
<P>
   Heller Industrial Parks president Jeffrey Milanaik said the
first 250,000-square-foot building had been fully rented at $4 to
$4.25 a square foot as has 50,000 square feet in the second,
480,000-square-foot building. ``Based on that activity we expect
the entire project to be completed and leased by June,'' Milanaik
said. He added, however, that if all the proposed projects are
built there could be a glut.
</P>
<P>
   Heller thinks otherwise. ``There is enough room for everyone to
succeed,'' he said. But to compete, he said, much of the existing
industrial space at the Revlon site, which with its 14-foot high
ceilings is obsolete, will be demolished and replaced with a
250,000-square-foot structure with 28- to 32-foot ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition of the old industrial building is to start next
month, with construction of the new one to begin in March.
Completion will follow nine months later. Rents are expected to be
in the $4 a square foot range or possibly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The possible start of the retail component is still a year away,
Heller said, noting that he was hopeful that a plan could be
devised that the township would support. Otherwise, he said, he
will redevelop those 18 acres as additional office or
warehouse-and-distribution space.

NATIONALISTS OUST TAIPEI MAYOR IN VOTE WATCHED BY CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ The Nationalist Party challenger unseated
Taipei's popular mayor Saturday in a suspenseful election that was
closely watched abroad because of its possible effects on Taiwan's
relations with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Defeating the incumbent by a surprising 51 percent to 46
percent, according to unofficial results, the challenger, Ma
Yin-jeou, 48, established himself as a new star of the Nationalist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether you voted for me or not, my victory
is everybody's victory,'' he said Saturday night in a speech to
tens of thousands of wildly celebrating supporters in midtown
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the mayoral contest, the Nationalist Party reasserted
itself across much of Taiwan. In elections for the national
legislature, which was expanded to include 225 representatives, the
party won a commanding 124 seats, according to preliminary
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the mayoral contest, considered too close to call,
that captivated the country. By defeating Chen Shui-bian, 47, Ma
set back the career of a man considered a major contender for the
presidency in elections in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's Democratic Progressive Party pledges to seek eventual
independence from mainland China, which regards Taiwan as a
renegade province. The party's ascension to national power would
raise tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, while promoting Taiwan's
separate status in the world, is formally committed to eventual
reunification with the mainland. This symbolic gesture is
considered crucial by China, which threatens to attack if Taiwan
ever declares legal independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters are giving the Kuomintang another chance,'' said
Andrew Yang, a political scientist at National Sun Yat-sen
University in Kaohsiung. But Yang said the approval of many voters
was contingent on further efforts by the party to rid itself of
cronyism, to make its internal operations more democratic and to
define a program for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were a major setback for the Democratic
Progressive Party, which was born in the 1980s in opposition to the
Nationalist dictatorship that dated to 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek
fled the Communist victory on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Chen became Taiwan's first directly elected mayor in 1994 and
won high public approval for improving traffic flows and attacking
vice. But some saw him as high-handed and he lost ground Saturday
in former strongholds where his efforts to suppress karaoke bars
and prostitution cost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He met his match in Ma, a former justice minister and a graduate
of Harvard Law School who is known for his scrupulous honesty.
There were few substantive issues in the campaign. Ma promised to
do a better job and make Taipei a ``world class city.'' Handsome
and vigorous, he used a drawing of a jogger as his campaign logo.
</P>
<P>
   Ma was greatly helped as many members of the New Party, _ which
comprises breakaway Nationalists who are strong supporters of
reunification with the mainland _ deserted their own candidate to
support him and insure the defeat of Chen. In legislative
elections, too, the New Party suffered a collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Ma overcame a feared bias against ``mainlanders'' _ those from
families that fled China in 1949 _ who are sometimes resented by
the majority of ``native'' Taiwanese. Ma was born in Hong Kong and
moved here when he was 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to work with you all together,'' he said in his
victory speech, extolling his ethnically inclusive concept of a
``new Taiwan person.'' At one point he switched from Mandarin
Chinese to the Taiwan dialect.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's popular president, Lee Teng-hui of the Nationalist
Party, says he will step down after this term. Within Nationalist
Party circles Ma is considered too young and inexperienced to run
in 2000, and he has not been close to Lee or the party
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But his victory and the party's strong national showing have
prevented a serious crisis of confidence in the party. Vice
President Lien Chan and another party heavyweight, James Soong, are
considered leading contenders for nomination for the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Chen remains the best-known opposition figure, popular in much
of Taiwan, and political experts here do not count him out as a
candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Before a dejected crowd Saturday night, Chen offered
congratulations to Ma and said, ``I hope he can fulfill the city's
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I lost,'' he said, ``I feel my team has done a good
job in making Taipei a better place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare plus for the Democratic Progressives, Frank Hsieh,
their candidate for mayor of the second-largest city, Kaohsiung,
was a surprise victor by a narrow margin over the Nationalist
incumbent, Wu Den-yih.
</P>
<P>
   Taipei itself was quiet Saturday after a week of frenzied
campaigning. Residents strolled to neighborhood polling places in
schools, fire stations and temples where they stamped their choices
for mayor, city council and the national legislature on long paper
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters marveled at a democratic process that in just one
decade has become deeply ingrained.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the late 1980s did the Nationalists give free rein to
the building opposition. The first direct legislative elections
were in 1991, the first mayoral elections in the two major cities
were in 1994, and the first presidential election was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-buying has been a problem, especially on the part of the
wealthy and well-organized Nationalists, but it is declining and
mainly confined to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the elections are peaceful and well organized, and after
we get the results everyone will accept them,'' said Tseng Li-ming,
a 64-year-old bank officer, as he left the midtown college where he
voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you don't do a good job, you'll get voted out,'' he
said.

 &HT;    PRO-INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT SUFFERS ELECTION DEFEAT IN TAIWAN
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ For weeks, Chinese leaders have fidgeted just
over the horizon as democratic Taiwan neared bellwether elections
that would test whether Taiwanese are aching for full independence
from the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, to the relief of Beijing and likely Washington as
well, millions of Taiwanese delivered a loud mandate for caution.
With a turnout of over 67 percent, the voters signaled in mayoral
and parliamentary results that they don't want to risk confronting
China's threat to ``use force'' in case Taiwan declares
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent advocate of an eventual ``Taiwan Republic,''
Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian, was beaten by a 53-47
percent margin in what had been viewed as a neck-and-neck bid for
his re-election as mayor of the capital city, Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a native-born Taiwanese with an earthy charisma, had been
expected to vault from this election to a strong run for the
presidency in 2000 on a pro-independence platform. Although
thousands of his tearful supporters greeted the defeated Chen with
chants of ``President, President,'' it appeared that he and other
pro-independence figures will have difficulty re-establishing
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this election had turned out in Mr. Chen's favor, it would
be another of those aggravating factors that would be perceived as
making the government in Beijing more nervous,'' said Ramon Myers
of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, one of several
American experts on Taiwan monitoring the election. He said both
Washington and Beijing would be relieved at the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was knocked out of his City Hall power base by Nationalist
Party challenger Ma Ying-jeou, a descendant of the mainland Chinese
elite that took control of the government when it was forced to
flee here after the 1949 communist takeover of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   With a boyish charm and a Harvard Law School pedigree, Ma
attracted voters who wanted peace and stability. To Beijing, Ma was
the lesser of two evils in the race, since he and his party stand
for Taiwan's eventual reunification with mainland China rather than
Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   As firecrackers popped all over downtown Taipei, thousands of Ma
supporters rejoiced outside his downtown headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Taiwan has a shadow in their minds,'' said Daniel
Chan, a 38-year-old schoolteacher. ``They are always afraid of
being attacked by mainland China. I think Mr. Ma can give us a more
stable situation. Tonight I can feel safer about my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's pro-independence Progressive Party also lost heavily in
races for parliamentary seats throughout Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The big winner was the long-ruling Nationalist Party, which
roared back to reconsolidate its power following six years of
steady slippage attributed to the party's past reputation for
favoritism and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's Central Election Commission said that throughout
Taiwan, the Nationalists had won 46 percent of popular votes in
races for the parliament, far ahead of the runner-up Progressive
Party's 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome increased the Nationalists' share of the next
parliament and guaranteed the ruling party enough seats to avoid
having to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most avid observers of the Taiwan election were the
six mainland Chinese government advisers on Taiwan relations, who
have been here for 10 days conducting quiet meetings on the fringes
of the election campaign at the invitation of a Taiwanese
educational institute.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on the eve of the election as they toured a newspaper
aimed at Taiwanese children, Chinese delegation member Su Ge said
the group from Beijing is ``concerned'' about a clause in the
Progressive Party platform calling for an independent Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Su said, however, that Taiwan's commitment to holding democratic
elections would not ``cause a barrier to reunification'' if Taiwan
ultimately agrees to return to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Taiwan can continue their economic and political
structures unchanged, and mainland China can continue with its
structure and systems,'' said Su, a former diplomat who is
assistant president of Beijing's Foreign Affairs College. ``We
can't have one side lord it over the other side, or as we might
say, one side swallow the other side.''

 &HT;    CLINTON CALLS FOR NATIONAL WAITING PERIOD FOR GUN BUYERS
 &HT;    350&AMP;add.
 &HT;    Eds: Subs for the previously budgeted SOCIAL-RADIO.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Saturday he would ask
Congress next year to impose a national waiting period on handgun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly national radio address, Clinton said a federally
mandated delay between the purchase and delivery of a handgun would
be one of his top priorities. He did not indicate how many days he
would seek. Many states already impose a delay, but the time
periods vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This 'cooling-off' period will help prevent rash acts of
violence and give authorities more time to stop illegal gun
purchases,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the national handgun waiting period, Clinton said
he would ask Congress for a lifetime ban on gun ownership for
juveniles convicted of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why young people convicted of violent crimes
should be allowed to buy guns on their 21st birthday,'' Clinton
said, ``and I want to thank Sen. Bob Dole for his recent strong
public support of this idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call for a ban on gun ownership for juveniles
convicted of violent crimes comes after a year in which the nation
has been shocked by children gunning down their classmates in
schools, and then frustrated to learn that the killers would be
free when they became adults.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he also was concerned that guns sold at gun
shows might not be subject to federal laws requiring background
checks. Clinton said he would ask Attorney General Janet Reno and
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin `` to find ways to close this
loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida last month passed a constitutional amendment allowing
counties to require background checks for sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said national background checks by the Justice
Department began last week, and that over 100,000 checks blocked
more than 400 convicted felons from purchasing guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more that 100 illegal gun sales blocked each day. Who
knows how many lives were saved?'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton noted the new checks have been challenged in
federal court by the National Rifle Association. Clinton said he
would oppose any efforts to weaken the Brady Bill, which
established the checks.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Republican radio address that follows Clinton's,
Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida outlined GOP goals for reforming
Social Security. Shaw will be one of the participants in the White
House Social Security conference Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who will be chairman of the House Ways and Means Social
Security subcommittee when the new Congress convenes next month,
called Social Security ``one of the best things about America.''
</P>
<P>
   But the congressman, a father of four and grandfather of eight,
noted that the program's long-range financial future is in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said Republicans would seek to reform the system in ways
that would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Protect current and future retirees, especially women.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improve fairness across generational lines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maintain the safety net for the needy and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide new options for younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   While not offering specifics of those options, Republicans, in
general, have supported allowing workers to directly invest a
portion of their payroll taxes toward their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw echoed other Republican leaders in calling on Clinton to
offer a plan for reforming Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how Social Security reforms always began in the past,
and we agree with the president that we should save Social Security
first,'' Shaw said. ``Because the president is elected by all the
people, he alone is best positioned to build a bipartisan consensus
to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has indicated that Clinton will not offer a plan
if it appears _ as they believe it does now _ that doing so would
polarize debate over reform.

JURY FINDS OFFICIALS NOT TO BLAME IN DEATH OF WITNESS' MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A jury on Friday rejected the assertions of a
witness in a murder case who sued local authorities on the basis
that they failed to protect his mother, who was killed in a
drive-by shooting after he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Cooksey, 37, said officials from the city of Compton,
Calif., and Los Angeles County had a duty to protect him and his
mother, Viola Woods, in exchange for his testimony. Though Cooksey
was placed in protective custody at a hotel, Ms. Woods, 51, was
not.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woods, who was often homeless, was shot and killed while
walking down a street in the Watts section of Los Angeles on Aug.
6, 1994, 12 days after Cooksey said he received a death threat that
mentioned his mother. Cooksey had testified at a preliminary
hearing in the murder case nine months before.
</P>
<P>
   The Superior Court jury, which began deliberations late
Wednesday, found that the county was not negligent in failing to
protect Ms. Woods. Though jurors found the City of Compton
negligent, they did not award Cooksey damages for infliction of
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Cooksey's case was in part the impetus for a law that took
effect in California this year creating a comprehensive statewide
witness protection program and setting aside $3 million to pay for
it. The case inspired some of the bill's provisions, including one
requiring a written agreement between the witness and the
authorities. Cooksey asserted that he was verbally assured that his
mother would be protected but that the authorities failed to follow
through on the promise.
</P>
<P>
   Cooksey had testified at a preliminary hearing for Regis Thomas,
a reputed gang member who was a suspect in the killing of two
Compton police officers in February 1993. Cooksey was arrested on
an unrelated charge a month later, and told investigators that
Thomas had bragged to him about shooting the officers and had given
him a gun, which Cooksey sold.
</P>
<P>
   Cooksey helped police recover the weapon, which matched the
results of a ballistics test, and agreed to testify against Thomas,
who was convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Compton and the county questioned the authenticity
of the death threat Cooksey said he received, and maintained that
they had made efforts to find Ms. Woods and find a place for her to
stay. No direct link was ever established between Cooksey's
testimony and his mother's death; no suspect in Ms. Woods' killing
was ever arrested, and police believe the bullet that killed her
may have been intended for rival gang members on the street at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Two other legal claims in Cooksey's suit were dismissed midway
through the trial, when the judge ruled that there was no special
relationship established between the authorities and Ms. Woods that
required them to protect her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a witness protection case,'' said Peter Glick, a
lawyer who defended the county. ``There's no credible evidence that
Ms. Woods' killing was related in any way to Calvin Cooksey
testifying. There was no evidence of a special relationship that
would place liability on the County of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooksey's lawyer, Daniel Rodriguez, said that his client's
criminal record made him an unsympathetic plaintiff, and that the
verdict could be a disincentive to the authorities to protect
witnesses and their families.

 &HT;    Campaign funding focus predicts more attack ads, soft money
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Academics, political consultants and journalists
gathered at the National Press Club last week to digest the results
of the Nov. 3 elections, focusing not on who won or lost but on how
the game was played.
</P>
<P>
   Such academic exchanges usually produce a wide variety of
conflicting opinions. But on one point, the group agreed: the
federal system of contribution limits enacted after Watergate is
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barriers are down,'' said Alex Castellanos, a noted
Republican media consultant. ``Really, there are no rules.''
</P>
<P>
   While analysts differ over whether this development is good or
bad for American democracy, the implications for the 2000 elections
are already clear:
</P>
<P>
   _ The two political parties, which many believed were becoming
increasingly irrelevant in American elections, have re-emerged as
the dominant players. Issue ads, produced by the parties and funded
by unregulated soft money, greatly expanded the reach of the
parties in 1998 and will be an even bigger force in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Campaign advertising will become even more negative.
Researchers for the Annenberg Public Policy Center here found that
60 percent of the issue ads produced by the political parties after
Sept. 1 were ``pure attack.'' Voters across the country who
complained about the negative advertising and who turned out in
record low numbers this year, will likely see even more negative
advertising in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unions, corporations and other special interest groups
historically barred from giving to campaigns will contribute even
greater sums of unregulated soft money to the two major political
parties, which will then spend it on issue ads in targeted races.
The influx of soft money will ensure that the airwaves are
saturated with political advertising and, some argue, put more
pressure on the parties to reward the contributors with favorable
legislation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money that is coming in is coming in from interests whose
goal is simple: to get public policy decisions to benefit them,''
said Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, an opponent of soft money.
``Very often that comes at the expense of the voter, the taxpayer.
If you wonder why tobacco legislation or health care legislation
gets all bogged up in Congress and you never get to decisions on
the merits, I suggest you look at all the money pouring into the
parties for soft money ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax exemption exploitation
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer estimates that unregulated soft money contributions
to the political parties could reach $750 million in 2000, more
than three times the amount donated in 1996. Federal law bars
unions and corporations from giving directly to candidates, but
they can give unlimited amounts of soft money _ intended for
general party-building activities _ to parties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the two parties collected soft money contributions and
spent much them on issue advertisements for President Clinton and
GOP nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the political parties adopted the same strategy toward
the congressional midterm elections, channeling millions in soft
money to issue ads in specific states and districts. Issue ads,
even if they mention a candidate by name, are not subject to the
same funding restrictions as candidate ads, which must be paid for
with money raised from individuals in donations of no more than
$1,000 per election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, millions of unregulated donations also flowed to
outside groups, many of which exploited their tax-exempt status to
accept contributions and channel them into issue ads targeted at
specific candidates. Many analysts predicted the influence of these
groups to be even bigger in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the political advocacy of independent organizations in
individual Congressional races paled in comparison to the money
spent on issue ads by the two major parties. The Annenberg Center
estimates the two parties spent around $66 million on issue ads,
with Republicans outspending Democrats 2 to 1. But that figure
doesn't include the amount state parties kicked in to match the
national party contributions to produce the ads.
</P>
<P>
   After Sept. 1, the two political parties accounted for 70
percent of the more than 400 issue ads appearing on television,
with only 11 independent organizations accounting for the remaining
30 percent, Annenberg found.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Owens, who heads the Internal Revenue Service's divisions
on tax exempt organizations, said there appeared to be less
activity from tax exempts but that may only have been because 1998
was not a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen what happens in about a year when the
presidential elections start heating up,'' Owens said. ``Then we'll
see if there has been a sea change here.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the outside spending was decidedly mixed.
Americans for Job Security, a trade association representing large
insurance companies, reportedly spent $1.8 million against Rep.
Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) in New Jersey's 6th Congressional District.
Pallone captured 57 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate GOP group 3-for-9
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation for Responsible Government, a moderate
Republican-leaning group which spent more than $800,000 in nine
Congressional Districts, lost six races and won only three.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups may have amassed the clearest track record.
The Sierra Club, which spent $6 million in 1997 and 1998 on issue
ads, voter guides and field operations, won 20 out of 23 targeted
races. The group ran negative ads against several incumbents who
lost, including Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
(R-N.Y.) and Rep. Bill Redmond (R-N.M.). It's impossible to
determine if the group's spending was the deciding factor in any of
these contests.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, head of the Annenberg Center, argued
that the diminished role of outside groups and the increased
activity of the parties was essentially a positive development in
1998. Voters have an easier time understanding the agenda of the
political parties than they do outside organizations that may not
be familiar to them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With parties running negative ads, candidates themselves were
free to run more ads that were either positive or contrasted their
record with that of their opponent, Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
   The money spent on issue ads by the political parties also
produced mixed results. The Republican Party spent more than the
Democrats on congressional races, but ended up losing five seats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outspent Republicans in North Carolina and pulled off
an upset with the election of trial lawyer John Edwards over
Faircloth. Yet in Wisconsin, Republicans poured at least $1 million
and perhaps $2 million into issue ads to defeat Sen. Russell
Feingold (D-Wis.) and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold was the chief Democratic sponsor of campaign finance
reform legislation in the Senate. The bill, which was blocked by
Republicans, would have banned soft money to the political parties
and made issue ads launched in the last 60 days of a campaign
subject to the same funding guidelines as candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that many analysts considered political suicide,
Feingold refused an offer from the Democratic Party to counter the
GOP ads with issue ads of its own. When the Democratic Party
decided to run ads anyway, Feingold demanded that the party stop
advertising on his behalf, a public show of integrity that may have
worked to his ultimate advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to have a Wisconsin-based, restrained campaign
that responded to the thing that I have heard Wisconsinites say
over and over again,'' said Feingold, who won by 35,000 votes.
``They believe, like most Americans, that campaigns are too long,
too expensive and too negative.

 &HT;    Stores offer broad range of topics for business-minded reader
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seldom in recent years have gift-givers had such a
broad range of topics to choose from in the business, economics and
investment sections of bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   There's this year's bearish stock market, the many fables and
foibles of American business, the escalation of the importance of
cyberspace in our lives and, of course, the approach of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   No article about books in this genre can do more than point the
way, which is all this attempts to do. The best advice is to visit
a good bookstore and browse.
</P>
<P>
   Being gift suggestions, these are all hardback books. But good
paperbacks are also available, and less costly.
</P>
<P>
   As for price, an effort was made to keep the list as inexpensive
as possible. If those on the list appear pricey, it's because books
are pricey.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Wall Street emerged as one of the most important topics
of 1998, given the number of us who have retirement money in mutual
funds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A timely arrival was ``The Bear Book: Survive and Profit in
Ferocious Markets'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $24.95). Author John
Rothchild aims to convince investors they can make money in a bear
market as well as in a bull market. This has been a good year to
test his thesis, and we may get another chance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the revised and updated edition of ``Stocks for the
Long Run'' (McGraw-Hill, $29.95), a landmark study of the stock
market by Wharton economics professor Jeremy J. Siegel. It makes a
compelling case that common stocks really are the best long-term
investment.
</P>
<P>
   In ``What Works on Wall Street: A Guide to the Best-Performing
Investment Strategies of All Time'' (McGraw-Hill, $29.95), money
manager James P. O'Shaughnessy looks at the many strategies
investors have used to make money. This is a good reference book.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone interested in the history of investment markets,
``Wall Street: A History'' (Oxford, $30) by Charles R. Geisst is
readable and authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there are many ``how-to-do-it'' books for people
interested in the techniques of personal finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiplinger's Practical Guide to Your Money'' (Kiplinger Books,
$29.95) by Ted Miller, editor of Kiplinger's Personal Finance
Magazine, is a comprehensive example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Schwab's Guide to Financial Independence: Simple
Solutions for Busy People'' (Crown, $23) comes from the man who
pioneered discount investing.
</P>
<P>
   More complex is ``Contrarian Investment Strategies: Beat the
Market by Going Against the Crowd'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25), by
Wall Street money manager and frequently quoted mutual fund
executive David Dreman.
</P>
<P>
   Author Peter Siris sees brokers and other market pros as the
investor's chief adversary in ``Guerrilla Investing: Winning
Strategies for Beating the Wall Street Professionals'' (Longstreet,
$24).
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for Wall Street's turmoil this year is the
nature of the new global economy. Several very good books offer
insights into how the global economy got that way and what may come
next.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complete is ``The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:
Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor'' (Norton, $30). With wit,
wisdom and authority, Harvard historian David S. Landes provides
valuable insights on why today's world is the way it is,
economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government and
the Marketplace That Is Remaking the Modern World'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $26), authors Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw look at
the post-Cold War world and the forces that enabled the West's
market economy to prevail over the Soviet-brand command economy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest engines driving global economic change is the
computer, and the worldwide network of computers known as
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   For history-minded readers, here's a recent book that
demonstrates the Internet is not the first technology that
revolutionized our lives. In ``The Victorian Internet: The
Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's
On-Line Pioneers'' (Walker, $22), Tom Standage shows how the
telegraph did to 19th century society what the computer and
Internet are doing to ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy''
(Harvard Business School Press, $29.95), by Carl Shapiro and Hal R.
Varian, warns those who must apply the new technology not to ignore
``basic economic principles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wired magazine Executive Editor Kevin Kelly takes a
different position in ``New Rules for the New Economy'' (Viking,
$19.95), contending the new economy of networking has changed the
rules and you'd better know them to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On a more practical level, author Patricia Seybold explains
business via the Internet is already widely popular with business,
and is likely to become more popular with consumers. Her book is
``Customers.Com: How to Create a Profitable Business Strategy for
the Internet and Beyond'' (Times Business, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is our fascination with the movers
and shakers of business, living and dead. Biographies are among the
most readable of gift books.
</P>
<P>
   The all-capitals part of the title of ``TITAN: The Life of John
D. Rockefeller Sr.'' (Random House, $30) reminds us how few titans
there are in today's structured business environment. Author Ron
Chernow's portrait of one of the biggest of America's 19th century
robber barons is compelling and highly readable.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Welch, General Electric's chief executive officer, has been
the subject of at least two mostly favorable books in recent years.
In the latest _ ``Jack Welch, General Electric, and the Pursuit of
Profit'' (Knopf, $29.95) _ author and former Wall Street Journal
reporter Thomas F. O'Boyle is considerably less friendly to the
head of one of the world's most admired corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Another personality book is ``In Sam We Trust: The Untold Story
of Sam Walton and How Wal-Mart Is Devouring America'' (Time Books,
$25.95). Author and journalist Bob Ortega clearly admires his
subject, the legendary founder of the Wal-Mart chain. But as the
subtitle suggests, he is also concerned with the devastating impact
Walton's price-cutting strategy has had on small business.
</P>
<P>
   Bigness is the focus of Bruce Wasserstein's ``Big Deal: The
Battle for Control of America's Leading Corporations'' (Warner
Books, $30). A deal maker himself, the author takes the reader on a
tour of some of the biggest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work In Progress'' (Random House $27.95) is Michael Eisner's
account of how he and his partners rescued the legendary Walt
Disney Co. from near-disaster and went on to create one of the
world's biggest entertainment-communications empires.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the coming millennium has already inspired a
host of books, with more to come in 1999. Many are apocalyptic in
nature.
</P>
<P>
   But there are books available for readers looking for upbeat and
logical forecasts of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roaring 2000s: Building the Wealth and Lifestyle You
Desire in the Greatest Boom in History'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) is
an updating of Harry S. Dent's earlier book on the same subject. He
contends baby boomers, just now entering their peak spending and
investment years, will fuel unprecedented economic growth for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Kiplinger, editor-in-chief of Kiplinger's Personal
Finance Magazine and The Kiplinger Washington Letter, argues in
``World Boom Ahead: Why Business and Consumers Will Prosper''
(Kiplinger Books, $27.95) that we are on the threshold of an
unprecedented surge of economic prosperity, driven by technology.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything on the business bookshelf has to be serious, of
course. Here, too, gift shoppers have much from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   For humor, there is Dilbert, whose latest misadventures are
chronicled in ``Journey to Cubeville'' (Andrews McMeel, $19.95) by
author Scott Adams. The ``Everyman'' geek of the computer era has
become a cult cartoon figure (and Atlanta Journal-Constitution
regular).
</P>
<P>
   Satirist P.J. O'Rourke tackles the topic that fascinates
everybody _ money _ in ``Eat the Rich: A Treatise on Economics''
(Atlantic Monthly Press, $24).
</P>
<P>
   ``Pickup Trucks: A History of the Great American Vehicle''
(Black Dog &AMP; Levanthal, $24.98) offers an affectionate look at the
vehicle that has come to dominate interstates as well as back
roads. Justin Lukach explains why.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous reference books of value to someone in, or
interested in, business, investments and economics.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point for a reference shelf is Stuart Crainer's
``The Ultimate Business Library: 50 Books That Shaped Management
Thinking'' (Amacom, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   As the subtitle suggests, it is about the most important
business books in this century.

 &HT;    Know where your donations are going
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During the holiday season, you may give to charities
``from the heart.'' But be sure to use your mind also to avoid
wasting your money.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday spirit leads many people to give more freely, and
solicitors _ honest and dishonest _ know this. Americans annually
give more than $100 billion to charities and other nonprofit groups
_ and about $1 billion goes to frauds.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Mendoza, a Columbus resident who is a national board
member of AARP, said a recent survey by the organization showed
that Americans over the age of 25 receive more than five charitable
solicitations per week by mail or telephone, with most people
deciding to contribute during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   To give wisely, there are three basic guidelines to follow:
</P>
<P>
   _ Look out for fraudulent or misleading charity solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check out the accounting and spending practices of legitimate
charities to ensure they are using your donations as you want.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are looking for an income tax deduction, be sure the
organization is not only tax-exempt but also ``qualified'' as
tax-deductible by the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most charity fund raising is done honestly and for good
purposes, there are con artists that take advantage of Americans'
generosity,'' said Edward Smith, president of the Atlanta Better
Business Bureau. ``But proceed carefully, and you can spot them.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips that will help you avoid fraudulent or
misleading solicitations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch out for ``copycat'' names. A shyster group may use a
name very similar to a well-known charity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reject high-pressure sales. Legitimate charities will welcome
your gift whenever you want to send it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look out for vague appeals. A legitimate charity will clearly
state its purpose, and provide written materials about its
operations and finances if you ask.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't give out credit card numbers, checking account numbers,
Social Security numbers and other personal information to unknown
telephone charity solicitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Say no to ``runners.'' Some charity cons will offer to send
someone to your house to pick up your contribution. That's a fast
way to say goodbye to your money.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Smith, look out for heart-rending appeals, full of
tears but short on facts. ``Don't give to a group simply because
`children' or `hurricane victims' or any other sympathy pull is
included in the name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ways to check things out
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate charities are just that _ honest. But they may still
be spending contributions in ways you would disapprove. They might,
for example, be spending too much on salaries and administration
expenses, not enough on helping their cause. There are, however,
several ways to check on them.
</P>
<P>
   First, you may ask the soliciting organization to send you a
copy of its most current certified audit and annual report. Even a
newly established charity should be able to provide a program
brochure and budget plan for collected funds.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources of information include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Atlanta BBB evaluates local and national soliciting
organizations based on a set of standards. For information on
charities and a copy of the bureau's charitable standards, call
404-688-4910 or write to P.O. Box 2707, Atlanta, GA 30301-2707.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus has published a holiday edition of its newsletter,
``Give but Give Wisely,'' which evaluates national charities on 23
standards. For a free copy, send a self-addressed, stamped
business-size envelope to Holiday Giving, Council of Better
Business Bureaus, 4200 Wilson Blvd., Suite 800, Arlington, VA
22203.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Charities Information Bureau publishes a
quarterly newsletter, ``Wise Giving Guide.'' The first copy is
free, but there is a charge for subsequent issues if you want them.
Write to NCIB, 19 Union Square West, New York, NY 10003.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Georgia, call the secretary of state's office at
404-656-3920 to see if a charity is registered with the state. But
remember that a registration is only that _ it does not constitute
official approval. The state's information on charities may also be
accessed on the Internet at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.sos.state.ga.us/securities/charitysearch/htm.
</P>
<P>
   Rules for deductions
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to take an income tax deduction for your charitable
contribution, there are several important IRS rules to remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ You can deduct contributions only if you make them to a
``qualified organization'' as determined by the IRS. This means the
group is not only tax-exempt, but that your donation to the group
is deductible by you. All tax-exempt groups are not tax-deductible.
</P>
<P>
   _ A charitable donation is deductible only if you itemize your
deductions. If you do itemize, you will need an official receipt
for any gift of $250 or more. A canceled check is not an adequate
receipt.
</P>
<P>
   _ You may only deduct the portion of a donation that is truly
given away. You cannot take a full tax deduction on your gift if
you received anything of value in return, such as a dinner or
tickets to some affair. The value of what you received has to be
subtracted from what you gave.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some donations are not tax-deductible, including items such as
volunteer time and services and gifts to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   There are various IRS rules that apply to large donations to
charities. This gets very tricky, and you should consult a tax
attorney if you are considering a large donation.

 &HT;    Santa's waiting for e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You won't be surprised to learn the North Pole is
wired with the latest in T3 high-speed data lines and the finest
and most powerful of servers. Santa Claus, after all, does not mess
around.
</P>
<P>
   Kids have been writing letters to Santa for a long time now.
Each year, the post office routes any letter addressed to Santa
Claus at the North Pole to helpers who answer them if they can.
This is the busy season. If you or a young one wants to write Santa
online, you'll find there are many mysterious ways to reach Saint
Nick.
</P>
<P>
   We'll list some of the Web sites here that offer free letters
from Santa. Your child can write a note to Santa, using the e-mail
address on the Web page, and receive an answer by e-mail. The sites
we will visit today offer this cyber-fast connection to Santa free.
There are also places on the Web that charge _ but no child should
have to pay to get a letter from Santa, so we'll ignore them, and
you probably should, too.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop for the day is a Web site maintained by a
commercial storefront on the Net called the Christmas Store. But
despite the commercial nature of the site, you won't pay to write a
letter to Santa using the link on the page at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .holidaytree.com/xmasnt.html. In fact, you might urge your child
to really pull out the stops and write the best possible letter.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small prize, $100, for the best letter to Santa
received at the site. While that amount might not change your
Christmas dramatically, it sure wouldn't hurt. As you'd expect,
there are also links to various products and services sold from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas, of course, knows no nationality. So don't think it
odd that we're stopping next at the UK Online Pages at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .uk-online.com/christms
</P>
<P>
   /letter.htm. This site makes it easy, if a bit impersonal, to
send Santa a list of presents your child wants. Just fill in the
blanks, hit the button and the letter wings its way to the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom has more than its share of Christmas letter
sites, and we'll visit an excellent one next. It's called Christmas
and Santa Letter and is located at http://www.north-pole.co.uk
</P>
<P>
   /index5.htm. Not only can your child use the link on this site
to write a letter to Santa, there also is a link that will let
anyone send some of the prettiest electronic Christmas cards you'll
find on the Web. There's no cost for that service, either, and the
whole family probably will enjoy this place. The electronic
Christmas cards come in all varieties, including religious themes
and funny ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus Online also offers a fine way to send e-mail to the
North Pole at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .santaclausonline.com/
</P>
<P>
   santapages/letter.html.

   You'll find a form to fill out on this page. Then, just a bit
after you press the button to send your e-mail to Santa, you'll get
a canned reply. While most of the letter is traditional in nature,
some plugs for the products on the commercial site are included at
the bottom. So some parents may wish to avoid this site if the
notion of blending the commercial with the sublime bothers them.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. This is just a sampling of the places where
your child can write Santa. The selection is so broad you are sure
to be able to find the kind of site that appeals to your family.
Just use your favorite search engine and type in these search
terms: santa, online, letter. You'll get screenful after screenful
of sites that blend the old-fashioned spirit of the season with
this new-fangled Internet.

 &HT;    Newcomers settling in at Delta's controls
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fred Reid doesn't know all the gory details behind the
management overhaul that brought him to Delta Air Lines _ nor does
he particularly care to.
</P>
<P>
   ``For reasons truly unknown to me, Delta got a guy named Leo,
and Leo called Fred, and here I am,'' said Reid, hired away from
Lufthansa last summer to become Delta's executive vice
president-marketing.
</P>
<P>
   While Reid isn't dwelling on Delta's past, he is among a quartet
of newcomers who'll play a big role in the future of Atlanta's
largest corporate employer.
</P>
<P>
   They are the four executive vice presidents brought in from
outside the company by Chief Executive Leo Mullin, who was hired
last year to replace longtime CEO Ronald Allen and reinvigorate
Delta's strategies and service image.
</P>
<P>
   The makeover culminated this fall with the hiring of Robert
Colman from General Electric as executive vice president-human
resources and the appointment of retired Air Force Gen. Malcolm
``Mac'' Armstrong as executive vice president-operations. It
started in April with the hiring of Warren Jenson, previously
finance chief at NBC, as executive vice president-chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   All four replaced Allen lieutenants eased out by Mullin, who has
kept only two holdovers in his top echelon: Chief Operating Officer
Maurice Worth and Vicki Escarra, executive vice president-customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top management at Delta has turned over more completely and
quickly than I can remember at an airline that wasn't bankrupt,''
said Ray Neidl, airline analyst at ING Barings Furman Selz.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, the newcomers talked about the issues and
priorities facing them:
</P>
<P>
   Fred Reid: ``Our rightful place''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, whose domain includes route and pricing strategies,
international alliances and consumer marketing, believes Delta is
rapidly repairing service quality. The next task is to convince
skeptical customers of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key challenge is to find a way to communicate with our
passengers positively, yet realistically, that we are well on our
way to restoring our rightful place as one of the finer airlines in
the world,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has improved its industry rank in on-time performance and
mishandled baggage this year, he noted. ``By the middle of next
year, we will have put new interiors in all our planes and
radically upgraded our international business-class product.''
</P>
<P>
   To help push that message, Reid said, Delta's balloon-filled
``On Top of the World'' ad campaign may be brought down to Earth a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe sometime in 1999 we will go back to consumers with a
message saying, `OK, here's what we've done; here's what we've
accomplished in precise terms. We can always do better and will
constantly strive to do so.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 48, is a smooth industry veteran who spent 22 years in
Europe. A San Francisco native and University of
California-Berkeley graduate, he went overseas for Pan Am and
American and then moved to Lufthansa, rising to chief operating
officer. At Delta, he replaced Robert Coggin.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's major strategic challenge at Delta lies in beefing up its
international alliance network, considered weak compared with
competing pacts such as United's five-way Star Alliance or
American's planned Oneworld team, to include British Airways and
others.
</P>
<P>
   While Delta has a solid partnership with Swissair and separate
deals with assorted other carriers, it's been jilted by a few
partners in recent years. ``Delta has occasionally been inattentive
in this area, and that's dead and gone,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate goal is broader ties with Air France, a partner
added last year. But Delta faces a fight for Air France's
affections from rival Continental, which also needs better European
connections.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Delta's weakest theater, the carrier soon will cement a
deal with China Southern but has only one other pact, with Korean
Air.
</P>
<P>
   Reid also takes charge of Delta's fledgling expansion in Latin
America. Early returns on new routes are mixed, and the Latin
economy is cooling, but Reid said Delta will stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Reid said Delta will continue its focus on the
Atlanta and Cincinnati hubs and on boosting market share in the
hotly contested Washington-New York-Boston corridor. The airline
has de-emphasized hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth and Salt Lake City.
``We are relatively weaker in the West and don't see that as a
critical issue,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Delta will ``aggressively pursue optimal presence
in all sales distribution channels,'' including the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Armstrong: Safety breeds success
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's first airline job was as safety chief at US Airways,
which hired the retired Air Force general in 1995 as it
re-emphasized safety after three crashes in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Armstrong was recruited by Delta as vice
president-safety and compliance, and in October Mullin named him to
succeed Harry Alger as operations chief.
</P>
<P>
   His purview includes daily flight operations and maintenance, as
well as hiring and training of flight crews and mechanics. Along
with Colman, he'll play a big role in relations with Delta's pilot
union, which is talking tough as contract negotiations loom in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   None of those broader duties alters his original priority, said
Armstrong, 56. ``Our first priority has been, is and will continue
to be safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're safe, everything else is easier. It eliminates
disruptions from injury or equipment damage, which means it's a lot
easier to be on time. If you're safe and on time, you have the
resources and energies left to take better care of the customer. So
a lot of good things flow from safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said Delta is boosting on-time rates by getting a
handle on operational snarls earlier in the day and reducing the
domino effect on its hub system.
</P>
<P>
   ``As early as you can, you have to figure out which flights have
to be canceled, then get the planes and crews where they need to be
to reset the airline as quickly as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that approach, we are able to recover from (severe
weather disruptions) in six hours as opposed to about 18 hours if
you just keep grinding away. In six hours you still inconvenience a
lot of people, but in 18 you inconvenience three times as many.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he's also pushing for better coordination with
marketing ``to build a schedule we can realistically handle with
the equipment we have.'' That may mean simply extending flight
times to solve chronic delays, but Armstrong said that's better
than promising an arrival time the airline can't meet.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, a Louisianian educated at Louisiana State University
and Auburn, doesn't consider himself an airline neophyte despite
his limited time in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been in the aviation business for 35 years,'' said
Armstrong, a combat pilot and commander of a 55,000-person air
group during his Air Force career. ``The management challenges are
basically the same whether military or civilian.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Colman: Diluting the angst
</P>
<P>
   The mid-'90s saw Delta endure its first large-scale job cuts.
The turmoil hurt morale and tarnished the company's reputation as
an unusually stable employer.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of new culture will emerge remains unclear, but Colman
will help set the tone as human resources chief.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have a hand in everything from relaxed workplace policies
_ such as last week's lifting of a decades-old beard ban for most
workers _ to weightier matters such as benefits policies and labor
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real need to forge a greater trust and mutual
respect among all segments of the employee group,'' he said. ``They
are looking for better processes and much better communication from
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other major issue is to dilute as much as possible any
angst going into the pilot negotiations,'' Colman added. ``We've
got the best pilots in the industry, and we appreciate them. Having
said that, it's a two-way street, and I'm not sure they appreciate
what they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   (Since the interview, Delta has announced plans to rescind a 2
percent pilot pay cut negotiated in 1996 and boost pay for nonunion
workers as well.)
</P>
<P>
   Colman, 53 but a decade younger in appearance and demeanor, is a
New Jersey native who still vacations on the Jersey shore. He said
he belonged to four different unions while working his way through
school at Bates College in Maine and Vanderbilt University's law
school.
</P>
<P>
   But at Delta, where Colman replaced Robert Adams, he'll try to
keep unions from organizing beyond pilots. Activity has picked up
in the past few years, with two unions now courting flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They promise the stars, but unions are businesses that need
members to survive, and they're selling a product,'' he said. ``We
have our side of the story to tell, and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Colman began his career at Ford Motor Co. and then moved to
General Electric, winding up as a vice president at its jet engine
division in Cincinnati. By happy coincidence, he's an aviation
buff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people who adore airplanes,'' he said. ``I
love to fly in them, be around them, go to the airport. So this is
a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Jenson: Finding the upside
</P>
<P>
   New finance chiefs are often hired for damage control _ with a
mandate to slash costs, juggle debt or scrounge up capital for a
troubled company.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson faces none of that at Delta. He and Mullin inherited a
strong profit rebound. Dropping fuel prices have enabled Delta to
boost spending on staffing and service while holding down overall
costs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jenson, 41, didn't come to Delta to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I took the job was I thought there was a lot of
upside left at Delta,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say Delta made a billion bucks last year, and that's
true. But you have to ask, `What should we be making, and what
should customer service look and feel like, and what kind of cost
disciplines should we have?''' Jenson said.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent much of his eight months at Delta rebuilding his
department _ hiring a new treasurer, controller and investor
relations chief _ and examining processes in other areas. He has
quickly developed a reputation as a bottom-liner with broad
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson said Delta learned the hard way under Allen that cost
controls can't be achieved at the expense of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last place a company should ever go is to anything visible
to the customer,'' he said. ``You look for things you don't need to
do anymore, things that are redundant and ways to do business
smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he was instrumental in imposing tighter rules on
waivers of ticket restrictions and change fees that were costing
Delta millions. The rules were relaxed slightly this fall in the
face of gripes from passengers who regard occasional waivers as a
payback for their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson said the policy has been misconstrued and was only a
small element of a broader effort to instill consistency in
ticket-handling processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we undertook this, we talked to employees and
customers, and the No. 1 thing they told was they wanted
consistency,'' he said. ``This is a work in progress, and nobody
claims we've got it licked, but the goal is a uniform policy and
consistent application.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenson, who replaced Thomas Roeck, is a Utah native and Brigham
Young University graduate. Prior to his NBC job, he worked in
mergers and acquisitions for parent General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson said Delta has ``much greater rigor'' in preparing for
the next downturn than it did for the last one. He doesn't pretend
to know when it will come, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preparing for all sorts of scenarios. Capacity-wise, we
have flexibility to grow, stay flat or contract if necessary. I
have no better crystal ball than you do as to the exact nature of
the economy.''

 &HT;    Gift of investment keeps on giving
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At 13, Justin Oberste already has started saving for
his long-term needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Powder Springs eighth-grader puts a third of his allowance
each week into a savings account. As soon as he gets together $100,
he moves the money into a growth stock mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   His father got him started with a cash gift that opened the
accounts three years ago. Between market appreciation and his own
contributions, he now has about $7,000 squirreled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing is really important to me,'' Justin said. ``I know
I'll be able to get into college and get a good education. I'm just
glad my dad thought of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His story might be an inspiration to other parents and
grandparents this holiday season. Beyond all the toys and other
gifts, it is possible to give presents that will make a long-term
difference to young people.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of an investment may not be as welcomed as toys or as
exciting as something in basic green, but it has different kinds of
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of gift is going to last a lifetime,'' said Wendy
Rausch, a representative of the Stein Roe mutual fund group. ``It
grows along with the child, and it's a valuable educational tool,
teaching about money and investments and how to make them work for
the rest of their lives. I don't know that Barbie or G.I. Joe
necessarily does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things to think about if you want to make gifts of
stock, mutual funds or the traditional U.S. savings bonds:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a lid on transaction costs. If you're going to give $100
worth of stock, you don't want to get whacked with a sales
commission of, say, $25.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at no-load mutual funds, shares in companies that
sell directly to the public, or the very low cost Internet
brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stick with companies your kids can recognize. Don't expect
your child to show much interest in some obscure biotechnology
company, writes analyst Charles B. Carlson in his book, ``The
Individual Investor Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Industries known to kids include fast food, retailing, toys,
entertainment, some communications and technology companies, and
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Explain the gift. Author Neale S. Godfrey suggests you treat
this as an act of parenting, not just giving. You can explain you
are investing in your children's future, she advises, and you can
build in occasions to keep track of the growing value of the
child's investments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select the method you prefer. One is to make an actual gift.
Under the provisions of the Georgia Transfer to Minors Act, you can
make yourself the account custodian. When your child turns 21, he
or she is the owner and can do anything with the money.
</P>
<P>
   A second method is to set up a joint account, or a separate
account you own but earmarked for your child. That way you can
maintain control of how the money is spent. For either method,
remember you'll need your child's Social Security number to open an
account.
</P>
<P>
   If stocks are your choice, direct investment plans are one way
to keep the costs down. About 500 companies now sell their shares
to the public, skipping the stockbroker middleman.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a list of companies with direct purchase plans on
the Internet at http://www.netstockdirect.com. You might also check
libraries or bookstores for Charles B. Carlson's DRIP Investor
newsletter or for his several books.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the shares is easy enough. Usually you call a toll-free
telephone number and ask for information. When it comes in the
mail, you simply fill out a form and write a check.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks. A big one is some of the interesting
companies require high minimums to open an account. For McDonald's,
the opening investment must be at least $1,000. You could buy into
Procter &AMP; Gamble, Tandy or Wal-Mart for $250.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to shop carefully: Some of the companies want
direct investors but only big accounts. ``Some of them have
implemented onerous fees,'' said Carlson. ``It pays to make sure
you read what the company sends and find all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   A second possibility is to buy your shares through a discount
broker on the Internet. There are plenty of them, and fees can run
less than $10 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another method is to transfer to your child shares you
already own. Your broker can tell you about the costs involved.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund shares are also a good gift. To control costs, I
recommend no-load funds _ those that do not charge an upfront sales
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for investors' dollars is fierce these days,
which is why there are nearly 10,000 mutual funds in the
marketplace. Perhaps it's no surprise at least three of them
concentrate on kid-friendly stocks.
</P>
<P>
   They are Stein Roe Young Investor fund (1-800-338-2550), USAA
First Start Growth (1-800-382-8722) and IDS New Dimensions
(1-800-328-8300). All invest in large, growth-oriented companies.
Stein Roe and USAA have no upfront fee. At IDS, ask for ``B''
shares, which have a sales charge only if you sell them within six
years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Savings Bonds are the easiest to buy. Just go to your bank
and write a check. Series EE bonds currently pay 4.6 percent
interest. Inflation-adjusted bonds are paying 5.05 percent right
now. For details, go to http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sav/sav.htm
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback is the low payout. For long-term investments, you
may want to go for the higher returns of stocks, despite their
higher volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For the Oberste family, the choice was the Stein Roe fund.
Justin's father picked it, and Justin likes to check out the
periodic statements he gets in the mail. For him, they mean a
college education, probably at Arkansas State. ``My dad always
wanted me to go there,'' he said. ``He showed me the campus, and it
was just beautiful.

 &HT;    Target market: Your children
 &HT;    By Paige Braddock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The hustle and bustle _ and sheer crush _ of Christmas
advertising envelops kids in a cloud of want. The message is clear:
Consumerism is good.
</P>
<P>
   That puts a lot of heat on parents.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Sheryl Rowier, a Fayette County wife and mother of
three, doesn't like to get in the holiday spirit. But around this
time of year, Rowier starts to dread turning on the television and
opening the mail for fear of being bombarded by ads touting this
toy or that toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (parents) feel a lot of pressure. At least I do,'' said
Rowier, a vice president of human resources at Atlanta Life
Insurance Co. ``By the time I get home, they've picked things out.
'This is what I want. This is what I want.'''
</P>
<P>
   It works.
</P>
<P>
   Kids ages 6-12 play a big part in influencing family spending,
to the tune of $150 billion a year. The kids' biggest influence:
television. For anyone who's ever watched children's programming,
it's a no-brainer that advertisers target kids. But marketers
really crank up to near-frenzy levels during the holiday shopping
season. Nearly half of toy manufacturers' sales occur in the fourth
quarter, according to the NPD Group, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just parents who feel the heat. Any adult who has
money to spend and comes within range of a child during the
holidays can fall victim to the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely get pressure from my niece and nephew for things.
They watch a lot of TV and whatever they see, they want, without
realizing how much things cost,'' said Tangia Walker, an
administrative assistant at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the ads on TV, even before the Rugrats movie came
out, my niece was already asking for an Angelica doll,'' added
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Guilt is major motivator
</P>
<P>
   A hot toy is a combination of advertising and a great toy, said
toy industry expert Christopher Byrne, contributing editor of
Playthings Marketwatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend $10 million to market a toy, but if the kids
don't like it the advertising won't matter,'' said Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   That makes marketing to children a complex and sophisticated
communication process. The goal is to target children in such a way
they pressure their parents or other adults into spending. Adults
buy into it for a number of reasons, but a major one is guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of mothers work full- or part-time outside the
home. As a result, moms have more guilt,'' said Selina S. Guber, a
psychologist and president of Children's Market Research Inc., a
market research firm based in New York. Surveys by Nielsen indicate
children between the ages of 2 and 11 spend up to 28 hours per
week, on average, watching television _ putting them in contact
with quite a bit of market-savvy advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials, of course, are designed to make kids want a
particular toy. Kids often see commercials before their parents and
tend to be extremely brand conscious. And toys are designed to make
a fashion or lifestyle statement. In other words, kids want what's
trendy, Guber added.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is on all year but intensifies during the holiday
season, said Stephen Kline, a communications professor and director
of the media analysis laboratory at Simon Fraser University in
Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get angry,'' said Kline, a communications professor and
director of the media analysis laboratory at Simon Fraser. ``Here I
am trying to get my kids educational toys and all they want are
toys that they're going to lose interest in in a week. Toys are
designed to be out of fashion in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The toy industry learned it was really in the fashion business
with Barbie. ``Mattel's Barbie became a concept, a lifestyle, a
fashion symbol,'' added Kline.
</P>
<P>
   Although not the first, Mattel was one of the early toy
companies to use TV marketing. ``Largely, however, it was Disney
who with the Mickey Mouse Club created the first real opportunity
for advertisers targeting children,'' said Kline.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1950s, marketing to kids was regarded as sacrosanct.
There was the notion children should not be subjected to the same
kind of advertising pressures as adults, but that is no longer the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sabsowitz, an Atlanta mother of two, worries that because
of Barbie's marketing, her 6-year-old already is far too concerned
about image.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter totally buys into all the ads targeting girls. If
she sees two identical things and one has the Barbie logo on it,
then that's the one she wants,'' said Sabsowitz.
</P>
<P>
   And, she added, her 11-year-old son isn't immune to the ``look''
portrayed in advertising, either. ``He started at age 9 wanting to
dress a certain way ... to look cool.''
</P>
<P>
   How do marketers pull it off?
</P>
<P>
   In Kline's book, ``Out of the Garden: Toys, TV, and Children's
Culture in the Age of Marketing,'' the communications professor
blames the deregulation of television for an increase in
advertising in children's programming. In 1983, the Federal
Communications Commission reversed what had been a long-standing
position by the agency on children's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC lifted guidelines that limited the amount of commercial
time that could be shown on children's TV shows to 16 minutes per
hour. That decision, Kline said, gave rise to children's shows
based on toys, games, candy and breakfast foods, in some cases
produced by the product manufacturers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 the rules were changed to limit advertising to 10 1/2
minutes per hour on weekends, and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays.
Still, critics say, the commingling of the toy industry with mass
media makes it hard for kids to distinguish between programming and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger children have less ability to differentiate real from
unreal. It's an aspect of cognitive development,'' said Tom
Cummins, assistant professor of child and adolescent psychology at
Emory University. ``Younger kids have no ability to reason in the
abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, today's kids are being brought up by baby boomers for whom
consumerism is a big part of life. Sometimes it's the parents who
put pressure on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think working parents feel a twinge of competitiveness and
even guilt,'' said Art Roche, father of two and an art director
with Turner Broadcasting. ``They want their kids to have the newest
and coolest stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   So here we are in 1998 with a programming climate full of tie-in
advertising and character-based marketing. Marketers lean heavily
on character-based marketing in which personality becomes the
product. Characters come with built-in roles and personalities,
affecting the way kids play.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of this type of marketing, Nickelodeon is sitting on a
gold mine. The kids' network has a number of hot properties,
including ``Rugrats'' and ``Blue's Clues.'' Toys and games
associated with the shows are wildly popular. And in the case of
Rugrats, there's also a hit holiday movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Sarnoff, executive vice president of consumer products and
business development for Nickelodeon, knows kids feel an
``emotional connection'' to the show, which translates to dollars
at the cash register. Holiday offerings include a line of products
that play off of the movie such as a talking alarm clock, dolls,
stickers, games and puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   Rugrats products were first introduced in 1996 in ``a very, very
strategic and staged way,'' Sarnoff said. It started with the
successful launch of an exclusive line of apparel and accessories
at Kids R Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that kids really love the Rugrats
characters and really empathize with them,'' Sarnoff said. ``We're
a very research-focused company. We talk to kids all of the time.
We understand what is going on in their lives and choose which
properties to take into the consumer products world.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Guber, the president of Children's Market Research,
some of the most successful marketing campaigns are the ones that
cross gender, race and age barriers _ the pairing of Bart Simpson
and Butterfinger, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But certain toys, marketed correctly _ even without the TV or
movie tie-ins _ also can cross those barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Furby, one of this season's hottest toys, may be just such an
item. The fur is really flying over the interactive, gremlinlike
critter that ``speaks'' a new language ``Furbish,'' catches colds
and snores.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Electronics, which makes Furby, unveiled the toy during
Toy Fair in New York. Although buyers only got to see a prototype,
they were ``blown away,'' said Tiger spokeswoman Lana Simon. By the
end of the toy fair, the company had orders for a million units.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the real crux of the issue for critics such as Kline is
that kids are vulnerable, and many parents don't have the money to
buy all these products.
</P>
<P>
   He believes there are two bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is that parents come to realize that the marketplace is an
important agent for socialization of children's culture as much as
schools and parents are,'' said Kline.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, he said, play and the spiritual value of toys are
being defined by marketers, not parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given all this power to marketers and maybe we've given
them too much power ... in giving up control and limits.''
</P>
<P>
   But many parents, such as Fayette County's Rowier, are trying to
ease some of the pressure of the season. Rowier now gives money to
her kids to buy their own gifts. Still, she said: ``I feel guilty.
I think the real meaning of Christmas should be stressed.''

 &HT;    Going once, twice ... auctions to treasure
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Online auctions prove one of the basic truths of human
nature: One person's trash is another's treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Web auction game is relatively new, and might be a little
too much for Web surfers just getting comfortable with online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you read the directions carefully and ignore the $250
Furbys (unless the money is going to charity), you can find your
own personal pot of gold _ or gold plate _ at an online auction.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most popular online auction houses are eBay
(http://www.ebay.com) and Yahoo! Auction (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .yahoo.com). On these sites, you'll be able to find nearly
everything your heart desires, from rare coins to collectible
Christmas ornaments, vintage Barbie dolls and Waterford crystal.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a collector, or know someone who is, purchasing a
hard-to-find treasure through an online auction can be fun and
rewarding. A quick survey of collectors of a variety of items
showed that for the most part, initial asking prices on the items
were what a person would expect to pay at a flea market, an
in-person auction or a retail store.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all this in mind, newbies should take care to read
all the fine print before signing up or placing a bid. Once you
have purchased an item, you are conducting business with the person
auctioning the item. Yahoo! and eBay allow you to check up on both
buyer and seller. The eBay system has more checks and balances,
although problems are rare.
</P>
<P>
   There are sites such as Amazon.com, which have perfected the art
of one-click ordering, but eBay and other online auctioneers aren't
the sort of places where you log in, order up and log out. By their
very nature, these sites invite you to stay, take a look around and
see if they have any classic matchbox cars, Fiestaware soup bowls
or vintage rhinestone jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   If you see something you want to buy, that's great, but unlike
online retailers, you've got to register whether you are a buyer or
a seller. That way, if you develop a reputation as a con artist or
a welcher, the whole eBay community will find out via online
postings. And there truly is nothing worse than having a bad
reputation in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   For beginners, there's no better place to learn the ins and outs
of online auctions than eBay, which has an easy-to-follow tutorial,
a list of frequently asked questions and lots of other information
to help you before you bid. And even if you don't want to buy, it's
still fun to look. Recent items on sale at eBay included a 1983
DeLorean auto and a snuffbox featuring a painting of the Titanic
disaster. Yahoo! Auctions is equally easy to use and also requires
registration. There may be fewer items and the organization might
not be as efficient as eBay's, but if they have what you want, it
really doesn't matter what else they may have.
</P>
<P>
   With so much talk about sites that want to build community on
the Web, eBay and others create an instant community of like-minded
souls united by common interests. EBay founder Pierre Omidyar says
there may be only one or two collectors of a certain item in your
hometown, but there could be hundreds online. Here's where you can
find them and gather up some goodies along the way.

 &HT;    Use tact when giving at the office
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Millions of dollars and a lot of thought goes into
gift-giving for friends and family, but people aren't quite sure
how to proceed when it comes to buying gifts for co-workers. How
much should you spend? What's too personal? What's over the top?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's federal guidelines on what's a bribe and what's a
gift, but there's really nothing in the protocol about office
gift-giving that I'm aware of,'' says John Slocum, professor of
management at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't prevented office gift-giving from becoming a big
part of the $23 million incentives industry, according to Peter
Edmunds, publisher of Incentive magazine in Huntington Beach,
Calif. A survey by Gillette Co.'s Waterman Pen division found
workers give an average of eight holiday gifts and spend about $22
on co-workers and $28 for bosses or clients.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you buy a gift without appearing thoughtless or worse,
like a brown-noser?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a message behind everything you give,'' says Andrea
Claster, a Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.-based gifts consultant known as
the ``gift doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what you're trying to say with gifts because gifts do
speak for you.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no rule about how much you should spend, be
careful about going over the top. A $450 Mont Blanc pen would only
look like you're currying favor. One-size-fits-all gifts like
fruitcakes or appointment books are also out. So is ``The One
Minute Manager'' for the boss and the Franklin planner for the
woman who sits next to you who frequently forgets project
deadlines. ``Word Perfect for Dummies'' for the guy who is still
using the hunt-and-peck system of typing is also a bad idea _
unless you don't mind the frosty reception you'll get at the next
staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gifts) can't be seen as a self-improvement gift or
criticism,'' explains career strategist Marilyn Moats Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they draw undue attention or unsavory gossip. The
$100-plus imported silk ties former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky gave President Clinton probably set office gift-giving
back a hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's sensitive (about gift-giving now) because of the
Lewinsky thing,'' Kennedy says. ``After the Clinton-Lewinsky thing,
there's going to be very little gift-giving. The entire country saw
that as just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   So what works?
</P>
<P>
   If your boss is constantly fumbling for a business card, giving
him or her a nice little business card holder is a thoughtful
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with fantasy gifts or gag gifts. They can be good
only ``if the person has a sense of humor,'' Kennedy adds.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say you can never go wrong with food, especially
homemade baked goods like cookies or cake. Meats are risky because
they could offend vegetarians or those who follow strict religious
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give everybody a tin of cookies, it's hard to find
fault with that,'' Kennedy notes.
</P>
<P>
   Gift certificates, electronics and clothing are also popular,
Edmunds says. Claster suggests a weather radio or windproof
umbrella for the busy traveling executive. Many of the items can be
found on the Internet, a '90s blessing for those who don't have
time to shop.
</P>
<P>
   The key to remember, Edmunds adds, is, ``don't attempt to use a
business gift as a bribe. ... As long as it's professional and done
in good taste, that's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid any hint of impropriety, more companies are opting to
give to charities and avoiding employee gift exchanges altogether,
Slocum says. That way, he says, ``People don't get left out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the approach Kathy Collura and her co-workers at Hewitt
Associates in Atlanta take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of giving gifts, we adopt a family and that works out
beautifully, because we're able to give gifts to people who really
need them,'' Collura said.

 &HT;    Encarta is tops, but still has errors
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Microsoft's Encarta has been at the top of the heap of
popular electronic encyclopedias since its first appearance, and
the 1999 edition will not lose that place.
</P>
<P>
   The interface has been tweaked, not all of it for the good. It
takes more mouse clicks now, in some cases, to get what you want.
But it remains easy to use, and all articles are displayed in
large, easy-to-read text.
</P>
<P>
   The deluxe version is now a three-disc set, one disc being used
entirely for installation and the inevitable attempt to stuff
Explorer down your throat. It does this with a vengeance _ no by
your leave, no ``would you like to.'' It just sets up Explorer as
your default browser. I find that infuriating.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Encarta is a fine encyclopedia, with a heavier
emphasis on the arts than most. There are, for instance, large and
well-done sections on ceramics, woodworking and furniture. All
music (that I listened to, at any rate) was presented in excerpts
from commercial recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The sections on flamenco and bullfighting remain essentially
unchanged, and quite good except for the usual incorrect captions,
questionable choice of photos and unfortunate tendency to try to
force the bullfight into the general category of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Entries on firearms, which I have not previously examined, have
some very strange problems. As curator of arms at the West Point
museum, Robert W. Fisch may not have been the best choice to write
the little section on shotguns; clearly he is out of touch when he
tells us, ``Modern pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns equally
share the field with the similar side-by-side and single-barreled
pieces ...''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a museum curator to know pumps and
semi-autos rule the field, and the traditional double gun is no
longer made by major manufacturers, having been largely replaced by
over-and-under guns.
</P>
<P>
   The biography of John Moses Browning, the greatest arms designer
who ever lived, is unsigned. Probably a good thing, since it
contains ludicrous errors and, for want of a better term,
understatements. It says Browning invented ``two machine guns ...
the Colt Peacemaker and the Browning Automatic Rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Peacemaker, of course, is the popular name of the Colt's Single
Action Army, the single most popular handgun of the American West
following the Civil War, and by no stretch of the imagination a
machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The bio goes on with the offhand statement that Browning ``also
designed an automatic pistol.'' It is for this, embodied originally
in the Colt M1911A and refined later in the Browning Hi-Power, that
Browning is chiefly known today. Both weapons have been changed but
little since their inception and remain the most popular of all
semi-auto designs.

HIGHWAY CABLE PROJECT TESTS LAW ON DIGGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ Until workers dug into two buried water mains
next to the Garden State Parkway on Tuesday, installation of a $488
million E-Z Pass system on New Jersey's toll roads had been going
just fine. But now, after about 300,000 people in Jersey City,
Hoboken and Lyndhurst spent most of last Tuesday without water, the
project has become a test for the state's 4-year-old law intended
to prevent excavators from digging into buried pipelines and
cables.
</P>
<P>
   The ruptures, especially one to a 72-inch-diameter pipe linking
Jersey City to its biggest reservoir, have left New Jersey highway
officials with misgivings about the law.
</P>
<P>
   They have halted installation of fiber-optic cables for E-Z Pass
along the upper stretches of the Garden State Parkway and the New
Jersey Turnpike. Before any more trenches are dug for the cables,
they want assurances from the state's Board of Public Utilities,
which enforces the law, that their routes are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see how effective that law is and why it wasn't as
effective as it should be,'' said Edward Gross, executive director
of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and head of a consortium of
toll-road officials overseeing creation of the E-Z Pass system. ``I
just want to ensure we're not going to hit anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for one segment of state government to challenge the
job performance of another so publicly. But Gross said the piercing
of the pipes raised the possibility of further interruptions along
the state's major highways.
</P>
<P>
   Before the installation work was stopped, about 100 miles of
cable had been laid since summer. Planning calls for 300 more miles
to be laid by next April along the Parkway and Turnpike, as well as
the Atlantic City Expressway and a portion of Interstate 95 in
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The financial stakes for the highway consortium are high because
some of the cable will be leased to corporations and the
telecommunications industry to help defray the expense of
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Board of Public Utilities now is to ensure
that all the paths of buried pipes and electrical lines along those
300 miles are clearly marked, as required by the state's 1994 law.
Jersey City's 72-inch main was not marked before it was pierced by
crews from J. Fletcher Creamer &AMP; Sons, of Hackensack, the company
installing the fiber-optic cables for the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   James Giuliano, head of the board's investigation into the
water-pipe disruptions, says the E-Z Pass system will require one
of the largest marking operations since New Jersey created the
system in 1994. Gov. Christie Whitman called for its creation after
a gas line, damaged weeks earlier by digging equipment, finally
broke, creating a huge fireball in Edison, devastating a
condominium complex and leaving hundreds injured and one dead.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano said on Friday that the board welcomed the consortium's
safety demands, adding that the law was rigidly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires excavating companies and landowners alike to
call a clearinghouse before they begin any construction-related
digging anywhere in the state, providing the exact location of
where they plan to dig. That information is then sent to all
companies with underground pipes in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies visit the site and mark the underground routes
of their pipes, wires or cables with color-coded 24-inch tall
stakes, flags on 2-foot wire staffs, and spray-painted strips on
soft surfaces and paint on hard surfaces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To find their buried lines, some of which are decades old, the
utilities use metal detectors, electronic sounding devices and
maps. In recent months, the board has used satellites that provide
longitude and latitude to map the routes of 1,100 miles of major
gas mains, Giuliano said. Electric and water companies have started
compiling the same data for their lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials say they are proud of the system's safety
record. They say the number of times buried lines have been hit has
declined steadily, to 3,796 hits at 2.5 million marked sites in
1997 from 4,624 hits at 1.7 million marked sites in 1995.
Excavators, utilities and the clearinghouse have been fined $1.9
million under the 1994 law for a variety of violations, including
hits, incorrect markings, and failing to provide precise locations,
the board said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's water-main ruptures created the widest public
disruption since the system was created. In another major incident,
Newark International Airport was shut for 24 hours in January 1995
after a steel beam was driven through three major power lines,
knocking out the airport's electrical system.
</P>
<P>
   Three construction companies were fined $40,000 for violations
in that incident, including failing to preserve the markings that
Public Service Electric and Gas had made days earlier, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say Jersey City's 72-inch main was hit because of
falsified records. An employee of a marking company hired by United
Water Resources, which operates Jersey City's water system,
reported that he had marked the line, when in fact he had not,
officials said. He has been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano said he expected that the board would now require
United Water Resources to verify all markings reported by its
subcontractor.

   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ James P. Hoffa won election Saturday to the
post his father held when his main opponent conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   With the concession of Tom Leedham, Hoffa, a labor lawyer from
Detroit, will take the helm of one of the nation's largest unions.
The victory marked a return of the Hoffa name to the head of a
union that federal officials had long called the most corrupt,
particularly when Hoffa's father, James R. Hoffa, led the
organization from 1957 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham admitted defeat Saturday afternoon with only about 40
percent of the votes counted, but with Hoffa holding what appeared
to be a decisive lead. Hoffa had 88,851 votes, or 54 percent, of
those counted, while Leedham, head of the warehouse division, had
65,439, or 40 percent. A third candidate, John Metz, a St. Louis
teamsters leader, had 9,225 votes, or 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The returns have made it clear that our campaign for
rank-and-file power ran out of time,'' Leedham said in a statement.
``Hoffa Jr. campaigned for four years, spent $6 million and had a
famous name, but in six short months we came from nowhere to build
a grass-roots campaign for rank-and-file power.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said that Hoffa's lead was likely to expand because
Sunday will be dedicated to counting votes from the Midwest, which
is Hoffa's home turf and was his father's stronghold. About 420,000
votes were cast; counting is expected to be finished on Sunday or
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa won the race in his second try, having lost narrowly in
1996 to Ron Carey, the incumbent. That result was overturned and a
new election ordered when a federal monitor found that three Carey
aides had misappropriated more than $700,000 from the teamsters
treasury to help the Carey campaign. Carey was later barred from
the union and Leedham replaced him as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, ran
on a platform promising to reunite the badly splintered union and
to give more power back to state and local teamster organizations.
Much of his campaign support came from a group that Leedham
attacked as a corrupt old guard.

ANNAN SEEKS OUT GADHAFI ON LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, gambling that he could
persuade Col. Moammar Gadhafi to turn over two suspects wanted in
the bombing of a Pan Am jet in 1988, spent hours Saturday meeting
lower-level Libyan officials with no assurance he could see the
Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, Libyan officials said Annan had delayed by five
hours his departure from the Mediterranean port of Sirte, where
Gadhafi usually receives his few important foreign visitors. The
delay left open the possibility of a later meeting, after Gadhafi
initially rebuffed Annan and was reported by the official Libyan
news agency, Jana, to be ``in a camp in the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, whom aides describe as a born conciliator, flew to Sirte
at some political risk, saying he wanted to try to break the
decade-long deadlock in the Lockerbie case by persuading Gadhafi to
send the two suspects to the Netherlands for a trial by Scottish
judges. This was a compromise proposed in August by the American
and British governments after the Libyans balked at a trial in
either country.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when Annan arrived at Sirte, he was left talking with
Libya's foreign minister, Omar al-Montasser, and Libya's permanent
representative at the United Nations, Abu Zeid Omar Dorda.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who detoured from a trip between Tunisia and a meeting of
Persian Gulf leaders in Abu Dhabi to go to Libya despite the
skepticism of diplomats and U.N. officials in New York, could have
met either lower-level Libyan official at the secretary-general's
U.N. office. His trip to Libya was premised on the chance of
meeting Gadhafi, although there was no assurance in advance that
the Libyan leader would show up.
</P>
<P>
   Pan Am 103 was blown up over the town of Lockerbie in Scotland
on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people, including 11 on the ground.
An investigation by British and American law enforcement and
intelligence agencies concluded that two Libyan agents had planted
an explosive on the plane disguised as a radio-cassette player.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans are also accused of plotting the explosion that
destroyed a French jetliner over Niger in 1989, killing 171 people.
That case is also unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi is eager to see the end of sanctions, imposed on Libya
in 1992 and toughened in 1993. These sanctions have barred
international air travel to and from Libya as well as the sale of
arms and spare parts for aviation and the oil industry on which the
Libyan economy depends. Libyan assets have been frozen abroad and
diplomatic representation has been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had to apply to the Security Council's Libyan sanctions
committee on Thursday for permission to fly to Libya from the
Tunisian resort island of Djerba.
</P>
<P>
   An American diplomat who has been working on the Libya issue in
the Security Council said Thursday that the Clinton administration
saw Annan's trip as a way to ``advance the hand-over of the
suspects,'' and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect his travel to Libya to achieve that end,''
said the diplomat, Nancy Soderberg. Several diplomats said that
Annan had gone to Libya with no room for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and Britain have gone the extra mile,'' Ms.
Soderberg said. ``Libya has been given every opportunity to comply
with the Security Council resolutions. It's been almost 10 years
since the Pan Am 103 tragedy and the families of the victims have
waited long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Annan's trip, which he planned in close consultation with
British and American officials, Libya had been sending mixed
signals about its intentions, as Gadhafi tried to set conditions on
the release of suspects to protect his intelligence network and his
political position, Arab diplomats said. One of the suspects
belongs to a clan in Libya that is, at best, lukewarm in its
support of the government.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jana, Gadhafi, who has ruled Libya since a 1969
coup, did not have the power to turn over the two men, Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah. The agency said that the
Libyan people, through 500 ``popular committees,'' would have to
decide the fate of the two, who were indicted by Britain and the
United States in 1991. The move seemed to imply that Gadhafi wanted
political cover.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Libyan state radio reported that the General
People's Congress, Libya's top legislative and executive body, had
been summoned for Tuesday. The body usually endorses major policy
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Libyan government had been saying that it objected
to the prospect that the suspects, if convicted, would have to
serve jail sentences in Scotland. British officials last week said
they had assured the Libyans that they could send diplomats to
Scotland to monitor the prison conditions and that all Islamic
strictures would be followed.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects are now under loose government supervision in
Libya. They are unable to travel abroad because their passports
have been confiscated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Western diplomats said here last week that Libya was also
concerned that the United States would not agree to a lifting of
sanctions if the two men were sent to the Netherlands for trial,
but would instead move the finish line to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   These diplomats seemed to confirm Libyan suspicions by saying
that the sanctions would be suspended when the suspects were in
custody, but that a final lifting of the embargo would not take
place until Libya had met other goals, like ending support for
terrorism. American allegations that Libya has been behind attacks
on Americans led to bombing raids on Libya in 1986. Some Arab
diplomats say the attack on Pan Am 103, if Libyans were
responsible, was more than likely retaliation for the American
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   British and American officials say there is no hidden agenda,
and that Security Council resolutions demand general cooperation
from Libya before sanctions can be permanently rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has seen its sanctions erode slightly over the last year,
after the Organization of African Unity decided to ignore the
flight ban for its heads of government.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League, to Libya's annoyance, has refused to take the
same decision. Arab League nations have pressed Libya to turn over
the suspects.

 &HT;    Congregation moves out, tourists move in
 &HT;    By Jennifer Ffrench-Parker
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Ebenezer Baptist Church's congregation moves out
of its historic sanctuary in February, it will leave everything
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The pews will stay, as will the pulpit at which the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. and his father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr.
preached. So will the stained-glass windows with the names of the
church families who donated them.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen in time, the 750-seat church, will become a living
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Park Service will assume a 99-year lease the day the
congregation moves out and will immediately begin weekday tours of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service operates the Visitors Center at the Martin
Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, authorized by Congress in
1980 to preserve the Auburn Avenue neighborhood where King was
born, spent his boyhood years, preached, and is buried.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service conducts tours of the birth home and is
negotiating with the King family to buy the King Center for
Non-Violent Change and the tomb of the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catroppa, the Park Service's superintendent, said his
rangers will do interpretative tours of Ebenezer church, which was
founded in 1886, and will tell visitors about the Kings and the
role of the black church in the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The church will stay open for tours, even during a planned
$987,000 renovation that will replace the roof and repair the bell
tower. The work will be done over two years starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Catroppa doesn't want Ebenezer's Heritage Sanctuary to be
just a museum.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Park Service plans to keep the church open for
periodic ecumenical services and perhaps a monthly ``Sing at
Ebenezer'' program where choirs from different churches could
perform in the historic sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ebenezer is one of the most important churches _ period,''
said Catroppa. ``We don't want it be a museum. We are trying to
give it some life.''
</P>
<P>
   He would also like for the annual King Holiday service to
continue at the historic church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be appropriate,'' Catroppa said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer's senior pastor, the Rev. Joseph Roberts Jr., said the
church's offices will remain in the building until the second phase
of its $11 million construction program _ a social services
building _ is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The church's new sanctuary, built at a cost of $8 million, will
be dedicated March 21. A $3 million social services building is
planned just as soon as the church raises enough money to start
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said members can have having weddings and funerals in
the historic sanctuary, if they desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not giving up the old church,'' Roberts said. ``It's
just across the street and we can always walk over.''
</P>
<P>
   THROUGH THE YEARS
</P>
<P>
   In its 113 years, Ebenezer has had four senior pastors:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1886-1894: John Parker, founder
</P>
<P>
   _ 1894-1931: Adam Daniel Williams, father-in-law of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Sr.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1931-1975: The Rev. Martin Luther King Sr.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1975: The Rev. Joseph Roberts
</P>
<P>
   NOTABLE DATES:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1947: The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ordained at Ebenezer.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1960: King Jr. becomes associate pastor at Ebenezer, sharing
duties with his father.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1968: The funeral of King Jr. was held at the church.
</P>
<P>
   _ June, 1974: Alberta Williams King, wife of King Sr. and mother
of King Jr., gunned down at Ebenezer while playing the organ at
Sunday services.

 &HT;    Ebenezer Baptist prepares for big move
 &HT;    WITH EBENEZER-SIDE
 &HT;    By Jennifer Ffrench-Parker
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Atlanta church with deep historical roots is in its
last holiday season at its old homeplace.
</P>
<P>
   In about three months, the congregation of the Ebenezer Baptist
Church will move to a new sanctuary across Auburn Avenue to a new
$8 million facility.
</P>
<P>
   The move has been 10 years in the making for the church that
nurtured the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and was the spiritual
cradle of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Brown, a member for more than 40 years, said he is a
little sad about leaving the old church, but that his excitement is
mounting as the congregation gets closer to relocating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a warm family place to grow up,'' said Brown, who went
to Ebenezer as a boy with his parents. ``All the members looked out
for you. You heard of `it takes a village to raise a child'? It
really was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the church's board of trustees, Brown has been
overseeing the construction of the new sanctuary and has watched
the new building take shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from the old to the new,'' he said. ``Yes, there
are some mixed feelings. But, on the other hand, if you don't
change, you will become stagnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction on Ebenezer's Horizon Sanctuary, the new church's
name, began in March 1997, and is scheduled for completion by
year's end. The installation of pews and other interior work should
begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Roberts, senior pastor for 23 years, expects the
first service to be held sometime in February.
</P>
<P>
   The only firm date for now is the dedication service for the
sanctuary, set for March 21, which coincides with the church's
113th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is excited about finally having a place large enough to
accommodate all the people drawn to the church by its rich history
and its connection to the King family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents for me progression,'' he said. ``It's a place
where we might be more useful in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic church, built in 1913 and 1922, was the home church
of the young Martin, whose father, Martin Sr., was pastor from
1931-1975. Martin Jr. was co-pastor with his father from 1960-68.
</P>
<P>
   Built to seat 750 people, the sanctuary annually hosts about
750,000 visitors a year for services.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said there was always a problem finding seats and
parking for everyone, even with two services. That won't be an
immediate problem in the new church, which will seat 1,750.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we will be able to invite people in,'' said Roberts, who
in 1975 took over a 1,000-member church with a budget of $150,000.
Today, the church's budget is $1.6 million and membership has more
than doubled to 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The new church, which is being built by Russell-Beers
Construction, has a strong Afrocentric theme.
</P>
<P>
   It is circular, a design influenced by an African hut. Its eight
stained-glass windows, which will be installed after the
congregation moves in, will depict the story of King and the civil
rights movement. The church calls them ``teaching windows.'' Brown
said the pews will have African and Christian symbols etched into
them.
</P>
<P>
   With the completion of the Horizon sanctuary, the church plans
to launch fund-raising to build a $3 million community service
center that will house church offices and 30 social services
ministries including a food co-op, a medical center and its soup
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   For church secretary Beverly Miles, it won't be too painful to
make the move from the old to the new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually it will be quite easy,'' laughed Miles, who joined
the church in 1979 and has been secretary since 1993. ``The new
place has such a very cozy feel to it, it won't be a problem for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she gets nostalgic for the Heritage Sanctuary, as the
historic church is now known, she won't have far to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will just walk across the street,'' she said.

ANALYSIS: FINDING COMMON GROUND ON CHILD WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The two reformers were rivals from the very
beginning. And for nearly three years, they waged war over the
direction of New York City's dysfunctional child welfare agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Scoppetta, who seized the reins of the troubled agency
when it was reorganized as the Administration for Children's
Services in 1996, was determined to fix it from within.
</P>
<P>
   And Marcia Robinson Lowry, the veteran New York City litigator,
was equally determined to topple him with a class-action lawsuit
that sought a court takeover of the system that all too often
failed the children it was supposed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed?'' Ms. Lowry liked to say, when asked about
Scoppetta's efforts. ``Nothing's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, as Ms. Lowry formally announced the settlement of
her lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, it was clear that
much had changed. The two adversaries had finally found what had
long eluded them: the shared belief that Scoppetta had actually
begun to push his agency down the long road to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowry, who heads a national advocacy group called Children's
Rights and who has sued 10 child welfare agencies over the last 25
years, withdrew her call for a court takeover, agreeing that the
city should be guided for two years by a panel of experts who would
offer advice, not mandates. Scoppetta agreed that he could use the
extra help.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, Ms. Lowry decided that the man she had battled
so vigorously actually offered the best hope for salvaging the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Her turnabout reflects a growing consensus among child welfare
experts across the nation that litigation alone rarely forces
troubled agencies to change. Three years after Ms. Lowry won a
court takeover in the District of Columbia, and five years after
she won a series of court-imposed mandates in Missouri, those
agencies were still struggling to serve the abused and neglected
children in their care.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, on the other hand, had begun the slow process of
reform after the beating death of Elisa Izquierdo, 6, who was
killed by her mother while under the agency's watch in 1995. There
are still staggering challenges confronting the agency, which with
40,000 foster children is second only to Los Angeles in the size of
its system. But Ms. Lowry concluded that it would be better to help
Scoppetta than to try to dethrone him.
</P>
<P>
   So the two sides negotiated an innovative pact that includes the
creation of the expert panel and allows Ms. Lowry to seek a court
takeover if the city fails to act in good faith, with the experts
serving as her witnesses. In a separate accord, the state has
agreed to conduct nine audits of the agency and assign 41 workers
to monitor city compliance with state laws.
</P>
<P>
   For Scoppetta, the deal last week meant an end to the court
battles that had consumed his most talented deputies and the
assurance that he would not endure the negative publicity that
would result from a trial highlighting his agency's failings.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Lowry, it meant gaining unprecedented independent
scrutiny of the agency and a sharper legal case against the city if
it should renege on its commitment. The panel of experts, who will
testify for Ms. Lowry if the city acts in bad faith, will have
complete access to city officials and their records.
</P>
<P>
   Backing away from the use of court-imposed mandates was a
gamble, but a worthy one, because while the agency remains deeply
troubled, Scoppetta has tried harder to fix it than anyone else in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, with the support of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, Scoppetta has reduced caseloads, toughened eligibility
standards for new employees, increased the number of adoptions and
raised salaries for caseworkers who have long been overworked and
underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   There is still much to be done, of course. City officials have
yet to prove that their efforts have actually improved abuse
investigations. Thousands of children still languish for years in
foster care. Parents wait months for drug treatment programs.
Adolescents sleep in city offices while officials scramble to find
them beds. And even the city predicts that the coming state audits
will uncover deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Giuliani sharply rebuked agency officials for sending
two foster children home, where they were repeatedly sexually
assaulted by their biological parents and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowry and city officials do not underestimate the challenges
ahead. But with the combination of expert advice and tough
monitoring, Ms. Lowry now believes the team can push the agency
forward. And in a gesture of faith, she agreed to a two-year ban on
any class-action lawsuits on behalf of children now in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has paid more attention to this agency
than any in recent memory,'' said Ms. Lowry, whose group sued the
city in 1995 in partnership with another group, Lawyers for
Children. ``Scoppetta's level of visibility and political access
combined with the know-how of these experts is a potentially
winning combination for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowry also agreed to dissolve court-ordered mandates imposed
by another foster care settlement, the Wilder Settlement, which was
intended to insure that foster children went to proper homes. City
officials had never come close to meeting the dictates of that
agreement, which was made in 1986, and Ms. Lowry insisted they
comply with those obligations under the good-faith test established
in the new accord. And the city, which has long sought an end to
the Wilder litigation, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Such a meeting of minds was almost unthinkable just five months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowry, after all, had built a reputation as a relentless
litigator. For 25 years, the class-action lawsuit has been her
sword and the court-imposed settlement the justice she renders on
behalf of the nation's abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   Scoppetta, a former federal prosecutor and deputy mayor who led
the federal investigations of police corruption in the 1970s, was
equally determined not to submit his agency to court-imposed
oversight. And increasingly, some critics say, he seemed reluctant
to acknowledge the depths of its troubles.
</P>
<P>
   So for years, the two sides sparred testily in court and in the
media. And even now, after having negotiated the compromise, some
bitterness remains. The old adversaries did not appear together
publicly to announce their agreement last week. They did not shake
hands and they still spoke of each other with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   But by signing their names to the settlement, they were, in
effect, standing on common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That someone like Marcia would give up litigation, which is
her stock in trade, and that someone like Scoppetta would
acknowledge that these outside experts could really be beneficial,
says a lot for both sides,'' said Monica Drinane, who heads the
Juvenile Rights Division of the Legal Aid Society, which represents
foster children in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hopeful because what it signals is that people are
not focused on personally winning or losing,'' she said, ``but on
what is best for the children in the system.''

<P>
   Here is how New York's College Savings Program works:
</P>
<P>
   The donor opens an account by filling out a form and sending in
a check for at least $250, or by agreeing to have $25 a month
deducted from his checking account. The donor names a beneficiary,
who can receive up to $100,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The money goes into three funds managed by TIAA-CREF, private
pension managers, who divide the account based on the beneficiary's
age. As of January, accounts opened for newborns will have 45
percent invested in bonds and 55 percent in stocks, and those for
anyone over 16 will have 40 percent in bonds, 10 percent in stocks
and 50 percent in money market funds. TIAA-CREF takes 0.65 percent
of the assets each year to cover its costs.
</P>
<P>
   The donor can deduct up to $5,000 of his contribution from the
income on which the state levies taxes. Married couples must open
accounts separately, but can deduct up to $10,000 from their joint
tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The money must remain in the program for three years. During
that time, there are no state or federal taxes on the investment
gains.
</P>
<P>
   When the beneficiary is ready to use the money, it can be
withdrawn and sent to any accredited school in the nation; in many
cases, it can also be used for room and board, as well as books and
equipment. The beneficiary must pay Federal taxes on the money
used, but there is no state tax.
</P>
<P>
   If the money is withdrawn early, or not used for education, the
donor must pay state and federal taxes, as well as a program
penalty of 1 percent of all investment gains. But there is no limit
on how long money can remain in the program, and the beneficiary
can be changed to another member of the same family.
</P>
<P>
   More information is available by calling (877) 697-2837 or on

POLICE OFFICER COMMITS SUICIDE AFTER CAR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New York City police officer committed suicide Friday night
shortly after leaving the scene of a multiple-car accident he
caused in nearby Nassau County, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer was identified as Michael Lynch, 32, a five-year
veteran of the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   No one was seriously hurt in the accident, but Lynch did not
know that because he did not stop to check, the Lynbrook Police
Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Lynch showed up at a nearby repair shop an hour
later, workers said they told him that his car, a 1999 Honda Accord
with 500 miles on the odometer, would cost $9,000 to repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very upset when he walked in and just kept saying, `I
really screwed up, I really screwed up,''' said a repairman who
declined to give his name. ``Then a few minutes later, after we had
called him a cab, we heard a gunshot out front.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred shortly after 8:30 p.m. Lynch's car hit
another car as both vehicles traveled west on the Sunrise Highway,
near Roosevelt Avenue, said Sgt. James Fleming of the Lynbrook
Police Department. Lynch then drove his car over a small concrete
divider and hit two other cars traveling east, Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he just took off,'' Fleming said. ``It happens all the
time, but what caused him to do what he did I could not
speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the accident, about six miles away in nearby
Lawrence, workers at the K &AMP; G Garage said they saw Lynch drive up
to their 24-hour repair shop. They said he asked for an estimate
and was told that the damage to both sides of the car would cost
$9,000 to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch was married but had no children. He was last assigned to
the 103rd Precinct in Queens.

YACHTS NEARLY TOO FAST TO CONTROL IN AROUND ALONE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The background noise on the telephone didn't sound like a boat
at anchor, or even a marina for that matter. It was a chattering,
clattering kind of sound, like people standing around wheels and
brakes and asphalt. So what was Mike Golding, leader in the Around
Alone race for solo sailors, doing at a go-cart park in South
Africa?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to let off steam,'' the 38-year-old Englishman
said last week from Cape Town, where the first leg of the race
ended. ``I'm here racing against my support crew and a few other
people I've met down here. The track has 30 go-carts, so I'm hoping
some of my sailing competitors will show up, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike driving the daredevil go-carts, no one sails a top
60-foot yacht flat-out. Built with low-slung decks and innovative
keels and rigs, the highly tuned monohulls are capable of more
speed than any one competitor can handle. When the wind is up,
speeds in the 20-knot range and above leave such thoroughbreds on
the edge of capsizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 50 percent of the time, you're having to lift your
foot from the pedal to stay safe,'' Golding said of Team Group 4,
his French-built yacht, which surprised everyone in the fleet of 15
by winning Leg 1. ``The boat is able to do things that as a human,
you are not able to control. It's like a fast car; sometimes you
have to hold back.''
</P>
<P>
   Golding's victory in the first leg of the 27,000-mile race
around the world developed slowly, like water rising from a deep
well. It was not until a month after the Sept. 26 start from
Charleston, S.C., that Golding clawed his way to the front of the
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the competition, and not necessarily the act of sailing,
that gives me pleasure,'' Golding said. ``It's more the act of
putting what I know against what the others know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Golding whom the other 14 lone sailors must beat in
the second stage, a 6,884-mile leg to Auckland, New Zealand, which
began Saturday from Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Golding, a former firefighter, has sailed around the world three
times before, twice in amateur races and once in a record-setting
161-day nonstop solo voyage against the prevailing winds.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Around Alone race, Golding was lower on the
favored-to-win list than the likes of Isabelle Autissier, the
indomitable French sailor who is the only woman in the race, or
Marc Thiercelin of France, who had finished an impressive second in
a similar race around the world last year.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first leg, a 34-day chase after wind from the
North to South Atlantic, those three had finished within six hours
of each other. When they arrived Oct. 31, they were all faster to
Cape Town after their 6,800-mile ocean passage than anyone in the
1994-95 race, breaking the record set by Autissier, who led the
fleet four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our boats are lively, tender, exciting and fast, and sometimes
scary,'' Golding said. ``But in some ways, they are stronger than
other boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Made of composite materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber,
the yachts are constructed to withstand the huge seas and gale
winds likely to hit during legs in the lower latitudes beneath
Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina. Depending on the
design, some of the 60-footers are built with as many as five
watertight compartments to keep them afloat if damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Fast boats or not, the Around Alone race seldom offers easy
sailing. Add to that a few tales of personal woe such as the
much-publicized elbow injury that befell Viktor Yasykov of Russia
during the first stage. An abscess in his arm required at-sea
consultation through e-mail with a physician in Boston. But
excessive bleeding and pain nearly cost him his arm as well as the
race before the infection cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Town-to-Auckland route is rife with turbulence and
possibility for disaster. In the 1994-95 race, Autissier was
rescued at sea after her 60-foot sailboat was rolled upside-down
through 360 degrees and dismasted by storms. But she said last week
that she is calm and well prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you have been down there, the more comfortable you
are in going back,'' she said. ``But you have to really think about
what will happen all the time. Maybe sometimes you are not busy on
the deck, but you have to concentrate. You have to feel the waves.
Everything can change so fast.''

 &HT;    Braves stronger all around
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This has been no mere service call. If the Atlanta
Braves were a house, the furniture would have been rearranged in
every room.
</P>
<P>
   In the $700 million thrown around the majors during this
free-agent season, others have spent plenty more and bigger names
have moved. But no club has done what the Braves have done,
reworking every clubhouse aspect from the coaching staff to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Denny Neagle removes a tooth from the rotation,
but everywhere else the Braves have become stronger. Bret Boone
tightens the infield defensively and lends offensive pop at second
base unseen since Davey Johnson passed through town. Brian Jordan
and Otis Nixon elevate the outfield. Questions might exist about
rookie left-hander Bruce Chen's readiness for the majors or the
absence of a big-name closer, but the pitching staff probably has
never been deeper.
</P>
<P>
   All of that on a club coming off a team-record 106-win season.
General manager John Schuerholz, asked if he is finished with the
roster, replied that he isn't. ``I'm not going to paint myself into
any corners.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Braves have an existing budget problem. With 18
players now under contract for 1999, the payroll already has
reached $72.7 million. The club has targeted a $65 million to $68
million budget, meaning that something must give. Left fielder Ryan
Klesko, who will earn $4.75 million next season and another $12.25
million before his contract expires in 2001, remains the prime
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the team has a deep interest in how
Klesko, whose season unraveled after a June appendectomy, might
profit from working with new hitting coach Don Baylor. Nixon could
well be batting leadoff and playing left field on opening day, but
what if Klesko becomes a new man in spring training? Another
option.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, a Braves team that last season scored more runs and
fielded more cleanly than any in franchise history has made itself
better. If 1998 taught the team anything, merely being better can
become meaningless come October. However, criticisms that the
Braves are too pitching-heavy, that they lack depth, that they have
limited offensive resources beyond the home run are far less valid
than the night the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   Infield
</P>
<P>
   Boone becomes the first Gold Glove second baseman to wear an
Atlanta uniform since Felix Millan in 1972. He comes off a 24-homer
season. Johnson and Rogers Hornsby are the only previous Braves
second basemen to reach 20. Retaining Ozzie Guillen was critical
for Walt Weiss' legs at shortstop, where the team might not be
acrobatic but remains solid. Corner men Chipper Jones and Andres
Galarraga generated 228 RBIs, the most by any third base/first base
combination in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Outfield
</P>
<P>
   Jordan changes the dynamic in right field, where Michael
Tucker's spotty offense had become a liability. Jordan hit .351
against left-handed pitching last year and can bat almost anywhere
in the order, and his strong arm will be put to good use in one of
the deepest right fields in the majors. Durability remains the only
question. Andruw Jones improved by the month last summer and
deservedly won a Gold Glove in just his first season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Rotation
</P>
<P>
   Chen, at 21 only two months older than Andruw Jones, is destined
for some rough treatment, on his way to the majors after throwing
just 24 innings at the Class AAA level. Kevin Millwood also allowed
more hits (175) than innings pitched (174.1) last year. But the
thinking to deal Neagle was sound for three reasons: Glavine,
Maddux and Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen
</P>
<P>
   Braves relievers had a 3.83 ERA last year, fifth-best in the
National League, but the core that evolved from that group _ Kerry
Ligtenberg, John Rocker and Rudy Seanez _ had a 2.57 ERA with 171
strikeouts in 147 innings. Five pitchers are up for the remaining
three spots: newcomer Mike Remlinger; Odalis Perez; Russ Springer;
Mark Wohlers, who is intent on a comeback; and Mike Cather, coming
off corrective rib surgery. For the first time, the Braves could
have three lefties in the bullpen, Remlinger, Perez and Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Bench
</P>
<P>
   Nixon and Gerald Williams, a pleasant surprise last year, would
be starting for a host of teams, but here merely fill out the
outfield. Eddie Perez, coming off a .336 season, has been tied down
with a two-year contract to back up two-time All-Star catcher Javy
Lopez. Guillen and Keith Lockhart, coming off rotator cuff surgery,
are slotted for the infield reserve slots, meaning an end of the
line for Tony Graffanino.
</P>
<P>
   It all means that the Braves head to spring training with only
the 25th spot on the roster unfilled. When spring training
convenes, only nine Braves will remain from the franchise's last
World Series appearance three short seasons ago.

 &HT;    Youth detention centers face day in court
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALTON, Ga. _ J.A.S. was 13 years old the first time he was sent
to the state's regional youth detention center here, charged with
simple battery and forgery. He had gotten into a fight with his
father and written a $100 check on his parents' account.
</P>
<P>
   What he found at the center, a one-story building on the eastern
edge of this city known for its carpet mills, ``was pretty
frightening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The single-person cells sometimes had as many as five boys
stuffed into them. Often, no more than two guards oversaw the 60 or
more youngsters in a facility built to house 30. He says he was
among those subjected to outdoor mass strip searches and that he
witnessed physical abuse of other youths.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the tall, muscular youth was sent to
the Dalton RYDC four more times, usually for relatively minor
offenses such as simple assault and probation violation. The
conditions never changed, he said in a recent interview. The
facility was continually overcrowded and understaffed. Education
and health care were virtually nonexistent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   J.A.S., now 18, is one of five ``named'' plaintiffs, identified
only by initials because of their age, in a class action lawsuit
against the state Department of Juvenile Justice and the Dalton
RYDC that goes to trial Monday in U.S. District Court in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the facility, which serves nine counties
in northwest Georgia, is ``grossly overcrowded, unsanitary and
dilapidated'' and violates the constitutional rights of every youth
locked up there.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the suit believe a favorable federal court ruling
will force the department to improve conditions not only at Dalton,
but in the 20 other regional detention centers throughout the
state. Advocates for children have long maintained there are
systemwide problems, but have been unable to document them because
of confidentiality restrictions involving juvenile offenders. A
Department of Justice investigation conducted in 1997-98 was the
first time the entire system had been closely examined by an
outside agency.
</P>
<P>
   The federal report on that investigation, released this year,
was highly critical of the entire system, citing ``a pattern of
egregious conditions violating the federal rights of youths'' at
Georgia juvenile facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found the department had violated the
constitutional rights of children by confining them in a system
that was abusive, dangerous and overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   The state agreed to spend $65 million for improvements over the
next 2 1/2 years and to allow federal monitors to supervise its
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit want the court to go
farther and require the state to make specific improvements in
areas such as health care, mental health screening and treatment,
education and protection of the incarcerated youths. They believe
only a court verdict will ensure that changes are made.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Boardman Burnette, an attorney in the Atlanta firm of
Cullen &AMP; Miller, which is handling the case for the plaintiffs,
said the suit is seeking ``something with teeth; something that is
enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state can make promises (to improve conditions) until it
is blue in the face,'' she said, ``but we want something so if they
don't follow up the court can step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the youths say they plan to present graphic
testimony from J.A.S. and three other plaintiffs who have been
confined at the Dalton RYDC. Among them is C.N.H., who was 15 when
the suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, C.N.H. came from a family with a
history of mental illness. She was sexually abused as a child and
had a history of drug and alcohol abuse. The suit alleges that
C.N.H. was not given any psychological screening when she was
admitted to the RYDC. It also claims that during another
confinement at the facility, she suffered from pneumonia but had to
wait two weeks to get treatment, and later suffered severe
nosebleeds but never saw a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   J.A.S. also said he never saw a doctor at the Dalton RYDC. Even
getting to see a nurse required patience. ``You had to put in a
request one day and you might get to see her the next day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Education at the center usually consisted of ``two videos and a
sixth-grade math book,'' J.A.S. said. ``And they were always the
same videos: one about drugs and the other some nature video.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials would not comment on specific allegations in the
Dalton RYDC suit. But David Anderson Hooker, who defended the
state's juvenile justice system when he was with the attorney
general's office, said conditions in Dalton ``were not generally
bad. For a lot of reasons, Dalton was one of the better-managed
facilities and better-maintained facilities in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   When the suit was filed in March 1996, the Dalton center was the
only RYDC in the state accredited by the American Correctional
Association for meeting minimum standards for incarceration and
treatment of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations of those backing the suit are unrealistic, said
Hooker, who will be the lead defense attorney for the state,
although he now is in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between being constitutionally adequate
and what is ideal,'' he said. ``Those financing the case have gone
beyond constitutionally adequate to trying to reach what is
ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit's long road to trial has been unusual for a class
action suit. Instead of being pushed and financed by a nonprofit
public interest group with minimal local ties, as is generally the
case, the money and zeal for this suit come largely from business
and political leaders in Dalton and surrounding Whitfield County.
Many of them are closely linked to the Dalton RYDC and the juvenile
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Maples Blaylock, a Juvenile Court judge in Whitfield
County and a member of the Dalton RYDC advisory board, served as a
court-appointed guardian for C.N.H. in the girl's dealings with the
court. Blaylock declined to comment about the suit for this story,
citing ethical concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suit's major backers is Debby Peppers, a former
Whitfield County commissioner and one-time member of the Dalton
RYDC advisory board. Peppers also has done charity work for the
Juvenile Court and served as a court-appointed guardian for
children in their dealings with the court. She said it was during
the year she spent on the center's advisory board in 1990 that she
first heard stories about problems at Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what the attitude was up there and how they were doing
things,'' Peppers said. But it was not until she began talking to
other advocates for children that she said she realized the extent
of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Peppers said she heard about children not being able to get
their medication on a regular basis while confined. She also heard
allegations about lack of schooling, frequent physical abuse and
group punishment for infraction of rules. On occasion, she said,
the complaints came from people who worked at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people had a little knowledge about what was going
on,'' said J. Thomas Minor IV, a Dalton real estate attorney and
children's advocate. ``As we got together and talked about it, we
saw that it was a much bigger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 members of the community decided to form a political
action committee rather than a nonprofit group so they could
support candidates and initiatives they believed were responsive to
the needs of children, Minor said. The PAC, known as Voice of the
Children, has been the driving force behind the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Minor and Peppers said PAC members believed a class action
lawsuit would push the state into making some quick changes, first
at the Dalton RYDC and then in other facilities around the state.
</P>
<P>
   RYDCs are designed as short-term detention facilities for
juveniles awaiting court hearings or transfer to long-term
detention centers. But some youngsters have been detained at the
Dalton RYDC for up to 18 months; and those incarcerated in RYDCs
can include juveniles awaiting hearings in superior court for
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Voice of the Children members thought the suit would be settled
within a year, Minor said. Instead, it has gone on for more than 2
1/2 years, and expenses now exceed $50,000. Lawyers handling the
case have not billed the PAC for their fees but are seeking
reimbursement from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Peppers and Minor said the suit has produced some cosmetic
changes at the facility, such as new uniforms for the boys and a
new paint job inside the building, but not the long-term, major
improvements it is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker and state officials say improvements have been made, and
have nothing to do with the litigation. Those changes were in the
works before the suit, and before the Department of Justice
investigation and subsequent memorandum of agreement between
federal officials and the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memorandum of agreement really reflects an acceleration of
plans that had already been developed,'' Hooker said.
</P>
<P>
   Shrouded by trees on three sides, the low-slung Dalton RYDC
building has the same utilitarian, cement block and brick-and-tile
hardness as most detention facilities. The 8-by-10 cells are
intended for one person. Each has a built-in cement slab for
bedding, an open, stainless-steel toilet and sink, and recessed
light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Youths here range in age from 11 to 17. Boys wear dark green
uniforms; the girls, green and white stripes. The boys' wing, which
was built to house 22, is separated from the girls' wing by several
locked steel doors, the dining area, and a classroom jammed with
books and computers. A portion of the dining area has been
appropriated for a temporary classroom until a new one is built.
</P>
<P>
   A psychologist has provided individual counseling every Friday
for about a year, according to Bobby Hughes, interim director of
the Dalton RYDC. A licensed clinical social worker has counseled
youths two days a week for almost a year. Drug and alcohol
counseling sessions are now offered once a week. The center has had
a full-time nurse for about three years, and a doctor visits every
Thursday. A full-time psychological nurse is expected to be hired
by July. And, although it's still over capacity, the average daily
population last year was under 50, according to Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with 50 kids, it's still manageable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The center also is trying to incorporate vocational training,
using a greenhouse donated by local Girl Scouts and businesses. A
pet therapy program is in the works, as is increased time for
inmates on the center's computers, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep the kids out of their rooms and keep them busy,''
Hughes said. ``That's why we don't have a lot of incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker said he believes ``the state should be admonished to
always try to improve the services they are providing. But as long
as they are operating above the standards provided by the
Constitution and state regulations, that admonishment should come
in the form of advocacy, not a federal lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peppers said she believes there are still serious problems
at the facility _ and Voice of the Children will fight on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't quit,'' she said. ``Who else will speak for these
children?''

TRIAL OF ANTI-APARTHEID CHAMPION TAKES A TURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ All Allan Boesak says he is guilty of
is ``struggle bookkeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Courtroom 19 in the new wing of Cape Town's High Court, a
judge is going to decide whether ``struggle bookkeeping'' was
really fraud and theft, crimes serious enough to send one of the
liberation struggle's heroes to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, the court has heard from a string of witnesses
that Boesak used welfare projects to raise cash for a life of
luxury, flashy cars and overseas holidays. And for a while, it
seemed the prosecution might breeze to victory.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, one of the prosecution's principle witnesses,
Boesak's bookkeeper, crumpled under cross-examination and admitted
that he had implicated Boesak only to cover up his own thieving.
With tears in his eyes, the bookkeeper, Freddie Steenkamp, who is
already serving a six-year sentence for theft, asked for Boesak's
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Just how big a blow to the prosecution this was remains to be
seen. Prosecutors are scrambling to line up other last-minute
witnesses, including the singer Paul Simon, who contributed more
than $100,000 to Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the case has gripped this country both because it has
offered a window into Boesak's indulgent living and because
President Nelson Mandela has several times swooped in to help him,
in ways some critics find deeply objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   When Boesak appeared to face charges last year, Mandela sent his
justice minister to greet him at the airport, and in recent weeks
Mandela has openly raised funds for his defense and derided the
quality of the prosecution's case, triggering outrage in legal
circles. He later apologized for those remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Boesak was a clergyman in the forefront of the
anti-apartheid movement, defying the authorities and landing more
than once in solitary confinement. He was a founder of the United
Democratic Front, the political group aligned with the outlawed
African National Congress and a man with a certain gift for
rallying a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years that followed, prosecutors say, Boesak began
using the funds that poured in from foreign donors to support his
Foundation for Peace and Justice for his own needs _ sports cars,
an expensive home and, after his divorce, the debts of his new,
young wife.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, auditors testified, more money was spent on
first-class travel for Boesak and his family than for any other
project the foundation was involved in.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations of misappropriation of funds surfaced in 1994,
when lawyers for Dan Church Aid said money they had sent to help
victims of apartheid had been used to pay for Boesak's house. But
it took more than two years before formal charges were made.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak faces 32 counts of fraud and theft involving nearly $1.5
million dollars, $195,000 of which he is accused of taking for
himself. Much of the money had been donated by Scandinavian
charities, but some was donated by Simon after his Graceland tour
of South Africa and some from the charitable arm of Coca-Cola. The
prosecution says Boesak deliberately raised money from Coca-Cola
saying it was for a poverty project, when he had every intention of
using the money to invest in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The case was delayed for more than a year as Boesak battled to
have the country's Legal Aid system pay for his legal bills.
Eventually, an anonymous donor coughed up more than $150,000 for
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   When Boesak ran out of funds last month, he appealed directly to
Mandela, who then publicly solicited more money for him. Within 24
hours another anonymous donor gave another $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses have been former board members of Boesak's
foundation who described being kept in the dark about almost all
the foundation's financial transactions. Some had even resigned
because of the lack of accounting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But some witnesses have clearly been reluctant to speak against
a man they admire. During Thursday's testimony, the prosecutor
battled with an auditor who had trouble remembering much of
anything, including which years he audited the foundation's books.
Finally, the prosecutor made him read the notes from the margins of
his work sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good system of internal checks does not exist,'' the notes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak says he feels abandoned by almost everyone, but Mandela.
At times, he says, he has regretted ``ever leading one single
march.'' He says the charges are not about fraud or theft but about
politics and people getting revenge for the success he had.
</P>
<P>
   He says that administering the accounts of the foundation was
not his work and that he paid little attention to it. ``My job was
to work for the downfall of apartheid,'' Boesak said, brushing
aside the notion that perhaps he should have been more aware. ``I
should like to think that that was a job not badly done.''

 &HT;    The stuff Thanksgiving is made of in Cajun country tasty times
three
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ For anyone who thinks Louisiana is a part of the
United States, here's some evidence to the contrary:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mardi Gras is an official state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   _ You don't buy groceries; you ``make'' them. As in, ``So I was
makin' groceries at Schwegmann's last week ...''
</P>
<P>
   _ The accordian is cool here.
</P>
<P>
   But as a recent emigre to New Orleans from Atlanta, I find
nothing more foreign than the holiday dish Louisianans call
turducken. While the rest of America eats a regular roast turkey at
Thanksgiving and Christmas, here in the land of, ``There's no such
thing as too rich or too much,'' they eat their turkey stuffed with
a duck, which is in turn stuffed with a chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Tur(key)-Duck-(Chick)en. Get it?
</P>
<P>
   I discovered this three-in-one oddity a few months ago, after
living here less than a year. I was making plans to host my first
Thanksgiving for my family _ I am a newlywed with a new house, so I
convinced everyone to come down from New York City for turkey on
the Bayou.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the meal had to incorporate Louisiana cooking, and it had
to be very authentic and local. My family _ particularly my mother
and brother _ is insatiable in its desire to do as the Romans when
in Rome (Mom wore a sari while in India and my brother is not
unfamiliar with the worm at the bottom of a tequila bottle). Using
family recipes and simply transporting traditions from Mom's house
to mine would not do.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention my new mother-in-law also would be coming? Not
only did my meal have to be authentic, it had to be delicious and
well-executed. Sure, Matt's mom is terribly sweet and
nonjudgemental, but come on, it's my mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   First, I explored the deep-fried turkey option. This is where a
turkey is injected with spices and then dunked in hot oil and fried
crispy. I asked around to find out who made good ones. There is no
such thing as a Louisianan who can't cook or who doesn't have an
opinion on who makes what the best. Fights have been known to break
out among men on oil rigs and in fishing camps over which of them
makes the best crawfish etouffee or chicken gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   A cab driver taking me to the airport one morning pointed to an
oily-looking tire ``shop'' and promised that come November a woman
would set up a sign next to a pile of whitewalls and start selling
the best deep-fried turkeys in town. Other people swore by
Popeye's; the fried chicken chain deep-fries turkeys on special
order around the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   But a reheated deep-fried turkey? That sounded like reheated
french fries. So I looked into making one. I went on the Internet
and found a Web site with step-by-step instructions. It was simple
enough, as long as you had a stainless steel pot big enough to fit
a small child, a propane tank, an aesbestos suit and a yard made of
concrete. Apparently, many houses burn to the ground in New Orleans
when novices try to deep-fry turkeys in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   A new tradition
</P>
<P>
   I looked at the wooden deck that surrounds our wooden,
120-year-old house, and thought of how much my brother and husband
like to ``bond'' (Read: Drink) when they get together, and decided
a deep-fried turkey was not for us.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the word ``turducken'' entered my vocabulary. Unlike
the deep-fried turkey, which is fairly well-known around the
country, no one I talked to outside of Louisiana had heard of this
three-bird culinary feat.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, you can buy it all trussed up and ready to go, but you
cook it yourself, which means it would taste fresher than the
fried-ahead bird. And it cooks in the oven, not in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   I drove over the Mississippi River to Gretna, a suburb on the
West Bank, to a place I'd heard was famous for turduckens. Before I
even got inside the Gourmet Butcher Block, I was wrapped in the
smells of green onions, sausage and Cajun spices.
</P>
<P>
   Owners Glenn and Leah Mistich, both Cajun country natives, are
the king and queen of the New Orleans turducken market. They
debone, stuff and sew up 6,000 turkeys each year, mostly in
November and December. They've sent them to homesick Louisianans in
every state and as far away as South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Leah's family claims to have invented the turducken about 15
years ago. She says a customer came into her family's butcher shop
in Maurice, La. and asked what he could do with a wild duck he'd
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Prudhomme, patriarch of Louisiana cooking, lays some claim
to the dish as well.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is you can buy them at several shops around Louisiana
or even order one off the Internet, so let's just say it's in the
public domain.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble a turducken, Glenn Mistich starts by laying out a
limp turkey, deboned save for the legs and wings. He sprinkles it
with spices and spreads scoops of homemade sausage dressing all
over the cavity. Next he lays on a boneless duck, spices it, and
spoons in more dressing. Finally comes the floppy chicken, more
spices and more dressing _ this time, a traditional cornbread type.
He rolls the birds one over the other, and then deftly stitches up
the turkey. All I had to do was take it home and cook it for
several hours. I was sold.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Before I placed an order, I e-mailed a local food expert, Tom
Fitzmorris, and asked him what he thought of turduckens and where
was the best place to get one. He wrote back and asked ominously:
Why would you want one?
</P>
<P>
   ``The turducken is a gross Cajun exaggeration on an ancient
French dish called a ballotine, in which a chicken is stuffed with
a quail, which is then stuffed with an even smaller wild bird,'' he
wrote. ``My problem with (the turducken) is that it all becomes a
hodgepodge, usually tasting more like stuffing than any kind of
bird. You can eat all of my share.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I chickened out. I compromised and went to my local
grocer, Langenstein's, a place I trust completely, and asked if
they made a turducken. They do, but they stuff the turkey with just
one kind of dressing and with a duck and chicken breast, not the
whole birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cooks better that way,'' the lady behind the counter said.
I decided this was a turducken I could trust for my first
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, I pulled a perfectly browned turducken out of
the oven. Somehow it had survived four hours of repeated stabs with
the meat thermometer and a near-death-by-drowning from my manic
basting. My stepfather, following Langenstein's instructions,
removed the legs and wings and carved straight across the bird's
deboned breast like it was a leg of lamb. Inside was succulent,
white turkey meat. Hiding sort of at the bottom was a thin layer of
rich, moist duck breast and an even thinner layer of oyster
dressing. The chicken was nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been the triple delight we were all hoping for,
but it was, by all accounts, delicious.
</P>
<P>
   I think my mom summed it up best: ``I don't know where the
stuffing was, or the chicken, but the duck and the turkey were
delicious, fabulous. I am having one sent to New York next year.''
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I am ready to graduate to the real thing: My next
turducken is going to come from Glenn and Leah Mistich. I'll let
you know next year how it turns out.

 &HT;    Committee to consider impeachment articles
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Few members of Congress have disputed that
President Clinton lied about his sexual affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, the question is what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   That question will be put to the test this week when the House
Judiciary Committee weighs articles of impeachment against
President Clinton for the way he concealed his relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For only the third time in the nation's history, the committee
will debate articles of impeachment against a president. In this
case, the articles will allege that Clinton committed perjury,
obstructed justice and abused his presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
   The historic debate unfolds this week with Republicans
portraying the president as a liar not fit for office and Democrats
attacking the GOP as the party that would stop at nothing to remove
the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom of law, the case about the president would be
clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   Did or did he not lie under oath about having a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   But in the courtroom of politics, mitigating factors such as
what is best for the country will make the outcome less certain.
Which side wins this battle of wills has yet to be seen. What is
certain is both political parties are engaged in a public relations
war to win the public over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their obsession to remove the president from office, House
Republicans are willing to close their eyes to the clear wishes of
almost three-quarters of the American public, which does not want
to remove the president over a consensual affair,'' said Jim
Jordan, spokesperson for the Democratic committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Republicans are moving concertedly toward a several
month trial in the Senate, which would paralyze all three branches
of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Friday that he is
tired of the way the White House and committee Democrats are
twisting the facts in the case against Clinton. Hyde said he wanted
to assure the public and the Democrats that the GOP would not be
``intimidated by rhetoric or name-calling, and we will complete our
duty in accordance with the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House press agents have dramatically stepped up
their attacks on the House Judiciary Committee just as it prepares
to begin deliberations on articles of impeachment,'' Hyde said.
``This is certainly unfortunate, but it sadly comes as no surprise.
From the very beginning of the impeachment inquiry, those who would
defend the President at all costs have preferred to attack the
process rather than address the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The week kicks off with Republicans meeting with committee
staffers on Monday to approve drafts of articles of impeachment
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is expected to present ``a vigorous defense'' of
the president starting on Tuesday. The defense is expected to be a
highly-charged condemnation of the tactics used by Republicans and
independent counsel Kenneth Starr to remove the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers will attempt to prove that the president
did not commit perjury in the legal sense of the word, but rather
misled the American people in an effort to protect his family and
the public from finding out about his affair.
</P>
<P>
   When the White House finishes, Abbe Lowell, the Democratic
counsel on the committee, will present his findings and closing
remarks. David Schippers, the chief counsel to committee
Republicans, will present his findings after that.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on articles of impeachment are expected to begin
Thursday. The committee will likely approve articles of impeachment
on a party-line vote. Given the 21 to 16 Republican majority on the
panel, Democrats will not be able to do much to stop that.
</P>
<P>
   If articles of impeachment pass the committee, the attention
turns to Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich. As the outgoing Speaker
of the House, Gingrich will call House members back to Capitol Hill
for a vote on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In the current Congress, which expires Jan. 3, House Republicans
outnumber Democrats 228-206. There is also one independent who
usually votes with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Democrats are expected to vote for impeachment:
Virgil Goode of Virginia; Ralph Hall of Texas; and Gene Taylor of
Mississippi. Hall was one of four Texas Democrats to support
opening the impeachment inquiry. The other three are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   A simple majority _ 218 votes _ is enough to impeach Clinton,
creating the spectacle of a Senate trial. If the House passes
articles of impeachment, the Senate will be forced to hold a trial.
Under the rules of the Senate, that trial would begin at 1 p.m. the
day after the articles are delivered and continue in session until
a decision is rendered. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would
preside.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) gave a strong
hint about what he thinks about that prospect, telling reporters on
Thursday that ``We're not making any plans or preparations at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   House members say the House vote is too close to call. They say
that perjury will probably be the only article of impeachment that
stands a chance of passage. The likely alternative to impeachment
is censure.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) continued his quest to win Republican
support for a censure resolution that would condemn and fine
Clinton for his actions. But Republicans were reluctant to put
their names on the line by publicly endorsing the proposal, which
was strongly opposed by Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-Texas).

15-MINUTE SURGE GIVES RED STORM BIG EAST ROMP
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It lasted too long to be called a spurt and since it
spanned two halves, it probably could not be classified as a run,
even an extended one. The only category to put it in is dominance _
pure and total.
</P>
<P>
   Outscoring its hosts by 28 points over a 15-minute period, St.
John's ripped Boston College, 74-55, Saturday at the Conte Forum.
Though it was the Big East opener for both clubs, it eventually
took on the feel of one of those one-sided routs that St. John's
had been having against its smaller, metropolitan-area rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The 25th-ranked Red Storm, which improved to 6-2, took command
with just under eight minutes left in the first half. Until then,
the Storm played as if it hadn't had enough sleep the night before.
Beaten on the backboards, outhustled on the perimeter and unable to
score from practically everywhere, St. John's found itself trailing
by 24-15 with 7 minutes 56 seconds to go in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit was shocking since Boston College (2-4) entered as a
huge underdog. With no seniors, only three juniors and little
height, the Eagles already had lost to supposedly lower-level teams
such as Harvard and Fairfield. So when Boston College hit three
3-pointers en route to its 9-point lead, the crowd of 4,438 went
from being pessimistic to hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. As if to say ``enough is enough,'' St. John's
scored 17 of the final 19 points of the half to go ahead, 32-26.
The run was outstanding, as the Red Storm, after making only four
of its first 15 field goal attempts, hit 10 of its next 16.
</P>
<P>
   The spurt began with defense, as the re-energized Red Storm
forced 11 turnovers and held the Eagles without a field goal over
the final eight minutes of the half. Converting in transition, St.
John's scored nine of its 10 baskets on layups and dunks, including
a wicked reverse slam by Lavor Postell after driving the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give them a lot of credit for creating turnovers
and making them lead to scores,'' Boston College coach Al Skinner
said. ``Once we turned the ball over, they were very aggressive in
taking the ball to the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   What was still a close game at the start of the second half
became lopsided in a hurry. A thunderous dunk and layup by Tyrone
Grant, a 3-pointer by Ron Artest, a 3-pointer and three-point play
by Postell, and layups by Erick Barkley and Reggie Jessie _ all
while holding Boston College to two baskets _ powered St. John's to
a 49-30 lead with 12:54 remaining. By that time, the end was no
longer in doubt, and Red Storm coach Mike Jarvis was relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the road, you get scared and that's what I kept reminding
the kids,'' Jarvis admitted. ``I said forget about their record,
forget about being in the top 25. We're at their place and they're
not going to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, St. John's had balanced scoring, with Grant leading
the way with 15 points, Barkley following with 14, Artest scoring
11 and Postell and Jessie adding 10 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The only bad news of the day for St. John's was that senior
center Albert Richardson was elbowed in the right cheek midway
through the first half and had to be taken to nearby Newton
Wellesley Hospital, where he received stitches. After the game,
Jarvis said Richardson was fine and expected to return to action
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The victory made for a nice homecoming for Jarvis, who was born
and raised in Cambridge and experienced some of his greatest
professional triumphs in the area. In 1978, 10 years after
graduating from Northeastern University, he landed his first job as
a head coach at Cambridge Ridge and Latin High School, his alma
mater.
</P>
<P>
   With a young 7-footer named Patrick Ewing leading his club,
Jarvis won 77 of 78 games his first three years, earning
Massachusetts' coach of the year award each season. He moved into
the college ranks in 1985 and, in five seasons, became the first
coach to win 100 games at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always special to come back home and that's with capital
letters,'' said Jarvis, who spent Saturday night watching local
high school games. ``How often does anybody get the opportunity to
go back in front of your mother, your wife, your family and
friends, in your own back yard.''

AT A MIXER FOR VEGANS, ALL SPECIES ARE AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So, a guy walks into a party with a lizard on his
chest ....
</P>
<P>
   True story. Happened Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a man with a Belgian shepherd that stretched
nearly 5 feet long, and a woman with a pooch in a pocketbook, and
two ladies with cats.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the first singles mixer for vegans and their pets,
um, ``animal companions.'' Wouldn't want to imply any kind of
hierarchy among the species.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend always told me walking his dog was a good way to
pick up girls,'' said Dave Fazzino, sitting two seats away from
William Mejia, owner _ um, companion _ of Krishna, a type of lizard
known as a northern blue-tongued skink. ``Taking that thing around
must be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has been collecting
snakes, lizards and other reptiles since he was about 13. Right now
he has two: Krishna, an 18-inch creeper with a back that feels,
well, like a handbag and an amazing tongue that is almost
flirtatious as it darts in and out, and Radha, another skink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a girl not want to date me because of my
reptiles,'' Mejia said. ``They'll usually start with `Can I touch
it?' Then they want to hold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Krishna definitely drew the women Friday night at the Veggie
Singles party, held at the Source of Life Center on 34th Street,
just west of Fifth Avenue. That is partly because people
outnumbered pets by about 10 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the partygoers didn't have pets. These are
hard-core animal lovers, folks who go beyond mere meat avoidance to
shun all animal products. No cheese, no eggs, no honey. Most, like
Jean Thaler, do it for ethical reasons. Ms. Thaler, a bank
examiner, carried a purse that sported a pin saying ``Fur'' with a
red line through it.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Goldberg, the founder of Veggie Singles, wore an orange
button that said, ``Vegetarians Make Better Lovers.'' Goldberg, 56,
a Brooklyn resident, landed on the dating market in the early 1990s
after living with a woman _ and their three dogs and 13 cats _ for
more than 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   He answered personal advertisements, but was in a quandary when
the women ordered burgers: He did not want to pick up the tab, or
even pay the tax and tip, for food whose consumption he considered
immoral.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1994, Goldberg started a magazine called Veggie Singles
News, which now has 1,400 paid subscribers and distributes free
copies nationwide to thousands of other readers who page through
articles and advertisements intended to help ``vegetarian singles
meet and eat,'' as the magazine's motto puts it. Last year he
started organizing events _ a beach trip, a picnic, a massage
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I can tell if a woman is falling in love with me,
when she starts becoming a vegetarian,'' Goldberg said when asked
about the importance of shared eating habits to long-term
relationships. ``Then, if things take a turn for the worse, I can
tell, because she starts ordering steak.''
</P>
<P>
   Inviting the animals was a logical next step for the group.
Members bought two huge bags of vegan pet food and rented three
rooms on the fifth floor in the Source of Life Center. One for the
cats, with a litter box. One for the dogs, with a blue tarpaulin
spread on the floor. The one with a carpet, where the buffet of
Chinese food with faux meat was laid, was reserved for Homo
sapiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are urged to exercise appropriate caution,'' urged signs
posted in the hallways, ``as we are generally not familiar with the
history or temperament of most of the animals (or people) attending
this event.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the animal rooms were mostly empty as people chatted _ often
about their dietary habits _ and exchanged phone numbers. The cats,
Candy and Christina, and their owners became a bit lonely when
everyone else gathered elsewhere for a tarot card reading
(Actually, Candy was too shy to even come out of the bag that her
owner, Monica Jenkins, brought her in.)
</P>
<P>
   Most people had left their pets at home, not wanting to schlep
them on the subway or frighten them with too many strangers. Mejia
can handle only one skink at a time in public; he alternates
between Krishna and Radha so the one left at home does not get
jealous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is not to do something that's not fun for him,''
Ms. Thaler, 37, said to explain why she left Bobby, her cockatiel,
at home in his cage and brought a Beanie Baby bird to the party as
a surrogate. ``Whenever I take him out of his cage, he thinks he's
going to the doctor. He gets very upset.''

MASSACHUSETTS HANGS ON AND TURNS BACK LEHIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Massachusetts hung on to defeat Lehigh, 27-21,
Saturday in a Division I-AA quarterfinal game. Lehigh quarterback
Phil Stambaugh, facing a fourth-and-15 at UMass' 16-yard line,
threw the ball out of the end zone to set off a rush of fans onto
the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen (10-3), making their first playoff appearance
since 1990, will play Northwestern State, a 31-20 winner over
Appalachian State, in a semifinal next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' smallest player, the 5-foot-7-inch, 151-pound
Adrian Zullo, dragged Caliphe Buchanan into the end zone to
complete a 37-yard scoring pass from Todd Bankhead, giving UMass a
20-14 lead heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Place-kicker Jason Cherry, who earlier missed a 25-yard
field-goal attempt, was not called on when UMass faced a
fourth-and-goal at the 1-yard line on its next possession. Marcel
Shipp squirted in for the touchdown to give UMass a 27-14 with 11
minutes 17 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen were nearing their first playoff victory since
1978. In 1990, its last appearance, UMass lost to William &AMP; Mary,
38-0. Lehigh, making its first postseason appearance since 1980,
appeared headed for its first defeat in 14 games spanning back to
last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehigh fought back. Stambaugh rifled a 42-yard completion to
receiver Deron Braswell to set up the Mountain Hawks at the UMass
34 with 8:30 left. Stambaugh burrowed in from the 1 to cap the
10-play, 81-yard drive, closing the gap to 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 14-13 with 8:35 left in the third quarter, the
Minutemen had a chance to regain the lead on a 25-yard field-goal
attempt by Cherry, but he hooked the ball into the left goal post.
UMass had marched to the Lehigh 2, but two penalties _ the second
one declined _ left them to rely on their iffy kicking game.
Cherry, who replaced Matt Murphy at midseason, had attempted only
three field goals before Saturday, and has not inspired confidence
with low, weak kicks.
</P>
<P>
   After Lehigh's next drive stalled, it got the ball right back
when Kevin Quinlan's fumble on the punt return was recovered by
Bryant Appling at the Lehigh 45. A 40-yard connection between
Stambaugh and Rick Moore was called back because Moore was called
for pushing off. Lehigh only went backward from there and had to
punt.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts seized a 10-3 lead after a 30-yard touchdown pass
from Bankhead to Jimmy Moore. Moore bobbled the ball with defensive
back Kevin Joseph approaching, but managed to hang on to cap the
95-yard, nine-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts linebacker Kole Ayi knocked the ball from Deron
Braswell's hands on the next possession, and cornerback Mike Smith
recovered at the Lehigh 19 yard line. The Minutemen settled for
Cherry's second field goal of the half, a 33-yarder, to increase
their cushion to 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, asserting its size advantage in the interior, was
building momentum. On the ensuing Lehigh possession, a blitzing Ayi
smothered Stambaugh for a 13-yard loss to force a punt.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen took a huge gamble on the next possession, and it
paid off in the short run. Bankhead surged a yard on a fourth-and-1
to the UMass 29, keeping the Minutemen's next drive alive. But
later, linebacker James Young hit Bankhead as he threw, sending a
wobbly pass into the hands of Lehigh's Saundrell Davison at the
Mountain Hawks' 48. A few plays later, Lehigh tailback Ron Jean
sprinted 41 yards before Smith tackled him from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, who rushed for 82 yards on 12 carries in the first half,
finished off the drive with a 1-yard run, his second touchdown.
Lehigh tried to increase its 14-13 lead on Stambaugh's last-second
50-yard heave into the end zone, but it fell to the ground.

IT TOOK WEEKS, BUT WINNER GETS A PARTY  
 NO CONCESSION YET FROM OPPONENT  
 MAKING IT ONTO THE BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would be more than 10 days before the
certification of a winner in the race for state attorney general.
But that did not stop nearly 2,000 supporters of Eliot Spitzer from
gathering at the Waldorf-Astoria last week for a ``victory party.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the outcome of the Nov. 3 contest was far from clear.
On election night, Spitzer, the Democratic challenger, emerged with
a lead of 18,000 votes over the Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco.
But with more than 200,000 paper ballots to tally _ and court
challenges by Vacco _ the final count was delayed for weeks.
Spitzer's lead continued to hold and, two weeks ago, the Democratic
candidate declared victory at a small news conference.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all the paper ballots now counted, Spitzer's lead
has grown, leaving him with roughly 24,500 votes more than Vacco,
out of more than 4 million votes cast. The state Board of Elections
will make its report on the vote at a state Supreme Court hearing
on Monday and will certify the results the following week.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, supporters of Spitzer harbored no doubts about the
election's outcome. And the party, with its red, white and blue
balloons, was a dramatic contrast to the sober news conference
where Spitzer declared victory, having instead the feel of a
rousing valedictory.
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed to draw the firmament of Democratic political
power in New York, attracting virtually every prominent party
figure, from former Mayors Edward Koch and David Dinkins to
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Senator-elect Charles Schumer and
City Council Speaker Peter Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Attorney General Robert Abrams stood beside
Geraldine Ferraro, his opponent in a Senate race six years ago. And
state Sen. Catherine Abate, one of Spitzer's opponents during the
Democratic primary, also stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a come-from-behind victory,'' Spitzer shouted to the
cheering audience. ``This has been one long, tough month.''
</P>
<P>
   But Still No Concession
</P>
<P>
   While the Spitzer supporters were celebrating, lawyers for Vacco
continued to pore over voting records in the offices of the Board
of Elections in New York City last week. Although the board's
figures show Spitzer's lead has grown, Vacco _ far from conceding _
has dedicated himself to determining whether there was a sufficient
level of voter fraud to serve as grounds for a federal suit to seek
a new election.
</P>
<P>
   The Vacco campaign, which has made claims in state Supreme Court
of voting irregularities, declined to discuss any such findings in
court last Monday and has not discussed the matter in much detail
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reviewing data and checking lists against other lists,''
said Thomas Spargo, the lawyer for Vacco's campaign. ``We've found
a pattern of some registrations that are highly questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Spargo said, the campaign found ``a large number''
of people registered in a single apartment. ``We've found some
patterns that are extraordinary,'' he said. ``We're sifting through
and trying to make a determination about what to do with our
findings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Vacco's lawyers have made several charges
of election irregularities. They first said that 37,000 votes had
appeared without explanation after the unofficial Election Day
tally. Later, they said they had found a 7,000-vote error in the
results in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Spargo said that the Vacco campaign had obtained
material indicating that 1,000 people had voted in the names of
people for whom death benefits were being paid by the Social
Security Administration. But the campaign later backed off that
claim and has not produced any names in court.
</P>
<P>
   With each charge, the Vacco campaign asked the court for
additional time to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   What the campaign would do with its findings about registration
irregularities was not clear, although Spargo said the campaign
would have to make a decision soon. The campaign dispatched dozens
of lawyers and other representatives last week to election offices
in each of the city's boroughs _ except Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Spargo said that Staten Island, the city's least populous
borough, was not included, because ``there were not as large a
number of votes as in other boroughs.'' But it also happens to be
the only borough that Vacco won.
</P>
<P>
   Making It Onto the Ballot
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Elections also said last week that the
Working Families Party appeared to have drawn enough votes to earn
a place on the ballot in the next statewide election.
</P>
<P>
   The party represents an alliance of labor unions, politicians
and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or
ACORN, an advocacy group with low-income members. It won that
status by obtaining more than 50,000 votes on its line in the Nov.
3 election for Vallone, who was also the Democratic candidate for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   The board said the party received about 50,600 votes on its
line. The party, which is seeking to appeal to union members and
immigrants as well as middle-class and working-poor New Yorkers,
was also supported by former Mayor David Dinkins, and two mayoral
candidates from last year: Ruth Messinger and Sal Albanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will focus on issues that affect working-class families and
run campaigns around those issues,'' he said, saying that the party
would concentrate on raising the minimum wage, increased access to
health care and campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that a progressive agenda is not ignored
in Albany, the City Council and the county legislatures across the
state,'' he said.

 &HT;    RALLY AT CAPITOL URGES IMPEACHMENT
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Other Americans may say they are bored by national
scandal, but not an impassioned group who rallied at the U.S.
Capitol on Saturday for the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered as Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., perhaps the leading
supporter of impeaching Clinton, told them to stiffen the spines of
wavering Republicans looking for a way out of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two weeks will determine the future of Americans,
make no mistake about it,'' Barr said. Clinton's attorneys are
scheduled to begin presenting his defense to the House Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday, with a vote on sending articles of
impeachment to the floor possible by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the real Americans _ you _ want a constitutional
strategy, not an exit strategy,'' Barr said to the gathering of
several hundred people who traveled here on a few days' notice
after the event was announced by Free Republic, an Internet site
(http://www.FreeRepublic.com). In the past two years, the site has
developed into a cyberspace meeting place for Clinton critics.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was dotted with protest signs such as ``It's the
perjury stupid!'' and ``Impeach the Creep.'' A Jack Russell terrier
wore a sign reading ``Impeach Buddy,'' the president's dog.
</P>
<P>
   However, on this unseasonably balmy day, it was a self-described
``soccer mom,'' Jennifer McCorkle of Chillicothe, Ohio, who most
energized the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle, a mother of three, said she had been spurred into
action by polls that gave Clinton 69 percent approval ratings
despite his admitted affair with a White House intern and his
misleading statements. For the first time ever, she said, she
became a political activist, setting up a rally in her hometown and
later in the Ohio capital of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an American citizen who understands the elementary civics
lessons that my fourth-grade teacher taught me, that nobody is
above the law,'' McCorkle said. She called herself ``completely
astounded and disgusted'' at polls that show a majority of women
continue to support Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle was one of several people at the rally who said they
were new to protests and politics but have been drawn into action
by the Clinton scandal and the Internet site, started by Fresno,
Calif., software developer Jim Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The site made an activist out of Sheila Lee. Lee, who with her
husband owns a local magazine in Covington, La., said she regretted
missing a Free Republic rally on Halloween that attracted several
thousand people near the Washington monument.
</P>
<P>
   So for Saturday's rally, Lee drove 25 hours to spend her 55th
birthday at the Capitol rally.
</P>
<P>
   Another newcomer to politics, Michelle Hellgeth, a nurse from
Marietta, Ga., has gone even farther. Working on a computer in her
bedroom just nine weeks ago, she organized an impeachment rally for
Monday across from the White House in Lafayette Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never spoken out in my life,'' she said. She said that
she was doing it for her three grown children because ``I think
that moral values are so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellgeth has lined up nearly a dozen speakers, including
McCorkle and Barr, for Monday's event.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Americans are understandably ambivalent about the foreign
entanglements of U.S. business. Overseas operations can produce
profits and support some jobs at home, but they can also help
sustain abusive dictatorships and labor practices. In recent years
companies like Nike and Unocal have embarrassed themselves with
questionable overseas partnerships, but the problem extends far
back in U.S. industrial history.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was highlighted last week in a Washington Post story
on General Motors and Ford operations in Nazi Germany. The Post
reported that after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939,
the chairman of GM, Alfred P. Sloan, told a shareholder that the
internal politics of Nazi Germany ``should not be considered the
business of the management of General Motors.'' The company plant
in Germany was highly profitable. ``We have no right to shut down
the plant,'' Sloan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and Ford deny that they helped the Nazis or
significantly benefited from forced labor. The Post article said
American Ford and GM executives accepted medals from Hitler. A GM
executive met with Hitler and participated in converting the German
GM plant to military production in 1939 and 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The German Ford and GM plants were the largest producers of
trucks for the German army, according to U.S. Army reports. A 1945
Army report says U.S. Ford helped Hitler acquire crucial strategic
materials. Ford has found documents showing it profited slightly
from its German plant during years when the plant used forced
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and GM should give a thorough account of their actions in
Germany, and pay appropriate compensation. But they were not the
only U.S. businesses to profit during the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   The world has no contemporary equivalent of Hitler. But for the
past decade, U.S. companies have cozied up to the junta in Myanmar,
Afghanistan's Taliban, Central Asia's dictators, African
kleptocrats and Colombia's military.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. corporations argue that they can be a positive force in
repressive countries. This can be true. They often pay better than
local companies, and bad publicity has spurred some corporations to
sponsor health clinics and other good works. But these benefits are
outweighed by the political support companies lend to bad regimes.
Few ever criticize their hosts' policies. Governments take their
presence as a U.S. endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   It is unrealistic to expect that corporations will refrain from
trade or investment with bad governments. But they should hold
themselves to some guidelines. Their own practices should not be
abusive, even if local laws allow it. This means giving workers
wages they can live on and good working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   They also should not collaborate with government repression.
Apparel manufacturers in China and elsewhere have fired workers
trying to organize unions. Unocal, which is a partner with
Myanmar's government in a gas pipeline project, is being sued in
U.S. courts for alleged use of forced labor and forced expulsion of
villagers. Last week, Unocal did end its efforts to work with the
Taliban on a pipeline through Afghanistan, primarily because oil
prices are low.
</P>
<P>
   The entanglements of oil, gas, mining and other natural resource
companies with dictatorships are complex, as the businesses
sometimes find themselves keeping repressive governments afloat.
The activities of Shell, a British-Dutch company, in Nigeria
brought in nearly half the nation's hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Companies should use their tremendous power responsibly. Shell's
image is still tainted by its failure to speak out strongly to
prevent Nigeria's 1995 execution of nine environmental activists.
Some regimes are so heinous that simply to continue making profits
under them is reprehensible. Nazi Germany was surely one. Corporate
officials are not only businessmen, they are citizens of the world.

FIRST MOTHER, THEN BABY MAKES LANDING AT KENNEDY AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Nigerian woman seven-and-a-half months pregnant
went into labor on a flight from Ghana to New York on Saturday, but
the pilots radioed ahead and two Port Authority police officers
rushed on board when the plane landed at Kennedy International
Airport and helped deliver a healthy baby girl in coach class.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was born in coach, but she got first-class treatment,''
said Lt. Dan Carbonaro, a Port Authority police tour commander, who
witnessed the birth and joined in the applause of the flight
attendants and cockpit crew of Ghana Airways Flight 150, as the 6
pound, 9 ounce infant began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Janet Omolara Osita, 27, of Hassan, Nigeria, who was
traveling alone to New York to visit relatives, gave birth to the
as-yet-unnamed child across a row of seats with the help of
officers George Howard and Doris Caridi, and two airport
paramedics, Maureen Boyd and Mark Schauber.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the infant was wrapped in an airplane blanket and
handed to her crying, beaming mother. They were taken by ambulance
to Jamaica Hospital, where Michael Hinck, a spokesman, said mother
and child were doing fine. ``The Port Authority officers did a
great job,'' he said. ``Everything came out great.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth in a plane on the tarmac at Kennedy Airport did not
automatically confer U.S. citizenship on the infant, Carbonaro
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was technically born in Ghana because the plane had not
been received by U.S. Customs,'' he said. ``The plane was still
legally in the country of origin.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While doctors advise women not to travel by air in the last
trimester of a pregnancy, airlines have no regulations prohibiting
such travel, the lieutenant said. And with about six weeks
remaining to her due date, Ms. Osita apparently had no hint that
the birth was near when she boarded the flight Friday night in
Accra, Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the seven-hour flight, however, Ms. Osita went
into labor, which progressed rapidly. Moreover, the flight, which
had been scheduled to land at 7:15 a.m., was about 20 minutes late.
But the pilots radioed ahead and the Port Authority police were
alerted at 7:27 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all Port Authority police officers are trained in
emergency medical treatment, including birth deliveries, and, as it
happened, Howard, a 41-year-old father of two boys, had assisted in
a birth once before, 20 years ago as a volunteer firefighter on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Caridi, along with the paramedics, were waiting at
the gate of Terminal 4, the International Arrivals Building, when
Flight 150, a McDonnell Douglas wide-bodied MD-11 with several
hundred passengers aboard, drew up and opened the hatches about
7:35 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane's crew escorted passengers out, the officers and
paramedics hurried aboard. ``The baby had already started to
crown,'' said Howard, a policeman for 13 years. ``It was in the
birth canal.'' The mother, he said, was laid across several seats
in the center of the coach section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just worked with her,'' he said. ``It was natural
childbirth. She gave it a good push and after a couple of minutes
the baby came out. One portion of the head came out and turned to
one side. Then the shoulders came out, then the rest of the baby. I
clamped the cord and cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 7:48 a.m., someone noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris was comforting the mother while I delivered,'' Howard
said. ``Then Doris wrapped the baby in a blanket and handed her to
the mother. I was pretty calm, but it was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tears of the smiling mother, Carbonaro recalled a
moment of deep joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight crew was there and they all started applauding,''
he said. ``Normally we deal in a lot of negative things. But when I
heard the baby start to cry, well, it really felt good. It's a
great uplift, especially in the holiday season.''

LAST 3 TENANTS END EVICTION FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly six years, the women fought to keep their
home, a century-old low-rent residence in Manhattan catering to
single women, from closing its doors. Even when the eviction orders
came, they refused to go.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, finally accepting that their exodus was
inevitable, the last three tenants gathered their belongings in
duffel bags and boxes, and quietly left Leo House, which is
operated by a nonprofit group affiliated with Catholic Charities.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 supporters, including politicians and housing
advocates, stood outside the building's entrance, at 322 West 23rd
St., cheering on Mary Anne Aitken, Catherine Klemann and Georgia
Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fight is over now,'' Ms. Aitken said, as a young boy
presented her with a bouquet of carnations and a group of picketers
chanted: ``Affordable housing is no more. The Leo House has closed
the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aitken, 38, and two other women were the final members of a
group of 28 women who had fought to continue living in an annex of
Leo House when the eviction effort began in March 1993. Over the
years, their landlord, the Leo House for German Catholic Emigrants,
a nonprofit organization, has said it wanted to remove long-term
tenants to serve more short-term occupants.
</P>
<P>
   But the women fought all the way to state Supreme Court,
claiming that their landlord was violating rent-stabilization laws
protecting long-term tenants. Last February the court ruled in
favor of Leo House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aitken, who plans to move into a studio apartment in the
Flatbush section of Brooklyn, said she and the other tenants were
charged about $300 a month in rent.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the women, Catherine Klemann, 33, who lived in the
building since 1984, said she was unsure where she would go. Her
new apartment in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood will not be ready
to move into for at least another week. She and a group of
community leaders said that they intended to ask the building's
managers for an additional week.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I'd rather be moving into my own place, but I
have no place to go until it's ready,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Leo House called the women's protest unfair and
misguided. He said two of the women stopped paying rent long ago,
one in September 1997 and the other last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are by most standards not entitled to charity,''
the lawyer, Jared Brown, said. ``They are working women. The Leo
House won the right to evict them and just throw them into the
streets. That never happened, because the board wanted to be
fair.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The women had hoped Cardinal John O'Connor, who once served on
the Leo House board, would intervene and offer them a last-minute
reprieve. They met with the cardinal last month. The spokesman for
the archdiocese of New York, Joseph Zwilling, did not immediately
return phone calls to his office and home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said the archdiocese gives no money to Leo House, only
referring people there through Catholic Charities.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, opened in 1889 for German Catholic immigrant women,
is made up of a 59-room hotel that has charged guests $55 to $80 a
day, and the annex, where tenants paid $45 to $70 a week. The hotel
will remain in operation, mostly for travelers who are visiting
sick or infirm people in New York City, but plans for the annex
remain unresolved, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Several community housing organizations said that they planned
to continue the women's fight, pressuring the board to provide some
form of affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't very charitable or humane for a church organization
to throw people out just for a more profitable investment,'' said
Jane Wood, a longtime organizer of the Chelsea Coalition on
Housing.

 &HT;    RALLY AT CAPITOL URGES IMPEACHMENT
 &HT;    Eds: Retops with anecdotal lede.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doloras(cq) Post sat on a concrete wall near the
U.S. Capitol on Saturday, holding a poster that she and her husband
of 57 years had made. ``Impeach, Impeach, Impeach,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-written sign wasn't very professional-looking, but then
this was the first political protest that the couple, who live in
Falls Church, Va., had ever attended.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans may say they are bored by national scandal, but
not an impassioned group who rallied at the U.S. Capitol on
Saturday for the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered as Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., perhaps the leading
supporter of impeaching Clinton, told them to stiffen the spines of
wavering Republicans looking for a way out of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two weeks will determine the future of Americans,
make no mistake about it,'' Barr said. Clinton's attorneys are
scheduled to begin presenting his defense to the House Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday, with a vote on sending articles of
impeachment to the floor possible by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the real Americans _ you _ want a constitutional
strategy, not an exit strategy,'' Barr said to the gathering of
several hundred people who traveled here on a few days' notice
after the event was announced by Free Republic, an Internet site

   However, on this unseasonably balmy day, it was a self-described

 (SUBS to insert reference to Boesak's year in California in 7th

 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ All Allan Boesak says he is guilty of
is ``struggle bookkeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Courtroom 19 in the new wing of Cape Town's High Court, a
judge is going to decide whether ``struggle bookkeeping'' was
really fraud and theft, crimes serious enough to send one of the
liberation struggle's heroes to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, the court has heard from a string of witnesses
that Boesak used welfare projects to raise cash for a life of
luxury, flashy cars and overseas holidays. And for a while, it
seemed the prosecution might breeze to victory.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, one of the prosecution's principle witnesses,
Boesak's bookkeeper, crumpled under cross-examination and admitted
that he had implicated Boesak only to cover up his own thieving.
With tears in his eyes, the bookkeeper, Freddie Steenkamp, who is
already serving a six-year sentence for theft, asked for Boesak's
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Just how big a blow to the prosecution this was remains to be
seen. Prosecutors are scrambling to line up other last-minute
witnesses, including the singer Paul Simon, who contributed more
than $100,000 to Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the case has gripped this country both because it has
offered a window into Boesak's indulgent living and because
President Nelson Mandela has several times swooped in to help him,
in ways some critics find deeply objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   When Boesak returned from a year in California to face charges
last year, Mandela sent his justice minister to greet him at the
airport, and in recent weeks Mandela has openly raised funds for
his defense and derided the quality of the prosecution's case,
triggering outrage in legal circles. He later apologized for those
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Boesak was a clergyman in the forefront of the
anti-apartheid movement, defying the authorities and landing more
than once in solitary confinement. He was a founder of the United
Democratic Front, the political group aligned with the outlawed
African National Congress and a man with a certain gift for
rallying a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years that followed, prosecutors say, Boesak began
using the funds that poured in from foreign donors to support his
Foundation for Peace and Justice for his own needs _ sports cars,
an expensive home and, after his divorce, the debts of his new,
young wife.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, auditors testified, more money was spent on
first-class travel for Boesak and his family than for any other
project the foundation was involved in.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations of misappropriation of funds surfaced in 1994,
when lawyers for DanChurch Aid, a Danish charity, said money they
had sent to help victims of apartheid had been used to pay for
Boesak's house. But it took more than two years before formal
charges were made.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak faces 32 counts of fraud and theft involving nearly $1.5
million dollars, $195,000 of which he is accused of taking for
himself. Much of the money had been donated by Scandinavian
charities, but some was donated by Simon after his Graceland tour
of South Africa and some from the charitable arm of Coca-Cola. The
prosecution says Boesak deliberately raised money from Coca-Cola
saying it was for a poverty project, when he had every intention of
using the money to invest in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The case was delayed for more than a year as Boesak battled to
have the country's Legal Aid system pay for his legal bills.
Eventually, an anonymous donor coughed up more than $150,000 for
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   When Boesak ran out of funds last month, he appealed directly to
Mandela, who then publicly solicited more money for him. Within 24
hours another anonymous donor gave another $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses have been former board members of Boesak's
foundation who described being kept in the dark about almost all
the foundation's financial transactions. Some had even resigned
because of the lack of accounting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But some witnesses have clearly been reluctant to speak against
a man they admire. During Thursday's testimony, the prosecutor
battled with an auditor who had trouble remembering much of
anything, including which years he audited the foundation's books.
Finally, the prosecutor made him read the notes from the margins of
his work sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good system of internal checks does not exist,'' the notes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak says he feels abandoned by almost everyone, but Mandela.
At times, he says, he has regretted ``ever leading one single
march.'' He says the charges are not about fraud or theft but about
politics and people getting revenge for the success he had.
</P>
<P>
   He says that administering the accounts of the foundation was
not his work and that he paid little attention to it. ``My job was
to work for the downfall of apartheid,'' Boesak said, brushing
aside the notion that perhaps he should have been more aware. ``I
should like to think that that was a job not badly done.''

PRESIDENT FORCED OUT OF ADELPHI IS HIRED BY BOSTON UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Peter Diamandopoulos, who was forced out as
president of Adelphi University last year over issues of excessive
compensation and mismanagement, has been hired as a special
assistant to the president of Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   The move reunites Diamandopoulos with his mentor, Dr. John
Silber, the chancellor of Boston University. The two were friendly
competitors for the rank as the nation's highest-paid college or
university chief, although Boston University's enrollment of 30,000
is several times as big as Adelphi's, which is 4,275.
</P>
<P>
   Silber served on Adelphi's Board of Trustees until the board was
removed from office by the New York State Board of Regents last
year for failing to properly oversee Diamandopoulos and the
university. A new board appointed by the regents then terminated
Diamandopoulos' contract as president.
</P>
<P>
   At the formal hearings leading up to the regents' decision,
Silber was a staunch defender of Diamandopoulos, his compensation
and his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos' new appointment was first reported by the
student newspaper at Boston University. A university spokesman,
Colin Riley, said Saturday that Diamandopoulos would serve as a
special assistant to President Jon Westling, handling special
projects in development, international education and educational
policy. Diamandopoulos' new salary was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   At Adelphi, Diamandopoulos was criticized for not raising much
endowment money and resorting instead to large tuition increases,
which helped cause the enrollment to plunge 62 percent during his
12 years as president. He did promote foreign student programs,
especially in his native Greece. His education policies often
caused conflict with the faculty, but he was credited with creating
Adelphi's honors college, which has continued after his departure.
</P>
<P>
   To settle a tangle of litigation in the aftermath of
Diamandopoulos' removal from Adelphi, he, Silber and the other
former trustees agreed to repay Adelphi more than $1 million for
some of the excessive compensation and legal fees. In addition,
Diamandopoulos had to return $740,000, although he was granted a
partial settlement for the cancellation of his five-year contract.

   TAIWAN-ELECTIONS _ TAIPEI, Taiwan _ For weeks, Chinese leaders
have fidgeted just over the horizon as democratic Taiwan neared
bellwether elections that would test whether Taiwanese are aching
for full independence from the Chinese mainland. On Saturday, to
the relief of Beijing and likely Washington as well, millions of
Taiwanese delivered a loud mandate for caution. With a turnout of
over 67 percent, the voters signaled in mayoral and parliamentary
results that they don't want to risk confronting China's threat to
``use force'' in case Taiwan declares independence.

completely destroyed contribution limits and created a new
political environment where ``anything goes.'' Some analysts
believe there is some good news here. Unregulated third-party
advertising, the concern of the 1996 elections, has been replaced
by the parties, allowing the parties to reclaim some of their lost
influence in the political process and offering better
accountability to voters. Others such as Sen. Russ Feingold
(D-Wis.) argue that the need for reform has never been greater.

 &HT;    RALLY AT CAPITOL URGES IMPEACHMENT
 &HT;    Eds: Retops with anecdotal lede.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doloras(cq) Post sat on a stone ledge near the U.S.
Capitol on Saturday, holding a poster that she and her husband of
57 years had made. ``Impeach, Impeach, Impeach,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-written sign wasn't very professional-looking, but then
this was the first political protest that the couple, who live in
Falls Church, Va., had ever attended.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans may say they are bored by national scandal, but
not an impassioned group who rallied at the U.S. Capitol on
Saturday for the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered as Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., perhaps the leading
supporter of impeaching Clinton, told them to stiffen the spines of
wavering Republicans looking for a way out of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two weeks will determine the future of Americans,
make no mistake about it,'' Barr said. Clinton's attorneys are
scheduled to begin presenting his defense to the House Judiciary
Committee on Tuesday, with a vote on sending articles of
impeachment to the floor possible by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the real Americans _ you _ want a constitutional
strategy, not an exit strategy,'' Barr said to the gathering of
several hundred people who traveled here on a few days' notice
after the event was announced by Free Republic, an Internet site
(http://www.FreeRepublic.com). In the past two years, the site has
developed into a cyberspace meeting place for Clinton critics.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was dotted with protest signs such as ``It's the
perjury stupid!'' and ``Impeach the Creep.'' A Jack Russell terrier
wore a sign reading ``Impeach Buddy,'' the president's dog.
</P>
<P>
   However, on this unseasonably balmy day, it was a self-described
``soccer mom,'' Jennifer McCorkel of Chillicothe, Ohio, who most
energized the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkel, a mother of three, said she had been spurred into
action by polls that gave Clinton 69 percent approval ratings
despite his admitted affair with a White House intern and his
misleading statements. For the first time ever, she said, she
became a political activist, setting up a rally in her hometown and
later in the Ohio capital of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an American citizen who understands the elementary civics
lessons that my fourth-grade teacher taught me, that nobody is
above the law,'' McCorkel said. She called herself ``completely
astounded and disgusted'' at polls that show a majority of women
continue to support Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkel was one of several people at the rally who said they
were new to protests and politics but have been drawn into action
by the Clinton scandal and the Internet site, started by Fresno,
Calif., software developer Jim Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The site made an activist out of Sheila Lee. Lee, who with her
husband owns a local magazine in Covington, La., said she regretted
missing a Free Republic rally on Halloween that attracted several
thousand people near the Washington monument.
</P>
<P>
   So for Saturday's rally, Lee drove 25 hours to spend her 55th
birthday at the Capitol rally.
</P>
<P>
   Another newcomer to politics, Michelle Hellgeth, a nurse from
Marietta, Ga., has gone even farther. Working on a computer in her
bedroom just nine weeks ago, she organized an impeachment rally for
Monday across from the White House in Lafayette Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never spoken out in my life,'' she said. She said that
she was doing it for her three grown children because ``I think
that moral values are so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellgeth has lined up nearly a dozen speakers, including
McCorkel and Barr, for Monday's event.

ARMY FINISHES STRONG, BEATS NAVY, 34-30 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In another strange, competitive contest of the
kind that has marked the series in the past decade, Army scored 15
points in the fourth quarter Saturday to defeat Navy, 34-30, in the
99th Army-Navy game.
</P>
<P>
   A 70-yard touchdown run by fullback Ty Amey midway through the
fourth quarter gave Army a 31-30 lead and proved to be the winning
score for the Cadets.
</P>
<P>
   The game was marred by an incident immediately after Amey's run,
when a railing in the east end zone at Veterans Stadium gave way
and nine spectators were injured as they fell out of the stands.
The game was delayed for more than half an hour while ambulances
were brought onto the field. The nature of the injuries was not
immediately known, though there was a television report that the
most serious was a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams ended their seasons with 3-8 records.
</P>
<P>
   Navy played exuberantly in a first quarter that was filled with
action. Johnny Goff, Army's senior quarterback and second-best
ground gainer, fumbled on the Cadets' first and second offensive
series, turnovers that set up the Midshipmen for a 35-yard field
goal by Tim Shubzda and a 23-yard touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   On the first fumble, Goff was hit hard by the freshman defensive
end Bwerani Nettles from Los Angeles. Nettles recovered the second
fumble, which led to fullback Irv Dingle's 17-yard touchdown run
and a 10-0 Army lead.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Army's offense had the ball there was a new
quarterback, the sophomore Joe Gerena, with Goff now a cheerleader
on the sideline. Gerena had started two games and done well after
Goff injured an ankle in September, but had seen little action in
the last half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Warinner, the Army offensive coordinator who calls the plays,
decided to attack the Navy flanks with quarterback option plays and
they worked. Army moved down to the Navy 25 and from there Gerena
ran inside, ducked two tacklers and sped for a 25-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On Army's next series Gerena startled Navy by ripping off a
69-yard run down the sideline for a second touchdown. When the
extra-point attempt failed, the Cadets led by 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   The lead did not endure for long. In the second quarter the Navy
quarterback, Brian Broadwater, hit wide receiver Ryan Read for
touchdown passes of 49 and 69 yards, the latter an Army-Navy game
record. The first time Read ran a stop-and-go pattern against
cornerback Andrew Burke, who also stopped but did not go again.
Broadwater's pass was perfect. So was the next one into Ryan's
hands, as he sped by Burke once more.
</P>
<P>
   Those big plays put the Midshipmen ahead, 24-13, but Army took
back six points before halftime on another long play. Craig
Stucker, the fullback, hit into the line on a common dive play. He
found resistance but kept going 70 yards for a touchdown, just
making it to the end zone ahead of two Navy tacklers. A 2-point
conversion failed, and Navy remained ahead by 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Sailors increased the lead to 30-19 in the third quarter
following a 74-yard drive that ended with a nine-yard run by
another senior fullback, Matt Harden. This time Navy's 2-point
attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   Army was not through. The Cadets staggered through a 98-yard
drive that concluded with a surprise play, a 36-yard touchdown pass
to halfback John Johnson thrown by Army's best running back, Bobby
Williams, in the first minute of the fourth quarter. In four
seasons of play Williams had never attempted a pass. The Cadets
then trailed by 30-25.
</P>
<P>
   Navy lost a touchdown when Harden fumbled in the end zone when
hit by Will Henderson, and Army's Jason Walker recovered for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadets then took the lead on Amey's 70-yard run, another
simple dive play. After another 2-point conversion failed _ between
them, the teams failed on four in a row _ the score was 31-30,
Army. The Cadets added a 27-yard field goal by Eric Olsen with 47
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Between them the two teams came in having won only five of 20
games this season. But such is the luster of this contest that all
66,590 seats at Veterans Stadium were sold out by late September,
before big losses to Air Force, Army by 35-7 and Navy by 49-7, had
dimmed the season's sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Army's record was 2-8, the two victories coming against
Cincinnati and Houston, two opponents in Conference USA, the
Cadets' new affiliation. Navy, one of the few remaining independent
Division I-A teams, beat Kent, Colgate and Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of records, the game remains a grand spectacle, with
the Cadet Corps from West Point and the Brigade of Midshipmen from
Annapolis, each 4,000 strong, providing peripheral splendor,
notably when marching into the stadium well before the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   These ceremonies have been going on for decades, mostly in
Philadelphia, where the game has mostly been played since 1899.
There have been 21 games at other sites, such as Giants Stadium at
East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's game, Army was ahead in the series,
47-44-7. After 98 games the differential between the teams was only
93 points, in the Cadets' favor.

SECOND STRAIGHT TITLE FOR MORRISTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GRANT GLICKSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Morristown Colonials picked up where
two other New Jersey high school football powers had left off by
routing Westfield, 37-14, in the North Jersey Section 2, Group 3
final Saturday at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen Catholic and Passaic Tech kicked off this weekend's
six-game state championship set here on Friday night by registering
resounding victories in their respective title games. Bergen
Catholic (12-0) crushed St. Joseph (10-1), 35-9, in the Parochial
Group 4 final, and Passaic Tech (12-0) dominated Union Hill (10-2),
48-6, for the North Jersey Section 1, Group 4 title.
</P>
<P>
   For Morristown (11-0), the state's fourth-ranked team, it was
the second straight state title and fourth over all. The Colonials,
who are now 7-0 in playoff action, claimed their other state titles
in 1974 and 1993. They have won 19 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Morristown achieved the victory by holding off the Blue Devils'
comeback attempt. Westfield (9-3) rallied from a 22-0 first-quarter
deficit to pull within 8 points before the Colonials blew the game
open early in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came on the final play of the third quarter,
when Stewart Winston returned a Westfield punt 65 yards to the Blue
Devils' 10-yard line. Four plays later, Ahmad Hagler leaped over a
pile of players in the end zone for his second touchdown of the
game to extend Morristown's lead to 30-14. Winston put the game
away with 5 minutes 36 seconds remaining when he took a quarterback
keeper around left end for a 4-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   The teams took turns dominating in the first half. Morristown,
taking advantage of three Westfield fumbles in the first five
minutes of the contest, scored 22 unanswered points in the first
quarter. Westfield, which had lost three fumbles all season,
responded with two touchdowns of its own in the second period to
narrow Morristown's lead to 22-14 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Morristown, which arguably boasts the best backfield in the
state, scored on its first two possessions of the game. The
Colonials feature three dangerous backs in Hagler (181 carries for
1,643 yards and 21 touchdowns), Dorell Humes (56 carries for 646
yards and 8 touchdowns) and Winston (646 yards and 6 touchdowns
passing, and 722 yards and 10 touchdowns rushing).
</P>
<P>
   Morristown, which entered the game having scored 17 touchdowns
on runs of 40 yards or more, opened the scoring when Winston raced
around right end on a 36-yard quarterback keeper. Rob Oglivie faked
the extra-point kick and found Jon Rogers in the end zone to stake
Morristown to an 8-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing kickoff, Morristown's Matt Osborne recovered a
Kevin McCormack fumble at Westfield's 45-yard line. Two plays
later, Morristown made it 15-0 as Hagler dived in after a 44-yard
pass from Winston to Oglivie put the ball at the 1. Morristown
appeared on its way to an easy victory when Hagler broke loose on a
55-yard jaunt.
</P>
<P>
   But Westfield, which was seeking its first title since 1977 _
when Butch Woolfolk, later a running back with the Giants, played
for the Blue Devils _ did not go without a fight. Westfield got on
the board 1:29 into the second period when McCormack reached the
end zone from 49 yards out. McCormack's touchdown capped a
five-play, 91-yard drive. The key play was a 31-yard pass from
Brandon Doerr to Todd Dowling. Westfield's final touchdown came 43
seconds before intermission. Doerr hit Lamont Turner with a 8-yard
scoring strike.

VLADIMIR DOKOUDOVSKY, 79, BALLET DANCER, TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vladimir Dokoudovsky, a founding member of Ballet
Theater, a principal dancer with the Ballets Russes troupes of the
1930s and '40s and an influential teacher in New York, died on
Wednesday at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Patricia.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Mordkin Ballet, a forerunner of American
Ballet Theater, Dokoudovsky was among the dancers who in 1940
formed the nucleus for the first New York season of Ballet Theater,
as that company was originally called.
</P>
<P>
   He was best known for his appearances with the two organizations
that tried to preserve the heritage of Diaghilev's innovative
Ballets Russes: Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Ballet
Russe de Monte Carlo. He danced with the Monte Carlo company in
1938, and with the colonel's group from 1942 to 1952, interrupting
his tenure there to return to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo as a
guest artist in 1950 and 1951. He also choreographed ``Les Femmes
d'Alger,'' inspired by a Delacroix painting, for de Basil in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Monte Carlo of Russian and Italian parents, Dokoudovsky
received his early training from Olga Preobrajenska in Paris and
made his debut with the Monte Carlo Opera Ballet in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Although noted for his wide range of classical and character
parts, Dokoudovsky specialized in the works of such Ballets Russes
choreographers as Michel Fokine, Leonide Massine and David Lichine.
He was especially associated with Fokine's choreography, displaying
his versatility in such roles as the barbaric Warrior in ``Prince
Igor,'' the sensuous Golden Slave in ``Scheherazade'' and the
nimble Harlequin in ``Carnaval,'' as well as in the title roles of
``Petrouchka'' and ``Paganini.'' In recent years, Dokoudovsky
revived Ballets Russes productions for several regional companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, he started teaching in New York schools,
including Ballet Arts and the American Ballet Theater School. He
opened his own New York Conservatory of Dance in 1977. A popular
teacher, he was also a highly demanding one and his authoritative
presence led several generations of students to nickname
Dokoudovsky ``the Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Tatiana
Dokoudovska of Kansas City, Mo.

CLEOPA, 87, ROMANIAN MONK SOUGHT OUT BY PILGRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cleopa, an Orthodox monk who once fled communist pressure by
becoming an anchorite in Romania's forests, died last week in the
remote monastery where his down-to-earth teachings came to attract
large and steady streams of pilgrims. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Romanian Orthodox officials in Bucharest, who reported his death
on Thursday, said he succumbed to the illnesses of age. He was to
be buried at the 14th-century Sihastra Monastery, 200 miles north
of Bucharest, where an amphitheater was constructed after 1989 to
accommodate the growing numbers of visitors eager to hear Cleopa's
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with an tradition traced to Gregory of Sinai, a
14th-century saint, Orthodox officials said Cleopa's body would be
lowered directly into the ground seated on a small stool, as a mark
of respect for a life of particular asceticism.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article posted on a Romanian language Web site
devoted to Cleopa's teaching, he was described at a recent
appearance as being frail as he greeted visitors while being
carried by younger monks. ``I am Uncle Moldy,'' he was quoted as
saying, ``with one foot in the grave and the other on earth.'' Then
he declared, ``life is a fight against the body, the world, the
devil and death.''
</P>
<P>
   A child of illiterate peasants who was born in northern Romania,
Cleopa entered the Sihastra Monastery in 1934, when he was 25,
taking a single name as is customary for monks. As he cared for the
monastery's sheep, he quickly gained respect within the religious
community for his remarkable memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could recite long sections of scripture and the teachings
of the church fathers by heart,'' recalled the Rev. Roman Braga, a
77-year-old priest who is the spiritual leader at the Romanian
Orthodox convent of the Dormition of the Mother of God in Rives
Junction, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Brother Cleopa in between my prison terms,'' said Braga,
who spent 11 years in custody in communist Romania. ``I had heard
of him and traveled to see him in the early 1950s. He was not
highly educated, but he was able to speak in simple ways that were
at the same time very deep and went to the heart of his listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke of ordinary things but in ways that made you think of
God. I remember how joyful he was. He kept saying that life was a
gift and he had his special way of greeting you; he would say, `May
Heaven consume you.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Braga met the monk, Cleopa had returned from his
years of solitude. As Braga told the story, the monk had spent 12
years as a shepherd when the old abbot of Sihastra died. The monks
elected Cleopa to be the new abbot.
</P>
<P>
   After that, his reputation spread and people began traveling to
the remote monastery to seek his absolution and guidance. After
1948, when Communists consolidated their control over Romania, such
visits brought Cleopa to the critical attention of state
authorities, police and even some fellow churchmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was told to tell the people who were coming to see him, to
go away, to stop coming, but he could not do that,'' said Braga.
``Instead, sometime around 1950, he left the monastery and became a
hermit. He went into the mountain forests, living in solitude in an
underground den he built. Woodsmen brought him sacks of potatoes
each month and every day he would eat one potato.''
</P>
<P>
   Braga said that after Stalin died in 1953, pressure on the
Orthodox Church eased and Cleopa was able to return to the
monastery. His reputation for wisdom and good humor grew and so,
too, did the number of visitors, first during years that the
country was ruled by Nicolae Ceausescu and then even more markedly
after the fall of the dictator in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade of his life, Cleopa was invited to lecture at
universities. His sermons were gathered and published under the
title ``Talks with Brother Cleopa'' and were posted on the
Internet. Some were translated into English and published in
Sobornost, an ecumenical Orthodox and Anglican journal published in
Oxford.

   NEW YORK _ So, a guy walks into a party with a lizard on his
chest ....
</P>
<P>
   True story. Happened Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a man with a Belgian shepherd that stretched
nearly 5 feet long, and a woman with a pooch in a pocketbook, and
two ladies with cats.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the first singles mixer for vegans and their pets,
um, ``animal companions.'' Wouldn't want to imply any kind of
hierarchy among the species.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend always told me walking his dog was a good way to
pick up girls,'' said Dave Fazzino, sitting two seats away from
William Mejia, owner _ um, companion _ of Krishna, a type of lizard
known as a northern blue-tongued skink. ``Taking that thing around
must be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has been collecting
snakes, lizards and other reptiles since he was about 13. Right now
he has two: Krishna, an 18-inch creeper with a back that feels,
well, like a handbag and an amazing tongue that is almost
flirtatious as it darts in and out, and Radha, another skink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a girl not want to date me because of my
reptiles,'' Mejia said. ``They'll usually start with `Can I touch
it?' Then they want to hold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Krishna definitely drew the women Friday night at the Veggie
Singles party, held at the Source of Life Center on 34th Street,
just west of Fifth Avenue. That is partly because people
outnumbered pets by about 10 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the partygoers didn't have pets. These are
hard-core animal lovers, folks who go beyond mere meat avoidance to
shun all animal products. No cheese, no eggs, no honey. Most, like
Jean Thaler, do it for ethical reasons. Ms. Thaler, a bank
examiner, carried a purse that sported a pin saying ``Fur'' with a
red line through it.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Goldberg, the founder of Veggie Singles, wore an orange
button that said, ``Vegetarians Make Better Lovers.'' Goldberg, 56,
a Brooklyn resident, landed on the dating market in the early 1990s
after living with a woman _ and their three dogs and 13 cats _ for
more than 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   He answered personal advertisements, but was in a quandary when
the women ordered burgers: He did not want to pick up the tab, or
even pay the tax and tip, for food whose consumption he considered
immoral.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1994, Goldberg started a magazine called Veggie Singles
News, which now has 1,400 paid subscribers and distributes free
copies nationwide to thousands of other readers who page through
articles and advertisements intended to help ``vegetarian singles
meet and eat,'' as the magazine's motto puts it. Last year he
started organizing events _ a beach trip, a picnic, a massage
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I can tell if a woman is falling in love with me,
when she starts becoming a vegetarian,'' Goldberg said when asked
about the importance of shared eating habits to long-term
relationships. ``Then, if things take a turn for the worse, I can
tell, because she starts ordering steak.''
</P>
<P>
   Inviting the animals was a logical next step for the group.
Members bought two huge bags of vegan pet food and rented three
rooms on the fifth floor in the Source of Life Center. One for the
cats, with a litter box. One for the dogs, with a blue tarpaulin
spread on the floor. The one with a carpet, where the buffet of
Chinese food with faux meat was laid, was reserved for Homo
sapiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are urged to exercise appropriate caution,'' urged signs
posted in the hallways, ``as we are generally not familiar with the
history or temperament of most of the animals (or people) attending
this event.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the animal rooms were mostly empty as people chatted _ often
about their dietary habits _ and exchanged phone numbers. The cats,
Candy and Christina, and their owners became a bit lonely when
everyone else gathered elsewhere for a tarot card reading
(Actually, Candy was too shy to even come out of the bag that her
owner, Monica Jenkins, brought her in.)
</P>
<P>
   Most people had left their pets at home, not wanting to schlep
them on the subway or frighten them with too many strangers. Mejia
can handle only one skink at a time in public; he alternates
between Krishna and Radha so the one left at home does not get
jealous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is not to do something that's not fun for him,''
Ms. Thaler, 37, said to explain why she left Bobby, her cockatiel,
at home in his cage and brought a Beanie Baby bird to the party as
a surrogate. ``Whenever I take him out of his cage, he thinks he's
going to the doctor. He gets very upset.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Garcia Mendez, a former legislator in Puerto Rico
and lifelong champion of statehood for the island commonwealth,
died in a hospital in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on Nov. 17, his 96th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Mendez, a former speaker of the Puerto Rican House of
Representatives, helped found the Statehood Republican Party in
1948. The organization was a forerunner of the pro-statehood New
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pedro Rossello, the party's current head, declared a
three-day period of official mourning. At the governor's urging,
Puerto Ricans will take another nonbinding vote on the status of
the island on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Mendez was born in Aguadilla in the island's northwest.
He served in Puerto Rico's House of Representatives from 1932 to
1940 and became its youngest leader. He was later elected senator.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent lawyer and businessman, he founded Western Bank. He
also owned El Imparcial, a newspaper that is defunct.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Mendez is survived by two daughters. His wife, Freddery
Ramirez de Arellano, died some years ago.

AUSTRIANS STEP UP IN AN ALPINE SEASON WITHOUT TOMBA OR STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter does not officially begin until later this month, but the
winter sports season officially began in September, when the
aerialists opened their World Cup freestyle season in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Winter athletes are not yet tennis players, or golfers, or
soccer players, for whom one season blends seamlessly into the next
without much time for reflection or recovery. But the winter
campaigns are getting longer, and it will be intriguing to see what
happens as the Southern Hemisphere continues to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Skiers now train in South America and New Zealand during the off
season. Will there eventually be World Cup Alpine races in Chile in
June? World Cup moguls in Australia's Snowy Mountains in July?
World Cup snowboarding in South Africa's Drakensberg range in
August?
</P>
<P>
   For now, the winter circuit remains a European and North
American affair, with an occasional long-haul flight to Japan. The
1998-99 season began in earnest the last few weeks, without some of
its best known performers. Alberto Tomba, Picabo Street and Katja
Seizinger are not involved in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Tomba announced his retirement in early October, shortly before
the Alpine skiers opened their season on the glacier in Soelden,
Austria. The now-traditional glacier event, which comes nearly a
month before the next World Cup Alpine race, exists largely to
remind consumers that it is time to book their ski vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Tomba helped inspire plenty of lowlanders to head for the
mountains, and not just in his native Italy, during his remarkable,
rollicking career. But after winning three Olympic gold medals and
two world championships and then fading in the last two seasons, he
will now have time to devote to his acting and his wine cellar, and
to addressing serious charges of tax evasion that have been brought
against him in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Tomba's charisma will be extremely difficult to replace, but the
Austrian Hermann Maier is potentially a more dominant skier, if not
personality, than Tomba was at his peak. Unlike Tomba, who
specialized in the two technical events, Maier, known as the
Herminator, is a three-event skier: capable of winning any super-G,
downhill or giant slalom he enters.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrians have emphasized cross-discipline skiing in their
development program of late, and Maier won the overall World Cup
title with ease last season, his first full season on the circuit.
He also won two gold medals at the Winter Olympics in Nagano,
Japan, picking himself up out of the snow after one of the most
spectacular falls in the history of the downhill and finishing
first in the super-G and giant slalom.
</P>
<P>
   His success did not go unchallenged. In the off season, the
Italian team doctor, Herbert Schonhuber, and the Swiss team leader,
Teo Nadig, both publicly insinuated that Maier had used
performance-enhancing drugs in the last three years to help him add
more than 20 pounds to his once-slight frame.
</P>
<P>
   Maier denied those accusations, attributing them to frustration
on the part of his rivals. He said he had been tested four times in
1998 and that his new muscles came from lugging the bricks he laid
for a living before he found his place on the Austrian team.
</P>
<P>
   After defending himself, Maier strapped on his skis and resumed
attacking: winning the opening giant slalom at Soelden by 1.6
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will play host to this year's world Alpine
championships in Vail, Colo., in February, but the Americans are in
no position to impress the home crowds. Tommy Moe, whose only
career downhill victory came at the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer,
Norway, has retired, along with A J Kitt and Kyle Rasmussen, his
longtime teammates.
</P>
<P>
   A much larger blow to American skiing came at the World Cup
finals last March, when Street broke her left femur and tore
ligaments in her right knee in a crash. Street, one of the most
personable of athletes, had already spent most of 1997
rehabilitating after another knee injury and had gotten healthy
just in time to win the Olympic super-G gold medal in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   Street will not compete this season, but at age 27 she has no
plans to retire, and as if to prove it, she is featured in a
television commercial in which she escapes from a hospital bed in
her wheelchair, rolling down stairs and out the swinging doors of
the emergency room in tuck position.
</P>
<P>
   Street's longtime rival, Katja Seizinger of Germany, the premier
women's skier of the 1990s, is not nearly as comfortable in front
of the camera, although she is every bit as audacious on skis. But
she, too, is in rehabilitation after suffering the first serious
injury of her career (torn knee ligaments) during training in the
off season.
</P>
<P>
   Seizinger won two gold medals and a bronze in Nagano and the
overall World Cup title last season. In her absence, her teammates,
Hilde Gerg and Martina Ertl, Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer and
Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg are among the favorites to replace her.
</P>
<P>
   Austrians have dominated the Alpine events in the early weeks.
When Christiane Mitterwallner won the super-G in Mammoth Mountain,
Calif., on Friday, it gave the Austrian women four victories in
eight races so far; the weekend before in Lake Louise, Alberta,
Meissnitzer won the super-G and Renate Goetschl won two downhills.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian men have been equally impressive, with Maier
leading a 1-2-3 giant-slalom sweep in Soelden and Stefan Eberharter
leading a sweep of the top five places in the super-G in Aspen,
Colo., last weekend.

 &HT;    Winter meetings make comeback
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It used to be sort of fun when baseball would pick an
idle winter weekend, fly in the owners and general managers to some
hotel and talk baseball so loudly for so long that the nation
couldn't help but listen.
</P>
<P>
   The winter meetings were devised in part to get baseball back
out on the front page during the offseason, and the trades and
free-agent signings got the game's blood flowing again. Then the
locusts came in '92, and baseball called the whole thing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winter meetings are a tough place, with the agents knowing
the general managers are back there,'' Braves general manager John
Schuerholz said. ``They really get in the way. They really create
an atmosphere that's more bothersome and time-consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, after a five-year hiatus, the majors will hold its
first full winter meetings this weekend at Nashville's sprawling
Opryland Hotel. The concept has lost some of its appeal. A number
of owners are not attending, and there is some concern that, having
spent more than $700 million on free agents just since the season
ended, the clubs have lost the mood for dealing.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, Kevin Brown is out there for the taking,
and while the finalists are down to Los Angeles, St. Louis,
Colorado and San Diego, Scott Boras, Brown's agent, would love
nothing more than to flit from hotel room to hotel room while
hiking the bidding. Boras did so in the 1992 meetings in Louisville
when he played the New York Yankees against the Braves for Greg
Maddux. But the bigger money made dealing more difficult, and the
1992 meetings that saw both Maddux and Barry Bonds change teams
altered the landscape. In a near frenzy, teams spent almost
$258million on 34 players in just 48 hours. In an awful conclusion,
Florida Marlins president Carl Barger suffered a fatal heart attack
in the lobby as the meetings were breaking up. Next year came the
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   After the huge contracts already granted, Nashville's meetings
will be mellower. Roger Clemens' trade demand will stir the most
interest, and the Blue Jays already are pushing Houston for second
baseman Craig Biggio so Clemens can return to his native state.
Montreal's Rondell White is on the block, too.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect much from the Braves. Schuerholz already pulled
off the Bret Boone trade at the more sedate GM meetings, and the
acquisition of free agents Brian Jordan and Otis Nixon have filled
the team's remaining needs. Unless, that is, someone wants to talk
about Ryan Klesko.

 &HT;    Lewis fights for recognition
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He was born in England, grew up in Canada, maintains a
residence in Jamaica and trains in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All Lennox Lewis needs is for somebody, somewhere, to embrace
him.
</P>
<P>
   After 35 pro bouts, Lewis, 33, has won only one title belt and
zero support as the reigning heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned about the criticism I've received,''
he said. ``I'm just looking forward to my chance to prove everybody
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That it has taken until now _ or until March 13, when Lewis
meets consensus champion Evander Holyfield in New York City _ is
the biggest impediment to Lewis gaining credibility. He is 34-1
with 27 knockouts, a powerful right hand, tremendous size (6 feet
7, 243 pounds) and an Olympic gold medal. But he has never fought
Holyfield, Riddick Bowe, Mike Tyson, Michael Moorer or George
Foreman, who have held the three main titles (WBA, WBC and IBF) for
most of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an extended yawn over Lewis' accomplishments
and a microscopic fan base. The latest defense of his WBC crown,
against Croatian Zeljko Mavrovic, was held in a tent at a Native
American casino in Connecticut. Only a few thousand fans paid their
way in.
</P>
<P>
   One week earlier, Holyfield sold out the Georgia Dome. The fact
Holyfield has fought Bowe three times, Tyson and Moorer twice, and
Foreman and Larry Holmes largely explains his popularity and
credibility, which are partners in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis accuses Holyfield _ and others _ of ducking him, not the
other way around. ``I think (Holyfield) made a mistake by waiting
this long to fight me,'' he said. His manager, Frank Maloney, said,
``He's always wanted the recognition as the best heavyweight. After
this fight, people will say, `That's Lennox Lewis. He beat Evander
Holyfield.'''
</P>
<P>
   For now, all Lewis' supporters can say is he beat Tommy
Morrison, Razor Ruddock, Tony Tucker, Frank Bruno, Henry Akinwande
or Andrew Golota. He lost to Oliver McCall and avenged that only
when the substance-abused McCall suffered a nervous breakdown in
the ring. His narrow decision over Ray Mercer was disputed.
Holyfield denies avoiding Lewis but says his upcoming opponent's
reputation is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't judge him by the fact people didn't fight him,'' he
said. ``I'm fortunate because every time somebody didn't fight him,
it seemed like they fought me.''
</P>
<P>
   A recap of Lewis' non-opponents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Holyfield. He and Lewis were close to a deal last year but it
fell apart when the HBO cable network declined to put up sufficient
funds for the fighters' purses. Others blame promoter Don King for
sabotaging the talks by coming to an agreement with Lewis
($10million) before seeing what Holyfield would seek ($20million),
or Lewis for not lowering his demands. Holyfield also sought out
Lewis prior to Holyfield's first fight against Tyson in 1996 but
was rejected by the Lewis camp.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bowe. Lewis was a mandatory WBC challenger after Bowe's win
over Holyfield in 1992. But Bowe renounced that portion of the
title _ throwing the belt in a garbage can _ because he wanted to
make a few easy defenses first. The belt was presented to Lewis,
the first of two times he would claim a title without fighting a
champion. A second attempt to match Bowe and Lewis fell apart in
1993 when Bowe decided to give Holyfield a rematch. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tyson. Lewis was a WBC mandatory challenger again after Tyson
defeated Frank Bruno in 1996. But Tyson and his former promoter,
King, chose a perceived easier and richer fight against Holyfield.
Tyson not only was stripped of the WBC belt before the Holyfield
fight, he had to pay Lewis $4million to settle a lawsuit. King now
admits: ``Evander shocked the world when he beat Tyson. He shocked
me, and I didn't know I was in the world.'' Lewis went on to win a
rematch with No.2 ranked McCall for the vacant title.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moorer. When Moorer upset Holyfield, he thought a defense
against Foreman would be more lucrative and easier than against
Lewis. He was right on the first count, wrong on the second.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foreman. After Foreman floored Moorer, he declined to fight
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, believes Lewis' reputation for
avoiding difficult fights is unjustified, but he likes his
fighter's chances in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lewis) was an Olympic champion, and that's enough for me,''
Turner said. ``But from what I see, he doesn't have the tools to
beat Evander at his best. He's not as quick. He's not as tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis impressed more people as an amateur. After moving with his
mother and brother from London to Toronto in 1977, he went 75-7 in
the Canadian amateurs, the last win coming by knockout over an
American named Bowe to win Olympic gold in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   His development is widely believed to have been impeded by
former trainer Pepe Correa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been inconsistent at times, just like Evander,'' said
trainer Emanuel Steward, who is now in Lewis' corner. ``Lennox
should do well because of his physical strength, but I'm not sure
how they match up style-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield believes Lewis will wilt under pressure, saying, ``He
tries to knock you out, but he's never had a guy who can put
pressure on him. I'll hit him when I want to hit him. Pressure
makes people change. It's either gonna make him better or it's
gonna make him fold up like everybody else. I'm either gonna knock
him out good or I'm gonna knock him out bad. Either way, I'm gonna
knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's little surprise that Lewis believes otherwise. Holyfield,
he said, ``hasn't seen anything like me. When he gets hit and
realizes the power I have, things can happen mentally to a person
in the ring.''

 &HT;    Safeties hit and miss
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When he was NFC defensive rookie of the year in 1995,
Orlando Thomas started all 16 games, led the league with nine
interceptions and returned one for a touchdown. In the 41 games he
has played since that impressive debut, the Minnesota Vikings' free
safety has eight interceptions _ only one this year _ and no
scores.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for the dropoff, Thomas said two weeks ago, is
no explanation at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years later, I'd like to think I'm a smarter player
now,'' Thomas said as he studied videotape of the Green Bay
Packers' passing attack. ``But other than that, not a whole lot has
changed, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a significant change has occurred the past few
seasons, not so much to Thomas but to the position he plays. Think
of the traditional NFL free safety, and the mind conjures up images
of Hall of Famers Larry Wilson, Paul Krause and Emlen Tunnell.
Those men, who combined for 212 interceptions, played deep in the
secondary. They were defensive ``center fielders'' with superior
range, who moved well to the ball and benefited from overthrows by
scatter-armed quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But free safety has evolved as much into a run-support role as
pass defender during the past two years. Most secondary coaches
concede that it is getting increasingly difficult to locate free
safeties with strong ``ball'' skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an instinctive position,'' Vikings defensive coordinator
Foge Fazio said. ``We get guys whose instinct is to make the big
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend has left the NFL with a terrific group of impressive,
young strong safeties, including Lawyer Milloy (New England),
Robert Griffith (Minnesota), Rodney Harrison (San Diego) and John
Lynch (Tampa Bay). The quality at free safety, though, makes it
difficult to identify anyone enjoying an All-Pro season.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 through 1996, free safeties either led the league or
tied for the NFL lead in interceptions, but they didn't last year
and won't this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 starting free safeties in the NFL have 38 interceptions.
Sammy Knight of New Orleans is the only player with more than four.
Thirteen of the starters have none.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Marion, who played the first five seasons of his six-year
career with Dallas and now starts in Miami, hasn't had an
interception since the final game of 1995. That's a stretch of 38
games, during which he earned $4.76 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time you needed to have the (fortitude) of those
guys who pulled off the Brink's robbery,'' said Krause, the career
interception leader, who often was criticized for a passive style.
</P>
<P>
   Several coordinators said that some free safeties, including
Eugene Robinson of Atlanta, have lost range during the years.
Others said that catching skills have slipped at the position.
Fazio, secondary coach Bill Bradley of Buffalo and Colts assistant
head coach George Catavolos agreed that pass offenses have dictated
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``More offenses read (the secondary) from high to low now and
they are attacking the outside,'' Catavolos said. ``When everyone
played `cover two' (with two safeties deep), it was different. Now
you're seeing more `cover three' on third down, and teams are
bringing the free safety down to help against the run.

 &HT;    Old master has a new look
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since mid-October, members and guests at the Augusta
National Golf Club have been playing a course yet untouched by
anyone in a Masters tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Golden Bear tracks on the four holes that were
reworked this summer. There are no imprints from where a Tiger
Woods drive of gargantuan proportions has returned to earth. There
have been no azaleas in bloom yet on No. 2, No. 11, No. 15 and No.
17 since they were tweaked by architect Tom Fazio in June, mostly
to bring accuracy more into play heading into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly a reconstruction, it was nonetheless the most
extensive project the club has undertaken since it changed the
greens from Bermuda to bent grass in 1980. At a place where things
change less frequently than Haley's Comet passes over Washington
Road, it's a moderately big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta National members are used to seeing the course in less
than pristine condition when closed during the summer months, but
they are not accustomed to observing huge areas of bare clay and
earthmovers.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, the changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The par-5 No. 2 hole was lengthened by 25 yards with a new
back tee to 575 yards and a stone wall next to the tee box. Also,
the fairway bunker was shifted right to widen slightly the driving
area.
</P>
<P>
   _ The green at the par-4, 455-yard 11th hole was raised
approximately 2 feet, creating a new, back-left pin position, and
the pond was raised about a foot to accommodate flood control in
Rae's Creek, which was widened by about half its former size. Two
bunkers were removed and a new bunker placed in the right-center.
</P>
<P>
   _ The par-5, 500-yard 15th hole's fairway mounds to the right
side were reduced by about 85 percent, reducing the slingshot
effect for drives that land there. About 20 pine trees were planted
to the right side of the fairway, increasing the accuracy factor.
Also, a mound on the right side of the green was removed, with six
pine trees planted there.
</P>
<P>
   _ The par-4 17th hole was lengthened from 400 to 425 yards. The
pine clusters from the 15th hole come into play to the right of the
17th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   The changes take the previous yardage from 6,925 yards to 6,985
yards (3,500 in; 3,485 out).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these changes we've made will hold up for the
foreseeable future,'' Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson
said. ``We're comfortable with our golf course. The record that
Tiger broke (17-under par) stood for 32 years. I think we have a
pretty challenging golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Former state amateur champion Danny Yates, an Augusta National
member, has played the reworked course a few times since the
project and said, ``I definitely think it's going to make it more
challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the 15th hole has the greatest potential for effect.
Modern players have blasted drives there with little fear of
second-shot difficulties, but the added trees on the right have
tightened the driving area. With the mounds all but gone and its
accompanying slingshot effect that could add 40 yards to a drive,
the second shot could be a few clubs longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty big difference because you can't just hit it
over there to the right and just bomb it,'' Yates said. ``In fact,
I hit it over there and I just pitched it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The back tee at the dogleg-left second hole will affect mostly
tournament play, but everyone must be more mindful of the right
fairway bunker. Six-time champion Jack Nicklaus' recommendations on
alterations to Augusta National apparently were not as popular as
Fazio's.
</P>
<P>
   Of No. 2, Nicklaus told the Augusta Chronicle earlier this year,
``I wouldn't mind at all if they just blew that hole up. It's a
hole that plays illogical to me. It requires a duck-hook second
shot from an uneven lie to a green that only accepts fades. How
much sense does that make?

 &HT;    Decision time, by George
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Raiders, who got more mileage from backup
quarterback Donald Hollas than anyone could have anticipated, face
a tough decision soon on Jeff George. The former Falcon can void
his contract just by being on the roster at the end of the season
and force the Raiders to buy back an additional three years for a
signing bonus of at least $5 million. The problem is that George
has started and finished only four games in '98 because of a severe
groin injury, and that hasn't provided coach Jon Gruden a fair
gauge on how the QB fits into his offense. Gruden, owner Al Davis
and personnel chief Ken Herock love George's arm, but the Gruden
offense is predicated on getting the ball out quickly and George
has a penchant for holding it too long and taking too many sacks. A
clarification on George's injury: It was a tear, not a strain, and
the reported ``aggravation'' to the original tear, suffered Nov. 8
in the first series against Baltimore, was actually a new injury
just above the old one. ``Basically, he was starting the (healing)
process from scratch,'' Oakland quarterbacks coach Gary Stevens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Replay redux
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the new Cleveland Browns in 1999 _ and franchise
president Carmen Policy _ increases the odds that instant replay
will return. But not for the reasons espoused on last week's CBS
pregame show. Insider Michael Lombardi erroneously reported that
replay still would need only 23 votes to pass. But with the Browns
re-entering the league, the magic number for approval increases to
24. Where the value of Policy comes in is his ability to influence
other votes. Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson, a steadfast replay
opponent, announced he'll support it.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly wagers
</P>
<P>
   The questionable pass-interference call at the end of last
week's Buffalo-New England game, and subsequent two-point
conversion when Bills coach Wade Phillips didn't get his team back
on the field, had little bearing in Las Vegas. The point spread in
some parts of the country, including Atlanta, was either 3 or 3 1/2
points. The two-pointer allowed the Pats to win by four. But Caesar
Robaina, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Sports Consultants _ which
sets the line for most of that city's casinos _ said there was
little action on the game. Because of the finger injury to Drew
Bledsoe, the game was off the board until late Friday afternoon.
Then, it opened with the Pats favored by 1 1/2 and went to 2 points
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bad blood
</P>
<P>
   The league office already has served notice to Kansas City coach
Marty Schottenheimer and Denver counterpart Mike Shanahan that a
repeat performance of the debacle three weeks ago will result in
stiff sanctions. Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe has declared
publicly that he will attempt to strike a truce with Chiefs
linebacker Derrick Thomas in pregame warmups. Not surprisingly,
he's told teammates he hopes to verbally get under Thomas' skin
again during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals bungles
</P>
<P>
   Because he won't spend big on free agents, Cincy owner Mike
Brown has to take more chances on dubious-character picks in the
draft than almost anyone else. The Bengals seem to have reformed
tailback Corey Dillon, but their luck ran out last week on safety
Tremain Mack. The former fourth-rounder ('97), who has been
convicted four times for DUI, was sent to jail through January for
violating parole.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Miami receiver and former No. 1 pick Yatil Green, out two
seasons in a row with knee surgeries, has begun jogging. ... If
coach Pete Carroll is axed in New England, look for Packers
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis to be a candidate. ... The
University of Hawaii is interested in June Jones if he's not
retained by the Chargers.

   ATLANTA _ The pool of available veteran quarterbacks, which only
a month ago appeared dismal, has improved dramatically. By starting
10 of 12 games, Randall Cunningham has voided the second year of
his Minnesota Vikings contract. While coach Dennis Green would love
to keep both Cunningham and Brad Johnson, finances might dictate
that one of them goes. An unrestricted free agent who created a
market for himself is Washington's Trent Green. Since the Redskins'
bye week on Oct. 25, Green has thrown 11 touchdown passes and just
one interception and owns a 92.2 passer rating in five games.
Unless the Saints re-sign Kerry Collins, he'll attract suitors as
well. Add to that the quarterbacks who figure to be released after
June 1 _ Scott Mitchell (Detroit), Gus Frerotte (Redskins), Warren
Moon (Seattle) and Jeff Blake (Cincinnati) _ and there's the
potential for a real quarterback carousel again.

   The list of possible replacements for Mike Holmgren being
compiled by Green Bay GM Ron Wolf could include Jets assistant head
coach Bill Belichick and Vikings offensive coordinator Brian
Billick. Eagles coach Ray Rhodes remains a solid possibility as
well. Billick would be compelling because he'd serve a dual purpose
_ keeping an offensive-minded coach in charge while weakening a
division foe. Wolf's mentor was Al Davis, remember, and the Raiders
owner was notorious for interviewing assistants from every other
division team when he had a vacancy.

 &HT;    Manning's maturing on the job
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ With 2:49 remaining in the game against the New
York Jets three weeks ago, Peyton Manning hoisted the weight of the
world from his right shoulder and tossed it to Indianapolis Colts
teammate Marshall Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by a fourth-and-15 and a fast-closing linebacker at
the Colts' 33-yard line, elusive tailback Faulk feinted past the
would-be tackler and turned a short dump-off into an 18-yard gain.
The play moved the sticks and resuscitated a floundering series.
Faulk kept alive a sequence in which Manning overcame three
penalties, drove the Colts 100 yards in all and threw a winning TD
pass to tight end Marcus Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   And Manning advanced another link along the evolutionary chain
that promises to make him a premier player soon at the NFL's
highest-profile position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we all sort of consider that (play) a defining moment,''
said former University of Georgia standout Adam Meadows, the right
tackle for the Colts. ``That was one where you thought to yourself,
`Well, he's taken another big step now.' It was the latest in the
series of revelations.''
</P>
<P>
   What the rookie quarterback realized in his initial
fourth-quarter comeback was that even guys earning $6million a year
and carrying the label of Franchise Savior can't make every play by
themselves. It is a lesson the former University of Tennessee star
will carry into this afternoon's game against the Atlanta Falcons
at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Colts quarterbacks coach Bruce Arians noted that just a few
weeks earlier, Manning probably would have considered the
fourth-and-15 situation and convinced himself he had to throw the
ball to the down-marker to have a shot at converting. On the play
to Faulk, the tailback was Manning's third _ and as it turned out,
his best _ option, given the coverage New York was playing.
</P>
<P>
   Even quarterbacks with Manning's impressive heritage aren't
supposed to make those kinds of adjustments in only their 10th NFL
start, coach Jim Mora acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, that comes from experience and starting to be more
comfortable,'' Manning said after a midweek practice. ``The natural
reaction is to feel you have to throw it the length of the yardage
you need. But, hey, guys wouldn't be in this league if they all
couldn't make plays. You have to let the people around you do what
they do best. That helps you, and it helps you make better
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   By definition, such epiphanies are not planned in advance. And
quantum leaps typically are more serendipitous than scripted.
Still, those singular moments are a byproduct of preparation. And
in Manning, the Colts have a guy who lives the Boy Scout creed.
</P>
<P>
   A quarterback makes progress in the league by building
incrementally, preparing in the classroom and then stacking
successful physical plays on top of that mental foundation. That's
a blueprint Manning followed even at Isidore Newman High School in
New Orleans, and his debut season in the NFL indicates no need for
revision.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: While he would love to have attended Saturday
night's SEC title game, there's no way Manning would have asked to
be excused from team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   With four games remaining, the first overall selection in this
year's draft is on pace to demolish every rookie passing record.
Manning needs 38 attempts, 25 completions and 24 yards to put his
name atop those categories. Four more touchdown passes will wipe
out Charlie Conerly's rookie mark.
</P>
<P>
   Manning probably would trade in those gaudy individual numbers
for a few more victories, and he conceded that Sunday nights,
Mondays and Tuesdays are ``miserable'' after defeats. Despite a
2-10 record, though, the Indianapolis offense is becoming one of
the league's better units.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of Manning puts the Colts a leg up on other
rebuilding franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a team in this league that doesn't want the
quarterback who can take you to a Super Bowl,'' Mora said, ``and
we've got one. Peyton is way beyond what I thought he could be this
year. I've never seen the guy flustered. Sure, he gets frustrated
when things don't go well or he doesn't perform the way he thinks
he should. But he's never let it affect his performance. His game
last week (at Baltimore) was something. Even in a loss, you
thought, 'Man, that was something for a rookie.' And then, 'Hey,
that was a great game for anybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond throwing for 357 yards and three touchdowns, Manning was
on top of the game mentally. For most of the Colts' 67 plays, he
called two options in the huddle and then, after getting a pre-snap
read on safeties and linebackers, checked to one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Joe Namath once noted that in his third or fourth
season with the Jets, he broke the huddle, came to the line of
scrimmage and immediately recognized every defensive scheme. ``It
was like someone suddenly lifted a curtain,'' Namath said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's game, Manning said, was like that for him. The
difference is, it was one of only a couple times this year that it
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Steve Young probably feel that way every week,'' he
said. ``Part of the thing with me was, I was playing too fast. It
might seem contradictory, but you almost have to slow yourself down
to be successful in this league. I'm getting there, but it's not
all the way yet. At the beginning of the season, I was probably
playing at maybe 100 mph. Now I might have it down to 75 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the speed, Manning is miles ahead of the NFL's usual
learning curve and the Colts will bear his imprint for years to
come. Like all three sons of Archie and Olivia, he is
characteristically unpretentious yet commanding. On those occasions
when he's had to light into a teammate, the deed has been carried
out in private. And there is no denying the respect of those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that was important to me was earning that
respect of my teammates,'' Manning said. ``And then second was
getting the respect of opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished the first, in part, by grabbing a locker stall
right in the middle of the offensive linemen. Asked last week about
that move, Manning admitted the ``I'm-one-of-the-guys'' symbolism
attached to it. On the field, even the skeptics among opponents now
have few doubts about his star potential.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan claimed last week that the
secondary would be ``licking our chops'' against Manning. The
Baltimore corners who felt that way last week were left with their
tongues hanging by game's end.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens cornerback Rod Woodson said, ``There (is) an elite bunch
of guys who have that something special to them. He's one of them.

 &HT;    Dierdorf may be headed out of Monday Night Football booth
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The rumor that Dan Dierdorf might be replaced soon in
the Monday Night Football booth could become fact. Mike Ornstein,
who represents Sterling Sharpe, has been negotiating for a deal
that would team the former Green Bay wideout with Boomer Esiason
and Al Michaels. ... Look for the Jets to sign Vinny Testaverde to
an extension before the end of the season. Agent Michael Azzarelli
met Friday with Bill Parcells and cap specialist Mike Tannenbaum,
and they're getting closer on the numbers. ... Agent Tank Black of
Columbia, S.C., has jumped out in the recruiting wars, landing
several prime prospects already. He has the inside edge on LSU
tailback Kevin Faulk and Florida linebacker Jevon Kearse. ...
Atlanta guard Calvin Collins probably will need elbow surgery after
the season. ... Oregon quarterback Akili Smith now looks like a
solid first-round prospect for the '99 draft. ... Some NFL teams
now are beginning to eye UCLA coach Bob Toledo. ... Several
Redskins officials fear that safety Jesse Campbell might not be
able to come back from surgery that left his knee mostly
bone-on-bone.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down
</P>
<P>
   Owners Ralph Wilson of Buffalo and Detroit's William Clay Ford
complained about calls that director of officiating Jerry Seeman
conceded were erroneous. For stating the obvious, that the
officials are worse than ever, they were fined $50,000 by Paul
Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Two-minute drill
</P>
<P>
   Subject: Dallas Cowboys tailback Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Topic: The NFL record for career rushing touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Background: Just one season after some observers insisted his
career was in decline, Smith has spent much of 1998 achieving new
milestones. Earlier this season he passed Tony Dorsett as the top
rusher in franchise history and moved past Jim Brown for the No. 5
spot in career rushing yards. He is on pace for his best season
since 1995, and his next rushing touchdown will give him 124 and
break Marcus Allen's league record.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of your 123 rushing scores, 79 have been between 1 and 4
yards. So would you prefer to break the record on a 1-yard blast or
a 50-yard romp?
</P>
<P>
   A: To do it in style, with a long run, would be nice. But that's
not really my style. Most of those touchdowns have been me running
through somebody. So if I score on a 1-yard run, where there's some
bodies scattered, that's OK with me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You save the game balls from your touchdowns. Can you
remember the first one, and what's the plan for all those
footballs?
</P>
<P>
   A: My first (touchdown) was on a 2-yard run against Washington
in 1990. I think it was about the third game of the year. I have
that ball and every other one. They're my rainy day insurance.
They're worth something if I decide to sell them. Maybe I'll keep
No. 124 and sell the rest to collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will be the significance of the record for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: To score this many times, to me, it means I was out there
every week. I played hurt. I ran hard. I knew where the end zone
was and did what it took to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Spotlight on...
</P>
<P>
   Veteran: In its last six games against Green Bay, all losses,
Tampa Bay has averaged 9 points and quarterback Trent Dilfer has a
microscopic passer rating of 44.9. The Bucs desperately need a
victory Monday night to retain flickering playoff hopes, and Dilfer
must get them some points.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie: Fourth-rounder Jason Fabini has started every game for
the Jets, and despite five false-start penalties the first five
games, has solidified the right tackle spot for coach Bill
Parcells. A good run blocker, he'll be tested by Seattle
speed-rushers Chad Brown and Michael Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent: Injuries to wide receivers Robert Brooks (hamstring)
and Antonio Freeman (jaw) could provide Bill Schroeder an even more
prominent role in the Green Bay offense. The former World League
player entered the year with two career catches but already has 30
grabs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: A year ago Carolina owner Jerry Richardson suggested
coach Dom Capers had a lifetime contract. But a 2-10 record and
Capers' public role in free-agent additions of expensive busts such
as defensive end Sean Gilbert and cornerback Doug Evans could
seriously weaken the coach's job security.

 &HT;    Wings keep their cool
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So much for foreshadowing.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Detroit Red Wings were a franchise in need of
two things _ a winning streak and an airplane. It was bad enough
that the two-time champions fell 6-2 in Calgary for their sixth
loss in eight games _ their worst skid since Scotty Bowman's first
month as coach in 1993. But the team's airplane was grounded when a
fuel truck collided with the fuselage, ripping open a hole that
forced the Wings to bus four hours to their next game in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Detroit was not on the brink of a collapse,
but a rejuvenation. A 6-2 win over the Oilers started a five-game
win steak in which the Wings outscored opponents 26-8. Included
were a seven-goal third period in Vancouver, four wins by rookie
goalie Norm (It's A) Maracle and a performance against San Jose
impressive enough that Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said, ``Until
somebody takes the Stanley Cup away from the Red Wings, there's
nobody close. They're the best team in the league by 10 miles. I
mean, is there any other team that can play four lines and have
their starting goalie out for a period of time and it doesn't
bother them at all?''
</P>
<P>
   What plagued the Wings during an 8-8 start is the type of
post-title malaise general manager Ken Holland expected. As strange
as it sounds, Holland believes they would have been more
susceptible to emotional problems last season if not for two
incidents that helped unify and motivate the team:
</P>
<P>
   _ A limo crash shortly after the 1996-97 Stanley Cup finals that
ended the career and nearly the life of defenseman Vladimir
Konstantinov.
</P>
<P>
   _ The near season-long holdout of Sergei Federov.
</P>
<P>
   With Bowman pondering retirement, Detroit started this season
4-1 with assistants Barry Smith and Dave Lewis running the team.
But when Bowman returned, the Wings won only four of their next 11.
</P>
<P>
   Did Bowman's return cause players to relax again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question. I don't know,'' Holland said. ``We talked in
training camp about potential problems we might have this year.
There had been such pressure for so many years here to deliver that
Cup, and when we finally won it, I thought there might be a letdown
last year. But the accident happened, Federov held out and
everybody pulled together. This year we went through what I thought
might happen last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the slump had to do with Scotty coming back or
it was just part of the process we expected. This team has played
so many big games ... the last three or four years. It's pretty
difficult for a coach to walk in and say it's a big game when it's
only November. It's not a big game. The flip side is, the team we
play every night, it's their big game. It's their benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does anybody in Hockeytown seem overly concerned that
Detroit has dropped both meetings with the Dallas Stars, who, with
the addition of Brett Hull, believe they can make it past the Wings
in the Western Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could've played better against them and we weren't as
emotional as I thought we should be,'' Lewis said. ``I don't want
to make excuses. ...But it's not like we have little X's (on the
calendar) on those days that we play them. Calgary beat us twice,
too. Toronto beat us twice. We can't just worry about Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wings, trying to become the sixth team to win three straight
Cups, had periods of domination during their five-game streak. In a
6-2 win at Edmonton, they scored three times in the first 16
minutes. Against Vancouver, they trailed 1-0 after two periods
before reeling off seven straight goals.
</P>
<P>
   Maracle, who has replaced injured Chris Osgood, said of the
team's mood after the second period against Vancouver, ``The guys
were just hanging out, talking. We're losing at the end of the
second period and they're not even worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too early for worries.

 &HT;    Bouncing a Czech
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last thing NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wanted
reported last week was the cash-poor Pittsburgh Penguins satisfying
their payroll with the $2.5million they received from the cash-rich
Rangers as part of the Petr Nedved trade. Bettman balked at
approving the trade to begin with and relented only because the
Rangers included a quality player in the deal, Alexei Kovalev. From
that point, the league's stance became, ``Well, it's the Penguins'
money, they can do what they want with it.'' But the perception was
a team sold one star player so it could pay the other ones.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has become enough of a PR problem for Bettman, what
with the bankruptcy status, feuding co-owners (Roger Marino and
Howard Baldwin) and the inability of Mario Lemieux to collect
several million dollars in deferred salary. And, yes, it could get
worse. The French company Societe Generale has agreed to lend the
Penguins $20 million, but a U.S. bankruptcy judge has yet to
approve the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Water boys
</P>
<P>
   In its aim to make a buck, the NHL may have cost the New York
Islanders a goal Wednesday in a 3-2 loss to the Rangers. Although
the league does not allow goalies to keep a water bottle on top of
the net during the playoffs, it mandates they have one during the
regular season because of a merchandising deal with the beverage
company whose logo is on the bottles. So guess what? With the Isles
trailing the Rangers 3-1, Joe Sacco appeared to tip in a shot
midway through the third period. Live and replay views seemed to
show Rangers goalie Mike Richter catching the puck over the plane
of the goal line and pulling it back out. But the goal light never
came on, and when a replay judge was consulted, he said the only
camera angle with an otherwise clear shot had a view that was
blocked by the water bottle. ``Do you think it was a goal? How many
views do you need?'' said Isles coach Mike Milbury. His team's
second goal didn't come until five seconds remained.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   Guess this trade worked out. In the first six games Keith Jones
played for Philadelphia after being acquired from Colorado, the
Flyers went 6-0 and outscored opponents 25-9. Jones is skating the
top line with Eric Lindros and John LeClair, and the three combined
for 17 goals during the streak. ... The Rangers have opened
contract extension talks with defenseman and captain Brian Leetch,
who would become an unrestricted free agents after the season. New
York is offering deals averaging $6 million per year, at least $1
million less than Leetch is seeking. His outlook: ``Hopefully it
will go smoothly. Chances are it won't but hopefully it will.'' ...
Hurricanes owner Peter Karmanos on the dreadful attendance (7,300
average) in the team's temporary home in Greensboro: ``I'm not
happy with the crowds in Greensboro. I'd be lying if I said I was.
But I'm not disappointed in the sense that I think we're in the
wrong market.'' The Hurricanes maintain their new arena in Raleigh
next season will solve their problems _ provided it's finished in
time.

 &HT;    Olympics, game overtime on NHL board's agenda
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   THE AGENDA
</P>
<P>
   The league will hold its twice-a-year Board of Governors
meetings Monday and Tuesday in Scottsdale, Ariz. Nothing will be
decided but almost everything will be discussed, most notably:
</P>
<P>
   _ The NHL's participation in the Olympics. If Nagano wasn't a
complete disaster, it surely wasn't a thrilling success. It has
been assumed the NHL will return in 2002 to the Salt Lake City
Games because they are in prime time in the United States, giving
the league more exposure on NBC than it had in Japan. But officials
maintain nothing is certain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ties and overtime. The increasing number of draws and the
relative ineffectiveness of overtime have owners concerned. Two
possible alternatives: (1) End games with a shootout, as most minor
leagues do; or (2) make a victory worth three points instead of
two, giving teams more incentive in the overtime to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bankrupt Penguins. Pittsburgh's financial report will draw
the most interest of all the franchises. Ownership made last week's
payroll with the $2.5 million it received from the New York Rangers
in the Petr Nedved trade. It's worth noting that commissioner Gary
Bettman, who detests cash-for-player trades, probably would have
killed the deal if the Rangers had not included forward Alexei
Kovalev in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   BETWEEN SHIFTS: JAROMIR JAGR
</P>
<P>
   _ Team: Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: Tied for the league scoring lead with 33 points in 22
games, but only fourth on team with seven goals.
</P>
<P>
   _ On his impact in his native Czech Republic: ``When I was
younger, we didn't hear anything about the NHL. It was illegal to
even talk about it because they thought a lot of guys would defect.
Now, all kids dream of playing in the NHL. People see games on
satellite TV and can read about the games in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the Penguins' success despite personnel losses: ``Kevin
(Constantine, head coach) has done an excellent job and we've had a
lot of underrated players come up from the farm. Everybody is
scoring goals. In Kevin's style, everybody works hard and everybody
gets chances.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On his lack of goals this year: ``I've never considered myself
a goal scorer. I think of myself as more of a passer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the Penguins' acquisition of Alexei Kovalev: ``He's
probably one of the five most talented guys I've ever seen. They
put too much pressure on him in New York. I think it's going to be
a lot easier for him here.''
</P>
<P>
   THRASHERS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   With it becoming increasingly unlikely that the Thrashers will
have a permanent practice facility in place for next season, don't
be surprised if general manager Don Waddell reverses his plan to
hold training camp in Atlanta and sets up in Orlando. The IHL's
Solar Bears and NBA's Magic share one of the top athletic
facilities in the country, and Waddell helped design the hockey
side of it when he was Orlando's general manager. ... Orlando also
remains the Thrashers' probable minor-league affiliate. Waddell has
met with four teams in the IHL and AHL, as well as the
commissioners of the two leagues, to help determine where to spot
the farm team. ... Previous commitments by the Detroit Red Wings
voided Waddell's plans to bring the Stanley Cup champions to
Atlanta for an exhibition next year. ... The team ran the first of
five hockey and skating clinics for the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs Saturday
at the World of Coke's outdoor ice rink. The next one will be
3:30-4:30 p.m. Monday with Olympic gold medalist speedskater Dan
Jansen as a guest instructor. Mostly, former Atlanta Flames are
running the clinics. Curt Bennett attended Saturday's and ex-goalie
Dan Bouchard, who runs a hockey program at Life College, will work
two of the next three Saturdays, 8:30-10 a.m.

 &HT;    No yucks for Canucks
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of two things is likely to happen in the next week
or so:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Vancouver Canucks trade Pavel Bure to Los Angeles or the
New York Rangers;
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach Mike Keenan runs over general manager Brian Burke with a
Winnebago.
</P>
<P>
   Both are used to doing things their own way, and their
relationship seemed destined for failure from the time Burke took
over as GM and inherited Keenan. Neither does it help that Keenan
reportedly has a clause in his contract that states he must approve
all personnel decisions. The contract was not amended when Burke
was hired. A major irritation could be removed if Burke finally
deals Bure, the talented forward who has been holding out all
season _ not for a new contract, just a new employer.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings and Rangers seemingly are the only two teams willing
to pay Bure's $8million salary and both are star-hungry _
particularly L.A., which is struggling on the ice and at the gate
and is moving into a new arena next season. Keenan has infuriated
Burke, saying the GM is dragging his feet on a deal, and pulled an
all-timer last week in Toronto when he yanked goalie Garth Snow on
a power play while trailing 3-1 early in the third period. The
Maple Leafs scored into an empty net to clinch the win. Afterward,
Keenan claimed he was desperate for offense and made a point of
saying he would not have pulled Snow for an extra forward if Bure
were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly safe assessment to make that we need help,''
Keenan said. ``It's time for us to evaluate our personnel in terms
of who can play under pressure and who can't. That's for Brian
Burke to evaluate.'' Burke's response: ``When you lose a couple of
games in a row, everybody's seat of their pants gets a little
tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Decaf Coffey
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to find a bigger bust this season than
Chicago's cameo defenseman, Paul Coffey. The Blackhawks acquired
Coffey and his $2.5million salary from Philadelphia, knowing, at
37, he was far from the perennial All-Star who played for Edmonton.
But they expected more than this. After 24 games, Coffey has played
in only four because of back and knee injuries. His totals: 0
goals, 1 assist, $731,707.32 in collected salary.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   L.A. also is talking to the New York Islanders about unsigned
forward Ziggy Palffy, who would cost about $3 million less than
Bure but doesn't have the marquee value. ... The slow start by the
Kings, who are scraping bottom in the league with a 2.2
goals-per-game average, has worn on coach Larry Robinson. He says
he ``won't be the fall guy'' if the team continues to lose, all but
mandating that GM Dave Taylor make changes. ``There's nobody going
to the front of the net,'' he said. ... St. Louis goalie Grant
Fuhr, who started the year 3-1-2 with a 2.03 goals-against average
until suffering a torn abductor muscle four weeks ago, says he is a
few days from returning.

Mo Lewis, a 6-foot-3-inch, 258-pound New York Jets linebacker,
usually goes to martial-arts classes three days a week from 6:30 to
7:30 a.m. Many of Lewis' moves on the field start from a coiled
position, a style that Lewis adapted from his martial arts
training. ``I start in a coiled position because it helps me react
and attack more quickly,'' he says. However, with the Jets (8-4)
entering the crucial point of the season with four games to go,
Lewis has put the martial arts on hold, conserving his energy. (Vic

ROLANDO ALPHONSO, 67, MAJOR FIGURE IN JAMAICAN MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOHN PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rolando Alphonso, the tenor saxophonist for the
Skatalites and a major figure in Jamaican music, died Nov. 20 at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 67 and lived in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain hemorrhage, said his daughter Michelle
Alphonso. A blood vessel burst while he was playing a solo with the
Skatalites at the Key Club in Hollywood the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, Alphonso's saxophone has been one of the most
dependably ebullient sounds in Jamaican music. He worked as a
studio musician during the evolution of Jamaican music from
American-style rhythm-and-blues to the insistent backbeat of ska to
the steadfast lope of rocksteady and reggae.
</P>
<P>
   He backed Jimmy Cliff, the Wailers, the Maytals and most of the
other leading Jamaican performers of the 1960s, and he toured the
world with the Skatalites, a group that could transform anything
from movie themes to jazz tunes into buoyant ska.
</P>
<P>
   Since ska appeared in Jamaica in the early 1960s, it has had
frequent revivals, including the recent one that placed bands like
No Doubt and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones on the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   At the All Boys Catholic School in Kingston, Jamaica, Alphonso
played drums and then trumpet in the band. His mother gave him his
first saxophone when he was 15. After playing in hotel bands, he
became a studio musician and appeared on his first recording in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for two of the most influential producers in Jamaica,
Duke Reid and Coxsone Dodd. The Duke Reid Band of session musicians
included Alphonso and most of the future Skatalites, while Dodd
worked with Alphonso as an arranger and a core member of the Blues
Blasters, who prolifically recorded American-style rhythm-and-blues
shuffles from 1958 to 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica gained independence from Britain in 1962, and as it did,
Jamaican musicians were creating a distinctively Jamaican version
of rhythm-and-blues, drawing on New Orleans rhythm-and-blues and
styles from around the Caribbean. The ska beat clearly emerged
around 1960 on songs by Derrick Morgan and the producer Prince
Buster, and Dodd and Reid were quick to adapt to the style.
Alphonso performed at Dodd's sessions that yielded the first hits
for the Wailers in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, the Skatalites officially became a group, led by Don
Drummond on trombone. The band also included Alphonso and Tommy
McCook on tenor saxophones, Lester Sterling on alto saxophone,
Johnny Moore on trumpet, Lloyd Knibbs on drums, Lloyd Brevett on
bass, Jackie Mittoo on piano and Jerome Hinds on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   They brought a jazz background to dance tunes, adding harmonic
surprises to their propulsive music. The Skatalites, often with
arrangements by Alphonso, recorded instrumentals, songs with
vocalists and sessions for half a dozen producers.
</P>
<P>
   The original Skatalites lasted barely 14 months. In 1965,
Drummond was convicted of murdering his girlfriend and was
committed to a mental hospital; he died in 1969. Although the
Skatalites played their farewell concert in August 1965, the band
left an indelible mark on Jamaican music.
</P>
<P>
   After the group disbanded, Alphonso led the Soul Vendors. He
also worked with the Soul Brothers, made albums under his name and
worked as a studio musician. In 1971, he suffered a stroke, and
during his recovery he was told by doctors that he had only five
years to live. But he continued to work in Jamaica's studios before
moving to the United States in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   When the British ska revival at the end of 1970s rekindled
interest in ska, the Skatalites regrouped, first for a 1983
performance at the annual Sunsplash festival in Jamaica and, since
the mid-1980s, as a working band based in New York. Two albums by
the band, ``Hip Bop Ska'' (Shanachie) and ``Greetings from
Skamania'' (Shanachie) were nominated for Grammy Awards in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter who lives in New York City, Alphonso
is survived by his wife, Hermine; his children, Dennis, of Ontario;
Rolando Jr., of Los Angeles; Pauline, of Seattle, and Barrinton and
Noel, of New York; 33 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    PRO-INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT SUFFERS ELECTION DEFEAT IN TAIWAN
 &HT;    Eds: Updates returns throughout.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ For weeks, Chinese leaders have fidgeted just
over the horizon as democratic Taiwan neared bellwether elections
that would test whether Taiwanese are aching for full independence
from the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, to the relief of Beijing and likely Washington as
well, millions of Taiwanese delivered a loud mandate for caution.
With a turnout of 70 to 80 perdent in most races, the voters
signaled in mayoral and parliamentary results that they don't want
to risk confronting China's threat to ``use force'' in case Taiwan
declares independence.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent advocate of an eventual ``Taiwan Republic,''
Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian, was beaten by a 51 to
46 percent in what had been viewed as a neck-and-neck bid for his
re-election as mayor of the capital city, Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a native-born Taiwanese with an earthy charisma, had been
expected to vault from this election to a strong run for the
presidency in 2000 on a pro-independence platform. Although
thousands of his tearful supporters greeted the defeated Chen with
chants of ``President, President,'' it appeared that he and other
pro-independence figures will have difficulty re-establishing
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this election had turned out in Mr. Chen's favor, it would
be another of those aggravating factors that would be perceived as
making the government in Beijing more nervous,'' said Ramon Myers
of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, one of several
American experts on Taiwan monitoring the election. He said both
Washington and Beijing would be relieved at the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was knocked out of his City Hall power base by Nationalist
Party challenger Ma Ying-jeou, a descendant of the mainland Chinese
elite that took control of the government when it was forced to
flee here after the 1949 communist takeover of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   With a boyish charm and a Harvard Law School pedigree, Ma
attracted voters who wanted peace and stability. To Beijing, Ma was
the lesser of two evils in the race, since he and his party stand
for Taiwan's eventual reunification with mainland China rather than
Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   As firecrackers popped all over downtown Taipei, thousands of Ma
supporters rejoiced outside his downtown headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Taiwan has a shadow in their minds,'' said Daniel
Chan, a 38-year-old schoolteacher. ``They are always afraid of
being attacked by mainland China. I think Mr. Ma can give us a more
stable situation. Tonight I can feel safer about my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's pro-independence Progressive Party also lost heavily in
races for parliamentary seats throughout Taiwan, although it seized
one stronghold by electing the mayor of Taiwan's second biggest
city.
</P>
<P>
   The big winner was the long-ruling Nationalist Party, which
roared back to reconsolidate its power following six years of
steady slippage attributed to the party's past reputation for
favoritism and corruption Nationalist gains came largely at the
expense of the small, reform-minded Chinese New Party that also
opposes Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   In legislative races throughout Taiwan, the Nationalists rolled
up 46 percent of popular votes to the Progressives' 30 percent,
guaranteeing the ruling party a commanding 55 percent share of
seats in Taiwan's next legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most avid observers of the Taiwan election were the
six mainland Chinese government advisers on Taiwan relations, who
have been here for 10 days conducting quiet meetings on the fringes
of the election campaign at the invitation of a Taiwanese
educational institute.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on the eve of the election as they toured a newspaper
aimed at Taiwanese children, Chinese delegation member Su Ge said
the group from Beijing is ``concerned'' about a clause in the
Progressive Party platform calling for an independent Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Su said, however, that Taiwan's commitment to holding democratic
elections would not ``cause a barrier to reunification'' if Taiwan
ultimately agrees to return to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Taiwan can continue their economic and political
structures unchanged, and mainland China can continue with its
structure and systems,'' said Su, a former diplomat who is
assistant president of Beijing's Foreign Affairs College. ``We
can't have one side lord it over the other side, or as we might
say, one side swallow the other side.''

ANNAN REBUFFED IN BID TO GET LIBYAN SUSPECTS IN L OCKERBIE CRASH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, failed
Saturday to persuade Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy to immediately
surrender two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight
103. But Annan said Khadafy assured him during a meeting at a
desert camp that he is ready to find a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats had held high expectations that a meeting would
produce a breakthrough. But UN officials said the unpredictable
Libyan ruler still may rebuff Annan's efforts to send the two
suspects in the terrorist bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which
killed 270 people, to the Netherlands to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks have been fruitful and positive. And Libya has
confirmed its seriousness and readiness to find a solution to the
Lockerbie problem,'' Annan said at a news conference in Tripoli
after meeting with the Libyan leader in his desert tent. But he
added that it ``will require some time'' to clinch a deal.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear what was holding up a final agreement. The
last major sticking point for Libya was a demand by Britain and the
United States that the two suspects be imprisoned in Scotland if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   UN diplomats were confident that a British offer to allow
outside observers to monitor their treatment and to provide Libya
with unlimited diplomatic access to the prisoners had satisfied the
Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   Khadafy has come under pressure from his allies in Africa and
the Middle East in recent months to accept an offer from the United
States and Britain to have the suspects tried in a neutral country.
US and British officials _ seeking to resolve the matter before the
10th anniversary of the bombing on Dec. 21 _ said Saturday that
Khadafy is running out of time.
</P>
<P>
   A White House foreign policy spokesman, David Leavy, warned that
Khadafy could face ``tough action'' _ most likely tighter sanctions
or an international oil embargo _ if he does not turn over the
Lockerbie suspects soon.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has been under a UN air and arms embargo since 1992 for
refusing to turn over to American or British authorities the two
Libyan citizens suspected of planting a bomb on Pan Am 103. Khadafy
said the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Amin Khalifa Fhima,
could not get a fair trial in the United States or Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the Organization of African Unity endorsed a Libyan
request for a trial in a neutral country. In August, the United
States and Britain agreed to a trial in the Netherlands under
Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called his bluff,'' Leavy said. ``If he doesn't turn them
over, he would alienate himself from the people in the region and
increase their understanding for tough action.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as Thursday, British and UN officials expressed
confidence that Annan was near agreement with Libya for the
arrests. But by Friday, the Libyan leadership cast doubt over a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Libyan-controlled news agency JANA said the
decision to surrender the suspects could not be made by Khadafy,
but by the Libyan parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khadafy has a history of stringing things along,'' Richard
Murphy, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who has taken the lead in negotiating the terms of the
surrender of the suspects, flew Saturday from Tunisia to the Libyan
town of Sirte, some 250 miles east of Tripoli, for a meeting with
Khadafy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was received by Libyan Foreign Minister Moar
Montasser. JANA said at the time that Annan would not be able to
meet Khadafy.
</P>
<P>
   But following the Sirte meeting, Annan and several top aides
were whisked to an undisclosed desert encampment to meet with
Khadafy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Observers suggested Khadafy, who decided to convene a
parliamentary meeting Tuesday to decide the fate of the suspects,
was seeking to drag out the crisis in order to exact greater
concessions from the West.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan insisted before traveling to the region that he was
not prepared to negotiate.

THERE'S A DARK SIDE AS CZARIST CAPITAL READIES FOR VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 PETERSBURG-ELECTIONS-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Long before she died in a volley of
automatic weapons fire outside her St. Petersburg home, Galina
Starovoitova predicted the violent crime wave that has shocked this
elegant 18th-century Baltic port.
</P>
<P>
   Starovoitova knew that her city, known in the West as the
``Venice of the North,'' both for its palace-lined canals and its
tradition as Russia's most progressive city, has a dark side as
well. Some of the bloodiest and most infamous turning points in
Russian history took place here: the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution; the
beginning of Stalin's Great Terror purges in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Back in March, when Starovoitova, a prominent lawmaker and
leader of Russia's democracy movement, sized up the campaign for
Sunday's vote to elect a city legislature, she saw another critical
showdown ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, she believed, was whether real democracy had a chance
of taking root anywhere in Russia, or whether this country was
doomed to be run by the powerful, unaccountable, and criminally
suspect political machines that have taken control of local
government throughout all nine time zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be shooting here,'' Starovoitova concluded,
and she was right. On Nov. 20, two armed assailants fired three
shots into her skull in the stairwell outside her apartment. The
assassination has not been explained, but it capped off a spate of
beatings, shootings and bombings, blatant vote-buying, threats and
thuggish shakedowns that have made this the dirtiest election
campaign Russia has seen.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the seemingly obscure local election has gripped
the nation, amid calls of concern that ``criminal elements'' are
making a play for political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we will have power that is dictated by certain people's
private interests, or we will have power that is under the control
of society,'' said Yury Kravtsov, former speaker of the St.
Petersburg city legislature and an ally of Starovoitova. ``We are
fighting the battle for democracy in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   People here are toying with a new nickname for their city:
Chicago on the Neva River. Chicago in the 1920s had Al Capone. The
city of Dostoyevsky, the Kirov Ballet, and the Hermitage Museum is
now the home of a reputed mobster named ``Kostya the Grave,'' the
head of the vicious ``Cemetery Mafia'' that controls the city's
burial service and reportedly has close ties to the city
administration. Thirteen people connected with the city burial
business have been murdered in recent weeks, the newspaper Novaya
Gazeta reported last month.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg has nightclub owner Sergei Shevchenko, a reputed
crime boss and candidate for one of the city legislature's 50
seats, who recently went on television and gleefully announced,
``Of course I'm backed by criminal money, I'm a bandit!''
</P>
<P>
   One Shevchenko tactic has been to bus elderly voters to special
polling stations where pensioners and shut-ins are allowed to vote
early. There, groups of tough-looking young men tell them how to
vote or else, then hand them 20 rubles (worth $1) after the ballots
are cast.
</P>
<P>
   Shevchenko is not alone, either in his stated profession or in
his choice of campaign strategies. On Thursday, Russian television
showed people lining up to cast votes for cash at three separate
early polling stations. Authorities say there is a candidate with a
criminal past or a shady present in each of the 50 districts.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg has another crime syndicate, the Tambov clan,
which controls import and export operations in the port. Some
observers here say the clan has penetrated local law enforcement
agencies, including the ``Big House,'' the local headquarters of
the Federal Security Service, the former KGB. This fact, they say,
renders meaningless the authorities' pledges to find the assailants
in Starovoitova's murder and dozens of other apparent contract
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement officers are not going to arrest themselves,''
one pro-democracy legislator said. Starovoitova's allies have
received anonymous calls warning them that they will be ``sent
after her'' if they don't ``quiet down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, I have to survive until Sunday,'' said
Leonid Romankov, another Starovoitova ally and an incumbent. In an
interview last week about Sunday's vote, he said, ``After that, win
or lose, they no longer have a reason to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes joining a city legislative council, where the maximum
monthly salary is $445, something to kill, or die, for? For one
thing, each member has access to a personal slush fund worth
$445,000 annually. Some legislators, like Romankov, are known to
use the money as it was intended: to repair schools, kindergartens,
and other public projects in their constituencies that would
otherwise never see funding.
</P>
<P>
   Others have blatantly used the money for their own aims, like
the legislator who paid for a trip for his constituents to a
Spanish hotel he owns, or the legislator who apparently paid a
local newspaper to run a flattering article about him.
</P>
<P>
   But the slush fund is chicken feed compared with the real prize,
proximity to local power, and with it, control over city spending,
city construction contracts, setting fees for city services. That
explains why prominent businessmen are willing to spend an average
of $150,000 on their campaigns to try to get in.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Russia, local legislatures serve as rubber stamps for
mayors and governors, who have amassed czar-like powers and are
accountable to no one. Critics say this system has helped make
Russia one of the most corrupt countries in the world, by
concentrating decisions on how to spend money in the hands of a few
executives. It has also made local elections a foregone conclusion
in most of Russia's 89 regions.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Petersburg is different. Built on an uninhabited swamp
by Peter the Great to be his ``window to Europe,'' the city has
often worked the other way, as the conduit of Western ideas into
Russia's traditionally byzantine and autocratic society.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between these two forces has fueled the legend of St.
Petersburg as a city of eternal conflict that has inspired many of
Russia's best writers.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, the city known then as Leningrad had the
strongest dissident movements.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday The previous head of St. Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, was
one of the stars of Russia's democratic movement when he came to
power in 1991. But he gradually became more autocratic and, his
enemies say, more crooked. After he was defeated in 1996 by his
former deputy, Vladimir Yakovlev, Sobchak fled to France to escape
a corruption investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the city legislature passed a charter that contained
checks and balances similar to the US Constitution. The charter won
praise among democracy forces, but raised the ire of Yakovlev, who
previously had enjoyed the right to rule pretty much by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those orders decreed sweetheart deals to city insiders,
according to Kravtsov and other Yakovlev opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev, who raised a furor here by missing Starovoitova's
funeral, is campaigning hard to have the charter revoked. He denies
allegation of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Strange things have happened to Yakovlev's opponents. Many of
them have found themselves running against a candidate with their
same last name, or in some cases, their exact full name.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, Oleg Sergeyev, has two opponents named ``Oleg
Sergeyev.''
</P>
<P>
   In a different district, Sergei Belyayev finally forced his
double, one Captain Sergei Belyayev of a local fishing fleet, to
withdraw his candidacy after admitting he had been paid $900 to
run. Candidate Belyayev's relief was shortlived: Soon after he was
charged with corruption in what he says is a political case to
neutralize him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not. It is hard to tell in murky St. Petersburg.

   PHILADELPHIA _ A waist-high railing gave way at Veterans Stadium
during the Army-Navy game Saturday, causing injuries to nine
spectators who fell about 15 feet to the artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the injuries was not known, although CBS-TV
reported that the most serious was a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed for 38 minutes during the fourth quarter
while four ambulance crews attended to four students from the
Military Academy and five from its prep school at Fort Monmouth,
N.J. The names of the injured students were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The fans, who were standing between Sections 271 and 272, were
cheering for CBS cameras after Army's Ty Amey had run 70 yards for
a touchdown that put the Cadets ahead by 31-30 with 7 minutes 33
second to go in the game. The students were not being shown on
television when the accident happened, but CBS later showed it on
videotape.

UMASS WINS FIRST POSTSEASON GAME IN 20 YEARS

<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Massachusetts hung on to defeat Lehigh, 27-21,
Saturday in a Division I-AA quarterfinal game. Lehigh quarterback
Phil Stambaugh, facing a fourth-and-15 at UMass' 16-yard line,
threw the ball out of the end zone to set off a rush of fans onto
the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen (10-3), making their first playoff appearance
since 1990, will play Northwestern State, a 31-20 winner over
Appalachian State, in a semifinal next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' smallest player, the 5-foot-7-inch, 151-pound
Adrian Zullo, dragged Caliphe Buchanan into the end zone to
complete a 37-yard scoring pass from Todd Bankhead, giving UMass a
20-14 lead heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Cherry, who earlier missed a 25-yard field-goal attempt,
was not called on when UMass faced a fourth-and-goal at the 1-yard
line on its next possession. Marcel Shipp squirted in for the
touchdown to put UMass up 27-14 with 11 minutes 17 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen were nearing their first playoff victory since
1978. In 1990, its last appearance, UMass lost to William &AMP; Mary,
38-0. Lehigh, making its first postseason appearance since 1980,
appeared headed for its first defeat in 14 games spanning back to
last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehigh fought back. Stambaugh rifled a 42-yard completion to
Deron Braswell to set up the Mountain Hawks at the UMass 34 with
8:30 left. Stambaugh burrowed in from the 1 to cap the 10-play,
81-yard drive, closing the gap to 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   After Lehigh's next drive stalled, it got the ball right back
when Kevin Quinlan's fumble on the punt return was recovered by
Bryant Appling at the Lehigh 45. A 40-yard connection between
Stambaugh and Rick Moore was called back because Moore was called
for pushing off. Lehigh only went backward from there and had to
punt.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts seized a 10-3 lead after a 30-yard touchdown pass
from Todd Bankhead to Jimmy Moore. Moore bobbled the ball with
defensive back Kevin Joseph approaching, but managed to hang on to
cap the 95-yard, 9-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts linebacker Kole Ayi knocked the ball from Deron
Braswell's hands on the next possession, and cornerback Mike Smith
recovered at the Lehigh 19 yard line. The Minutemen settled for
Jason Cherry's second field goal of the half, a 33-yarder, to
increase their cushion to 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, asserting its size advantage in the interior, was
building momentum. On the ensuing Lehigh possession, a blitzing Ayi
smothered Stambaugh for a 13-yard loss to force a punt.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen took a huge gamble on the next possession, and it
paid off in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   Bankhead surged a yard on a fourth-and-1 to the UMass 29,
keeping the Minutemen's next drive alive. But later, linebacker
James Young hit Bankhead as he threw, sending a wobbly pass into
the hands of Lehigh's Saundrell Davison at the Mountain Hawks' 48.
A few plays later, Lehigh tailback Ron Jean sprinted 41 yards
before Smith tackled him from behind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jean, who rushed for 82 yards on 12 carries in the first half,
finished off the drive with a 1-yard run, his second touchdown.
Lehigh tried to increase its 14-13 lead on Stambaugh's last-second
50-yard heave into the end zone, but it fell to the ground.

STARS MUTINY? THERE'S A HITCH TO THAT THEORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interesting week around here.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson said no. Rafael Palmeiro said yes. Then came a
firestorm of public opinion, pro and con, over Pudge-for-Rocket
trade speculation. Good stuff, with plenty of emotion attached.
</P>
<P>
   You know it's a hot and heavy baseball topic when everything
involving the Cowboys, including Nine-Toed Deion's availability, is
shoved off into a December sports-page corner.
</P>
<P>
   This is a reminder. The Cowboys do play today in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cowboys a mere afterthought all week, a friend called
Friday to say he was expecting a ``Jones fires Gailey'' media
conference, just because Jerry was miffed over not being this
week's headline act.
</P>
<P>
   But moving right along again, the most outrageous local sports
story of the week didn't involve the Rangers or the Cowboys.
Actually, this one ended up being buried, but it's worth digging
up.
</P>
<P>
   A Phoenix newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said last week that
big trouble was right around the corner for the Stars, considered
by some to be the NHL's best team.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Arizona Republic'', one Stars player wanted
to take a swing at coach Ken Hitchcock during a recent game, and
other Stars players had privately complained to general manager Bob
Gainey that Hitchcock was being outcoached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to blow up pretty soon down there if they aren't
careful,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, a similar report appeared in a Detroit newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In total contrast, we live in one of the most competitive media
markets in the country, and the Stars, being of world championship
caliber, are closely watched by two newspapers, and a multitude of
TV and radio stations. There hasn't been even a hint of this in the
local media.
</P>
<P>
   It's best never to say never, but the opinion from here says
total fabrication is involved. Has a player ever wanted to take a
swing at the very demanding Hitchcock? Probably more than once and
more than one player. But a locker room mutiny brewing? There is
absolutely nothing to support that.
</P>
<P>
   The official stance of Hitchcock and Gainey is ignore such
foolishness. But it's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Heika has covered the Stars for this paper since day one.
In all that time, he had never heard Gainey even raise his voice.
Then last week, Heika raised the issue of the Phoenix report.
Gainey was suddenly yelling in anger at him over ``irresponsible
journalism.'' And Heika had written nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also was as angry as I've ever heard him last week,
but most of his comments were unprintable for a family publication.
</P>
<P>
   Finally cooling off, he noted, ``while there's no truth in any
of it, there are a couple of good lessons that all of us can take
from this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good teams have to deal with these kind of things.
Somebody out there will always try to create a disruption. Like in
any family, disagreements will happen. But you have to keep them in
your own room, because someone on the opposition will try to bring
you down.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Stars players, even the top names, who have
disagreements with Hitchcock. One complaint is that Hitchcock wants
perfection every game, but that's untrue. He demands perfection
every shift. Any slack off, and Hitchcock is sure to yell.
</P>
<P>
   For a fan paying the high tariff for Reunion hockey seats,
Hitchcock is their dream coach. He wants the paying customer to
always receive his money's worth in effort on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   But when a player thinks he has a beef with Hitchcock, if he
tells it to a player on an opposing team, word can get around
quick. And the media in another city can end up with ``mutiny
conditions existing in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the same player who was mad a week ago can be Hitchcock's
most vocal supporter a week later. So it goes in any locker room in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may think you have a friend on another team, but during
the season he has to be considered the enemy,'' Hitchcock said.
``And that includes a coach on another team who is a friend of
mine. Everyone is looking for an edge against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a perfectionist, Hitchcock also loves to tinker
with his line combinations. Joe Nieuwendyk, for example, never
seems to know who his linemates will be from one game to the next.
There is locker room grumbling over this, although not from
Nieuwendyk. Again, however, it's part of the business of coaching,
and it happens everywhere. But the Stars are so good, things become
magnified, particularly if the opposition picks up on the
displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   Let me add a personal note. Hitchcock drives me crazy by
constantly making Brent Severyn a healthy scratch. See there, I've
got a complaint, too.
</P>
<P>
   But a brewing mutiny in Dallas? The first guy who said don't
believe everything you read in the newspaper had a good point.

ANNAN FAILS TO PERSUADE GADHAFI ON LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to report Annan and Gadhafi meeting)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, gambled on an unusual
trip to Libya Saturday but apparently failed to persuade Col.
Moammar Gadhafi to turn over two suspects wanted in the bombing of
a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   After keeping Annan waiting nearly all day at the Libyan coastal
town of Sirte, Gadhafi later met briefly with the
secretary-general, who said afterward that the talks at an
undisclosed location were ``fruitful and positive,'' but indicated
that obstacles remained in the path to a trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to find a
solution to the Lockerbie problem,'' Annan said at a news
conference in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. ``Libya has also agreed
to a trial in a third country and believes that it ought to be
possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues related to
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But a trial in a third country, specifically the Netherlands,
was not the outstanding issue Annan went to Libya to discuss. That
compromise had been agreed to with the United States and Britain in
August after the Libyans balked at a trial in either country.
</P>
<P>
   The problems that have arisen since come from Libyan demands
that the two suspects, if convicted, not be imprisoned in Scotland.
Libya also wants more assurances that U.N. sanctions, imposed for
its failure to hand over the two suspects, will indeed be lifted
when it turns the men over.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, whom aides describe as a born conciliator, flew to Sirte
at some political risk, saying he wanted to try to break the
decade-long deadlock in the case by getting Gadhafi's agreement to
stop delaying the transfer of the two suspects to the Netherlands
for a trial by Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
   When Annan arrived at Sirte, he was left talking with Libya's
foreign minister, Omar al-Montasser, and Libya's representative to
the United Nations, Abu Zeid Omar Dorda, as well as the visiting
president of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore.
</P>
<P>
   Annan detoured from a trip between Tunisia and a meeting of
Persian Gulf leaders in Abu Dhabi to go to Libya, despite the
skepticism of diplomats and U.N. officials, and he could have met
either lower-level Libyan official at his office in New York. His
trip to Libya was premised on talks with Gadhafi, although there
was no assurance in advance that the Libyan leader would show up.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in his first two years as
secretary-general that Annan has taken political risks to try to
reach a compromise with a dictatorial leader.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed two years ago to reconstitute an investigation team
looking into allegations of massacres in Congo when the new
president, Laurent Kabila, whose troops were accused of the
killings, refused to work with the group set up by the U.N. Human
Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, he went to Baghdad to persuade
President Saddam Hussein to resume cooperation with arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases his agreements were not honored.
</P>
<P>
   There were no details immediately available on his talks with
Gadhafi, whom he appears to have met in a lavish desert tent, which
a television crew was permitted to film. Expectations for the
meeting were never very high, but the United Nations had a plane on
standby in Italy in case the two suspects were released.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that this could happen, since Libya's
Parliament has been summoned into a rare session on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over the town of Lockerbie on
Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people, including 11 on the ground. An
investigation by British and American law enforcement and
intelligence agencies concluded that two Libyan agents had planted
an explosive disguised as a radio-cassette player planted on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans are also accused of plotting the explosion that
destroyed a French jetliner over Niger in 1989, killing 171 people.
That case is also unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi is eager to see the end of sanctions, imposed on Libya
in 1992 and toughened in 1993. These sanctions have barred
international air travel to and from Libya as well as the sale of
arms and spare parts for aviation and for the oil industry on which
the Libyan economy depends. Libyan assets have been frozen abroad
and diplomatic representation has been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had to apply to the Security Council's Libyan sanctions
committee on Thursday for permission to fly to Libya from the
Tunisian resort island of Djerba.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
David C. Leavy, said: ``We are disappointed that Libya is still not
in compliance. ... this has been going on for far too long.''
</P>
<P>
   An American diplomat who has been working on the Libya issue in
the Security Council said Thursday that the Clinton administration
saw Annan's trip as a way to ``advance the handover of the
suspects,'' and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect his travel to Libya to achieve that end,''
said Nancy Soderberg, the acting deputy representative at the
United Nations. Several diplomats said that Annan had gone to Libya
with no room for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and Britain have gone the extra mile,'' Ms.
Soderberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Annan's trip, which he planned in close consultation with
British and American officials, Libya had been sending mixed
signals about its intentions, as Colonel Qaddafi tried to set
conditions on the release of suspects to protect his intelligence
network and his political position, Arab diplomats said. One of the
suspects belongs to a clan in Libya that is, at best, lukewarm in
its support of the government.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jana, the Libyan news agency, Gadhafi, who has
ruled Libya since a 1969 coup, did not have the power to turn over
the two men, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah. The
agency said the Libyan people, through 500 ``popular committees,''
would have to decide the fate of the two, who were indicted by
Britain and the United States in 1991. The move seemed to imply
that Gadhafi wanted political cover.
</P>
<P>
   Calling a Tuesday meeting of the General People's Congress,
Libya's top legislative and executive body, could provide that. The
body usually endorses major policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Libyan government had been saying for some time
that it objected to the prospect that the suspects, if convicted,
would have to serve jail sentences in Scotland. British officials
said this week that they had assured the Libyans that they could
send diplomats to Scotland to monitor the prison conditions and
that all Islamic strictures would be followed.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects are now under loose government supervision in
Libya, still being paid by the national airline, Libyan Arab
Airways, but unable to travel abroad since their passports were
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said here this week that Libya was also
concerned that the United States will not agree to a lifting of
sanctions if the two men are sent to the Netherlands for trial, but
will instead move the finish line to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   These diplomats seemed to confirm Libyan suspicions by saying
that the sanctions would be suspended when the suspects were in
custody, but that a final lifting of the embargo would not take
place until Libya had met other goals, like ending support for
terrorism. American allegations that Libya has been behind attacks
on Americans led to bombing raids on Libya in 1986. Some Arab
diplomats say the attack on Pan Am 103, if Libyans were
responsible, was probably retaliation for the American bombing.

TOP-RANKED CONNECTICUT BEATS MICHIGAN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.) (rl) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ The big question coming into Saturday's game
between top-ranked Connecticut and eighth-ranked Michigan State was
whether this would be a day of rebirth for Mateen Cleaves, last
year's Big Ten Player of the Year, or Khalid El-Amin, last season's
pre-eminent freshman in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   Both point guards had abysmal outings in last week's Great Eight
Basketball Classic in Chicago and vowed to improve their games in
Saturday's matchup before a capacity crowd of 10,027 at Gampel
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   It was El-Amin who made good on his potential. Connecting on
seven of 10 shots from the field, including four of seven from
3-point range, and dishing off six assists, he led all scorers with
20 points as Connecticut won its fifth consecutive game, defeating
Michigan State, 82-68.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin improved over his performance against Washington last
Tuesday, when he committed five turnovers and had no assists in his
team's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, on the other hand, endured another dismal performance.
He managed only two of 15 field goal attempts, including one of
seven 3-pointers, to finish with 6 points. That performance
followed Cleaves' three-of-17 game against second-ranked Duke on
Wednesday in the Chicago tournament, and left him 10 of 49 (20.4
percent) in his last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, a junior guard, trailed only Richard Hamilton of
Connecticut in the voting for The Associated Press' preseason team.
Cleaves' subpar outing Saturday was largely attributable to a
superb defensive job by Ricky Moore, a senior guard who is UConn's
best defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Moore did a great job on Mateen,'' Michigan State Coach
Tom Isso said. ``He got very frustrated in the second half because
of Moore's defensive play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Calhoun, the Connecticut coach, agreed that Moore's defense
was a key to his team's victory. ``I don't know why people don't
see that Ricky is one of the best defensive players,'' said
Calhoun, whose team shot 63.6 percent in the second half while
leading by as many as 17 points. ``He did a great job on Mateen.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring the first basket of the game on a layup by Kevin
Freeman, Connecticut went cold, missing five straight shots while
Michigan State could not miss. Connecting on their first five
shots, four from inside, the Spartans ran off 11 consecutive points
to take an 11-2 lead. But then it was the Huskies' turn to surge,
going on a 12-2 run to grab a 14-13 lead on El-Amin's first 3-point
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was a seesaw affair, with nine lead changes and three
ties in the first half. Connecticut scored 8 of the last 10 points
in the half, 5 of them by El-Amin, as the Huskies took a 38-24 lead
at the intermission. They never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Even though Saturday's game was a home game for Connecticut, the
Huskies spent Friday night on the road. For the last several years
the UConn squad has spent the nights before home games at a hotel
in Farmington, 30 miles away, before returning to the Storrs campus
the following morning. Coach Jim Calhoun said the routine was
intended to keep the players together and away from distractions on
campus. Calhoun, after watching film with the team at the hotel,
drives home while the team stays behind with an assistant coach
and, usually, an academic counselor. ... Four of the five Michigan
State starters are from Michigan, and three _ Mateen Cleaves,
Antonio Smith and Charlie Bell _ are from Flint, where Cleaves and
Bell were high school teammates. ... Connecticut's next game is
against Massachusetts on Wednesday night in Amherst, Mass.,
followed by its Big East opener against Pittsburgh Dec. 12.

TCU'S FOWLER STEPS UP, FOIL UTEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A gimmick defense seemed like as good of a
plan as any for UT-El Paso to stop All-American Lee Nailon, thereby
stopping TCU.
</P>
<P>
   So UTEP dropped another player back to help on Nailon,
challenging TCU's guards, and Prince Fowler in particular, to beat
them.
</P>
<P>
   The guards, and Fowler in particular, answered that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a dizzying display of second-half 3-pointers, TCU
defeated UTEP, 86-79, yesterday afternoon at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was a real key in the game,'' Horned Frogs
coach Billy Tubbs said. ``We started stepping up and knocking down
threes because they were kind of challenging us to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince Fowler really got hot at the right time; he stepped up
and made some big threes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler nailed three 3-pointers in a two-minute span early in the
second half, helping to erase a UTEP lead that had grown as big as
nine points.
</P>
<P>
   TCU was 7-for-10 on 3-pointers in the second half, as Vladimir
Jaksic also chipped in three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real hard to handle the big guy around the basket,''
Miners coach Don Haskins said of Nailon. ``So we got in a gimmick
defense. It doesn't sound like it when you give as many points as
we did, but they were at least out on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miners ran a triangle-and-two, a defense where the point
guard drops down to help guard the post players.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler was the player without a defender for most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history seemed to indicate that Fowler was a good player
to challenge. He had gone 2-for-15, including 1-for-11 on
3-pointers, in TCU's first game against UTEP, a 75-70 victory on
Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   He got off to an equally shaky start yesterday, 0-for-4 from the
floor in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, I didn't feel comfortable. I was rushing my
shot,'' Fowler said. ``I kind of relaxed myself coming into the
second half, and I just stepped up and shots fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler finished with 17 points and eight assists, and Nailon
finished with a game-high 24 points. He left the game with 17:03
remaining after rolling his right ankle, but returned less than
three minutes later. He is expected to be ready for TCU's game
against Texas Tech on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs had five players in double figures, dominated
the offensive glass, but still found themselves trailing for long
stretches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange game,'' Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   There was the 30-second span in the first half where TCU had
four fouls called against them. There was the fact UTEP shot 59
percent from the field, and didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   There was the fact that this was the second meeting between the
two Western Athletic Conference teams this season, but neither one
counts in the conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Fowler, the guy whom the Miners were so
unconcerned with that they didn't bother to cover him, knocking
down the shots that ended up winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised,'' UTEP's Jarvis Mullahon said. ``The first
time their post players did all the scoring. We didn't known the
other guys could score as well as they can.''

FAILURE OF JOHNSON'S ASSISTANTS A MAJOR MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oklahoma's dismissal of John Blake is yet another example of a
rising coach being touched by Jimmy Johnson's magic wand _ and then
watching as his career turns into a pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Shula (career record: 19-52). Dave Wannstedt (39-53). Butch
Davis (30-15). Norv Turner (29-46-1). John Blake (12-22).
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody notice a trend here?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a belief,'' Johnson says now, ``that they'll get the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But the stories of how each of Johnson's aides became
head coaches might be instructive in deciding why, as a whole,
they've been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wannstedt, rightly celebrated as a defensive mind,
downplays Johnson's involvement in the orchestration of his January
'93 move to Chicago. But a story he told then lends insight.

<P>
   Before the first playoff game of the 1992 season against
Philadelphia, both the Giants and Bears were elbowing their way
toward interviews with Wannstedt. But their interest was not public
knowledge. Until. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I'm in my office, watching Eagles film, and the phone
starts ringing off the hook,'' Wannstedt said. ``Everybody knew
everything. I couldn't figure it out. But what had happened was,
Jimmy had just stood up in a press conference and announced that
teams would have permission to interview me immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   And the problem with that, Dave?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, only thing was,'' Wannstedt said, ``is he forget to tell
me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1988, Don Shula's son, Dave, asked Johnson for
some career advice. Johnson told him it would be wise to leave his
father's Dolphins staff.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Johnson was the Cowboys coach. Hurried to
build a staff, he called Don to ask for permission to hire away
Wannstedt, who had departed Johnson's University of Miami staff for
a Dolphins job just a few weeks earlier. By the end of the
conversation, Johnson had hired both Daves.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of conflict, Dave Shula was issued a demotion
that would lead to his quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Shula's career took a crazy but temporary upturn a year later.
Shula was the Bengals receivers coach when head coach Sam Wyche was
fired. Shula met with Bengals general manager Mike Brown to inform
the boss of his vacation plans and desire to remain on the staff in
some capacity. But oddly, five hours later, Brown offered Wyche's
top job to Shula.
</P>
<P>
   Norv Turner's career path is a classic example of the role luck
plays. Shula got two years in Dallas and was out. Then Johnson
offered the job to old friend Gary Stevens, who accepted _ but then
relented to pressure from a miffed Don Shula and stayed with the
Dolphins. Then came calls to assistants Ted Tollner of the Chargers
and Joe Pendry of the Chiefs, both old Wannstedt pals. But their
clubs wouldn't free them. Then came an interview with Vikings aide
Bob Schnelker, which did not go well.
</P>
<P>
   And then came recommendations for a guy named Norval Turner, a
38-year-old Rams receivers coach. How well did the Cowboys know
him? After agreeing to interview him, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones
dispatched a staffer to the PR department to locate a Rams media
guide to confirm that the fella's name was really ``Norval.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch Davis was elevated to defensive coordinator after
Wannstedt's departure. Like Wannstedt, he was strong-minded in his
occasional bucking of the Johnson system _ which probably earned
him the mentor's respect. Along with staffer Joe Avezzano, Davis
got a courtesy interview for the head coaching job when Johnson
left. And he was under consideration for the Oakland Raiders' top
job. But instead, after the 1994 season, he moved to Miami to
become the Hurricanes' head coach. His allegiance to the Hurricanes
caused him to accept a football team left in shambles after the
renegade times of Johnson and successor Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is now considered a semi-success in some circles for doing
things ``the right way.'' And this year's Hurricanes are 8-3 with
the big upset of UCLA yesterday. Nevertheless, Davis' career record
is not what was once expected of a Jimmy protege.
</P>
<P>
   An aide who never won Johnson's respect, John Blake spent the
'93 season on the staff. Blake, a former Oklahoma standout, was
rescued for a time when, coincidentally, his surrogate father,
Barry Switzer, replaced Johnson in '94. Switzer relied on Blake as
a right-hand man until '96, when Blake's involvement in a Valley
Ranch racial conflict contributed to Switzer's guiding him to the
Oklahoma job.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Johnson Super Bowl Era assistants who used
that success as a career springboard is shockingly limited. Which
begs the question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Were they wildly successful as Cowboys assistants because of the
great leadership of Johnson? Were they outstanding cogs in a
machine who got exposed when put in charge of the machine? Did
Johnson's influence make them? Or did it ruin them?
</P>
<P>
   Not even Jimmy Johnson himself has the answer to that one.
NFC BUZZ There are rumors Green Bay GM Ron Wolf, thinking ahead to
when coach Mike Holmgren departs after this year, might go outside
the organization for his next coach, with Philly's Ray Rhodes on
the short list. Hiring Rhodes might be the only way the Packers
deflect criticism for not promoting Sherm Lewis. Wolf's reported
reasoning _ that hiring from within a Super Bowl-winning team
rarely results in a return to the Super Bowl _ seems lame. But at
least those who've long believed Lewis gets passed over because
he's black would be quieted by the candidacy of Rhodes. ... The
Bears are 7-21 in their past 28 games. That's the worst stretch in
Chicago since posting the same record during a 28-game stretch in
1973-74. ... Chargers at Washington: Redskins QB Trent Green has
thrown for 606 yards, seven TDs and one interception in his past
two games, and in Washington's past five games the 'Skins are
averging 29.4 points per. ... The Saints think they've done all the
right things in laying the groundwork for QB Kerry Collins to
re-sign in New Orleans. ``We've been understanding and
compassionate,'' says coach Mike Ditka, who rescued the troubled
Collins after he was dumped by Carolina. ``But if they feel there's
a better place in the NFL, I'm sure they'll take him there.'' And
then, a word of caution from Ditka: ``Go forward. Don't go
backward.'' ... No, the Packers still aren't believers in the
Vikings, despite having been blown out twice by Minnesota this
year. ``I'm not going to say they've overtaken us,'' says tight end
Mark Chmura. ``We're not folding our tents.'' ... The Vikings have
been ordered to turn down the volume on Metrodome speakers
stationed on the visitors' sideline _ speakers that resonate with
crowd noise and are aimed directly at the visitors' bench. ...
Detroit's Barry Sanders is one TD away from becoming the sixth
player in NFL history with 100. ... Minnesota cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock never had an interception in four years at North Carolina
and had just four in three seasons with the Patriots. The Vikings
acquired him for a third-round pick, and now Hitchcock has five
interceptions this year, including two returned for TDs. ... The
Cowboys are worth $413 million, according to ``Forbes'' magazine,
which makes the Cowboys' franchise the most valuable in sports. But
two points: 1) If Jerry Jones was to ever sell, $413 million would
be but a fraction of the eventual purchase price; and 2) suggesting
that a present value of $413 million means Jones got a steal in
1989 when he bought the club for $147 million is ignorant. Jones
himself is the driving force behind the increased value of the
club.
AFC BUZZ The Broncos have two unlikely stars in receiver Ed
McCaffrey and center Tom Nalen, both maybe Pro Bowl-bound _ and
both in Denver because of a rather lopsided transaction. In 1994,
the Giants traded a seventh-round pick for a Broncos receiver named
Arthur Marshall. Marshall is no longer in the NFL, but the player
taken with that Round 7 pick is. He's Nalen. And the player cut
that summer to make room on the Giants roster for Marshall is. He's
McCaffrey. ... This is when the traditionally awful Bengals usually
turn it up: Maybe it's contract runs, but Cincy has won seven of
its past eight December games. ... Look for Jon Kitna to be the
Seattle starting QB for the rest of the season, with Warren Moon as
No. 2. ... Rookie QB Peyton Manning is on pace to throw for 3,000
yards and become the first Colt to do it since Bert Jones in 1976.
... The Chargers haven't allowed a 100-yard rusher all year, and
remember, they've faced Denver and Terrell Davis twice. ... Today's
hottest name in future NFL head coaches? Pittsburgh defensive
coordinator Jim Haslett. ... Chiefs at Broncos: A rematch of the
facemask-pulling, knee-tackling,
embarrassment-to-the-citizens-of-Kansas City game of three weeks
ago. Chiefs officials are adamant in promising there will be no
cheap-shotting this week. But Kansas City QB Rich Gannon is more
realistic. ``I'm sure everyone will have their eyes wide open,''
Gannon says. ``And they should.'' ... CBS studio host Marcus Allen
swears he has no idea where cohort George Seifert will land next
year as a coach. ``It's a weekly series of George spottings,'' says
Allen of various rumors. Meanwhile, San Diego's June Jones can see
the Seifert-related handwriting on the wall. Jones replaced Kevin
Gilbride when the Chargers were 2-4. San Diego is since a more
respectable 3-3. ``I know at the end of the year they're going to
see what's available and who's out there,'' says Jones, aware that
Mike Holmgren and Seifert figure to top many teams' wish lists.
Jones apparently feels comfortable, however, with the Chargers'
organization. ``There's a possibility,'' he says, ``they might hire
somebody else and I still might stay.'' ... So who portrays Buffalo
QB Doug Flutie when the made-for-TV movie comes out? Three
candidates: Donny Osmond; Rick Springfield; Michael J. Fox.
``Definitely Michael J. Fox,'' says Dallas center Mike Kiselak,
Flutie's teammate in the CFL. ``That's what we all called him up
there.''

WILSON'S WORDS LOUDER THAN ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If you're old enough in America, you can say anything
you want, unless you own a team in the No Fun League. If you do,
you're probably rich enough to say anything you want but you'll pay
a high price for it, as 80-year-old Ralph Wilson learned.
</P>
<P>
   It was interesting to read Wilson's three-day whinings over how
badly he and his team were treated last week by the NFL and its
officials in a last-second loss to the Patriots since Wilson has
long been an obstructionist to the one thing that might have helped
his team avoid the whole mess. Conveniently, that seemed to slip
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson complained bitterly that a plethora of television replays
clearly showed Shawn Jefferson out of bounds on a fourth-down catch
that kept the winning New England drive alive with a minute to
play, forgetting that seven times he has voted against instant
replay, including four times since 1990, all tight votes in which
Wilson's support might well have carried the day because he is so
well respected among his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Then his team gets burned by a crew of officials who admittedly
could choose ``Three Blind Mice'' for theme music, and he's singing
the blues louder than Ruth Brown.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilson was slapped with a $50,000 fine by NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue for his comments, Wilson went on the offensive,
issuing a statement that read in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Society today is more enlightened. Fair comment and criticism
are rampant. The entire media as a unit is frank and the millions
watching a game are frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Commissioner, lecturing me as if I were a novice
instead of one who has been involved in football infinitely longer
than he has, contends that criticizing a call has `destructive and
corrosive effects on the game.' What is more destructive and
corrosive _ errant calls in front of millions of viewers or my
statements of opinion?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, to be frank, Ralph, your concern over the NFL's violation
of free speech is well taken, but where have you been? How come
you've never spoken out on the subject before, such as when some
poor sap like Bryan Cox is getting slapped with a fine for
criticizing the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   How come you never made a case for free speech when some coach
who won't make in a lifetime what you've made in a week in some of
your business ventures gets crushed by the Commissioner's Office?
How come, for example, you were silent a few years back when
Steelers coach Bill Cowher was fined for chasing down an official
and stuffing a picture of a formation in his pocket as a protest?
</P>
<P>
   It was, frankly, impressive to see Wilson finally stand up and
take a slap at what he knows has been going on for years in the
NFL, but how come it never happened until his own ox was being
gored? How come he never spoke up for Sam Wyche or Jimmy Johnson or
the hundreds of players who have been fined for speaking their
mind?
</P>
<P>
   Wilson went on to say, ``Something has to be done to make this
different in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Ralph, a lot of people have been trying to get something
done to make things different in the future. It's called instant
replay, and in case you've forgotten, you voted against it in 1985,
1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1997. Conversely, the Patriots
have voted for it eight of the nine times it has been proposed.
</P>
<P>
   If Wilson really wants to make a difference, he can stop
complaining about something he helped make possible and come into
the 21st Century when the next instant replay vote comes up _ which
may not be until the 21st Century does.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, there is more talk about controlling one's
destiny around the NFL than there is around an Ouija board.
</P>
<P>
   Every coach would love to be in the position of  &UR; Bill
Parcells &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who needs only to have his team win its remaining three
games from AFC East rivals Buffalo, Miami, and New England to lock
up the Jets' first division title since the divisional format began
in 1970. For the moment, the Jets need no help to return to the
playoffs for the first time since 1991, yet few teams have a more
difficult road than they, because they are in a division where four
teams are within a game of first place and every one of them seems
capable of changing the others' destiny at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Dolphins are tied at the top at 8-4 while the
defending champion Patriots and surprising Bills lurk only one game
off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots appear to be getting healthy at just the right time
to make a stretch run, but the odds are stacked deeply against them
because they must play three of their final four games on the road
_ in Pittsburgh Sunday, in St. Louis next week, and then a classic
season-ending matchup with their old coach and running back,
Parcells and  &UR; Curtis Martin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Worse news is that despite a hot quarterback and reinforcements
arriving weekly, the Patriots have no apparent running game and
have struggled to stop the pass the last five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those pass-rush problems could be solved by the imminent
return of  &UR; Willie McGinest &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but it is unlikely that they can win
four times in winter winds if they continue to pass 45 times a
game.
</P>
<P>
   And while injuries have decimated the defense and the receiving
corps, the problems with the running game have had nothing to do
with injuries and seem fixed in stone (just like running back
 &UR; Robert Edwards's  &LR; feet).
</P>
<P>
   In the first six games of the season, Edwards rushed for 483
yards and six touchdowns, averaging 80 yards a game and 4.4 yards a
carry. But in the last six he has rushed for only 222 yards and one
touchdown, averaging 37 yards a game and 2.4 yards a carry. Worse,
he has looked tentative, perhaps tiring of getting slammed in the
backfield two or three times a game and never knowing when it might
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   While  &UR; Drew Bledsoe  &LR; is third in the NFL in pass attempts with
412, New England is 29th in the league in rushing, averaging a
dismal 78.8 yards a game. Only the lowly Carolina Panthers have
been more inept, which brings us to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Martin was defecting to New York last March,
there was much talk in Foxborough of how a computer study revealed
that running back was the easiest position to fill. It was said
that while Martin may not be easy to replace, his production would
be, even if done by committee.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as of this morning, Martin has rushed for 1,039 yards _
334 yards more than Edwards. And you don't want to say the only
valid comparison is with Martin's rookie year, because he rushed
for 1,487 yards and 14 touchdowns that season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Patriots have enough of a running game to get to the
playoffs is debatable, but clearly the Jets do. New York also has
the best divisional record (4-1) at the moment, but it must go on
the road three straight Sundays _ at Seattle, at Miami, and at
Buffalo _ and it is only 3-3 away from the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The upside for the Jets is that they are playing their best
football of the season, and despite a franchise habit of
floundering late (6-27 this decade in December-January
regular-season games), New York is coached by a guy whose trademark
is winning with the season on the line.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason Parcells's teams are a collective 41-24 in
December and January since he became a head coach in 1983: He knows
how to prepare teams for a run to the finish line if they have any
legs under them.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, his Jets did not, which is why they went 1-3 and
blew a playoff spot after sitting at the same 8-4 mark they are
Sunday. It is also why running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell  &LR; and
quarterback  &UR; Neil O'Donnell  &LR; are gone, replaced by an apparently
injury-free Martin and  &UR; Vinny Testaverde &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde would be the comeback story of the season, were it
not for  &UR; Randall Cunningham &LR; . All but finished after losing his job
in Baltimore, Testaverde has emerged as what Parcells hopes is the
reincarnation of  &UR; Jim Plunkett &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots should already have been eliminated but they came
from behind to beat the Dolphins with 23 seconds on the clock and
did the same to Buffalo with no time left, courtesy of those calls
that had Wilson apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Bills won in New England, they would have been tied with
the Jets and Dolphins and looking at by far the easiest schedule of
the four teams. The winning percentage of the Bills' remaining
opponents is .458; they host both Oakland and the Jets at frozen
Rich Stadium while playing hapless Cincinnati and the Saints on the
road. That schedule should have been an edge, but the loss to New
England negates some of it, and Wilson knows that.
</P>
<P>
   As for Miami, the Dolphins are the polar opposite of the Bills
and not just because of the weather. They face teams with an
aggregate .771 winning percentage. Miami must go to Oakland, then
host the Jets and undefeated Broncos, before ending the season at
Atlanta against a team that could be in position to win its first
division title in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   So who really controls their own destiny in such a circumstance?
The Jets, because if they win, nobody can unseat them; and New
England, to a lesser degree, because it holds a win over wild-card
challenger Tennessee and could create the same situation with the
Steelers Sunday. In addition, it still has an opportunity to level
the field with the Jets, something it has already done with Miami
and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills have the easiest schedule but history is against them;
only three teams have begun 0-3 and ended up in the playoffs. Their
short-term future will likely be determined Dec. 19 against the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dolphins, they have the stingiest defense in the
league, and that is always a major plus when the weather turns
foul, but they have not been able to mount much of a running game
and now have four of the five offensive linemen who opened the
season (plus tight end  &UR; Troy Drayton &LR; ) out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   How will it play out? If you claim to know, you're kidding
yourself, but the Jets have the inside track and I like Buffalo's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave the Dolphins and Patriots? Well, if the
playoffs began Sunday, it would leave them in the playoff lineup as
well.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that four teams from one division will reach the
postseason, but unlike Pittsburgh and Oakland, at least the men
coaching those teams have one advantage this afternoon _ to some
degree, they control their destiny.
</P>
<P>
   At least until nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer  &LR; has been hot of late, and his
Cardinals are 6-6 and in the NFC playoff hunt for the first time
since 1982. Plummer believes it would never have been this way if
he'd listened to the people around him. ``You have got to set your
mind and goals and you have got to believe in yourself,'' Plummer
said. ``When everyone else is telling you you're too small, your
arm isn't strong enough, you're too skinny, you don't stay in the
pocket well enough, you can't take the hits, if I believed all
that, then I would be working somewhere else cleaning pools or
something in Arizona.'' Plummer said one reason he likes being
compared to  &UR; Joe Montana  &LR; is that, ``He was a guy who they said a
lot of the same things they said about me as far as the size and
the arm strength and little things like that. But he had the
intangibles that count.'' ... Speaking of intangibles, the
Cardinals do not play a single team with a winning record the rest
of the way, a fact that could help them reach the playoffs for the
first time in a nonstrike year since 1975. The Cardinals have never
reached the playoffs in a 16-game season ... Bledsoe has an
interesting point of view on what the two last-second wins he's
engineered have meant to his reputation: ``I think there's probably
a change in the perception of me as a quarterback. I don't think
these last two weeks will change me as a player either for the
positive or the negative, but I think that the perception of me as
a quarterback probably changes with those kind of games.'' Of
course, Bledsoe couldn't care less about how he's perceived. ``It's
not something that's necessarily important to me,'' he said. ``I
think that the ultimate goal is to win championships and when that
goal is achieved, then the perception changes. Until then, there
will be things out there that are not entirely favorable. But the
perception is not something that I care about. It's the winning
that I care about. If we can win games, then that perception can be
whatever it is and I don't really care.'' ... How bad are things
going for St. Louis coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil &LR; ? His team would have to go
on a five-game winning streak for Vermeil to have as many wins as
his predecessor,  &UR; Rich Brooks &LR; , &UR;  &LR; had on the day he got fired two
years ago. And the Rams have only three games left ... Vermeil is
not the only coach with heavy baggage to carry. In Chicago,  &UR; Dave
Wannstedt's  &LR; 7-21 record the last two years marks the worst stretch
for a Bears team since the short, unhappy tenure of  &UR; Abe Gibron  &LR; 25
years ago ... When  &UR; Koy Detmer  &LR; found  &UR; Jeff Graham  &LR; with an 18-yard
scoring pass last week against Green Bay, it was the first
touchdown pass to an Eagle wide receiver this season in 383 pass
attempts. Graham caught a second one in that game, and in
Thursday's win over the Rams,  &UR; Irving Fryar  &LR; got his first
touchdown reception since last December. Fryar is hardly part of
the problem in Philadelphia, but word from a source close to Eagle
owner  &UR; Jeff Lurie  &LR; is that the decision has already been made not
to re-sign Fryar next year when he becomes a free agent. The
Eagles' offense has been so stymied that it could become the
lowest-scoring team in the history of the 16-game schedule. To
date, Philadelphia has 109 points, which projects to break the low
of 140 set by the 1992 Seahawks ... Despite the Eagles' troubles,
remember this. Three years ago  &UR; Ray Rhodes  &LR; was the NFL's Coach of
the Year. The problem is, he can't coach some of the players the
nitwits paid to supply them have been bringing in. Rhodes could end
up as the Ravens' new head coach if  &UR; Ted Marchibroda  &LR; does not
survive or, at the worst, return to being defensive coordinator
under  &UR; George Seifert  &LR; or  &UR; Mike Holmgren  &LR; if either lands in
Seattle as a replacement for  &UR; Dennis Erickson  &LR; ... Erickson, by the
way, is all but gone in Seattle, where the Seahawks are 6-6 and
seemed to concede that they can't make the playoffs by sitting down
struggling veteran  &UR; Warren Moon  &LR; in favor of young  &UR; Jon Kitna &LR; .
Kitna came through last Sunday but Erickson concedes, ``It's not
Warren's fault by any means but in this business it's either the
quarterback or the coach.'' As Erickson well knows, sometimes it's
both soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the upside of the coaching carousel,  &UR; June Jones  &LR; has done
well enough in San Diego since replacing  &UR; Kevin Gilbride  &LR; that he
may survive his stint as interim coach. Jones is 3-3 after taking
over and benching rookie quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf  &LR; ... Star-crossed
Tennessee wide receiver  &UR; Yancey Thigpen  &LR; may be back Sunday after
missing six games with a knee injury. Thigpen's career has been one
of the oddest imaginable. Since becoming a full-time starter in
1995 in Pittsburgh, he has consistently followed a great season
with a nonexistent one. In '95, Thigpen had 85 receptions for 1,307
yards. The next year he had 12 receptions and played in only six
games because of injuries. Last year, he had 79 catches for 1,398
yards before leaving the Steelers to sign a multimillion-dollar
contract with Tennessee. This year, he's again missed half his
team's games with injury ... There are many reasons the Packers
have struggled this year, but one glaring one has been the absence
of the big plays that so characterized their recent seasons. This
time a year ago, Green Bay's offense had produced 50 plays of 20
yards or more. This year the number is 30. Worse, their running
backs had 12 such plays in 1997. They have none this season. But
director of football operations  &UR; Ron Wolf  &LR; said such statistics
tell little of the story. ``We haven't been consistent,'' Wolf
said. ``We've laid an egg every prime time appearance we've made.
Injuries have been the biggest problem for us but we're in pretty
good shape now.'' Wolf said the same applies to New England, which
at one point had seven starters in street clothes. ``To have that
many people out and still be in the playoff race is a credit to
 &UR; Pete Carroll  &LR; and his staff, or to somebody,'' Wolf said. ``You
can't operate in today's football without your players. The fact
New England is still winning with those injuries is remarkable.
Everybody has players injured but you lose seven starters and, God
almighty, it's hard to recover.'' ... Here's what the NFL will be
paid by its various TV partners during the length of it present
deal, from 1998-99 to 2005-06, according to a prospectus for the
NFL's recently derailed $600 million bond offering. ABC/ESPN: $1
billion; $1.05 billion; $1.3 billion; $1.35 billion; $1.185
billion; $1.22 billion; and $1.257 billion. CBS: $300 million, $350
million; $500 million; $400 million; $550 million; $690 million;
$715 million; $728 million. Fox: $450 million; $400 million; $450
million; $450 million; $575 million; $725 million; $765 million;
and $815 million. Escalator clauses that may kick in after five
years would make the take even bigger ... By the way, if you're
looking for a Christmas read for the football fan, consider Wolf's
recently published book, ``The Packer Way.'' It's a well-done
primer on how an organization is built ... When Bears rookie
 &UR; Curtis Enis  &LR; went down for the season with a knee injury, he
became the fourth top rookie running back in six years to suffer a
major injury. All of them _ Enis,  &UR; Garrison Hearst, Ki-Jana
Carter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Tshimanga Biakabutuka  &LR; _ had several things in
common. All were juniors coming out early and all missed
significant training camp time with holdouts. It makes you wonder
how much time is needed for a rookie to make the transition to the
NFL.

COUP LEADER LIKELY TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON AND DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six years ago, Hugo Chavez languished in a Venezuela prison,
accused of leading a bloody, failed coup that killed hundreds of
people. Sunday, as millions of Venezuelans vote, the former
paratrooper _ who has been denied a visa to visit the United States
_ is poised to become the country's next president.
</P>
<P>
   With adoring references to Simon Bolivar, the 19th century
revolutionary leader who liberated Venezuela and other South
American countries from the Spanish monarchy, Chavez stirs crowds
with vague promises of a modern-day ``social revolution that can't
be stopped'' _ and that's what scares business leaders and
investors at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He has few seasoned political and economic advisers and no
experience in government, other than plotting to overthrow an
elected president. Even worse, he has shown no signs that he has a
plan for rescuing the troubled country, reeling from decades of
corruption and a recent drop in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's oldest civilian democracy is at a crossroads. It
must decide whether to choose Chavez's fiery rhetoric of
antiestablishment, antiglobalization, and antigovernment populism _
or Henrique Salas Romer, a centrist former governor and
Yale-trained economist who also lambastes Venezuela's legacy of
corrupt government.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls show Chavez with leads ranging anywhere from 5
percent to 15 percent, such measures often are unreliable in
Venezuela because many poor voters do not have phones. No matter
who wins, the results of these elections will be felt well beyond
the country's warm Caribbean shores.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, which produces about 3 billion barrels of oil a day,
is one of the largest suppliers to the United States, providing 16
percent of the country's total petroleum. Before this year's
financial crisis, it also had been one of Latin America's shining
stars in privatizing stagnant state monopolies and attracting
billions of dollars in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being, Venezuela's economic promise has been
overshadowed by its political uncertainty. US officials worry that
Chavez, if elected, could drive the country to ruin, scare away
foreign businesses, and perhaps become Latin America's newest
dictator. Already he has appeared in Cuba with Fidel Castro and
pledged to dissolve Venezuela's congress and its supreme court and
replace it with a constituent assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, business executives from Houston to Boston wonder
whether Venezuela's wheezing economy might soon close its doors to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, many of the things (Chavez) has said raise
questions,'' said Bernard Aronson, a former US State Department
official who now leads a company that invests in South America.
``Anybody who is thinking about investing in Venezuela is going to
wait and see what the rules of the game will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wiarda, a political scientist at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst and a senior associate at Washington's
Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the prospect
of a Chavez victory and the possibility of authoritarian rule don't
bode well for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult situation,'' Wiarda said. ``One of
the most developed countries in the region might elect a populist
president who seems ready to violate every international economic
principle we know.''
</P>
<P>
   How someone like Chavez, 44, could rise so swiftly from
political banishment to the top of Venezuela's power structure says
a lot about this charismatic and enigmatic figure.
</P>
<P>
   A former lieutenant colonel from a working-class family, Chavez
has aimed most of his messages at the country's poor. His
``Patriotic Pole'' coalition also has drawn support from leftist
intellectuals and conservative businessmen _ particularly among the
country's agricultural and manufacturing sector _ who would rather
not compete against multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Although his trademark accessory is a cranberry red beret, which
he wears while making speeches in small villages and Caracas slums,
Chavez is also known for wearing tailored suits and driving a
Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   He unapologetically refers to the 1992 coup attempt he led as
``a legitimate rebellion for the people.'' (He encouraged another
overthrow attempt later that year.)
</P>
<P>
   But more than personality, Chavez's ascendancy also says a lot
about the accumulated anger that most Venezuelans now feel toward
their broken political system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite impressive economic growth through most of this decade,
the gap between rich and poor in Venezuela, as in many other Latin
American countries, has increased dramatically. Most people blame
the government.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Venezuela's 23 million people live in
poverty. Billions of dollars in oil revenues have been squandered
by the two leading parties, the Democratic Action Party and the
Christian Democrats, in corrupt contracts and no-show jobs for the
politically connected.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1993, about a year after Chavez's failed coup,
President Carlos Andres Perez was suspended from office amid
allegations he embezzeled $17 million from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, basic services, such as health, public safety, and
education have decayed even below the levels of other developing
countries. Every weekend, an average of 30 homicides are reported
in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Medical patients often must sit on beds at hospitals weeks in
advance before a doctor performs surgery. The country's
universities are roundly criticized for graduating barely educated
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great portion of the population feels the government has not
fulfilled its promises, and that is who Chavez now represents,''
said Roberto Briseno Leon, a professor at the Central University of
Venezuela in Caracas and director of the Laboratory of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skol, a former US ambassador to Venezuela, thinks a
Chavez presidency might bring even more problems. ``The sense that
where Chavez wants to go is decidedly backwards and against the
modern economy,'' Skol said. ``If it gets populist, statist, and
isolationist, Venezuela will just get poorer and more corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Salas has tried to maintain an image of
independence from Venezuela's two main parties. Last week, however,
in an unusual turn that illustrated the degree of concern there is
about a Chavez victory, both parties dumped their candidates, a
septuagenarian party leader and a former Miss Universe, and threw
their support to Salas.
</P>
<P>
   With strong support from middle class voters and business
leaders, Salas has promised to do for Venezuela what he did as
governor in the state of Carabobo, in the heart of the country's
industrial belt. There, he cracked down on government corruption by
halting the theft of medicines and equipment from public hospitals.
He created the country's only police emergency telephone system and
reduced infant mortality in the state by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His administration also inaugurated a low-interest credit
program for small businesses, a plan he says he would expand
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But for many watching the election closely, the overriding
concern is not so much who wins, but the margin of victory. Some
experts, including State Department officials, predict that a close
election may spark unrest by Chavez and his supporters should he
lose, or by the military and the political establishment should he
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be best for the stability of the country if one of
them would win by a large margin,'' Briseno said. ``A tight race
would make for a very uncertain and confused situation, and that's
the worst thing that could happen to Venezuela right now.''

SHUTTLE ON COURSE TO RENDEZVOUS WITH RUSSIAN MODULE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MARK CARREAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Endeavour astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm
Saturday to raise and reposition the nearly 13-ton Unity module,
the first hurdle in their goal of linking components of the new
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle astronauts were on course to rendezvous with the
much-larger, $240 million Russian Zarya module tonight.(Eds.
Sunday) Astronaut Nancy Currie will use the robot arm to grab the
41-foot-long Russian module so it can be fastened to Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Working from her control panel within Endeavour's crew
compartment on Saturday, Currie commanded the 50-foot robot arm to
grasp and raise the 33-foot-long Unity module, which was stowed
horizontally in the shuttle's cargo bay for Friday's liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two hours, her commands rotated and repositioned
the raised module so that it was accurately aligned and suspended
just four inches from Endeavour's docking system. Pulses of the
shuttle's steering jets activated by Endeavour commander Bob Cabana
provided the forces necessary to shove the complementing docking
systems of the shuttle and Unity together.
</P>
<P>
   When the procedure was complete, Unity was secured vertically
and towering nearly four stories out of the cargo bay, ready for
Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Unity firmly attached to Endeavour,'' Cabana
informed mission control shortly before 6 p.m., CST. ``We're off to
a great start on building the international space station.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful sight,'' responded Chris Hadfield, the
shuttle crew's liaison in mission control, where ground teams
followed the activities by television and telemetry beamed down by
the astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Endeavour raced after Zarya, Russian for ``sunrise,''
the propulsion and electrical power generation module that was
launched from Central Asia on Nov. 20 as the cornerstone of the new
station.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, the shuttle trailed Zarya by just over 2,000
miles and was closing.
</P>
<P>
   The Endeavour crew should converge on Zarya at an altitude of
240 miles shortly before 6 p.m., CST, today. (Sunday)
</P>
<P>
   That rendezvous will set up the the most challenging phase of
the first station assembly mission.
</P>
<P>
   As the two spacecraft circle the Earth at five miles per second,
Cabana and pilot Rick Sturckow will steer Endeavour slowly toward
Zarya, rising gradually from several hundred feet below. They will
then maneuver their spacecraft about 350 feet in front of the
43,000-pound Russian module.
</P>
<P>
   As the operation continues, Endeavour will maneuver about 250
feet above Zarya, allowing Russian ground control teams to maintain
an unimpeded communications link to their module during the
upcoming shuttle capture.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the shuttle pilots will begin a slow descent
toward Zarya. With the separation within 35 feet, Currie will use
the shuttle's robot arm to grab the Russian module. With carefully
choreographed commands, Currie will position Zarya so that its
docking mechanism is aligned several inches above Unity's.
</P>
<P>
   More pulses of the shuttle's steering thrusters should drive the
two modules together, forming a single 75-foot-long, nearly
70,000-pound structural bridge between future American and Russian
segments of the new station.
</P>
<P>
   Unity is equipped with a half-dozen docking ports to join future
living quarters, research facilities, an airlock, viewing port and
an electrical power generating apparatus. The station's first crew
compartment, the Russian-built service module, should be launched
by the end of next year and joined to the opposite end of Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   At least three spacewalks by astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim
Newman are planned this week to link power and computer data cables
between the two modules and establish a communications link to
NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new station's 100 components will require at
least 43 more missions over the next six years.

BLUE JAYS BRING CLEMENS WOE UPON THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Blue Jays had just signed Jose Canseco, all this might
not be happening.
</P>
<P>
   All Roger Clemens wanted was some indication that Toronto was at
least trying to stay competitive enough to win the wild-card spot,
giving him a shot at the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also disturbed by the Blue Jays' off-season stadium
problems (they even threatened to move back to Exhibition Stadium,
for pity's sake), the declining Canadian dollar (which may not
affect him directly but certainly does indirectly) and ownership's
decision to cut payroll and hold it at the $43 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were manager Tim Johnson's fantasies about
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the ``Toronto Star'' says that Clemens has lost
faith in Johnson, brother of former Rangers assistant general
manager Sandy Johnson, after learning that the Jays manager had
lied to players and others about having served with the Marines in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' older brother is a Vietnam veteran, and Roger had
planned to have a special motorcycle helmet made for Johnson, who
was given a motorcycle as a birthday gift last July, with his
Marine company name and number on it. Clemens has since canceled
those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has apologized for having made up stories and promised
to seek counseling. ...
</P>
<P>
   If you're keeping score, there were two bona fide ace starting
pitchers on the free-agent market in Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown
(who's still there) and two at the next level who could have been
the No. 1 starter in the Rangers' rotation in Todd Stottlemyre and
Al Leiter. And how many has Rangers' general manager Doug Melvin
signed so far? Zero. ...
</P>
<P>
   One Toronto columnist, handicapping the race for Clemens, sees
it this way: (1) Astros; (2) Indians; (3) Yankees; (4) Rangers; (5)
Angels. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays were surprised and disappointed that Clemens,
despite winning consecutive Cy Young awards while in Toronto, had a
negligible affect on attendance on the days he started. In fact,
the Jays drew 2,559,563 fans the year before Clemens arrived and
2,454,283 last year. That's not likely to happen if Clemens comes
back to Texas, where fans love a power pitcher and where he's seen
as a local hero. ...
</P>
<P>
   Should Clemens come back to Texas, there would be some
similarities to Nolan Ryan's signing with the Rangers in 1989. Like
Ryan, Clemens is a pure power pitcher who is approaching some
milestones in career records. The difference is that Ryan was 42
when he arrived, six years further along than the 36-year-old
Clemens, who appears to have another two or three premier years
left in his arm. ...
</P>
<P>
   Two considerations as the Clemens saga continues: (1) He has the
right to veto a trade, which means he could turn down the Yankees
in order to force Toronto to send him to a Texas team; (2) Will he
force his new team to re-negotiate his contract, getting him into
the Randy Johnson salary range ($13 million a year)? Clemens has a
$5 million base salary for 1999, $6.35 million in 2000 and $5
million due in deferred payments. ...
</P>
<P>
   The agent for former Red Sox outfielder Mike Greenwell, who
didn't play last season, has contacted Melvin about his client
coming out of retirement. ``I might take a look at it later,''
Melvin says. ``It's not something I'm going to jump into.'' It's
not likely to happen unless the Rangers can't re-sign Lee Stevens.
...
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson's agent Dan Howits says the Rangers are among
the teams interested in his man. Melvin says that's not true. ...
</P>
<P>
   One reason Palmeiro may have been ready to get out of Baltimore:
There was talk that the Orioles might eventually move Cal Ripken
Jr. to first and ask Palmeiro to move to right field. ...
</P>
<P>
   Funny how the Rangers run from that phrase ``final piece of the
puzzle'' after Melvin trotted it out in his introduction of John
Wetteland two winters ago. ``\RPalmeiro\S can't be the final
piece,'' manager Johnny Oates says. ``He's just one of the pieces.
We all have to do our job.''. ...
</P>
<P>
   Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte has been mentioned prominently
in the Clemens' rumors, but the Jays might be put off by reports
that he's seeking counseling to combat fear of throwing strikes.
...
</P>
<P>
   Now that Palmeiro's back in town, can Kenny Rogers be far
behind? The two are best friends, and Rogers' advice played a major
role in Raffy contacting the Rangers personally. ``I want him to be
here this year,'' Palmeiro says, ``not next year \Rwhen Rogers can
be a free agent\S. He wants to play here.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Melvin says the signing of Palmeiro won't affect the development
of last year's No. 1 draft pick, Carlos Pena. ``Carlos is also an
excellent defensive player,'' Melvin says. ``This just allows us to
take our time about bringing him along, but I could see him playing
first here in three years and Raffy moving over to DH.''
REVO'S RIMSHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers' official on the most obvious difference between
Rafael Palmeiro and Will Clark: ``Just look at their bodies. One
works out; the other doesn't.'' Is that like saying Raffy looks
good, even in the shower?
</P>
<P>
   TCU vs. Southern Cal in the Sun Bowl? Sounds like that warning
about being careful what you pray for; you might just get it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a coin flip, maybe the NFL should have the captain of
each team just draw cards. High card gets their choice. That's
assuming, of course, that NFL officials know their cards better
than they do the rules on pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, Albert Belle promises to be more accessible to the
media, be more fan-friendly and pass out candy each and every
Halloween. ... has lightning struck Camden Yards yet?

HOFFA WINS ELECTION, RIVAL CONCEDES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ James P. Hoffa won election Saturday to the
presidency of the teamsters' union, the job that his powerful
father held for more than a decade, after the main opponent
conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   With the concession, from Tom Leedham, Hoffa, a labor lawyer
from Detroit, will take the helm of the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters, one of the nation's largest unions.
</P>
<P>
   The victory returns the Hoffa name to the head of a union that
federal officials had long called the most corrupt, particularly
when Hoffa's father, James R. Hoffa, led the organization from 1957
to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Cherkasky, the federal election monitor,
Hoffa had 100,899 votes, or 54 percent, of those counted here in
Alexandria early Saturday evening, while Leedham, head of the
union's warehouse division, had 74,700 or 40 percent. A third
candidate, John Metz, a St. Louis teamsters' leader, had 9,225
votes, or 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In conceding defeat, Leedham said: ``The returns have made it
clear that our campaign for rank-and-file power ran out of time.
Hoffa Jr. campaigned for four years, spent $6 million and had a
famous name, but in six short months we came from nowhere to build
a grass-roots campaign for rank-and-file power.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's lead is expected to expand because Sunday will be
dedicated to counting votes from the Midwest, which is Hoffa's home
turf and was his father's stronghold. About 420,000 votes were
cast; counting is expected to be finished on Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa won the race in his second attempt, having lost narrowly
in 1996 to Ron Carey, the incumbent. That result was overturned and
a new election ordered when a federal monitor found that three
Carey aides had misappropriated more than $700,000 from the
teamsters' treasury to help the Carey campaign. Carey was later
expelled from the union and Leedham replaced him as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Hoffa camp spent almost a $1 million, while the
Leedham campaign spent about one-fourth that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa narrowly won the South, with 14,282 votes to 13,197
Leedham and 1,062 for Metz. Hoffa ran more strongly in the East,
after having lost it by 21,000 votes to Carey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Hoffa received 65,196 in the East, Leedham received
43,611 and Metz, 7,192. Ballots from the West were being counted
Saturday and ballots from Canada are to be counted late Sunday or
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, ran
on a platform promising to reunite the badly splintered union and
to give more power back to state and local teamster organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham styled himself as an anticorruption reformer in the
fashion of Carey when he first won the union's leadership in 1991,
and Leedham promised to involve the rank and file far more in
negotiations and other union activities.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa flew to Washington from Detroit Saturday, and his campaign
aides said he was not planning to speak publicly until Sunday or
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Saturday, Tom Pazzi, Hoffa's campaign
manager, said, ``I would characterize our attitude as a
continuation of what it's been, which is a quiet non-hysterical
confidence. We are looking forward to not merely winning, but to
running the union in an effective way and making some progress.
That prospect is a sobering one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jody Rodriguez, a ballot observer who works at a Yellow Freight
trucking terminal in Columbus, Ohio, offered this assessment: ``We
feel like Jimmy's the messiah of the labor movement. He's for the
working-class people, and he's the guy who's going to rebuild this
union. There's nothing wrong with having an educated attorney
heading the union instead of truck drivers because that will help
us even the playing field with companies.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy to restore the teamsters to their power of
old, largely because the union's membership has slipped to 1.4
million from 2.3 million in the 1970s and the overall power of the
labor movement has declined.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffa's supporters say they hope that he is the man who will
lead the resurgence of labor and attract hundreds of thousands more
workers to the teamsters banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll do the same thing his father did, build up this
union,'' said Danny Moussette, a teamsters' official from Chicago
who began driving trucks in 1960. ``With the solid people Jimmy has
around him, he'll be able to build this union back up to 2
million.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoffa camp and the Leedham camp demonized each other. The
Leedham forces called Hoffa a corrupt tool of the teamster old
guard, which provided him with much of his campaign support. The
Hoffa supporters called Leedham a corrupt Carey lieutenant because
he was part of the 1996 Carey slate and Carey had named him head of
the warehouse division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done well enough that we've shown the reform
movement will stay alive,'' said David Eckstein, a Leedham slate
member who was director of field services under Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated number of votes cast this year, 420,000, was down
from 480,000 in the 1996 election. Teamster officials attributed
the decline to two factors: cynicism arising from the Carey scandal
and the fact that the current campaign did not have the same heat
and fury as the battle between Hoffa and Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The teamsters have long been considered one of the nation's most
powerful unions not just because of its size but also because its
members handle goods that affect every nook and cranny of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Its members include long-haul truck drivers, police officers,
warehouse workers, food-processing workers, garbage collectors,
flight attendants, even the actors who play Mickey Mouse and Donald
Duck at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have played a role overseeing the union since
1989 when the teamsters signed a consent decree allowing government
oversight to settle a lawsuit charging that the union had made a
``devil's pact'' with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Hoffa became the nation's most famous union leader not
only because he greatly expanded the teamsters size and clout but
also because he won the first nationwide master freight contract
and helped double the wages of many teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffa was also widely known for his ties to the underworld.
He was convicted of mail fraud and jury tampering, and
law-enforcement officials say he helped arrange for the teamsters'
pension and welfare funds to lend tens of millions of dollars to
organized-crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa disappeared in 1975, in what was widely viewed as a mob
killing. He was last seen in a restaurant in suburban Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   His son has denied any ties to organized crime and has
repeatedly insisted that as far as he knows, his father was framed
by the government and did not have dealings with crime figures.

MIAMI DERAILS UCLA'S RUN FOR A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As soon as Cade McNown's pass fell incomplete in the end
zone Saturday, almost certainly ending UCLA's hopes for a national
title, Paul Dee clenched his fists and began jumping in joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a game like this in 10 years,'' the Miami
athletic director shouted above the mounting din, after the
Hurricanes outlasted previously unbeaten UCLA, 49-45, before 46,819
at the Orange Bowl. ``It's wonderful. We're back.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss probably deprived UCLA (10-1) of a shot at the national
championship in the Fiesta Bowl. The Bruins entered the game second
in the Bowl Championship Series ranking, one spot ahead of Kansas
State, which was looking to remain undefeated in the Big 12
championship game against Texas A&AMP;M. If Kansas State won, UCLA
would head to the Rose Bowl, bumping Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Miami fans began spilling onto the field after the game. A
police officer wrestled down one of the first to reach the
sideline, but soon became overwhelmed. ``There's nothing you can
do,'' one officer said, as several thousand fans met at midfield,
jutting No. 1 fingers in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trudged off the field, presumably in shock at seeing
a 38-21 late third-quarter lead disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't stop them,'' UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said.
``Our defense didn't play very well and obviously if you can't play
good defense you don't deserve to be a national champion.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Hurricanes, 8-3 and headed to the Micron PC Bowl at
nearby Pro Player Stadium, the showing provided some solace after
their 53-point beating by Syracuse the week before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was about getting our respect back,'' Miami Coach
Butch Davis said. ``We asked not one single person to surrender
until the game was over, and not one did. It took every ounce of
heart and soul we could muster to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami, four-time national champions, went a decade without
losing in the Orange Bowl, but had lost eight of its last 14 games
there after 1995 NCAA probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game says a lot about Coach Davis and this team to come
from where we were last Saturday to what we did today,'' said Scott
Covington, the Miami senior quarterback who threw for 318 yards and
three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Michael Lawson added: ``This is definitely an
out-of-body experience. I'm going to wake up tomorrow and not
believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   The game evolved into a battle between UCLA's McNown and Miami's
Covington and running back Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   McNown accounted for six touchdowns, five by passing. He
completed 26 of 35 passes for 513 yards, with his touchdowns going,
in order, for 77, 7, 14, 61 and 59 yards. He also scored on a
1-yard option run.
</P>
<P>
   James was equally as spectacular for Miami. With the backup
running back James Jackson suspended for an undisclosed team
violation, James had to do yeoman work. And he did _ rushing 39
times for a school and Big East record 299 yards. He scored three
times, on runs of 45 yards, 10 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA probably came in here thinking they were going to win
easy,'' James said. ``But they didn't understand what this program
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   James' last score, with 50 seconds left, proved the game-winner.
It came after a disputed lost fumble by UCLA receiver Brad Melsby
at the Miami 26-yard line with 3 minutes 24 seconds remaining, with
the Bruins ready to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes then went 74 yards in eight plays to beat only
their second ranked opponent in nine tries under Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time this year we got to use the Orange Bowl
heat to our advantage,'' Covington said. ``We got to grinding them
down and I saw a lot of poise on that last drive.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA wasn't finished. It quickly moved deep into Miami
territory, as the drama thickened and the crowd's noise level
reached deafening proportions. McNown had two final chances from
the Miami 29, and both passes fell incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bennett saw McNown's last pass slip through his grasp in
the end zone as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's James had 173 yards rushing by halftime, as the
Hurricanes built a 21-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta Bowl executive director John Junker took the occasion to
hark back to a sequence that had dramatically changed the Bruins'
game against ranked Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored 21 points almost before you could blink,'' Junker
said. ``With their offense, that could happen again here, and it'll
be interesting to see if Miami can overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Junker envisioned indeed unfolded in the second half. The
Bruins scored twice in the third quarter in five plays and added
another touchdown by quarter's end to seemingly assure a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Hurricanes on this day had more resilience than they've
shown since their championship runs of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing,'' Davis said at the end, flashing a wide
smile. ``We made 6.5 million people in Kansas happy today.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's loss opened the door for Kansas State now to play
Tennessee for the national championship.

TEAMSTERS' NEW LEADER IS SEEN AS A CONTRADICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related: TEAMSTERS-RDP)  
(rl) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like his famous _ many would say infamous _ father, James P.
Hoffa, the newly elected president of the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters, is a contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Hoffa is a genial, well-to-do lawyer who lives in
suburban comfort and lacks his father's powerful build. He has
become a hero to many Teamsters with his vow to clean up a union
embarrassed by a campaign-finance scandal under its previous
president, Ron Carey. Yet many of Hoffa's mentors and allies are
under investigation or have had run-ins with the law.
</P>
<P>
   The question _ the same one that swirls around his father's
reputation to this day _ is which Hoffa will emerge to lead the
Teamsters. To the new Teamsters president, the answer is clear. He
talks about how he aims to reunite a union that has been torn by a
near civil war between his supporters and those of Carey.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledges to restore the union's financial health. Under
Carey its assets plunged from $150 million to nearly zero, leaving
its strike fund depleted. He also promises to do more organizing to
regain some of the union's membership, which has fallen to 1.4
million from 2.3 million two decades ago. Hoffa wants to organize
truck drivers, hospital workers and public employees.
</P>
<P>
   But his opponents have repeatedly pointed out questions about
the younger Hoffa's links. In the late 1960s, Hoffa was an investor
in a partnership with Allen Dorfman, a friend of his father and
leading organized crime figure who funneled tens of millions of
dollars from Teamster pension funds to the Mafia. Although Dorfman
was well known as a mob figure, Hoffa denied knowing that Dorfman
was tied to organized crime, and he said he sold his investment as
soon as he found out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Hoffa sought to run for the Teamsters presidency, but
he was told he could not because he was not working as a union
member. To qualify, he took a job as administrative assistant to
Larry Brennan, head of the Teamsters in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan played a major role in running a union welfare fund at a
time when federal Department of Labor officials found $725,000 in
improper expenses, including spending on golf outings and adult
entertainment. Federal monitors have criticized Brennan for giving
union subordinates more than $30,000 in raises that were
immediately sent to his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Similar _ if more serious _ allegations dogged Hoffa's father,
James Riddle Hoffa, who headed the union from 1957 to 1971, an era
when lawmakers termed the Teamsters a national menace. The elder
Hoffa's union was widely considered the most corrupt in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert
Kennedy, began the pursuit of Hoffa, with more than two dozen
investigators, in what has been called the largest and longest
investigation of an individual. Hoffa was convicted of fraud and
jury tampering, and prosecutors tied him to everything from relying
on Mafia muscle in contract disputes to helping divert millions of
dollars from pension funds to his mob friends.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, after being released from jail, Hoffa disappeared in
what investigators say was a gangland rubout.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Teamsters ranging from truck drivers to vegetable packers
worshipped the elder Hoffa for turning their union into the
nation's strongest and largest, for winning them pension benefits,
and for helping double and even triple their wages. This workers'
hero was the most famous union leader of his time, and his son is
uncompromising in defending his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Hoffa denied that his father had any ties to
organized crime, insisting he was framed by the Kennedys and
overzealous prosecutors. He also angrily rejected assertions from
Carey and from his main opponent in this year's race, Tom Leedham,
that he would be like his father and let mob influence expand in
the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing,'' Hoffa said in an interview last
year, is that ``my father was, I believe, murdered by the mob. The
mob will never come back into the Teamsters union. I will see to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In several interviews over the past year, Hoffa has been eager
to discuss anything but allegations of corruption, especially those
that swirled around his father. ``The Hoffa name is revered in this
union,'' he said. ``My father's the pioneer who put this union on
the march.''
</P>
<P>
   James Phillip Hoffa was born in Detroit on May 19, 1941. He
remembers going to dozens of union meetings with his father and
standing in front of the fire barrel with him during strikes.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Cooley High School in Detroit, where he was an
all-state football player, and in 1963 he graduated from Michigan
State, where he was a starter on both the offensive and defensive
lines. He went to the University of Michigan Law School, where he
was a classmate of Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader. He
and his wife, Virginia, have two grown sons.
</P>
<P>
   After law school, he often represented Teamster locals that were
close to his father. Other lawyers in Detroit said he was a
talented litigator who eventually was able to drum up plenty of
business without depending on those links.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's campaign, Hoffa also seemed to be trying to carve
his own path. His forces relied on Republicans in Congress to
embarrass Carey, and now, Hoffa said, the Teamsters will no longer
be reflexively pro-Democratic, as they were under Carey. Yet while
Hoffa said the Teamsters would begin supporting some Republicans _
he mentioned Rep. Peter King of Long Island in particular _ he
described himself as a progressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to support politicians that share our vision for
America,'' he said. ``That is a working man's agenda, which is to
promote full employment, good jobs for this country, that is
against exportation of jobs and one that supports reforming the
labor laws that favor employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign, Hoffa also promised to move power back
to union locals and regional Teamster councils. That was popular
with the many Teamster chieftains who supported him, but his
opponent, Leedham, insisted that giving local barons more power was
a recipe for them to steal more money.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Hoffa seems to be rethinking plans to send
power back to the locals. ``I'm not running for this job to give
the power back to anybody,'' he said last month. ``We're going to
provide leadership. People will rally to somebody who wants to
lead.''

NEW `PSYCHO' NOT BAD, BUT THE ORIGINAL DWARFS IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people have already made up their mind about Gus Van Sant's
remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Their reactions range from
``Is Van Sant nuts?'' to near-apoplexy over Van Sant's nerve in
remaking a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, you just wanna tell these people to close their eyes,
breathe deeply and repeat to themselves, ``It's only a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And although the new ``Psycho'' is not an abomination, its main
problem is that it IS only a movie; it's not going to jolt the
cinematic landscape like the 1960 original. Hitchcock broke rules
regarding sex, violence and the leading lady, and left audiences
shook up; Van Sant breaks rules of remakes, changing very little,
and leaves audiences scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   As publicized, the movie is a virtual shot-for-shot remake; Van
Sant is so slavish in places, he even uses the same license-plate
numbers as the original. And although some of Van Sant's shots are
just as dazzling as Hitchcock's, it's because they are Hitchcock's.
You gotta admit, it's hard to knock this movie's direction, script
or score, because for the most part they're just as good as the
original's _ because they are the original's.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant does make good use of some tools that Hitchcock didn't
or couldn't use, though. The primary reason to see this movie in a
theater is its use of sound; Van Sant employs an unsettling mix of
nearly inaudible whispers and boosted background noises whenever
something creepy is about to happen, and the voice-overs bounce all
over the theater, echoing and overlapping till you feel as if the
characters are sitting next to you. Van Sant also uses color well _
it's been a strength of even his lousiest movies _ flattening it
out to the point that the movie actually looks as if it was filmed
in the '60s, and dressing his stars in tones that reflect their
characters' personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The shadows of the original loom largest over the cast,
especially Vince Vaughn, trying mightily to fill Anthony Perkins'
shoes as Norman Bates. Vaughn's performance is uneven; you get the
sense that his Norman feels more guilty about all the bloodshed,
but in Norman's more ``normal'' moments, Vaughn doesn't convince
you that Anne Heche's Marion Crane could trust him enough to eat
one of his sandwiches. Heche fares better, playing Marion in a much
warmer way than Janet Leigh did, her impulsive decisions making
more sense in this context. Viggo Mortensen is too mannered as
Marion's lover, and Julianne Moore is too butch as Marion's sister,
but William H. Macy is easily Martin Balsam's equal as the private
eye who gets involved when Marion disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the original could stand some tweaking, but Van
Sant tweaks in the wrong places. Most critics agree that the
psychiatrist scene near the end is the original's weakest element,
but it remains intact here; so does Marion and Norman's dinner
conversation, which goes on far too long. Van Sant saves his
indulgences for the killings (which still look almost quaint
compared with most of today's fare), adding Van Sant-ish touches
such as quick edits of passing clouds or of a cow standing in a
road as the knife comes down. It's odd that he picked the

   But then, his whole movie is odd. He defends it as a tribute, as
something nobody has done before, adding that people remake songs
and plays all the time, and nobody seems to get upset. But those
remakes are often best when they're reinterpretations; Van Sant may
be paying tribute here, but he's done it by reinterpreting a
classic as a curiosity piece.

TOCCHET REBORN AS COYOTE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ A look at the standings going into the weekend showed
Phoenix and Toronto tied for the NHL lead in points with 30. Not
Philadelphia, not Detroit, not Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   What's most remarkable is the emergence of the Coyotes, who went
into the weekend with a 14-3-2 rec-ord and were 8-1-1 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's obvious to point out the seasons Keith Tkachuk and
Jeremy Roenick are having, the real surprise is the rejuvenation of
former Bruin Rick Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, 34, played a total of 67 games with the Bruins in the
1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons, a time when the club had hit rock
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was miserable for everyone in Boston; the team was
going nowhere, and Tocchet was happy as heck to get out of Dodge in
the form of a trade to Washington that also involved Adam Oates and
Bill Ranford and brought Jason Allison, Anson Carter, and Jim
Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Now everybody is happy. The Bruins are worlds better, Tocchet
opted for free agency after 1996-97 and signed with the Coyotes,
and Washington went to the finals last season partly on the
strength of -Oates's play. Funny how it all works out.
</P>
<P>
   When Tocchet was here, he looked to be on the downside of his
career. His body had a lot of miles on it, he had a history of back
and shoulder problems, and the end appeared to be near.
</P>
<P>
   But Tocchet has been reborn in the desert climate (who wouldn't
be, when you think about it?). Going into the weekend, he was third
on the team in scoring with 19 points in 19 games. He had eight
goals, 46 penalty minutes, and was a plus-11.
</P>
<P>
   Before having back surgery four years ago, Tocchet seemed to be
finishing his career as a journeyman, going from team to team on
his way to retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what people said _ you can't blame them, really,''
Tocchet said. ``If you're struggling like I was, you just have to
believe in yourself. For me, the health part of it, my back, has
been pretty much everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet's offense tailed off dramatically from the time he put
up 109 points with Pittsburgh in 1992-93. In the two seasons he
spent partly with Boston, he tallied 60 points and 40 points. Last
year, in his first complete season with the Coyotes, he had 45
points, 26 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Tocchet didn't last here was that he's the
type of player who thrives in an environment where there's a great
deal of support. He doesn't have to be The Man in Phoenix. The
Coyotes have Tka-chuk, Roenick, Teppo Numminen, and Nikolai
Khabibulin for that.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in his career, Tocchet is much more comfortable in
a secondary role. In Boston, he was expected to do much more than
he did. In the pickle the Bruins were in, it wasn't going to matter
much either way, which was a frustrating situation for both player
and management.
</P>
<P>
   If you look back over his career, Tocchet's best seasons have
been on teams with an abundance of talent. The ideal time for him
to have been a Bruin would've been around the 1988-90 seasons. It
didn't happen. But now, Tocchet is in a perfect situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm proud of is I've worked very hard to get back to
where I am,'' Tocchet said. ``It's taken me a lot of summers to get
to where I can compete, where I can be a good player again. Hey, I
make a lot of money, so I'm not complaining, but I made a
commitment that if I was going down, I was going down swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, who once looked ready for the old-age home, is now
talking about playing for several more years. His contract expires
in July and he has an option for a third year. An extension didn't
seem remotely possible a couple of years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have laughed, too,'' he said. ``I was rolling the
dice. Now I feel like the ball is in my court and I think I can
still compete. Who knows? The thing is, I think I can, and that's
not a road I was looking down a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but shudder at the comments of Tampa Bay owner
 &UR; Art Williams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who seems the personification of the old adage
that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. After watching his
injury-riddled club lose its eighth game in a row, Williams lashed
out. ``I can't explain it,'' he said. ``I don't know if we've got a
bunch of pansies on this team. Maybe it's a lack of confidence or
maybe some of our guys are playing just for the money. For whatever
reason, we can't seem to give a full 60 minutes of effort. I refuse
to sit there and cater to an overpriced bunch of crybabies. This
season has been a brutal lesson for me. I was told we were a few
players away from a competitive team so I willingly spent even more
money than we budgeted. So far, it's really been discouraging.''
Call me crazy, but comments like that are not going to help the
situation. Williams admits he knows nothing about hockey. His
energy would be better spent learning the game than belittling his
employees. Williams, reportedly a terrific businessman and
otherwise good guy, apparently forgot one of the oldest bits of
advice with regard to purchasing pro teams or anything else:
``Caveat emptor.'' ... Our favorite trade rumor of the week:
Colorado dealing pesky  &UR; Claude Lemieux  &LR; to Washington for
defenseman  &UR; Mark Tinordi &LR; . Imagine Lemieux,  &UR; Dale Hunter &LR; , &UR; Craig
Berube &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Chris Simon  &LR; on the same team. Now, if they could
only find a way to get  &UR; Ulf Samuelsson  &LR; and  &UR; Shayne Corson  &LR; ...
 &UR; Grant Fuhr  &LR; is something of a medical marvel. He's practicing with
the Blues barely a month after injuring his groin. Original reports
had Fuhr out as long as eight weeks. ``There's the medical schedule
and then there's my schedule,'' said Fuhr. Boston-based  &UR; Jay
Fee &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the player's agent, joked a few weeks back that Fuhr said he
expected to be out ``2-8 weeks.'' ... Word out of Florida is that
general manager  &UR; Bryan Murray  &LR; was perturbed when Buffalo goalie
 &UR; Dominik Hasek  &LR; shed his equipment last Saturday in protest of a
call. Murray thought that Hasek, as the league's MVP the last two
years, should act better. As great a goalie as Hasek is, he's the
same guy who attacked a reporter because he didn't like what the
scribe had written about him. Volatile is not too strong a word to
describe him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Doug Gilmour  &LR; said he has no regrets about signing with Chicago
as a free agent despite the club's many woes. Gilmour could've
stayed with the Devils or gone to Buffalo or any number of other
clubs who are having much better seasons than the Blackhawks, one
of the worst teams in the Western Conference. ``I'm exactly where I
want to be,'' said Gilmour, who signed a three-year, $18 million
deal last summer. ``Obviously, I didn't expect us to have the start
we've had. No one did. So it's been frustrating and disappointing
at times. But have I thought it was a mistake? No, not a chance.
That would be like quitting. That would be the biggest copout in
the whole world.'' ...  &UR; Bernie Nicholls &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 37, was cut by the
Sharks last month, but rather than try to play for another club, he
has accepted a job as assistant coach with San Jose ... Calgary
goalie  &UR; Ken Wregget  &LR; has been on a long, frustrating road to
recovery from back woes. He injured himself Nov. 3 against Detroit
and tried to come back too soon, worsening things. His condition is
said to be similar to the one that limited him to 15 appearances
with Pittsburgh last year, but Wregget said, ``It is not
career-ending. It is not season-ending. It is just taking a long
time.'' ...  &UR; Brad May &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who had nine goals in 27 games last year
after being dealt to the Canucks, has fallen off offensively, with
only one goal in 19 games. Bad luck has been a part of it, he said.
``In Philly, I had a breakaway, made the right move, and the puck
rolled off my stick,'' said May. ``In Boston, I had a great shot
that should have gone in. Another time, we got a shot on net, I was
right there for the rebound and it bounced 2 feet behind me the
other way. They have to start going in.'' ... As big as hockey is
in Phoenix, it didn't succeed in Tucson. The West Coast Hockey
League's Gila Monsters were forced to cease operations because of a
lack of fan support ... There are plenty of people out there who
would love to drop a few pounds, but we can't recommend the
 &UR; Jean-Sebastian Giguere  &LR; diet. The Flames netminder loses an
average of 10 pounds a game from excessive sweating. Last year, he
was playing for the Saint John Flames of the American Hockey League
and lost 19 pounds in one game. He became ill and had to be rushed
to the hospital because of dehydration. During training camp, team
doctors ran a battery of tests on the 21-year-old goalie. He donned
his pads and rode the stationary bike hard, trying to replicate the
sweating he would do in a game. They found out he was taking in too
much air along with the fluids he was drinking and they weren't
being absorbed properly. Now, Giguere takes nourishment through a
straw, which seems to help. ``This feels good right now,'' he said.
``I never feel bad after a game. I feel hungry. I sleep better.
Last year, I could not eat. I could not sleep after a game because
my stomach was all full from the water and the air.'' ... Former
Boston University standout  &UR; Jay Pandolfo &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who struggled under
former Devils coach  &UR; Jacques Lemaire  &LR; and bounced back and forth
from the minors, appears to be flourishing under new coach  &UR; Robbie
Ftorek &LR; . Pandolfo, who no doubt has gained some maturity in the
last couple of years, is playing on the checking line with  &UR; Bobby
Carpenter  &LR; and  &UR; Brian Rolston  &LR; but is also more involved in the
offense. He is fourth on the team in scoring with 12 points ...
Before Toronto played Sunday night against the Canadiens, goalie
 &UR; Felix Potvin  &LR; was given permission to arrive in Montreal early to
take care of family matters, but it fueled speculation that he is
about to be dealt, likely to Tampa Bay ... Speaking of Tampa Bay,
49 days to the All-Star Game.

YALE STUDENT FROM GERMANY FOUND STABBED TO DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ A Yale University senior was found stabbed to
death Friday night a mile and a half from campus.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Suzanne Jovin, a 21-year-old political science
major from Goettingen, Germany, was stabbed more than 17 times in
the head and chest. The police found her body at Edgehill Avenue
and East Rock Road, and she was pronounced dead in the emergency
room at Yale-New Haven Hospital at 10:26 p.m. The police said they
had not determined a motive, but Michael Kuzckowski, press
secretary for Mayor John DeStefano Jr., told The Associated Press:
``Early indications show that this is not a random event.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first killing of a Yale student in New Haven since
1991, when Christian Prince, a sophomore from Chevy Chase, Md., was
found shot to death on Hillhouse Avenue at the base of the steps of
St. Mary's Church on the Yale campus. After Prince's death,
applications to Yale were down 9.5 percent for the 1991-92 school
year.
</P>
<P>
   The area where Ms. Jovin was found, a popular route for joggers,
is known as a safe area for students who venture off campus. ``It
gave me a really eerie feeling, especially when it's a place people
are encouraged to go out to get away from campus,'' said Thao Tran,
a sophomore from San Jose, Calif. `It's supposed to be really nice
and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you think it could have been you,'' added Christopher
Deutsch, a sophomore from Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Students who knew Ms. Jovin talked about her energy, enthusiasm
and kindness. An hour before she was killed, she was making pizzas
for disabled people at a New Haven church. Ms. Jovin ran a program
at Yale called Best Buddies that organizes activities between
students and disabled people. She left the church about 9 p.m. and
returned a Yale van to its campus parking lot, said Daniel Koehler,
a junior who participates in the Best Buddies program.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a tremendous person,'' Koehler said. ``She was just
really enthusiastic, and I'm going to miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is planned by Yale.

CHEERS FOR GORDON AT FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Jeff Gordon's victory in the Farm Aid on CMT 300 at
New Hampshire International Speedway Aug. 30, the second of two
annual New England whistlestops on the NASCAR Winston Cup series,
was typical of the season he had in winning his third series
championship in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Lustily booed during the driver introductions at NHIS, Gordon
drove his No. 24 Dupont-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo to Victory
Lane, where he was greeted by more boos and accusations from his
competitors at Roush Racing that Gordon's team tampered with tire
pressure and cheated its way to the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   That scene seemed to play itself out at almost every race he won
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen times Gordon withstood the criticism of his
competitors, endured the scrutiny of NASCAR officials, and turned a
deaf ear to the growing crescendo from a resentful faction of
anti-Gordon fans, and he got the last laugh simply by winning it
all in NASCAR's 50th anniversary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best way to fight criticism and, you know, to make
things quiet,'' Gordon said. ``To me, that's what makes us such a
great team; whether we're being criticized, or whether we've got
the pressure on us, we always find a way to step up to that
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which super teams dominated the NBA and Major
League Baseball, another emerged in NASCAR, delivering Hendrick
Motorsports its fourth consecutive Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Gordon's colleagues paid homage to that
sustained excellence at NASCAR's Awards Banquet at the
Waldorf-Astoria. Though he appeared to be the most scorned man at
the track this season, there was no disputing his talent or
begrudging him his due rewards. When he took center stage in the
grand ballroom, Gordon seemed to ascend to a new level of stardom,
especially since he had tied Richard Petty's record for wins in a
season with his 13th in the season finale at Atlanta Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a year like we had this year is something that really
gets me going (for next year),'' said Gordon, 27, the youngest
driver to win three Winston Cup championships and the winner of a
record $9,306,584 this year. ``It was one of the funnest years I've
had driving a race car. It just blows me away that we're having
this kind of success as a team, at this high level of
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   To cap his championship season, Gordon was unanimously selected
by a panel of 15 media members as Driver of the Year. He joined
Mario Andretti and Darrell Waltrip as the only three-time honorees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even comprehend having my name in the same sentence as
Mario Andretti,'' said Gordon. ``Growing up in Indiana, I remember
watching him at Indy, and, in the last 6-7 years, getting to know
Darrell Waltrip. It's an honor, and to do it three times with those
guys is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the highlight of his season?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the unique thing of this season, and it's that there
was never just one thing, one highlight, one thing that stuck out
in my mind,'' said Gordon. ``It was a combination of things. I
mean, I can go on and on, but you look at our first win at Michigan
... winning the Brickyard 400 for the second time ... the fourth
Southern 500 ... Atlanta ... both road courses (at Watkins Glen,
N.Y., and Sears Point, Calif.) ... I could go on and on. Those were
all the things that made it the year that it was, that made it so
special and made it so spectacular for me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Motor Speedway president  &UR; Tony George  &LR; always said
it was his dream to bring Formula One racing back to American soil.
Last Wednesday, George realized that dream by landing a Formula One
race for 2000 on his 2.5-mile parcel of property at 16th and
Georgetown in Indianapolis. The fabled Brickyard, which will
undergo extensive renovations to the infield to accommodate a
1-mile, 13-turn course, would seem to be a perfect venue for F1's
first race in the US since a poorly attended event at Phoenix in
1991. But some purists fear that the US Grand Prix, combined with
the wildly successful NASCAR event at Indy, will further dilute the
prestige and spectacle of what for almost 82 years was the
Brickyard's only event: the Indy 500. Back in August, when he
presided over the Indy Racing League's final visit to NHIS, George
expressed a strong desire to land an F1 event. ``It's something
I've been interested in for quite some time to bring to
Indianapolis,'' he said then. ``I think we have a good plan and a
good venue to offer for the long term and the viability and
survivability of such a race.'' While no date has been set, George
indicated that FIA officials ``have a plan to change things the way
they schedule the season. They're thinking of scheduling the Asian
races and Australian races in the early part of the season, the
European races in the middle part of the season, and the American
races _ Canada, US, Argentina, Brazil _ towards the end of the
season. My preference would be to run sometime in late September.
It gives us plenty of time between the Brickyard 400 and our
(Senior PGA) golf tournament in early September. I think the
weather's generally good in the Midwest that time of year, it can
be very pleasant. How late could we go? I don't know, maybe late
October. It's really dependent on how the rest of the schedule
falls out.'' ... Open-wheel racing saw one great driver,  &UR; Bobby
Rahal &LR; , &UR;  &LR; retire this year and will see another,  &UR; Arie
Luyendyk &LR; , &UR;  &LR; do the same next year after the Indy 500. Luyendyk, a
two-time winner of the event, plans to call it quits after the 83d
Indy 500. Rahal, the 1986 Indy 500 winner, called it a career after
completing his ``Last Ride'' tour with an 11th-place finish in the
FedEx CART season finale at California Speedway. Rahal, who tabbed
 &UR; Max Papis  &LR; as his successor, will remain head of the two-car
operation he co-owns with late-night host  &UR; David Letterman &LR; . ``I
think the biggest thing I feel is just the enormity of turning a
page in my life,'' said Rahal, a three-time CART champion and
veteran of 285 career starts and 24 victories. ``I don't feel
melancholy or sadness or joy necessarily. What I feel is just a
long chapter in my life is over and now a new chapter has started.
Where that chapter will take me I have no idea. I'd like to be a
positive influence on open-wheel racing.'' ...  &UR; Bobby Labonte  &LR; was
all smiles at the NASCAR Awards Banquet for two reasons: He
finished sixth in points with 4,146, his career best effort, and he
finished three spots ahead of his older brother,  &UR; Terry &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was
ninth (3,759). The brothers started the 1998 season side by side on
the front row of the Daytona 500, Bobby on the pole and Terry on
the outside.

COWBOYS' JEFFERS LIVING OUT A BOYHOOD DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John and Sarah Jeffers have a photo of their 5-year-old son
Patrick in a Cowboys sweatshirt. And they have one of 10-year-old
Patrick sitting in his dorm room at the Cowboys football camp.
</P>
<P>
   Now 25, Patrick Jeffers has had a few snapshots of fame in his
first three months as a receiver for the Cowboys. As he takes the
field today in New Orleans as a growing weapon in the Cowboys
offense, he has become the poster child for an entire community.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Williams' third-grade class at Fort Worth Country Day
School adorns a bulletin board with newspaper stories and pictures
of Jeffers, one of the school's now-famous graduates. Dr. John
Jeffers' office in Arlington greets callers with updates on their
favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Dr. John Jeffers. ``Nobody could have
predicted this. And people in my office think he's their son. My
nurse gets calls and the first thing they want to talk about is
Patrick, even before they say what is wrong. I have to spend five
minutes answering questions about him before I can give care to my
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before Jeffers, who was traded to the Cowboys from
Denver roughly three months ago, romped down the field with a
67-yard touchdown pass against the Minnesota Vikings on
Thanksgiving Day. That prompted a horde of phone calls to his
parents' home and had Country Day coach Joe Breedlove jumping out
of his chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were screaming and yelling in our living room, I was
thinking that every household that was affiliated with Country Day
was doing the same thing,'' Breedlove said. ``You get tickled all
the time. You find yourself looking for him on the field, looking
for his number on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jeffers' mother Sarah: ``One lady called and said, `We knew
him when he was still in diapers.' Now they have a new reason to
get excited about the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   With every catch he's made, seemingly with every practice,
Patrick Jeffers seems to get more excited about playing for his
hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big thrill,'' Jeffers said. ``I was a big Cowboys fan
my whole life. To come back and play with a star on my helmet is a
dream come true. That's what it's like every day ... it's like
living a dream.''
No doctoring for him
Jeffers fantasized about the Cowboys growing up, talking with his
roommate at the Cowboys-sponsored football camp. That happened to
be childhood friend Blake Brockermeyer, a former Arlington Heights
offensive tackle who now plays for the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers comes from a football family. Sarah is the matriarch,
who gained her intense football knowledge dates back to her days
growing up watching Auburn with her father. When Patrick played
college football at Virginia, Sarah was known to scream to coach
George Welsh from the stands to get her son the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers' older sister Allison Dooley, a doctor at Parkland
Hospital in Dallas, is married to SMU assistant football coach
Derek Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, football wasn't his favorite sport and his goal
wasn't to become a professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a doctor like my dad,'' Jeffers said. ``He
would come get me when I was little and take me to the hospital. I
would follow him around. He was my role model. I wanted to follow
in his footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, soccer topped his list of athletic endeavors. Jeffers
played soccer from the time he could walk and proved to be one of
the top talents in the area, making several select all-star teams
and playing year-round.
</P>
<P>
   There, however, was never a question about Jeffers' athletic
ability, according to his older brother Rich, who lives in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was evident early on that he was going to be a good
athlete,'' Rich said. ``He was always taller and faster than
everybody. And he just kept on growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers, who said he eventually grew tired of soccer, starred in
football, soccer and track in high school at Country Day and had
his No. 22 retired this past year. A two-time all-Southern
Preparatory Conference wide receiver, Jeffers' initial dream was to
just play major-college football.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dream that he almost didn't realize. Recruiters snubbed
him following his senior year because of a perceived ``lack of
competition'' at Country Day. A stellar student, Jeffers nearly
took an offer to play at Princeton before deciding to walk on at
the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 218-pound receiver quickly erased any doubts about
his ability to play Division I football by becoming a starter as a
redshirt freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could tell right away he was a good prospect,'' Welsh said.
``He was big, he could run, he could catch. It was hard to explain
how schools in Texas could miss on somebody like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He led the team in receptions and scored six touchdowns as a
sophomore. Only then did he begin to think playing in the NFL was
an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just started building from there,'' Jeffers said. ``Every
year the scouts came down to look at the seniors. And the coaches
told me to keep working because I was getting some notice.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished at Virginia fourth on the school's all-time receiver
list with 108 receptions for 1,785 yards and 15 touchdowns. The
Broncos took him in fifth round of the 1996 draft.
Painter steps in
Jeffers said he loved the experience of being part of last season's
Super Bowl title team with the Denver Broncos. However, nagging
injuries thwarted his growth as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Broncos said they loved his potential, he was
inactive for 28 games, played mostly on special teams and caught
only three passes for 24 yards during his first two years there.
</P>
<P>
   Another injury during training camp this season and the presence
of other quality receivers prompted Broncos coach Mike Shanahan to
make what he told Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was one of the
``toughest decisions'' he ever had in cutting Jeffers.
</P>
<P>
   However, before the Broncos made the move, Cowboys receivers
coach Dwain Painter, who coached Jeffers with the Broncos in 1997,
urged Cowboys coach Chan Gailey and Jones to intervene. The Cowboys
acquired Jeffers in a trade the week of the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you look for in a receiver is size, speed and playing
strength in addition to being able to catch,'' Painter said. ``Pat
had all that in Denver. Unfortunately, he got nicked up a bit and
got caught up in a numbers game. We're glad to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers went about his business of learning the new offense,
resulting in him being inactive for eight of the first nine games
and causing his bursting-with-pride mother to grow increasingly
antsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is not my strong suit,'' Sarah said. ``I know
training camp was over, and they didn't have time to teach. Patrick
would kill me if I said anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What mother didn't know was that Jeffers was quietly catching
the Cowboys' attention with his play on the scout team and
improving his skills by working against All-Pro cornerback Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be amazed how much we learn about a guy from what he
does on the scout team,'' Gailey said. ``We saw Pat make catch
after catch after catch. Then we started putting him in our
offense. And he continued to make plays and develop very well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jeffers finally got a chance to play against the Arizona
Cardinals on Nov. 15, he continued to impress, catching his first
pass with the Cowboys. Injuries helped expand his role the
following week, and he doubled his output with two receptions for
40 yards, including a 21-yarder to set up a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for his performance against the Vikings,
which he calls the highlight of his career. He caught three passes
for 92 yards and the first touchdown of his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers' play has resulted in frequent comparisons to Broncos
receiver Ed McCaffrey, who is also tall at 6-5, sure-handed and
perceived to be slow. Jeffers, who learned a lot from McCaffrey
when he was in Denver, said he has long way to go before he can be
put in McCaffrey's class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some similarities, which makes it natural for people
to try to compare,'' Jeffers said. ``But in no way am I Ed
McCaffrey. A lot of what he does I can use to help my game. I hope
I can get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers said both he and McCaffrey get a raw deal in the speed
department because of their long, loping strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a 6-5 guy running out there and naturally he's not
going to look as quick as a smaller guy whose feet are churning,''
Jeffers said. ``But the fact is that we are covering a lot more
ground with every stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers was so fast in high school that he never lost a race in
track, breaking the school records at Country Day in the 200 and
the 400 meters. He continued the unbeaten streak against the
Vikings with the 67-yard catch running away from Vikings cornerback
Jimmy Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I hear them talk about him being slow, I think to
myself `if they only new,' Rich said. ``But if it works to his
advantage, I'm all for it. I guess Hitchcock was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   What Jeffers appreciated most was finally getting an
opportunity. Now he wants the dream to continue one day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing changes for me,'' Jeffers said. ``I'm going to
continue to work hard and let the rest take care of itself.''

   STORYLINES
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   How will the club stop the Saints' passing game?
</P>
<P>
   On any other week, Cowboys coaches wouldn't be concerned about
the Saints offense, ranked 23rd in passing. But this isn't any
other week. Unless a miracle happens, cornerback Deion Sanders
won't play because of a sprained left big toe. The other
cornerback, Kevin Smith, is out two to four weeks with a strained
muscle in his lower back. The club is in such dire straits that it
signed Larry Brown, its Super Bowl XXX most valuable player, to
help fill the void in the secondary. Brown may not start, but look
for him to play if Charlie Williams, Kevin Mathis and Terry Billups
struggle. Without a healthy Sanders, the Cowboys have allowed 984
yards passing and nine touchdowns through the air the last three
games.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to the Cowboys' running game?
</P>
<P>
   Against the Vikings, the Cowboys fell behind early and never
went back to the run as Emmitt Smith gained just 44 yards on 18
carries. Cowboys coach Chan Gailey blamed himself for the tepid
ground game, saying, ``I just didn't stick with it.'' Gailey will
have plenty of chances to stick to the running game today as the
Saints rank 17th in rush defense and have allowed 100 or more yards
rushing in four of the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   What can we expect from Troy Aikman?
</P>
<P>
   A whole lot. Aikman has passed for 959 yards and four touchdowns
in the last three games, leading the Cowboys to 101 points. He will
take on a Saints defense that is last against the pass, but
improved of late, holding five of their past seven opponents under
200 yards passing. Injuries to Ernie Mills (abdomen) and Jeff Ogden
(shoulder) limit Aikman's options, but he still has big-play
flanker Michael Irvin, who leads the team with 62 receptions for
868 yards, a 14-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   SAINTS
</P>
<P>
   How fired up will the Saints be?
</P>
<P>
   Caustic head coach Mike Ditka chewed out the Saints following
their 30-10 loss to the Dolphins last week, calling them a bunch of
cowards, and saying that he was, ``embarrassed for myself, for the
coaching staff, for the organization.'' Publicly, at least, the
Saints players have responded. Wide receiver Andre Hastings said,
``There's no such thing as giving up in my mind. I'd knock my mama
down to win. Now, I'll help pick her up, but I'll knock her down.''
Simply put, the Saints are desparate. After beginning the season
3-0, they have dropped seven of their last nine. They remain
mathematically alive for a playoff berth, so the Cowboys can expect
an inspired bunch for at least a half or so.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cowboys secondary banged up, who among the Saints wide
receivers could be expected to have a big game?
</P>
<P>
   Sean Dawkins is the Saints' most explosive receiver, and that's
explosive compared to rest of the talent on his team. Dawkins has
just 39 receptions for 651 yards. The other receiver, Andre
Hastings, has 25 for 271. That is 64 combined receptions from the
Saints' top two pass catchers. In comparison, the Cowboys' Michael
Irvin has 62 receptions. Still, Dawkins has shown flashes of
brilliance this season. He had five receptions for 110 yards
against the Panthers on Sept. 13, six for 102 against the Panthers
on Nov. 1, and eight for 148 against the 49ers on Nov. 22. Rookie
Cameron Cleeland is a threat with 35 receptions for 498 yards and a
team-leading four receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Saints' defense do anything to stop the Cowboys'
high-powered offense?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, but they'll try. They rank 17th against the rush,
and 30th against the pass. Last week they saw their streak of
recording a sack in 60 consecutive games end in a 30-10 loss to the
Dolphins. Even with the horrific pass defense, the Saints, oddly,
lead the NFC with 18 interceptions. Safety Sammy Knight has as many
interceptions (5) as the Cowboys' Deion Sanders. Cornerback Tyronne
Drakeford and safety Chad Cota each have four. Safety Rob Kelly
returned a Dan Marino pass 79 yards for a touchdown last week. The
Saints will need more of that to stay in it against Troy Aikman and
company.
</P>
<P>
   ONES TO STOP
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Michael Irvin
</P>
<P>
   Since his streak of games with at least one reception ended at
117, Irvin has been on a tear the past two weeks. He has 18
receptions for 235 yards. He hasn't had a touchdown in a month, but
that could change as the Saints have allowed seven in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Saints
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kerry Collins
</P>
<P>
   He is 2-0 lifetime against the Cowboys. Of course, both of those
wins came when he was with the Carolina Panthers. Since he joined
the Saints on Oct. 14, he has made three starts. He passed for 150
yards in his first start, 328 in his second, and 110 in his third.
The Cowboys will pressure him to make sure he does not continue his
roller coaster ride with a good performance today.
</P>
<P>
   THE EDGE
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys run offense vs. Saints run defense
</P>
<P>
   Edge: Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   Despite rushing for only 58 yards against the Vikings last week,
the Cowboys' ground game has been pretty consistent. They have
rushed for at least 120 yards in six of the past seven games.
Saints linebacker Mark Fields leads the club with 85 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys pass offense vs. Saints pass defense
</P>
<P>
   Edge: Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman has averaged 320 yards passing in his past three
games and continues to be one of the best in the game. His passer
rating (97.2) is fifth in the league. The Saints lead the NFC with
18 interceptions. Defensive end Joe Johnson leads the club with six
sacks, though he may not increase that total against Cowboys tackle
Larry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys run defense vs. Saints run offense
</P>
<P>
   Edge: Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have allowed just three 100-yard rushers all season,
and just one in the past eight games. The Saints' leading rusher
over the past three games is quarterback Kerry Collins, who has
outgained Lamar Smith 103 yards to 53.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys pass defense vs. Saints pass offense
</P>
<P>
   Edge: Even
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were forced to sign Larry Brown because of injuries
to Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith. Meanwhile, the pass rush has
generated just three sacks in the past two games. Kerry Collins has
one touchdown and five interceptions in three starts with the
Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   Edge: Saints
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries, the Cowboys signed Tyrone Hughes last week
for kick-return duties. But he is not the player he was for the
Saints, who have Andre Hastings returning punts. Hastings is third
in the NFC, averaging 14 yards per return.

</P>
<P>
   Edge: Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey has stayed cool during this recent rash of injuries
that threaten to undermine his club's development. New Orleans'
Mike Ditka tries to motivate with angry tirades and harsh words.

STARS SEEKING OFFENSIVE PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ After reviewing game film, Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock couldn't find many problems with his team's performance
during a 4-1 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't put the puck in the net,'' said Hitchcock, even
though his team outshot the Canucks, 37-18.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock and assistant coaches, Rick Wilson and Doug Jarvis,
dissected the film at their Edmonton hotel yesterday in preparation
for the Stars' 7 o'clock meeting tonight with the Oilers. The
verdict: The team needs to maintain its consistency of the past
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have to increase our tenacity from the red line in,
but we created plenty of good scoring chances,'' Hitchcock said.
``We simply have to be able to convert those chances and not let a
team off the hook like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who have struggled with slow starts a few times this
season, tore into the Canucks, but had nothing to show for it after
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't let a team stay in a game like that or it'll
come back to haunt you,'' said winger Pat Verbeek, who misfired on
four prime scoring opportunities. ``We should have been up two or
three to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what do the Stars do to correct the problem? They took
yesterday off from skating and did off-ice workouts, but Hitchcock
said he wasn't considering any real changes in his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With Brett Hull expected to miss another game because of a sore
groin, Hitchcock likely will use Jamie Langenbrunner on a line with
Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen. However, Hitchcock did play Verbeek
with Modano for one period Friday night when he was trying to spark
the Stars' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The second line is expected to be Verbeek, Joe Nieuwendyk and
either Dan Keczmer or rookie Jason Botterill.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hrkac will center the third line of Mike Keane and Grant
Marshall. Brian Skrudland will center Dave Reid and Guy Carbonneau
on the fourth line. Unless, of course, Hitchcock changes his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well, but we're still looking at things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the absence of Hull should not create a
significant lack of offense. The Stars played without Hull last
season and were fourth in the NHL in scoring, averaging 3.1 goals
per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can score, and we're getting plenty of great chances,''
Verbeek said. ``It starts with me. I'm not missing \Rbad\S chances,
I'm missing on great ones. ... It's frustrating the heck out of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek has one goal and two points in the past 13 games and was
one of the culprits behind the Stars having 18 shots miss the net
against the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers are not in any better shape. They're coming off a 2-1
loss Friday against struggling Tampa Bay after edging high-flying
Phoenix, 4-3, Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to set the tempo in your own building,'' Oilers coach
Ron Low said of his team's disappointing 6-6 record at Skyreach
Centre. ``The biggest \Rproblem\S right now is our best players
aren't playing like our best players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars know that feeling. If Verbeek and Modano and
Nieuwendyk and Sergei Zubov are stopped, it's difficult for the
Stars to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say there are certain players who are struggling, and
we do expect our scorers to score more,'' Hitchcock said. ``But
this is a problem we have to react to as a team. We have to be able
to convert our chances and not keep letting teams up. We have to
find ways to beat a good goalie.''

BIGGEST WINNER WILL LOSE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the LPGA Player of the Year is honored Tuesday at
a luncheon in New York, she will receive only Rookie of the Year
hardware. Which is to say that Annika Sorenstam will walk away with
what Se Ri Pak deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam had another great campaign (four wins and the money
title), one that was capped by the first-ever sub-70 season scoring
average (69.99) in LPGA Tour history, and when all the numbers from
the various categories were crunched, the Swede had finished first
based on a points system. Nice and neat, yes. Fair and accurate,
no. Pak had a better season for two very good reasons: the
McDonald's LPGA Championship and the US Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Korean won both of those majors _
unquestion-ably the most coveted championships on the tour _ and
threw in two other victories. She had a round of 61 in the Jamie
Farr Kroger Classic the week after she won the Open and finished
second on the money list. But she also made a rookie mistake and
played too much, particularly right after her draining playoff win
at the Open in July, and her major wins thrust her into a scorching
spotlight the likes of which had not been seen in women's golf
since Nancy Lopez burst upon the scene two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The attention took its toll. On a return in late October to her
native Korea, where she is a national hero, Pak collapsed with
exhaustion and spent a few days in a hospital. Two weeks later, she
concluded the LPGA season with a whimper, finishing 25th in a field
of 30 at the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But her sparkling summer had long since made its case.
Unfortunately, a numbers system is oblivious to such factors.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, easily the Tour's top rookie, will be able to hold a trophy
Tuesday, but you'll excuse her if her embrace is half-empty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk to most players who have gone through qualifying school and
they will tell you it is unbearable pressure. Then there's  &UR; Allen
Doyle &LR; , who probably wonders what the big deal is. All he did
Friday was conclude four days of sparkling play (67-70-71-67) at
Grenelefe Golf &AMP; Tennis Resort in Haines City, Fla., to take
medalist honors at the final of Senior PGA Tour Qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   His victory was no shock, considering he earned $164,918 in just
six events after turning 50 in June. But what is stunning is the
fact that he also was medalist at PGA Tour School two years ago _
when he was 48. That led to a forgettable 1997 season on the PGA
Tour, but the plan all along was to polish his game in preparation
for what is now reality: The Norwood native, one of the premier
amateur players of his generation, can challenge for a chance to
win more money in one weekend than he could earn in a year of
selling buckets of balls at his driving range in La Grange, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bob Lendzion &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former pro at Quechee, Vt., who won twice
on the European Senior Tour this past summer and has teed it up
just about anywhere the game is played, had a decent start at
Grenelefe, but closed 74-75 and missed out by nine shots. Another
on the outside looking in was  &UR; Gary McCord &LR; , who was three back and
earned conditional status for 1999. Which is OK because his day job
_ analyst for CBS golf coverage _ pays handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither  &UR; Ben Crenshaw  &LR; (3-8-1) nor  &UR; Mark James  &LR; (8-15-1) has a
sparkling record in Ryder Cup competition, but their passion for
the event cannot be matched. They will captain the US and European
teams in September's matches at The Country Club in Brookline, and
as part of the buildup they were in town recently to meet the
press. James talked about his first Ryder Cup experience, 1977,
``which came a few months after  &UR; Tom Watson  &LR; and  &UR; Jack Nicklaus
 &LR; took apart the field at Turnberry.'' (Watson beat Nicklaus in
arguably the greatest British Open ever.) James, paired with  &UR; Tommy
Horton &LR; , &UR;  &LR; was a bit stunned when he saw the draw that first day at
Royal Lytham &AMP; St. Annes: Watson and Nicklaus would provide the
opposition. ``I thought it was a mismatch,'' said James, ``but we
only lost, 7 and 6 (actually, 5 and 4). Had one of them broken his
leg we would have had a chance.'' ... Reporters, obviously glancing
at the current standings that include names like  &UR; Sven
Struver &LR; , &UR; Robert Karlsson &LR; , &UR; Andrew Coltart &LR; , &UR; Patrik Sjoland &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and
 &UR; Pierre Fulke &LR; , &UR;  &LR; asked James several times about the possibility of
having so many rookies on his team. James was more than polite,
though he could not have been blamed had he laughed. After all, the
standings represent a handful of events and there are nearly three
dozen tournaments to be contested before the Top 10 places will be
secured. Players such as  &UR; Bernhard Langer &LR; , &UR; Jose Maria
Olazabal &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Jesper Parnevik  &LR; will no doubt move up into view
soon enough ... If you would like to listen to the Crenshaw/James
media day, it is available at www.jkgolfpro.com ... Want to warm up
for the Ryder Cup? Well, the third edition of the Presidents Cup is
here. A US team led by  &UR; Tiger Woods &LR; , &UR; Mark O'Meara &LR; , &UR; David
Duval &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Davis Love  &LR; (ranked 1-2-3-4 in the world) is at Royal
Melbourne GC in Australia to take on the International Team, and if
you can adjust your schedule to the 16-hour time difference, it
should provide for better golf viewing than what the Silly Season
has been providing. ESPN will be live Thursday (4-8:30 p.m., then 9
p.m.-2 a.m.) and Friday (4-8:30 p.m.), but the CBS coverage
Saturday (1-6 p.m.) and Sunday (4-7 p.m.) will be tape delayed. The
International Team should get a boost from a nucleus of Aussies on
native soil _  &UR; Greg Norman, Steve Elkington, Craig Parry, Stuart
Appleby  &LR; _ and the presence of  &UR; Vijay Singh, Ernie Els,  &LR; and  &UR; Nick
Price  &LR; (still the world's best ball-striker) makes this a
formidable squad. But if depth means anything, the US has to be
considered a strong favorite because the dropoff to guys like  &UR; Mark
Calcavecchia, Scott Hoch, Hal Sutton,  &LR; and  &UR; John Huston  &LR; isn't
nearly as dramatic as what the International Team faces _  &UR; Greg
Turner, Shigeki Maruyama, Naomichi Ozaki,  &LR; and  &UR; Carlos Franco. &LR; 
Then again, recalling Valderrama and a certain singles win by the
supposedly overmatched  &UR; Costantino Rocca,  &LR; perhaps you can foresee
a scenario in which Franco is the hero. He certainly makes for a
great story, a 33-year-old journeyman who grew up in poverty in
Paraguay and has played mostly on the Japanese Tour. Franco is 40th
in the world rankings, ahead of  &UR; Brad Faxon, Thomas Bjorn, Paul
Azinger, Nick Faldo,  &LR; and a bunch of other guys you have heard of.
Proof that the rankings are not to be trusted, you say? Perhaps. Or
maybe Franco will prove more than worthy, as he did last month at
the final stage of PGA Tour School when he earned his card for 1999
by finishing in a tie for the 35th and final spot. If you relish
the true spirit of the game, Franco is your man _ a golfer from a
country with just a handful of courses and fewer than three dozen
professionals, a player who, in the final round of Q School, with
his livelihood at stake, started putting with his driver. No, the
putter was not broken. He told reporters he just wanted a change.

RED SOX LOSE CLARK TO BALTIMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tear up all the rejection slips accumulating on Yawkey
Way, and you'll probably have enough confetti for another Yankee
victory parade down New York's Canyon of Heroes.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Will Clark became the latest free agent to say
thanks but no thanks to the Red Sox, electing to take a two-year,
$11 million deal from the Baltimore Orioles, who apparently seized
the moment while Boston general manager Dan Duquette hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles closed the deal for Clark before the Red Sox
actually tendered an offer to the man to whom they had turned as a
potential short-term replacement for Mo Vaughn. Frank Wren, the
Orioles' new GM, placed a phone call to Clark's agent, Jeff Moorad,
as Wren was flying from Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale late Friday
night, then reportedly closed the deal from an airport rental car
counter.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had talked parameters of a deal, Moorad said, but
did not make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the process we assumed Will would end up with the Red
Sox,'' Moorad said Sunday. ``The Red Sox were clearly serious about
the player. But in the end, Frank Wren and the Orioles came on like
gangbusters and put the deal together in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' interest in Clark was sufficient enough that
Duquette had manager Jimy Williams place a call to Clark last
Monday. But Clark _ who in essence flip-flopped spots with Rafael
Palmeiro, as Palmeiro signed with Clark's former team, the Rangers
_ said he was impressed by a call from Orioles manager Ray Miller
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray made it apparent that the Orioles wanted me,'' said Clark.
``When you feel wanted, it makes you feel better about yourself and
it makes you play better.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Williams didn't make him feel wanted, too, but
the Orioles followed up their phone call with an offer and the Sox
did not.
</P>
<P>
   The list of free agents courted by the Sox who decided to go
elsewhere began with Albert Belle, peaked with Bernie Williams, and
includes Palmeiro, Clark, and Robin Ventura. And that doesn't count
their own free agent defection, Mo Vaughn, whose six-year, $80
million contract still remains the high-water mark for signings
this winter, with an average annual value of $13.3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   There are slim pickings left in the free agent market, which
leaves Duquette little choice but to upgrade the team through
trades, a process that is expected to accelerate Friday, when
baseball's winter meetings begin in Nashville. Expos outfielder
Rondell White, Marlins first baseman Clifford Floyd, and Dodgers
outfielder Raul Mondesi could be among the players targeted by
Duquette, and the club also intends to explore its long shot
options in Roger Clemens trade talks with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, meanwhile, have lost All-Star Palmeiro, All-Star
second baseman Roberto Alomar, outfielder Eric Davis, and reliever
Armando Benitez, but have done a dramatic makeover of their team by
adding Belle, Clark, second baseman Delino DeShields, and reliever
Mike Timlin through free agency, while acquiring catcher Charles
Johnson in a three-way trade with the Mets and Dodgers. They also
retained outfielder B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   They've committed a projected $124 million to those six players
alone, and by all accounts, they're not done yet. The Orioles are
considered one of the leading candidates to sign righthander Kevin
Brown, the prize among this year's class of free agent pitchers.
Brown could cost as much as $14 million a year for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to change the tide, the intensity, and the way
the guys here approach the game,'' Wren said. ``I don't think
there's a better guy in terms of the way he approaches the game
than Will Clark. And that doesn't even touch on his hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark nearly came to Baltimore five years ago, but the Orioles
chose Palmeiro and Clark signed with the Rangers. Now, as he nears
35, he gets his chance to play for the home team in Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   He received a $1 million signing bonus and will be paid $4.5
million in 1999 and $5.5 million in 2000. He can make an additional
$900,000 a year by meeting games-played clauses, and has additional
performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has been a terrific hitter at Fenway Park, batting .438,
his best average in any ballpark. But Sunday, he took an apparent
shot at the quality of the Fenway Park infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a place to play defense,'' he said, ``Baltimore is way
above Boston.''

ASU'S WHITE-COLLAR LYNCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was an angry mob outside calling for blood, so the men in
suits (with patches on the elbows) dragged out convicted murderer
James Hamm and hanged him from their ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   Only a day after Hamm had been hired to teach criminal justice
courses at Arizona State, officials at the school decided that
``reassigning Mr. Hamm to non-teaching duties is in the best
interest of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you were one of the people who called ASU, demanding
Hamm's head on a platter. Maybe you're a truck driver or an
electrician, a small businessman or secretary or construction
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you didn't notice, but at the same time ASU's elite were
lynching Hamm, they were spitting in your face.
</P>
<P>
   And mine.
</P>
<P>
   James Hamm wasn't run out of the university for being a killer.
He was run out for being uppity.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to become a ``professional,'' and the suits would have
none of it. A guy like Hamm, they say, should only work in a
``non-teaching'' position.
</P>
<P>
   My father and grandfathers were in non-teaching positions. They
were steelworkers. All my uncles worked in the mills. So did I, the
summers I was in college.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching at a university is no more honorable than working in a
mill.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching has no more dignity.
</P>
<P>
   If it's OK for a one-time killer to work in a mill, or cut
grass, or fix a pipe, it should be OK to teach at a university. If
not, you insult every working stiff out there. &QL; 
`QUESTION OF PREJUDICE'
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there is a class question here,'' Hamm told me
Friday. ``But there's also a question of prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   James Hamm admits his crime. He expresses remorse. He served 17
years in the state prison, and has graduated from college and the
ASU Law School. He is both a convicted murderer and an educated
man. Now that he's served his time, he wants to work.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are willing to let him have a job, it seems, but only
as long as he doesn't get to wear a suit.
</P>
<P>
   There's no other reason.
</P>
<P>
   We exclude ex-cons from some jobs for safety reasons. That isn't
a problem here. ASU officials admit it. The students Hamm would
have taught are older, more savvy, more able to challenge him.
Besides, he's never tried to hide his past. He couldn't if he
wanted to, and he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   All he wants to do is work, and we're saying no. At least, we're
saying he can't work in an area where he has some ability. We'd
prefer he did ``unskilled'' work.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning less desirable. Meaning less valuable. Meaning less
dignified. Meaning this isn't an ethics problem or morality
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pedigree problem.
</P>
<P>
   Either a man with a background like James Hamm deserves to work
or he doesn't. If we limit the types of jobs he can get for reasons
other than qualifications of safety concerns, it isn't the ex-con
who's being put down.
</P>
<P>
   It's us. &QL; 
HE ACCEPTS IT
</P>
<P>
   Hamm told me he understands and expects people to become
emotionally involved in anything he tries to do. He accepts it.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I still would like to be a professor. And I'm still
disappointed and still hurt at what they've done. But there is a
sense in which you say, let's take what we've got and let's make
something meaningful to other people. I want to come out of this
feeling like this wasn't a lose-lose situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids in the classes Hamm was to teach have learned more
about justice from the way Hamm was treated than from anything he
could have taught them.
</P>
<P>
   They've also learned that running a university is a highly
specialized profession, requiring advanced degrees in both
scaredy-cat and backsliding.
</P>
<P>
   And they've learned that ``class'' is something into which
students are divided. And something into which professions are
divided. And something which the people who do the dividing don't
often possess. &QL;

AIR FORCE RALLIES LATE TO CORRAL WAC TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Air Force was a sleeping giant for most of
yesterday's Western Athletic Conference Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons, ranked 13th in The Associated Press poll,
awakened late in the fourth quarter, scoring two touchdowns and
defeating Brigham Young, 20-13, before a crowd of 32,745 at Sam
Boyd Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With his team trailing 13-7, Air Force senior quarterback Blane
Morgan connected with Matt Farmer on a 59-yard touchdown pass play
with 3:49 remaining in the game for what proved to be the winning
score.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer ran untouched down the left sideline for the touchdown,
and Air Force took a 14-13 lead. The Falcons added another
touchdown with 1:43 left when fullback Spanky Gilliam dashed 29
yards for a touchdow. The extra-point attempt was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force moves to 11-1 and will close the season at the Aloha
Bowl. The Falcons' only loss this year was a 35-34 setback at the
hands of TCU. BYU dropped to 9-4 and will play in the Liberty Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The WAC title was the first for Air Force, which shared the
league championship in 1985 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys never gave up,'' Falcons coach Fisher DeBerry said.
``It was a gutsy performance. Blane \RMorgan\S did a great job of
making the plays. He's a winner and a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan scored Air Force's first touchdown on a 2-yard run midway
through the third quarter, capping a five-play, 73-yard drive to
tie the game 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the fourth quarter, after BYU's Owen Pochman had kicked
two field goals to give the Cougars a 13-7 lead, Morgan connected
with Farmer for the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-11 from the Air Force 41, Morgan threw to Farmer,
who was standing along the line of scrimmage. After making the
catch, Farmer quickly slipped around a defender and sprinted to the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I got the ball off to Farmer, he'd be off to the
races,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown gave Air Force a 14-13 lead with 3:49 left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force stopped BYU on the next possession and took over at
the Cougars' 42. Four plays later, Gilliam dashed for the 29-yard
TD run. Brigham Young still had hope when it blocked the extra
point, leaving the score at 20-13 with 1:43 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   BYU picked up one first down, but Air Force held again and took
possession with 27 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars took a 7-0 lead with 1:01 left in the first half
when quarterback Kevin Feterik passed to Mike Rigell for a 13-yard
TD.
</P>
<P>
   BYU missed three opportunities to score in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The first came late in the first quarter when the Cougars drove
46 yards to the Air Force 20, but Pochman's 37-yard field-goal
attempt hit the left upright. The second came early in the second
quarter after the Cougars had driven 63 yards to the Air Force 25.
But Feterik's pass was tipped and intercepted by C.J. Zonotti. The
third was late in the second quarter after BYU had driven 65 yards,
where Aaron Roderick dropped a pass in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   BYU's first-half touchdown was set up when Rob Morris recovered
a fumble by Matt Rillos at the Air Force 24 with 1:44 remaining in
the second quarter. Three plays later, Feterik connected with
Ridell for a 13-yard TD pass.

IS REHABILITATION FOR RELEASED KILLERS POSSIBLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He murdered a man in Phoenix nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like James Hamm, he paid his official debt to society, doing 13
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the man who asks to be called only Bobby _ for fear of
losing his mortgage finance job _ wonders whether he'll ever get a
break in the world beyond bars.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby took real-estate courses but was laughed at when he
inquired about a broker's license. He inquired about becoming a
licensed contractor and was told not to bother.
</P>
<P>
   He took insurance classes and scored high on tests, only to be
denied a license by the state.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal was denied also, based on ``insufficient
rehabilitation time.''
</P>
<P>
   But is rehabilitation possible _ at least in terms of anything
beyond menial, low-paying employment _ for the approximately 150
killers and 12,000 total inmates released annually from the state's
prisons?
</P>
<P>
   Have Arizonans struck a reasonable balance between the clashing
demands of social vengeance and individual redemption?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions burned up the talk-radio airwaves and the
telephone lines at Arizona State University on Thursday after it
was revealed that the School of Justice Studies had hired Hamm as
an adjunct professor to teach two law courses next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the uproar, ASU officials reversed themselves
Thursday and said that Hamm would be reassigned to another area in
which he would not be teaching students.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was paroled after serving 17 years for the murder of
Willard Morley near Tucson after a drug deal that went bad. In his
latter years of incarceration, Hamm was described as a model
inmate, and earned an undergraduate degree from Northern Arizona
University.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his release, Hamm raised another furor by being
admitted to ASU's Law School, from which he graduated. He failed
his first attempt at the state Bar, which had caused further
protests simply because he was allowed to take it.
</P>
<P>
   James Jones, a retired state purchasing agent, said Friday that
he understands the groundswell of anger directed toward Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Society shouldn't have to worry about rehabilitation, Jones
said:
</P>
<P>
   You kill? You die.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have paid with his life,'' Jones said. ``At the
least, he should have been put to hard labor like they did at the
Yuma Territorial Prison. It just sickens me that the same law
school my boy attended admitted him, and the school turns around
later and hires him.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gallup, a former Phoenix police sergeant, also questioned
why Hamm was released from prison. Released killers should be
treated as pariahs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way a killer should be let out of prison is if they
have a terminal illness so they can die with dignity,'' Gallup
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a murderer is treated as anything more than a cancer in the
community, we've got our values at a cross purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   But rehabilitation and acceptance by the community is society's
only sane course of action, said Larry Hammond, a Phoenix defense
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond advocates a carrot-and-stick approach to ensure good
conduct on the part of parolees and to try to integrate them back
into society. The final step would be giving the inmate back all
the rights of other citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not wise to have a flat rule like the stripping of all
rights,'' Hammond said. ``It should be a system on post-release
restrictions like OK, you do well for a year or two and here's your
right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, if the progress continues, here's your passport. You
continue to do well, you have the right to run for public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond said ASU missed the perfect opportunity for having Hamm
become a role model for other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Sarahlyn Bristow, a Baptist minister who is chaplain at Estrella
Jail, said there are even more compelling reasons spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we confess all our sins, we are forgiven. If they do
their time and they are repentant, they should be welcomed back
into society,'' Bristow said. ``If God forgives me, how can I judge
someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   But Juanita Soto Ayers, former director of counseling at the
Arizona State Prison-Florence, said it's a pipe dream to think that
more than one in 50 prisoners can really be rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can find equally intelligent and hard-working people to
become college instructors who are not killers,'' Ayers said.
``Maybe he should write a book or make speeches about his
experience in prison. But he shouldn't be allowed to teach
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Most students interviewed on the ASU campus said they would
welcome Hamm in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Pearman, a freshman, said, ``He knows a lot about the
legal system _ a whole lot more than most people would want to
know. He served his time. He's done. He's fine. I don't have a
problem with him teaching here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Wolf, another freshman, said she also could have learned
something from Hamm although, ``I wouldn't want to spend a lot of
time with him outside class. Office hours would be a bit of a
question.''
</P>
<P>
   DeAnza Valencia, a master's candidate in the School of Justice
Studies, said students will miss out on an unusual perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone cries about the universities being an ivory tower, so
when we finally get a chance for some real-world experience, it
gets taken away,'' Valencia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the students really thought there would be a
lot to learn from Mr. Hamm. But the university gave in. I think the
larger political context is that people really don't believe in
rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   And one Valley man, who served 16 years for murder before being
released and earning a bachelor's and master's degree from ASU,
said the lack of opportunity takes its toll.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who is raising two small daughters alone and facing
bankruptcy, said he has been denied jobs at large social-service
organizations. Instead, he said, he's been relegated to low-end
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give it one more chance and go for a Ph.D. at
ASU,'' he said. ``But in the long run, I'm probably going to have
to leave America.'' &QL;

UMASS KEEPS IT GOING

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ After the final seconds ticked off the clock,
the throng stormed the field and approached the goalpost in the
south end zone, only to be thwarted by law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't seem to bother these University of Massachusetts
football fans, though. They simply ran down the field en masse,
ignoring pleas from the public address announcer, and attacked the
north goalpost like an army of ants closing in on a side of beef.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the celebration: The Minutemen had just made the
1998 season arguably the most successful in school history,
defeating unbeaten Lehigh, 27-21, to advance to the NCAA Division
1-AA semifinals for only the second time, and becoming the first
team in school history to win 10 games overall and two playoff
games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at McGuirk Alumni Stadium wanted to be part of this
home finale. (However, junior Joshua Dubreuil got a little too
involved, as he was struck on the head when the goalpost came down.
He was taken to Cooley-Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, where he
was treated for lacerations and released.)
</P>
<P>
   The UMass players were mobbed on the field during the postgame
handshakes following the first home playoff win in school history.
Miniature cannons fired deafening blasts. The school band blared
the fight song. And a goalpost was sacrificed. Support for the
football team has returned to UMass with a vengeance. And the
season isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four teams still playing 1-AA football, and we're
one of them,'' said UMass coach Mark Whipple, who took over a
program that last year had suffered its worst season this century
(2-9) and boldly declared that in 1998 he would field a unit
capable of winning a national championship. Now he's just two wins
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great, great day for the UMass team, our seniors,
and the university,'' said Whipple, whose 10-3 team now goes on the
road to Natchitoches, La., to meet Northwestern State, a 31-20
winner over Appalachian State Saturday. UMass has already beaten
one team from Louisiana in the playoffs, McNeese State, in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big game, and big players stepped up and made the
big plays,'' said Whipple. ``You have to give credit to the kids.
They believed that they could win, and as coaches we believe in
them. We made a couple more big plays than they did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit running back Marcel Shipp, who had sat out the
first-round game because of a knee injury. He gained 159 yards on
36 carries, including a 1-yard touchdown run with 11:17 left that
put the Minutemen ahead, 27-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way I wasn't going to play today,'' said Shipp,
who became the first player in UMass history to rush for 2,000
yards in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Another standout on the offense was quarterback Todd Bankhead,
who completed 22 of 36 passes for 270 yards and two touchdowns, the
second of which was a 37-yarder to wide receiver Adrian Zullo with
1:34 left in the third period that turned a 14-13 halftime deficit
into a 20-14 lead. Bankhead's other scoring pass went 30 yards to
Jimmy Moore, who caught eight passes for 117 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But it was defense that secured the victory. The Minutemen were
burned badly in the first 1:01 of play, when Lehigh (12-1) scored
on Ron Jean's 8-yard run, which capped a five-play, 76-yard drive.
Lehigh struck again with 2:45 left in the half, capitalizing on a
Bankhead interception to score on a 1-yard run by Jean, capping a
five-play, 53-yard drive, to make it 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   After UMass had built its 27-14 lead, Lehigh cut the deficit to
6 with 7:11 left on a 1-yard run by quarterback Phil Stambaugh.
Then Lehigh stalled two UMass drives, getting the ball the final
time with 2:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh, which had beaten Richmond on a field goal with three
seconds left in its first-round game last weekend, moved to the
9-yard line with 2:01 left, and things looked bleak for the
Minutemen.
</P>
<P>
   But defensive end Chris Price sacked Stambaugh on second and
goal from the 9, moving the ball back to the 16 with 1:16 left. On
third down, Stambaugh threw incomplete to Deron Braswell in the
left corner of the end zone, with defensive back Mike Smith
covering tightly.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:08 left, UMass called a timeout before the fourth-down
play. Whipple huddled up his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just told them to finish,'' he said. ```You've got one
play, and you just have to finish.'''
</P>
<P>
   That they did. Stambaugh threw to almost the same spot, to Joe
Falcone, with Smith covering again. The receiver couldn't get two
hands on the ball, and it fell to the ground incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me before the game what position I would have
wanted in the fourth quarter, it would have been exactly how it
turned out,'' said Lehigh coach Kevin Higgins, whose team gave up
the most points it has allowed all season. ``We had an opportunity
to win at the end. We just didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That left the home team _ and fans _ to celebrate the final game
of the year at McGuirk Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited to be one of four,'' said Whipple. ``Anything
can happen in any game, and if we're lucky enough to play two more,
it probably will.''

BANKHEAD GEARED UP IN CLUTCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ There were times when he couldn't move the
team, when he couldn't complete a pass, when, it seemed, his mind
was elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the times when he took charge, when just about
every pass he threw was on target, when he was totally involved.
</P>
<P>
   When UMass needed quarterback Todd Bankhead most, however, he
was there.
</P>
<P>
   That was never more evident than on a pair of second-half
touchdown drives, when Bankhead moved the Minutemen 80 and 59 yards
to turn a 14-13 halftime deficit into a 27-14 lead. The Minutemen
then hung on for a 27-21 win over unbeaten Lehigh, keeping alive
their hopes of an NCAA Division 1-AA championship.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the final stats will show that Bankhead completed 22
of 36 passes for 270 yards and two touchdowns. Eight of those
completions, good for 117 yards, and one of those TD passes went to
wide receiver Jimmy Moore. Bankhead also had two passes
intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   It was a performance that did not leave the quarterback overly
elated, but one he definitely won't discard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we can win and still have a shot at winning the
championship, I'm pleased,'' said the 6-foot-3-inch, 207-pound
junior from Escondido, Calif. ``My job is to go out there and play
as well as I can and give the team a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback position calls for consistency and to make
things happen and to make the plays when he has to,'' said
Bankhead. ``When I do that, we move the ball; and when I don't, we
don't move the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass moved the ball sporadically in the first half and trailed
at the break, 14-13. But on back-to-back possessions _ the last of
the third quarter and first of the fourth quarter _ Bankhead drove
the Minutemen to the end zone with clocklike precision.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive that put UMass ahead, 20-14, he clicked on 4 of 5
passes, two of them on third downs, before hooking up with Adrian
Zullo on a 37-yard scoring strike. And on the drive that boosted
the lead to 27-14, he completed two big third-down passes to set up
Marcel Shipp's plunge from the 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to do my job, keep the ball on the ground
when I could, and eat up some clock at that point,'' said Bankhead.
``My first half was just so-so, but things picked up after that.''
</P>
<P>
   A big plus for the Minutemen was the return of Shipp, who had
sat out last week's first-round win over McNeese State with a knee
injury. He practiced sparingly during the week but knew that when
Saturday's gun sounded, he'd be in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp responded to the challenge by gaining 159 yards on 36
carries. One of those rushes _ a 5-yard gain off right tackle in
the first quarter _ pushed him over the 2,000-yard mark for the
season, making him the first player in UMass history to accomplish
that feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was playing this game regardless,'' said Shipp. ``I
had to. You weren't going to keep me out of a game like this. The
knee held up pretty well during the game. It got a little tight on
me at the end, but it will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipp said reaching 2,000 yards meant a lot to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great achievement,'' he said. ``That's something I've
always wanted to do, and this season I accomplished it. I'm proud
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shipp will be a lot prouder, he said, if he and his
teammates can continue this storybook march.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence level on this team has built throughout the
year, and we've been playing just well enough to win,'' he said.
``I don't think we've played our best game yet. Hopefully that's
still ahead.''

IMPEACHMENT DARKENS WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
WASHINGTON _ As they al ways do this time of year, members of
Congress and their spouses will assemble at the White House on
Monday evening for the annual Christmas ball with the first family.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a season of ornate decora tions, of giving and sharing . .
. and impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of wretched timing, it seems this year's grand White
House holiday party falls the very same week as the House Judiciary
Committee's scheduled vote on whether to approve articles of im
peachment against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some Congress members, who are accustomed to smiling through
strained social situations, say this would simply be too much to
bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone would have to con vince me that it wouldn't be too
uncomfortable, and I don't think they can,'' said Rep. John
Shadegg, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg plans to stay home, and says a small group of his GOP
colleagues will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   At least a few congressional wives are forbidding their husbands
from going. A Democratic senator, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confided that he won't attend be cause his wife said she
wouldn't shake Clinton's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it never considered canceling the ball. It
dutifully decorated its official tree, an 18-foot balsam fir from
Wisconsin. It mailed out the invita tions: ``The President and Mrs.
Clinton request the pleasure of your company at a Congressional
holiday ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And at 7 p.m., the White House will open its doors to many of
the very same members of Congress who are trying to cook the
president like a Christmas goose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypocrisy makes the world go round, and it's clearly the jet
fuel in politics,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia
political sci entist. ``I would think this particular audience
could manage to denounce the president on the floor of the Senate
or House, and 10 minutes later show up in a receiving line with the
president and first lady. There's something to be said for
separating social affairs and public affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year is like few others. The rancor is high, even by
Wash ington standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington has rarely been as nasty and partisan, and hosts
and hostesses have to be much more careful about the mix at
parties,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hillary Rodham Clin ton declared, ``It's a little
hard to get into the Christmas spirit.'' She was referring to the
unusually warm weather. But she could just as well have been
talking about the atmos phere on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   This is a year when a member of the president's own party _ Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., _ said Clinton showed he was ``immoral'' by
having an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewin sky
and then deceiving the nation about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were it my daughter . . . I would be looking for the man. I'd
be looking to give him a straight right,'' Biden said in a recent
speech.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly the stuff of ``Ho, Ho, Ho.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden is not planning to attend the ball, said his
communications director, Chris Madison. He said the event poses a
scheduling problem, since Biden commutes home each night to
Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the White House said it was expecting the usual amount of
attendees for the ball _ about 1,000. All 535 members of Con gress
have been invited, and each may bring a guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about Christmas this year at the White
House, as we are every year. We're doing as many events, I think,
as we have done in the past,'' White House spokesman Roger Salazar
said. The lineup includes a recep tion for journalists and their
fami lies on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Told that some invitees may stay away, Salazar replied, ``For
every one of those, we could come up with examples of folks who are
seeking the invitations. We don't have attendance problems
tradition ally, and I don't think we will this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the partygoers, espe cially the Republicans, are quick
to note that their attendance won't be an endorsement of the chief
execu tive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still admire the office of the president,'' said Rep. Matt
Salmon, R-Ariz. ``I may have some prob lems with the traits of this
president, but I still admire the office, and I still believe that
the White House is the people's house. You bet I'm going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salmon has already taken some flak for his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spouse of a member of Congress gave me a really hard time
because I am going,'' he said. ``She said, `How in the world could
you stand in the same room with that man?' '' &QL;

KANSAS BEATS COLD-SHOOTING PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ When Pepperdine arrived home it could have wandered
off campus, headed toward the beach and somehow wound up in Asia
without getting wet _ all without hitting the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of shooting day.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine, searching for any kind of national recognition, was
an anemic 1 of 14 from 3-point range. That, more than anything,
allowed No.7 Kansas to escape the Wooden Classic with a 62-55 win
Saturday at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Senior point guard Jelani Gardner scored a game-high 16 points,
but joined the Waves' outside ineptitude by missing both of his
3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Tommie Prince, the Waves' top long-range shooter
entering the game, was held scoreless for only the second time in
his Pepperdine career. He missed six shots and was 0 of 5 from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit some of those (3-point) shots, we probably win,''
Gardner said. ``We played hard but basically we're not good enough
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The outside struggles are the opposite of what the Waves
experienced during the exhibition season, but they mirror what has
taken place since.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine hit 50 percent of its 3-pointers in two exhibition
games, and coach Lorenzo Romar said the shots charted during
practice were the same. However, the Waves are 29 of 107 on
3-pointers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a big opportunity to get recognized and to show
people we can beat the big-name teams,'' Prince said. ``But 1 for
14, man, that's something. If we could have hit a few we could have
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas (5-1) did very little to distinguish itself as one of the
nation's elite teams, other than keep alive a streak of not losing
back-to-back games that dates back nearly five years. The Jayhawks
were coming off an 18-point loss to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Gregory led the Jayhawks with 13 points. Ryan Robertson
added 12 and Eric Chenowith chipped in 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Oklahoma State coach) Eddie Sutton said it best when he
grabbed me and I said how ugly it was and how hard both teams
played,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams said. ``He said forget all
about it. It's a `W.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The one problem we had is we haven't lost very often. It's a
good problem to have, but when you do lose then I think the kids
get a little more tentative and think something's wrong. The
tentativeness showed up on the court, especially in the first
half.''
</P>
<P>
   What was certain to bother the Waves as they fought their way
through the evening traffic on their way back to Malibu was the
missed opportunity for a program starving for attention outside Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas may be in the top 10, but the Jayhawks are still fumbling
around offensively and committing way too many turnovers. Couple
that with a spirited defensive effort from Pepperdine and the
seven-point loss becomes unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves held Kansas scoreless for a span of 7:01, bridging the
halves, but scored only nine points and had a 28-26 lead with 18
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got good shots, shots we talk about in practice and that we
want, and at times weren't able to knock them down,'' Romar said.
``If we made a couple shots there we could have spread the gap and
been up. I told our guys at halftime that we were three or four
made shots from being in control of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team had a double-digit lead, and it wasn't until a 7-0
spurt late, keyed by strong inside play, gave Kansas a 56-47 lead
with 4:45 to play. The Waves closed within 56-53 with two minutes
remaining, but Chenowith hit a six-footer along the baseline to
extend Kansas' lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's effort to pull within a possession failed when
Prince, who had an in-grown toenail removed earlier in the day,
symbolized the afternoon by missing two uncontested 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not getting shots then we're going to do something
about that,'' Romar said. ``But we're just not making wide-open
shots. All we can do is go back and shoot as many as we can
shoot.''

YOUTHFUL PROBLEMS NEARLY DERAIL UA  
 BUT WILDCATS RALLY TO BEAT WYOMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The good news for 13th-ranked Arizona is that three
players had career scoring highs Saturday in a 94-84 dash past
Wyoming at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is they had to.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th ranked Wildcats (4-0), who have four non-conference
games left to straighten out their youthful woes before opening
defense of their Pac-10 title, had all of their shortcomings
exposed in a strong effort by the Cowboys (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to continue to be a struggle, I'm afraid, for a
while,'' said UA Coach Lute Olson. ``But the ability is there.''
</P>
<P>
   In transition, the Wildcats didn't get back and were burned for
easy layups.
</P>
<P>
   In half-court defense, UA didn't find Wyoming's outside shooters
quickly enough, allowing the Cowboys to open a quick nine-point
lead with torrid three-point shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, with three true freshmen in the lineup, was
discombobulated offensively, the youngsters firing away and hitting
little. Very little. The two freshman shooting guards, starter
Traves Wilson and backup Ruben Douglas , shot a combined 0 for 9
and had six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   That's likely going to cause yet another freshman, Richard
Jefferson, a Moon Valley High product, to be moved to shooting
guard with Justin Wessel stepping into Jefferson's small forward
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like we have to take a look at whether those
are the two guys we are going to go with,'' Olson said. ``We've
been waiting for one of our shooting guards to surface, and neither
has. Richard and Justin are the ones making things happen. They
deserve the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was bailed out by senior point guard Jason Terry's
career-high 29 points (plus seven assists and four steals), senior
center A.J. Bramlett's career- high 24 points (plus 17 rebounds,
four steals, and two blocked shots), and Wessel's career-high 15
points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson made only three of 11 shots for 7 points but he added
six rebounds and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-2 tear by the Wildcats midway through the closing half,
sparked by Bramlett's outlets to Terry, who pulled up for three
pointers or found Wessel running on the wing, took UA from nine
points down to 13 up in 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Wildcats survived seven missed free throws in the
closing 4:54.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we proved to ourselves a little bit that we can play
with anybody in the country,'' said Cowboys first-year Coach Steve
McClain.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made the point a little too clearly for the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scouting report said they were good shooters,'' Terry
said. ``The whole thing with this team is defense. If we don't play
it in the first half, it's going to be close. The older guys know
that, but maybe the young guys have to experience it to know it.
That's what these non-conference games are about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett, at 6-10 the tallest man on the floor, acknowledged
that as big as his numbers were, they could have been even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to try to get every rebound because that's what
sparks runs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett, who missed several shots from point-blank, said the
unexpected emergence of Wessel, a sophomore who has been in the
program for three years, has been critical to the Wildcats' early
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin really came up big,'' Bramlett said. ``He's got the
skills. Defense is the only thing that has kept him out of big-time
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wessel, who made six of seven shots, played 29 minutes, in part
because starting power forward Eugene Edgerson was suspended for
the game for throwing a flagrant elbow in the Brigham Young game
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene wasn't there, and if he had been the start might have
been different because he is a physical, intense player ,'' Wessel
said. ``We feed off him. Without him, it was like we were playing
in slow-motion at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have freshman starters, but I've been in the program longer
and I'm more comfortable at this point. The coaches told me that
I'd have a lot of chances like this to come in, and to be ready to
step up.'' &QL;

PHOENIX AREA HOMEOWNERS SAVOR SOARING MARKET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Valley's hot home market hit inferno status this year, as
buyers snatched up houses at scorching speed even as prices roared
upward.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers smiled, buyers paced, and real estate analysts gasped as
the frenzy was documented in hard, cold facts:
</P>
<P>
   More than 90,000 new and existing homes in metro Phoenix will
sell this year, setting an all-time record.
</P>
<P>
   The average time a home is listed before being snared by an
eager buyer has fallen to just 21 days in some areas, a record low
for the 1990s. In some popular areas, bids are being offered
minutes after a house is put up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   There is little or no difference between what sellers are asking
and what buyers are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The value of more than half the homes in the Valley has
increased by at least 25 percent since 1994, making many homes that
were worth $100,000 five years ago worth at least $125,000 now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are good,'' said Scott Jarson, a agent with Realty Execu
tives. ``Homes are being snatched up hours or even minutes after a
sign goes up or they get listed on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbi Contana found out just how good times are when she and her
husband recently offered their north-central Phoenix home for sale.
Competing bids by prospective buy ers pushed the sale price $8,000
above their list price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea how in demand our home was,'' she said. ``If we
had the time, we probably could have gotten even more.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Contanas had it easy selling their home, the Lillises
found it tough buying a home in the area they wanted when they
moved back to Phoenix from Chicago earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   They knew exactly where they wanted to buy _ the Arcadia
district with its close-knit neighbor hoods, sprawling ranch homes,
good schools and lovely stands of orange trees. But what they
didn't know was what it would cost them. Big.
</P>
<P>
   The Lillises and their three daughters had lived in Arcadia in
east Phoenix for six years before moving to the Midwest in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In those six years, the increase in the value of their home was
some thing every homeowner dreams of: The Lillises sold theirs for
$150,000 more than they had paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   But just a year later they had to pay $50,000 more than they
sold their former Arcadia home for to get back into the
neighborhood _ in a smaller home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bowled over by how much more it cost us to move back
into the neighborhood _ and for less space,'' Lynn Lillis said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Arcadia area is so desirable that they felt lucky to
get into the house. And that happened only because a friend tipped
them that someone was selling; they were able to put an offer on
the home before it was officially on the market.
</P>
<P>
   That tells the story of the Valley's real estate market. It will
cost you to get a prime home, and you'll have to hustle. And if you
already own one, you can move it fast and make a hefty profit if
it's priced right.
</P>
<P>
   Like any fire, though, the Valley's home market won't burn
forever. Analysts already are predicting a slowdown for next year.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, sellers are still basking in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, the value of most existing homes has
bal looned in value, jumping more than 50 percent in areas such as
Arcadia, Paradise Valley, downtown Phoe nix's historic districts,
north-central Phoenix, southwest Phoenix, east Scottsdale and
Apache Junc tion/Gold Canyon, an emerging area.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many new homes in growing suburbs like
Ahwatukee in the southeast Valley and Arrowhead Ranch in Glendale
are being pounced upon almost before the paint dries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just won't seem to quit,`` said R.L. Brown, a local home
building analyst. ``The Phoenix housing market has exceeded all
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, homes are selling days or even hours after they
hit the market, and prices often trump sellers' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Contanas had seen some of their north-central Phoenix neigh
bors selling. They thought it might be a good time to make some
money on their three-bedroom house so they could move into a bigger
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to sell it fast so we listed it at $190,000,'' Bobbi
Con tana said. ``Our Realtor thought we might be able to get a
little more, but we had already found another house we wanted.``
</P>
<P>
   The Contanas scheduled an open house for the next day. More than
a dozen people were waiting in their driveway before they opened
their front door.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of selling for $190,000, they got $198,000 be cause
buyers started outbidding each other for the home near Squaw Peak.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder. The Contanas' former home is in the 85016 ZIP
code, where home prices have increased nearly 44 percent since
1994. Add to that the fact that more than 2,200 of the houses in
the ZIP code have changed hands at least once since 1994, and you
have one sizzling area.
</P>
<P>
   The speed their home sold also was not unusual in this market.
</P>
<P>
   The average time that priced-right homes stay on the market has
fallen to three weeks in some popular Valley communities, a
fraction of the time it took to sell houses in the early 1990s,
when ``For sale'' signs languished for an average of nine months in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the homes that are spending the least time on the
market are in northeast Scottsdale, central Phoenix historic
districts, Arcadia, Paradise Valley, Ahwatukee and Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Ray Levin, a real estate agent with Keller
Williams, was putting up a sign for a Sunday open house in
northeast Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The home near Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard and the Thomp son
Peak Parkway had gone on the market the day before. It was priced
at $215,000 in an area where more than 45 percent of the area's
homes have sold at least once since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Levin barely got the sign up before he had to add ``Sold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple followed me into the house and made an offer less
than an hour later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a testament to the vibrancy of the market, this year new and
existing home sales will break all records with a total of at least
90,000 transactions across the Val ley.
</P>
<P>
   And the average spread between what sellers want and buyers are
willing to pay has closed to less than 1 percent, agents say.
</P>
<P>
   Resale numbers skyrocketed in some Valley communities like east
Mesa, Apache Junction, Arrowhead, Arcadia, northeast Scottsdale,
Para dise Valley, central Phoenix and historic neighborhoods like
Encanto and Willo, all of which could be considered among top hot
spots for home values and number of sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the 85018 ZIP code where Arcadia is located and the Lillises
bought, nearly 30 percent of the homes have changed hands in the
past five years. And these days it doesn't take long to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good home in Arcadia is typically on the market about six
minutes before it gets snatched up,'' said Bruce Wiskirchen, an
agent with Realty Executives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Valley homes are hot because thousands of home-hungry people
are rushing to Arizona to live in metropolitan Phoenix. Maricopa
County led the nation for population growth last year, and from
1990 to 1997, almost 600,000 people poured into the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a robust job market is gushing the cash that home buyers
need to bid up prices.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, interest rates have plunged to mouth-watering
lows well below 7 percent, offering buyers some of the best
mortgage deals they've seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix isn't alone in the trend. Other cities such as Atlanta,
Las Vegas, San Diego and Los Angeles are all brimming with buyers
will ing to pay more because they have money to spend and wanting
more house because of low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and the next several years will be looked upon as the
golden years,'' National Association of Re altors economist John
Tuccillo said. ``Mortgage rates and unemployment are low, consumer
confidence and spending are high.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix is a striking example of a place offering attractive
lairs that are still relatively affordable for people on the move.
</P>
<P>
   The area's median existing home price is $115,000, far below
most of those other cities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Atlanta is the closest, at just above $115,000. But the typical
price for an existing home is $125,000 in Las Vegas, $176,000 in
Los Angeles and $192,000 for San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the Phoenix home market is broad-based. Since
1993, more than half the ZIP codes in the Valley have shown jumps
in home prices of more than 25 percent. That's not bad, since
inflation rose only 13 percent during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some Valley homes are more appealing than others,
either because they are in top-ranked school districts or come with
the most square footage and ameni ties for the lowest price. Those
are the two top priorities for the average metro Phoenix home
shopper, real estate agents say.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Valley's prime homes can be found in neighbor hoods
offering easy access to free ways and nestled up against bustling
business corridors and thriving shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   But the the mix of attractions may vary from hot spot to hot
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ambience, a whiff of class and mansions with breathtaking views
draw buyers to Paradise Valley. Northeast Scottsdale and the Arca
dia district pull home seekers with their good schools, big lots
and upscale lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Central Phoenix's historical dis tricts attract people who work
down town and have grown tired of long commutes and cookie-cutter
homes. Tempe boasts solid schools, big yards and quick freeway
access.
</P>
<P>
   Some west Valley areas beckon because you can still get a big
home there for less than $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One west Valley couple, Jim and Theresa Norman, recently consid
ered selling their 2,000-square-foot home on Palm Valley's golf
course, near Litchfield Park.
</P>
<P>
   But even though they could get more than $150,000 for their
home, which they bought four years ago for less than $115,000, they
found they'd have had to pay at least an additional $100,000 to buy
a similar house in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   While the market is hot, sellers shouldn't expect the heat to
drive buyers completely crazy. Good area or no, a house is likely
to languish on the market if the seller gets too greedy, pegging
his price too high over the appraised value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a home is overpriced, it doesn't matter where it's located.
It won't move as quickly, no matter how great the market is right
now,'' said Chuck Fraas, an agent with Century 21 Alliance and
Investment Group.
</P>
<P>
   But reasonably priced homes aren't going to go begging for quite
a while, Valley real estate observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brown and other analysts like David Thikoll of the Meyers
Group are predicting a slight slow down in construction of new
homes next year, they say the area's resale market isn't going to
waver for a while.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Even if the Valley's home market slows next year as we
expect, it will continue to be a hot market for resales and
appreciation, as long as jobs keep bringing people here,'' Thikoll
said. ``And there's no forecast for job growth to stop anytime
soon.'' &QL;

MORTGAGE OPTIONS HELP HOME BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traditional 30-year mortgage with a hefty down payment isn't
the only way to buy a home anymore.
</P>
<P>
   There are a plethora of mortgages available that make buying a
house easier than ever, whether you're a first-time home buyer who
doesn't have enough cash for a down payment, someone with bad
credit, or a high-end buyer who wants a big tax write-off right
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortgages have changed dramatically from 20 years ago. Now
there are a whole bunch of types of loans on the market that make
it simpler for people to buy homes,'' said Jay Luber, a vice
president with North American Mortgage, one of the biggest mortgage
lenders in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The many ways to finance a house, coupled with low interest
rates, have helped more people buy homes and others buy bigger
houses, thus helping fuel the boom in sales of both new and resale
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell the story:
</P>
<P>
   Someone purchasing a $150,000 house with 10 percent down and an
8 percent interest rate _ where 30-year loans were hovering a few
years ago _ would pay $990 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The same loan with a 7 percent rate _ which the market averages
now for conventional loans with no points _ only costs $898 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low interest rates have definitely helped the home market.
People can now afford much more house and get different options for
financing it,'' said Phil Mercurio of Century 21 Alliance and
Investment Group.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest help has probably come for first-time buyers. These
eager home shoppers no longer have to scrape together 20 percent,
or even 10 percent, of a home's value to get into their first
house.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, now backs these
loans, which lets first-time buyers put less than 5 percent down _
even less if they get bond money from a city or state trying to aid
home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Also Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the top loan buyers in the
country, have beefed up their low down payment programs for
first-time buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The groups recently began allowing borrowers to obtain a 3
percent down payment from gifts or loans from family, friends,
employers or a non-profit agency.
</P>
<P>
   That is a big change from the past, when borrowers had to bend
over backward to show that their down payments came from their own
checking accounts and that the cost of getting into a home would
not leave them strapped to make the monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   For home buyers who are not sure how long they will stay in
their house, there are new hybrid loans, said Terry Turk, president
of Sun American Mortgage in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   These loans have low fixed interest rates for five, seven or 10
years and then rise in cost. That way, people who know they're only
going to be in a city for a few years can buy a bigger house.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the top mortgage companies also have developed programs
for people who have a rocky credit background or have been through
a bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   These mortgages carry higher interest rates at first, but if the
borrower doesn't miss payments for the first year or so, the lender
will either refinance or drop the rate.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end of the market are mortgages that allow buyers to
pay all interest and no principal for a period, so the home buyer
can get the best tax bang for the buck.
</P>
<P>
   And there are balloon mortgages for people whose income is based
on a large annual bonus. These loans require only interest payments
until a certain time and then a large ballon payment of principle.
</P>
<P>
   All mortgage bankers agree that getting a mortgage has become
easier for those who have a steady income. But it could get even
better.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae is looking at customizing loans. For example, if
someone plans to work eight more years before retiring, his or her
mortgage could last that long.
</P>
<P>
   Or if a borrower will have big education costs for children at
some point, a long-term mortgage could be configured so the person
has smaller payments then.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt among economists that more people buy when
barriers to the loan process like steep down payments and high
interest rates are taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low interest rates gave the Valley's already strong housing
market a shot in the arm,'' said Jay Butler, director of the Real
Estate Center at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   As a testimony to that, the rate of home ownership in the Valley
has steadily climbed during the past several years, recently
hitting a high of 75 percent of all households. Nationally, home
ownership hit a record 68 percent last month. &QL;

ALBERT GORE SR., 90, FATHER OF THE VICE PRESIDENT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Sen. Albert Gore Sr., the father of the vice president
and a longtime powerful figure in the Democratic Party, died on
Saturday at his home in Carthage, Tenn., three weeks before his
91st birthday, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore and his wife, Tipper, were with Gore when he
died, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1953 to 1970, Gore represented Tennessee in the Senate,
where he was regarded as one of the the few liberals among Southern
Democrats. His liberalism contributed to his defeat in 1970 in a
bitter campaign in which the Republican victor, William E. Brock
III, derided Gore's support of busing and civil rights legislation
and his opposition to the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign was said to have been so nasty that it temporarily
soured his son's view on politics. The younger Gore went on,
however, to be elected to the House of Representatives, to the
Senate and in 1992 to the vice presidency on the Clinton ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr. was born on Dec. 26, 1907, in the hill country
near Granville, Tenn., and attended a one-room school in Possum
Hollow. To raise money for college, he taught in a one-room
mountain school before entering Middle Tennessee State Teachers
College, where he worked his way through school.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Gore's forebears, he said in a 1956 interview, ``came
across the mountain'' after the American Revolution and ``started
chopping timber.'' He added: ``I still chop a little now and then
myself when my fences need mending.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's first campaign for public office, when he was 23, was a
bid for superintendent of schools in Smith County, Tenn. He lost
the election and went back to work on his father's farm.
</P>
<P>
   His political career might have ended there, but a year later,
the man who had defeated him died, and Gore was named to succeed
him.
</P>
<P>
   That led Gore to think about higher office and, to prepare
himself, he studied law in night classes at the YMCA in Nashville,
and received a law degree in 1936. In 1938, he was elected to the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Gore was elected to the Senate, where he did not fit
into the mold of either the Northern liberals or the Southern
conservatives. He was known as one of the Senate's best debaters
and was considered a possible vice presidential nominee in 1956 and
1960, but he frequently found himself on the unpopular side of an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, for example, he voted against the confirmation of
Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. to the Supreme Court although Haynsworth,
who was nominated by President Richard Nixon, had ample support in
Tennessee and although the Democrats had enough votes to block the
nomination without Gore's support.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Gore was one of only three senators from the South to
refuse to sign a Southern manifesto protesting the Supreme Court's
desegregation decision two years earlier. Siding with him were
Lyndon Johnson and Estes Kefauver.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, with Johnson now president and prosecuting the war in
Vietnam, Gore said in a speech at the University of Idaho that the
administration should get out of the ``morass in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are destroying the country we profess to be saving,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute Saturday night, President Clinton described Gore as
a public service role model ``who helped connect the South with the
rest of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert Gore Sr. was the embodiment of everything public
service ought to be,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had a hardscrabble beginning, Gore was financially
successful in later life, running a profitable cattle-breeding farm
in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Gore is survived by his wife of 61
years, Pauline La Fon Gore, three granddaughters, and a grandson.
His daughter, Nancy, died in 1984.

MIAMI UPSETS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ UCLA's locker room was so quiet, you could hear a Fiesta
Bowl drop. Some players closed their eyes and some gazed into
nothingness, their heads covered in towels, tears rolling down
their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti tried to explain the
unexplainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was by far _ and this is an understatement _ the most
horrendous performance by a defensive team I've ever been involved
with or watched on TV,'' Aliotti said after a devastating 49-45
loss to Miami on Saturday, before 46,819 in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much riding on this game, it's hard to imagine
how we could play so poorly. This is as tough as it gets, because
we were so close to something special. To experience this is pretty
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Devastating is gaining 670 yards and scoring 45 points, and
losing.
</P>
<P>
   Devastating is blowing a 38-21 lead with 16 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Devastating is wasting a career performance by quarterback Cade
McNown, who threw for a school-record 513 yards and five
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Devastating, and ironic.
</P>
<P>
   All season the Bruins (10-1) dismissed the means (close calls,
sloppy defense and fabulous finishes) and focused on the ends:
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the means fought back.
</P>
<P>
   Their weaknesses were exposed on national television, on the
biggest day of the college season, with the Fiesta Bowl and
potential national title at stake _ not to mention $6 million for
the Pacific-10, a Rose Bowl for Arizona and a chance for the Bruins
to erase their reputation for being soft in front of an East Coast
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no debate: the defense rested, and a 20-game
winning streak died hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team is weak in one area and you're competing for a
national championship, you're bound to get found out one day,''
Bruins guard Andy Meyers said. ``It's an absolute joke and a
travesty. I apologize to all the Bruin fans. We gave them hope and
let it fall.''
</P>
<P>
   All season coach Bob Toledo clung to the theory that you win
with offense and keep from losing with defense.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the defense lost _ yielding 689 yards to the
Hurricanes and 299 yards to their punishing tailback, Edgerrin
James. Both figures are UCLA opponent records.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played without injured linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo
for all but two plays and had 10 men on the field for one
Hurricanes touchdown. The shortest of Miami's seven touchdown
drives was 70 yards. On another drive, the Hurricanes covered 80
yards in four plays _ all runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond words,'' said UCLA cornerback Marques Anderson,
who missed countless tackles. ``These are the games national
championship teams have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   All season the Bruins came from behind to win.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, they came from ahead to lose, as Miami finished with a
28-7 surge and finished the Bruins the way they finished Arizona,
Stanford and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are no surprises in the storied Orange Bowl _
where Miami has busted seven winning streaks of 10 games or more,
where the Hurricanes upset Nebraska in the 1984 Orange Bowl, where
Doug Flutie found Gerard Phelan for a Boston College miracle and a
phantom penalty on Rocket Ismail's punt return against Colorado
cost Notre Dame the 1990 national title.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as the Hurricanes rallied from a 45-35 deficit in
the final minutes Saturday, the crowd of 46,819 sounded like 75,000
and ghosts of upsets past enveloped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was David vs. Goliath, and God came through for David
again,'' Miami defensive end Derrick Ham said.
</P>
<P>
   All season the Bruins created game-changing turnovers. Saturday,
fumbles by receivers Brian Poli-Dixon and Brad Melsby changed the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby's came with 3:34 left and the Bruins driving for the
clinching touchdown. On third-and-8 from his 44, McNown hit Melsby
down the middle. He dodged one tackle, gained 30 yards and was hit
by Miami's Edward Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby appeared to have one knee down when the ball popped
loose, but the officials ruled it a fumble. Miami's Delvin Brown
recovered, and eight plays later James _ who else? _ rumbled 1 yard
for the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the worst seat in the house, but I'd venture to say he
was probably down,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   McNown took possession with 50 seconds remaining and quickly
moved the Bruins to Miami's 29. But the drive stalled and the
Fiesta Bowl evaporated when his fourth-down pass fell incomplete in
the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for the fans to see a shootout all the time,''
McNown said. ``But you can't win football games giving up yardage
like that.''

JARVIS FEELS AT HOME AS ST. JOHN'S RIPS BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With his 80-year-old mother, Dorothy, and his wife,
Connie, seated next to each other behind the visitor's bench and
his son, Mike 2d, seated alongside him as one of his assistants,
St. John's basketball coach Mike Jarvis, the former coach at
Cambridge Rindge &AMP; Latin and Boston University, enjoyed a
triumphant homecoming Saturdayafter his 25th-ranked Red Storm
pinned Boston College with a 74-55 loss in the Big East opener
before 4,438 at Conte Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Who ever said you can't go home again?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it didn't apply to Jarvis, who considered leaving
George Washington two years ago to take the BC job before removing
himself from consideration after deciding ``the timing wasn't
right,'' he said. Jarvis, though, wound up in the Big East after
leaving in June to take over at St. John's, which won its first
conference road game of the season in its coach's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always special to come back home; it's with capital
letters,'' said Jarvis, 53, who spent a lot of time at The Heights,
scouting basketball games and once even picking the brains of BC's
football staff when he was a high school football coach. ``How
often does a guy get an opportunity to do that in front of your
wife and your mother and your family and friends _ in your own
backyard?
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston College has been very, very good for me for a long
time,'' he added. ``I don't think we ever lost a game here in high
school and it's kinda nice to know we can win a few in college as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a 75-70 loss to Fairfield a week ago, the Eagles
(2-4, 0-1), who were led by Kenny Walls's career-high 18 points,
surged to a 9-point lead (24-15) on a 3-pointer by Clinton Sims
with 7:56 to go before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing aggressively then we had a couple of missed
shots, a couple of calls, and then we got passive and started to
look away from the basket,'' said BC coach Al Skinner, whose team
went without a field goal in eight attempts and managed just 2
points in the final 7:56 of the half, shooting 19 for 57 overall.
``But the real difference was our shooting percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm (6-2, 1-0), who got double-figure scoring from
three starters, including a team-high 15 by Tyrone Grant, responded
by capitalizing on a five-minute BC scoring drought to go on a 12-0
run to build a 27-24 lead. They extended the run to 17-2 to take a
32-26 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went into the locker room (at the half) and got a
little more focused,'' said St. John's Lavor Postell. ``They had a
little run in the first half, and then it was our turn to run.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's opened the second half by going on a 17-4 run,
scoring the last 12 points unanswered, to build a whopping 49-30
lead on Postell's 3-point dagger with 12:56 to go. The Eagles,
however, went on a 3-point binge, with Kenny Harley sandwiching two
of his own around a Walls trey to help BC pull within 10, 53-43,
with 7:10 to go. But it was as close as the Eagles got to ruining
Jarvis's homecoming when freshman guard Erick Barkley drilled a
clutch trey and followed with a pair of free throws to spark a
decisive 14-4 run that gave the Red Storm an insurmountable 67-47
lead that grew to as much as 24, 72-48.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that were happening then mostly were our fault,''
said Jarvis. ``We weren't carrying through with the defensive
assignments, we weren't finishing inside like we wanted to, we were
shooting too many jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the road, then you get scared, because then anything can
happen. And that's all I kept reminding the kids is that we're on
the road,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about their record. Forget about the fact that they're
rebuilding their program and forget about the fact we're in the Top
25. We're on the road, and they're not going to quit at home. So
we're just going to have to dig in and play the way we're supposed
to play.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be discouraged if home values in your neighborhood haven't
risen as sharply as in some areas of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Your time may be coming.
</P>
<P>
   In some spots in metro Phoenix, home sales have been slow to
reach the boiling point, but it's heating up nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that most of the homes in the Valley increased in value
by 20 to 35 percent between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be as jaw-dropping as the numbers in the hottest
spots, which saw more than a 50 percent increase in value, but it's
not shabby. Compare the Phoenix area's increase to other U.S. home
markets; the average appreciation nationwide over that time was
under 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has focused on the sizzling home trade in such
areas as Arcadia and north-central Phoenix, where the landscape is
lush and neighborhoods are long-established.
</P>
<P>
   But real prosperity is on the way for some areas that haven't
had time to mature and appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's next home market hot spots are likely to be housing
hubs in Ahwatukee and Chandler in the East Valley, Goodyear in the
west Valley, Arrowhead on the Peoria/Glendale border and far north
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The number of home sales in those areas, and the short-term
rises in house prices, make it likely that these areas and a few
others will be coming into their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along the Valley's peripheries, there are areas that will
continue to grow and thrive and possibly become the Arcadia or
central Phoenix of tomorrow,'' said Jay Butler, director of the
Real Estate Center at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   He said there's definitely a symbiotic relationship between new
and older homes _ each helps pull up the value of the other.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of new homes have been built across the Valley in recent
years _ 150,000 since 1994 _ to create dozens of new housing hubs
and revitalize older neighbhorhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In the northwest Valley, the Arrowhead area is beginning to
boom, partly because of its new freeway access.
</P>
<P>
   The large housing area really started to evolve as Loop 101 was
completed, linking it to the rest of the Valley, according to
housing analyst R.L. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The area's relatively affordable upscale homes, shopping and
restaurants also have played a part in its growing attractiveness
for home shoppers. The typical price for a home in Arrowhead is
$144,000. Values in the area that includes ZIP codes 85308, 85381
and 85382 have been slow to grow. But the number of sales is high.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of the 17,500 single-family houses in
Arrowhead's main ZIP code (85308) have changed hands during the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   In west Phoenix, a housing area reaching into Goodyear and
Litchfield Park and south to Avondale also is up-and-coming,
because of its affordable homes adjacent to such amenities as golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the homes in that area are new, so home building
analysts are forecasting values there won't start to take off for a
few years. The median price for a home in Goodyear's 85340 ZIP code
is $136,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people have recently woken up and realized the west
Valley has great amenities, transportation and is affordable,''
said Carl Giordano, a realtor with Remax Sunset Valley.
</P>
<P>
   On the west side, ZIP code 85340 encompasses the community of
Palm Valley and several other growing developments. Its values are
flat, growing only about 10 percent since 1994. But sales there are
brisk; more than 40 percent of the 1,555 new and existing houses
there have sold since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the more popular home sales spots in the Valley
continue to grow and draw buyers, communities like Ahwatukee
Foothills could post 50 percent gains in value in the next five
years the way that Paradise Valley has done the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahwatukee, particularly the Foothills, is the Scottsdale of
the East Valley,'' said Mike Mendoza, a Realtor with Keller
Williams. ``There's no other spot with the upscale homes, good
schools and beautiful terrain in that part of the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Home values in the newest Ahwatukee area (ZIP code 85045) have
increased at a heady pace, though the area is still young. Homes
there have jumped in price nearly 30 percent since 1994 to reach a
median of $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The rest of Ahwatukee didn't do as well. But the area is still
a magnet for buyers. Most of the houses in the area spanning ZIP
codes 85044, 85045 and 85048 have sold at least once since being
built. Nearly 90 percent of the single-family houses in 85045 have
sold as either as new homes or resales during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of values in Ahwatukee depends on whether more
roadways are built to connect the homes to other parts of the
Valley, said Mendoza, who lives and specializes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic jams for commuters leaving and entering Ahwatukee have
deterred some buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But others have been lured by its acclaimed Kyrene school
district.
</P>
<P>
   In northeast Phoenix, both home sales and home prices are
growing steadily, and analysts expect that to continue.
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, homes north of the under-construction Pima
Freeway are likely to jump in value and sell like hotcakes during
the next five years as the roadway is completed.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell Mountain Ranch is part of the area and was the No.
2-selling master-planned community in the state last year after Sun
City Grand last year.
</P>
<P>
   Grayhawk is a popular golf community in the area, and DC Ranch
just recently started to sell homes but already has a long waiting
list of potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are flocking to the area for the great lifestyle,
schools and family-friendly neighborhoods,'' said Yvonne Chrysokos
of Remax Achievers.
</P>
<P>
   Many homes in this part of north Scottsdale are upscale but not
as expensive as homes in Paradise Valley or northeast Scottsdale.
The price for a home in north Scottsdale runs about $195,000 in the
85331 ZIP code. In the part of Scottsdale adjacent Paradise Valley,
the median home price is $245,000. And in Paradise Valley, the
typical home sells for $565,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newer home areas in the East Valley, such as
Chandler, Gilbert, East Mesa and Gold Canyon, have drawn scads of
buyers who want big new homes but don't want to pay huge prices.
</P>
<P>
   An average house costs $163,500 in the Chandler area around
Ocotillo. Gilbert is less; a typical home sells for $143,000. East
Mesa prices are comparable at $140,000 in the 85215 ZIP code. Homes
in the Gold Canyon and Apache Junction are the lowest price right
now, averaging about $97,000, but that likely will change because
of several upscale communities opening in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the prices across the East Valley have steadily risen
as the area's &UR; planned communities have filled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``New-home prices may have gone up in areas like Chandler, but
it still draws many people whose first pick for a house is the East
Valley,'' said Meg Shultz of Russ Lyon Realty. &QL;

A FEW SPOTS EXPERIENCE PRICE DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR  
 and RYAN KONIG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's tough to find a place in Phoenix or outlying areas where
home values haven't posted double-digit increases in the past five
years and sales aren't sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly farming communities of Gila Bend, Avondale and
Wittman were the only areas to post declines in home values from
1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The median price for homes in the 85337 ZIP code that includes
Gila Bend have dropped 8 percent since 1994 to $41,400. In
Avondale, which is ZIP code 85323, homes depreciated 6.8 percent,
to $115,000, and prices in Wittman (85361) decreased in value by 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale is the most likely of those areas to see values turn
around in the next few years. That's because the West Valley, south
of Interstate 10 and Goodyear, offers affordable new homes for
around $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Sky Harbor International Airport, a place where
many homes vibrate from the strident thrumming of airline engines
overhead, had the fewest home sales in the five-year period. But
prices didn't suffer because it's an emerging commercial
real-estate hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 5 percent of homes, just 71 out of 1,433, in that area
(ZIP code 85034) have changed hands during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Connell, who inherited his 1,500-square-foot block home near
the airport from an uncle three years ago, isn't surprised by that
figure.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to the Valley from Seattle to live rent-free in the
house and work on a master's degree at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplanes are so loud, they kept me awake at night for the
first year after I moved in,'' Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's considered selling, but found that there are
few buyers for homes there.
</P>
<P>
   Although the airport area is waning in popularity for home
sales, it is a growing hub for office buildings and industrial
projects because of its prime location next to the airport and
several major freeways.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some homes there have been bought by commercial
developers who want the land for office space. As a result, the
median sales price for homes in the 85034 ZIP code has shot up 29
percent during the past five years, to $50,000. &QL;

   SELECTED POEMS: 1960-1990
</P>
<P>
   By Maxine Kumin. (Norton, $17.95.) This collection by a
versatile elegist and observer of nature features vivid poems that
are, refreshingly, about something: Many tell stories that serve to
preserve her family's history. Last year in the Book Review,
Richard Tillinghast called the book ``a welcome addition to any
poetry library.''
</P>
<P>
   A JOURNEY WITH ELSA CLOUD
</P>
<P>
   By Leila Hadley. (Penguin, $14.95.) Invited to India by her
estranged hippie daughter, a demanding, perfectionist mother
embarks on a voyage of self-discovery that takes her from New Delhi
to the home of the exiled Dalai Lama, with epiphanies and emotional
awakenings along the way. ``Hadley is a gifted travel writer with
an artist's eye for the composition _ and the look, smell and
history _ of every scene,'' Diane Johnson wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   IN INDIA: FROM MIDNIGHT TO THE MILLENNIUM
</P>
<P>
   By Shashi Tharoor. (Harper Perennial, $14.) An expatriate takes
a hard look at his country's first 50 years of independence, and
explains why parliamentary democracy has done so little to relieve
poverty, illiteracy and disease. ``Few books in recent years, if
any, offer such a comprehensive overview of what ails India, its
politicians and its people,'' John F. Burns said in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR LETTERS OF LOVE
</P>
<P>
   By Niall Williams. (Warner, $13.99.) The narrator of this tale
of romance and fate is a Dubliner whose search for one of his
artist father's paintings leads him into the arms of a young woman
on the Irish coast. Last year, reviewer Katharine Weber called the
novel ``a luminously written, magical work of fiction ... filled
with marvelous characters, large and small.''
</P>
<P>
   THE END OF THE NOVEL OF LOVE
</P>
<P>
   By Vivian Gornick. (Beacon, $12.) Examining the works of writers
like Willa Cather and Grace Paley, a critic argues that literature
has lost its faith in the transformative power of love. ``Gornick
makes forceful and dramatic judgments,'' Elizabeth Frank wrote in
1997. ``Reading her essays, one is reassured that the conversation
between life and literature is mutually sustaining as well as
mutually corrective.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MERRY HEART: REFLECTIONS ON READING, WRITING, AND THE WORLD
OF BOOKS By Robertson Davies. (Penguin, $14.95) A posthumous
collection of lectures and essays by the Canadian novelist on the
literary life and matters of humane concern. Last year, reviewer
Sven Birkerts said that even though much of his public prose is
less successful on the written page, ``Davies was a relaxed and
winning raconteur, a beguiling autocrat of the rostrum.''
</P>
<P>
   TRAIN WHISTLE GUITAR
</P>
<P>
   By Albert Murray. (Vintage International, $13.) This novel, just
restored to print, is about a black boy growing up in Alabama in
the 1920s and his idol, a blues guitarist named Luzana Cholly. In
1974, John Wideman admired the ``long passages of dialogue,
monologue, the lyric descriptions of countryside and fireside,
which are nothing so much as the riffs and choruses of a blues
artist translated into speech and action.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FILE: A PERSONAL HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy Garton Ash. (Vintage, $13.) A British historian tells
how he found a blurred image of his younger self in an old East
German secret police file, and how he tracked down the people who
had informed on him. The result is ``a political thriller,
reminiscent of Graham Greene and John le Carr, and a treatise on
memory, forgetting and forgiving in the great tradition of
Proust,'' Tomas Venclova wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   HALLUCINATING FOUCAULT
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Duncker. (Vintage International, $12.) This
intricate first novel focuses on a graduate student who tracks down
and falls in love with the subject of his dissertation, a French
novelist in an insane asylum. The result is ``a fascinating drama
of knowledge and power, reason and desire,'' Allen Lincoln wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   MURDER IN THE MUSEUM OF MAN
</P>
<P>
   By Alfred Alcorn. (Zoland, $13.) When a university dean is found
dead in the Museum of Man, the museum's courtly recording secretary
turns sleuth. The result is a ``stylish, occasionally fiendish
detective story ... out to skewer glitzy academic corruption,''
Nina Auerbach wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   TRUMAN CAPOTE: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances,
and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career
</P>
<P>
   By George Plimpton. (Anchor/Doubleday, $16.95.) This chronicle
shows how the talented Capote turned fame into an art form, and
finally into a substitute for art itself. His lurid story is told
mostly through the firsthand accounts of fellow celebrities. In
1997 the reviewer, Julia Reed, found the book to be filled with old
gossip, but said ``some of the best bits reveal more about the
speaker than about the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   PILGRIMS
</P>
<P>
   By Elizabeth Gilbert. (Houghton Mifflin, $12.) Many of the
pilgrims in this first short-story collection are working-class
folks searching for redemption but skeptical of spiritual
enlightenment. The author ``embraces the bizarre and fabulous with
similar enthusiasm,'' Liam Callanan wrote in 1997. ``She moves
stealthily, avoiding the temptation to grandstand, moralize or,
especially, patronize.''

 METHODOLOGY FOR HOME PRICE STORIES
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
For this package of stories and the accompanying maps and graphics,
The Arizona Republic used a computer analysis of median prices and
sales of new and existing homes throughout the Valley.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We used home-price data from Marketron Services Inc., a
Phoenix-based company, and Maricopa County Assessor records. We
also interviewed dozens of home-sale experts, including economists
and Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Through the computer analysis, we identified the Phoenix
metropolitan ZIP codes that showed the highest price increases
during the past five years for new and resale homes. We also were
able to calculate the percentage of homes that sold from 1994 to
1998. &QL;

ASU'S WHITE-COLLAR LYNCH
 ING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was an angry mob outside calling for blood, so the men in
suits (with patches on the elbows) dragged out convicted murderer
James Hamm and hanged him from their ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   Only a day after Hamm had been hired to teach criminal justice
courses at Arizona State, officials at the school decided that
``reassigning Mr. Hamm to non-teaching duties is in the best
interest of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you were one of the people who called ASU, demanding
Hamm's head on a platter. Maybe you're a truck driver or an electri
cian, a small businessman or secre tary or construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you didn't notice, but at the same time ASU's elite were
lynching Hamm, they were spitting in your face.
</P>
<P>
   And mine.
</P>
<P>
   James Hamm wasn't run out of the university for being a killer.
He was run out for being uppity.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to become a ``profes sional,'' and the suits would
have none of it. A guy like Hamm, they say, should only work in a
``non-teaching'' position.
</P>
<P>
   My father and grandfathers were in non-teaching positions. They
were steelworkers. All my uncles worked in the mills. So did I, the
summers I was in college.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching at a university is no more honorable than working in a
mill.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching has no more dignity.
</P>
<P>
   If it's OK for a one-time killer to work in a mill, or cut
grass, or fix a pipe, it should be OK to teach at a university. If
not, you insult every working stiff out there. `QUESTION OF
PREJUDICE'
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there is a class question here,'' Hamm told me
Friday. ``But there's also a question of prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   James Hamm admits his crime. He expresses remorse. He served 17
years in the state prison, and has graduated from college and the
ASU Law School. He is both a convicted murderer and an educated
man. Now that he's served his time, he wants to work.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are willing to let him have a job, it seems, but only
as long as he doesn't get to wear a suit.
</P>
<P>
   There's no other reason.
</P>
<P>
   We exclude ex-cons from some jobs for safety reasons. That isn't
a problem here. ASU officials admit it. The students Hamm would
have taught are older, more savvy, more able to challenge him.
Besides, he's never tried to hide his past. He couldn't if he
wanted to, and he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   All he wants to do is work, and we're saying no. At least, we're
saying he can't work in an area where he has some ability. We'd
prefer he did ``unskilled'' work.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning less desirable. Meaning less valuable. Meaning less
dignified. Meaning this isn't an ethics problem or morality
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pedigree problem.
</P>
<P>
   Either a man with a background like James Hamm deserves to work
or he doesn't. If we limit the types of jobs he can get for reasons
other than qualifications of safety concerns, it isn't the ex-con
who's being put down.
</P>
<P>
   It's us. HE ACCEPTS IT
</P>
<P>
   Hamm told me he understands and expects people to become emotion
ally involved in anything he tries to do. He accepts it.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``I still would like to be a professor. And I'm still
disappointed and still hurt at what they've done. But there is a
sense in which you say, let's take what we've got and let's make
something meaningful to other people. I want to come out of this
feeling like this wasn't a lose-lose situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids in the classes Hamm was to teach have learned more
about jus tice from the way Hamm was treated than from anything he
could have taught them.
</P>
<P>
   They've also learned that running a university is a highly
specialized profession, requiring advanced de grees in both
scaredy-cat and back sliding.
</P>
<P>
   And they've learned that ``class'' is something into which
students are divided. And something into which professions are
divided. And some thing which the people who do the dividing don't
often possess.

FREE AGENCY CHANGES HOT STOVE LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some will say the Hot Stove League is back and better than ever,
with players jumping from club, trades taking place almost on a
daily basis and baseball talk dominating the cold winter months
from every point between Boston to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Others will argue, believing all these players hopping around
leads to fans becoming disinterested with their clubs. The makeup
of today's clubs changes every off-season to the point where it's
difficult to follow even your favorite club.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult line to walk if you're inside the inner circle
of baseball, where owners definitely want to please their fans and
shaking up the roster seems to be the best way to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The winter meetings begin later this week in Nashville. There
was a time when the winter meetings were cause to stop the sports
world. It was a time when nearly every trade that was going to
occur took place.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials have promised this year's winter meetings
will resemble those from days gone by, when fans across the country
scurried for their morning papers to see what transactions had
taken place. But with the flurry of activity that's taken place in
the last month, is there really anything left to do?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, free agency has changed the landscape of the game. It
wasn't really that long ago when, for example, the Detroit Tigers
would pretty much look the same from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Cash, Dick McAuliffe, Ray Oyler and Don Wert rounded out
the infield. The outfield had Willie Horton, Mickey Stanley, Al
Kaline as the primary starters with Jim Northrup serving as a
backup. Bill Freehan was always behind the plate and Denny McLain,
Mickey Lolich and Earl Wilson anchored the rotation for years.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a club and it was pretty much the same thing. Across the
country just about every club had its regulars. You knew they would
be back every year, as long as they produced. Players were the
property of their clubs, and that was that. If Horton's contract
was up and he wanted to look elsewhere, too bad. He couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Everything began changing when Curt Flood challenged baseball's
reserve clause in 1970. Flood wondered why, after playing 12
seasons for the St. Louis Cardinals, he couldn't switch clubs on
his own. After all, the guy working at Allied Signal is not
obligated to stay there his entire life. If Insight wants to hire
him for more money, they simply offer more money to lure the worker
away.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Flood wound up losing that court battle with the
Cardinals, one which went all the way to the Supreme Court, the
stage had been set for the inevitable. Within a few years free
agency was here to stay. The game has not been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   But before the purists start blaming Flood, who recently passed
away, for all the game's problems _ stop. It was inevitable that
the game's owners would have to allow players the freedom to work
elsewhere. Anyone who believes a player should be the property of
his club for life is simply living in the dark ages.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fallout from free agency was the advent of the
multiyear contract. It really didn't exist in the game before free
agency because there was no need for it. This is where those old
stories about a player walking into the owner's office asking for
more money came from.
</P>
<P>
   Before free agency a club had no need to offer more than a
one-year contract. In essence, the player's salary was truly
determined by what he did the previous season. Bad year, bad
contract. Good year, good contract.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple theory that every player had to follow, even the
game's superstars, all the way from Babe Ruth to Willie Mays.
Everyone else had no choice but to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Once players were allowed to jump around, clubs naturally looked
to lock those players up for more than one season.
</P>
<P>
   It soon turned to the absurd, though. The most obvious example
was the $10 million, 10-year contract the Cleveland Indians gave
pitcher Wayne Garland after the 1976 season. Garland, a 20-game
winner the season before for Baltimore, went 28-48 while being
plagued by arm injuries in the next five seasons. He was forced to
retire just five years after signing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   There were other foolish examples, like the time Atlanta signed
catcher Biff Pocoroba to a seven-year deal. In all, several owners
started getting carried away with the newness of free agency, and
this is where the irony with today's signings takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams just received a seven-year deal to remain with
the Yankees. Pitcher Kevin Brown wants a seven-year deal of his
own. First baseman Mo Vaughn just signed with Anaheim for six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the players receiving the longest-term deals now can be
classified as superstars. Still, this is exactly how baseball's
problems in the late 1970s and early '80s began. Owners, indeed,
need to show a bit of restraint, which was the primary topic at
Thursday's owners meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's the other side to the argument: If owners
couldn't afford these contracts they simply would not present them
to the players. It's a difficult argument to make when you see so
many owners coughing up unheard of amounts of money for the
services of a single player. &QL;

MELSBY NOT SURE ABOUT CALL BUT TAKES BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Brad Melsby wasn't too sure about the call, but he had
no doubt about the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I lost the game,'' said the UCLA receiver,
referring to his fumble at the Miami 26 with 3:24 left that the
Hurricanes recovered and used to drive for the winning touchdown in
their 49-45 victory at the Orange Bowl on Saturday that ended
UCLA's hopes for a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling on the sidelines was we were going to make plays
again and find a way to win. We were on the way to doing that when
I fumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, with UCLA facing third-and-8 at its own 44 and clinging
to a three-point lead, caught a ball over the middle from Cade
McNown and slipped a defender before he was hit by a pair of Miami
players, including strong safety Edward Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's hit popped the ball loose and the refs said it happened
before Melsby hit the ground. However, TV replays appeared to
indicate that Melsby's knee was down before the ball came loose.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Myers, for one, didn't need to see the replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took all the self-control I had not to punch the
official,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the worst seat in the house,'' said UCLA coach Bob
Toledo, ``But I'd venture to say he was down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' said Melsby, a junior from Los Alamitos
High. ``I took a pretty good hit. The first thing I thought was
that I was down, but I should have had better control of the ball.
I should have had the ball and we should have run out the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, who has caught just 13 balls this season, has had a
habit of making them big ones. His 61-yarder with 17 seconds left
beat Oregon State and earlier Saturday his 59-yard scoring pass
gave UCLA its biggest lead, 38-21. Nine of Melsby's catches this
season have come on UCLA scoring drives
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, who walked away from the team last year despondent over
his slow recovery from knee surgery, was matter of fact in his
comments. Toledo sought him out in the locker room, put his arms on
Melsby's shoulder and told him it wasn't his fault the Bruins lost.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby, however, had a hard time believing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were on our way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One play and out: UCLA lost its all-conference linebacker,
Brendon Ayanbadejo, on Miami's first offensive play. Ayanbadejo
sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee and
returned for one play.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to be back for the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hurt on the ground when someone fell on me,'' Ayanbadejo
said. ``It's strange. They say if you play full speed and know what
you're doing, you won't get hurt. The play we practiced against was
different from the way they ran it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayanbadejo and safety Larry Atkins are the only senior starters
on defense. Ali Abdul Azziz replaced Ayanbadejo and had two
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you miss a good player in a big game, it hurts,''
defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Drifting away: Several players, including captains Cade McNown
and Andy Meyers, questioned the preparation techniques of the young
defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were plenty of things going on, including a lack of
focus,'' Meyers said. ``When you look over something, you're bound
to trip on what's in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaos reigns: The most humiliating moment of an embarrassing
game for the UCLA defense came late in the first quarter, when
Miami quarterback Scott Covington passed to uncovered receiver
Aaron Moser for a 7-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 10 guys on the field,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said in
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers lie: Check the tackle statistics for UCLA's
second-year defenders: Ryan Nece had 12, Jason Stephens had 11,
Tony White had 10 and Marques Anderson had seven.
</P>
<P>
   For every tackle they made, they seemed to miss two. The Bruins
were well-positioned on most plays _ for once, alignments and
assignments weren't the problem _ but they could not corral
Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense played really well the last two games,'' Nece
said. ``For this to happen and us to have breakdowns and not
execute the fundamentals, it's very frustrating.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M BEATS KANSAS STATE, 36-33  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was a slant pass in the second overtime, from a
second-string quarterback to a second-team running back working at
flanker, that shuffled the rankings in the Bowl Championship
Series, not a computer program designed by a Ph.D. It was a
stiff-arm at the 1-yard line that will keep Kansas State out of the
national title game at the Fiesta Bowl, not penalty points for
strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When Branndon Stewart, a senior quarterback whose football
odyssey has taken him from the backup role behind Peyton Manning at
Tennessee to a benching earlier this season at Texas A&AMP;M, hit Sirr
Parker on the 28-yard line in double overtime of the Big 12
championship game, college football justice was carried to the end
zone on swift legs.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Aggie zigged inside cornerback Jerametrius Butler,
then zagged out to the corner and saved one punishing push to the
face of the Wildcats' Lamar Chapman that propelled him over the
goal line. The football barely brushed the flag. The Aggies had
barely beaten the Wildcats, 36-33, in a heart-stopping finish on a
heart-stopping final day of a memorable football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 5-11, but I was 6 feet on that one,'' said Parker,
who caught a pass on the same pattern to bring the Aggies within
27-25 in regulation, then caught the 2-point conversion to send the
game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   What it means is this. When the BCS ranking comes out Sunday,
Florida State will join Tennessee in the national title game at the
Fiesta Bowl _ if the Volunteers won the Southeastern Conference
title game against Mississippi State Saturday night. UCLA, which
like Kansas State started the day unbeaten only to be upended by
Miami, 49-45, will go to the Rose Bowl against Wisconsin in a
suddenly traditional matchup of Pacific 10 and Big Ten champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East winner, Syracuse, will be in the Orange, maybe
against Florida, maybe against Kansas State. And the Aggies are in
the Sugar Bowl, perhaps against Ohio State. It also means that
Kansas State learned that the adage ``it ain't over until it's
over'' can be especially painful.
</P>
<P>
   They were ahead by 14 points with 10 minutes 37 seconds left in
the first half when the public-address announcer informed the more
than 60,000 people _ most of them dressed in the purple of Kansas
State _ at the Trans World Dome that UCLA had lost. It came seconds
after quarterback Michael Bishop had heaved a 66-yard bomb to
Darnell McDonald. The crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas State players beamed smiles and slapped high fives.
They had come into this game ranked third in the BCS and needed
either Tennessee or the Bruins to lose. They got it. They
celebrated, and the Aggies across the field steamed. But neither
states of mind lasted long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very evident that we are tremendously disappointed. This
is a big hurt for our coaches, players and fans. I have so much
pride in the players and fans,'' Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder
began after the game. Then his voice cracked, and he cried. With
him was Bishop, running back Eric Hickson and linebacker Jeff
Kelly. They cried, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much pride in these players,'' Snyder continued.
``This may be the most difficult thing to happen in their young
lives that they have been forced to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats essentially collapsed on themselves. They outgained
Texas A&AMP;M, 519 yards to 452, but racked up 110 yards on penalties
and turned the ball over three times. The biggest was on third down
with 2:22 left in the game. Bishop, who threw for 341 yards and 2
touchdowns and ran for another, appeared to pick up the first down
that would have allowed the Wildcats to run out the clock, but
linebacker Warrick Holdman knocked the ball loose and Cornelius
Anthony recovered on the 35-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sick feeling,'' a devastated Bishop said after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who was replacing an injured Randy McCown after losing
his job to him after the fifth game, slung a sidearm pass down the
field to a streaking Matt Bumgardner. He lunged for the ball and
caught it on the 14-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Twice earlier in the game, the Aggies had to settle for field
goals after having the ball inside the 10-yard line. On third-and-9
from the 9-yard line, Stewart this time found Parker, who cut in
front of strong safety Jarrod Cooper at the goal line and caught
the touchdown pass to bring the Aggies within 27-25. Stewart again
went to Parker for the 2-point conversion, this time on a
play-action rollout that left Parker alone in the end zone to tie
the score at 27-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was going to play ever again,'' said the
senior quarterback, who was 15 of 31 for 324 yards and 3
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Randy was doing a great job. But when I knew I'd get
the start I couldn't wait to get out there.''

PEPPERDINE WASTES A CHANCE FOR PROMINENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Opportunity No. 1 is gone. Wasted would be an
appropriate way of putting it. Three more chances exist this month
for the Waves to gain prominence. That's what they've been talking
about since October.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's 62-55 loss to No.7 Kansas on Saturday in the Wooden
Classic was its best chance for stardom, but Wisconsin offers
visibility next Saturday. Michigan State does the same Dec.21.
Ditto for Rhode Island on Dec.29.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game we were looking forward to playing for a long
time,'' Pepperdine guard David Lalazarian said. ``We knew what it
meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine has talked about being a Top 25 team this season, and
the Waves also mentioned that anything short of a West Coast
Conference title and an NCAA berth would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to become a force on a higher level, Pepperdine
must beat a high-profile, top echelon team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we were a team that could beat Kansas and we feel
like we're a team that could beat Wisconsin and a team that can
beat Michigan State,'' Pepperdine point guard Jelani Gardner said.
``(The loss) lets us know we have to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice to see you: Before, during and after the game, Waves center
Nick Sheppard and Jayhawks forward Lester Earl chatted.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a while since they've seen each other. Both played at
Louisiana State during the 1996-97 season before transferring to
their current schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got his phone number before I left after the game,''
Sheppard said. ``We were friends. We hung out together. It was just
good to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl, bothered recently by a sore knee, scored four points in 14
minutes. Sheppard had two points and eight rebounds but missed all
six of his shots from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Foul shots: Forward Marc McDowell led Pepperdine in scoring, but
was held 10 points beneath his average with two points.... The
Waves had only six assists.... Pepperdine is yet to play outside
California.... Kansas center Eric Chenowith, from nearby Villa
Park, had 10 points but played only seven minutes in the second
half because of foul trouble.

 &HT;    Vols roll in the fourth to win title
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee won its second consecutive conference championship and
in the process may have scheduled a date with Destiny as the
Volunteers stormed from behind in the final seven minutes to defeat
Mississippi State 24-14 in the 1998 SEC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (12-0), ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll,
will receive an invitation from the Fiesta Bowl today where the
Volunteers will get the opportunity to play for their first
national championship since 1951. Tennessee will not know its
opponent until the official Bowl Championship Series pairings are
released at 3:30 p.m. today on ABC. With No. 2 UCLA and No. 3
Kansas State both losing on Saturday, the Volunteers will likely
face Forida State (11-1) on Jan. 4 in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's hopes and dreams for an entire season seemed to be
on the ropes with 8:43 left in the game when Mississippi State's
Kevin Prentiss returned a punt 83 yards for a touchdown. That gave
the Bulldogs a 14-10 lead against a Tennessee team had had
struggled on offense for most of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee struck back with cold-blooded precision as
quarterback Tee Martin found Peerless Price open for a perfect
41-yard touchdown strike that gave the Volunteers a 17-14 lead with
less than six mintues remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then , on Mississippi State's very next possession, the Bulldogs
fumbled and Tennesee recovered at the 26. The Volunteers did not
hesitate as Martin hit Cedrick Wilson for a touchdown on the very
first play giving UT control of the game and consecutive SEC titles
for the first time since 1989-90.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's offense played it close to the vest all night as
Martin found himself under constant pressure by Mississippi State's
constantly blitzing defense. But as the Volunteers had done all
season, beginning with the last-second victory over Syracuse, the
Volunteers found a way to win when the game was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are just one victory away from the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   With Tennessee leading 10-7, both teams continued to play it
close to the vest going into the fourth quarter, waiting for the
other team to make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee used a 20-yard run by Travis Henry to move out to its
44-yard line. But facing a third and eight at that point,
Mississippi State blitzed quarterback Tee Martin, who threw wide
and Tennessee had to kick.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Mississippi State's Kevin Prentiss gathered in the
punt at his own 12-yard line and sprinted down his own sideline for
a touchdown, giving the Bulldogs a14-10 lead and cranking up the
noise at the Georgia Dome to yet another level.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 10-7 at halftime, Tennessee had an apparent touchdown
midway through the third quarter when linebacker Al Wilson
intercepted a pass and returned it 33 yards. But the Volunteers
were called for a block in the back and took possession at the
Mississippi State 33.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play from scrimmage Tennessee's Travis Henry
fumbled and Mississippi State recovered, killing the scoring
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   That play was the only thing resembling any kind of offense and
both teams slugged out defensively the rest of the way and
Tennessee was clinging to its three-point lead as the final period
began.
