LOST SHEEP ON THE LAM IN THE CITY GETS A BREAK
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On most mornings, Sgt. Joseph T. Kersting brings the
tools of his trade to patrol the streets of East Harlem: a
plexiglass shield, an electronic stun gun, a life preserver, a rope
and a heavy-duty fire extinguisher.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, that rope got a workout: a sheep was loose, dashing
through traffic on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in Manhattan in a
mad spectacle that drew police officers, an agent of the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and some
commuters in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how the animal made its way onto the highway. One
theory is that it escaped from a slaughterhouse at 126th Street and
Amsterdam Avenue, then journeyed crosstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were pretty shocked,'' the sergeant said, acknowledging
that he himself was stunned when he saw the sheep trotting down
Second Avenue near East 120th Street. ``It's not that common to see
a sheep running down the FDR.''
</P>
<P>
   With their emergency lights flashing but no sirens, they chased
the young sheep down Second Avenue. ``A couple of civilians tried
to help us and no one could stop the sheep,'' the sergeant said.
</P>
<P>
   At East 96th Street, they were joined by the ASPCA agent, Tina
Salaks, who had been sitting in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep ran up the exit ramp from the northbound lanes of the
FDR Drive, heading south toward Carl Schurz Park, then entered the
tunnel under Gracie Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant; his partner, Officer Larry Lopez; and Salaks _
aided by a commuter _ were able to trap the sheep in the southbound
lanes of the tunnel. He was bundled into the back of a patrol car
and taken to the ASPCA on East 92nd. After a thorough checkup by
ASPCA veterinarians, the 49-pound sheep was soon happily munching
sweet hay and grain. The sheep, named Franklin for the highway
where he made good his escape, will most likely live out his years
at Green Chimneys, a sanctuary for abused animals in upstate New
York, said Valerie Bedziner, a spokeswoman for the ASPCA.

LAZIO COURTS NEW YORK'S JEWISH VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days before the Salute to Israel Parade, Rep.
Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate, met with Jewish
community leaders Friday, seeking support from a constituency that
traditionally favors Democrats but which might swing toward either
candidate in November.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong meeting with about 25 leaders at an office
building in Midtown Manhattan, Lazio said he explained his
positions on a number of concerns among Jewish leaders, including
support for moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to
recognize the city that Israel claims as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after the meeting, Lazio said he had also told the
gathering that he could not take a position on whether Jonathan
Pollard, convicted of spying for Israel, should be granted
clemency, because Lazio said he lacked access to government
information in the case. He did say he would support a presidential
review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   On another topic, Lazio said he told the meeting that he would
accept an endorsement from the Independence Party, even though its
presidential candidate might be Pat Buchanan, who has been
criticized by Hillary Rodham Clinton and others for remarks they
consider anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lazio and Clinton, the Democratic candidate for Senate,
plan to march in the Salute to Israel Parade on Fifth Avenue in
Manhattan on Sunday. New York's Jewish voters may prove to be a key
constituency in the Senate election.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Democratic candidates in New York can count on support
from Jewish voters. But Lazio's predecessor in the Senate race,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, enjoys strong backing in the Jewish
community. And Clinton has angered Jewish leaders with her support
for an independent Palestinian state and by her visit last year to
the West Bank, where Yasser Arafat's wife, Suha, made remarks
implicating Israel in the poisoning of Arab women and children.
</P>
<P>
   On some issues, Lazio said he stated positions similar to those
of Clinton. For instance, she too has called for moving the U.S.
Ebassy, which would bolster Israel's claim to Jerusalem, control of
which is claimed by Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's support for moving the embassy is qualified: she
supports legislation that would allow the administration to delay
the move if it determines a delay would help the Mideast peace
process. Lazio said he believed the sovereignty of Israel is
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for America to demonstrate to Israelis and to
the world that we stand four-square behind Israel and the
sovereignty of Israel,'' he said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not stated a position on clemency for Pollard, the
American convicted of passing secrets to Israel. Pollard is serving
a life sentence, which Jewish groups and an increasing number of
politicians call too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday she would ``work on'' forming an opinion
before the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said, ``I haven't had the kind of secured briefing that
people need to make that kind of judgment'' on whether Pollard
should be freed. But he called on the next president, within six
months of taking office, to open a comprehensive review of the case
to determine whether clemency is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he faced several questions about his possible
association with the Independence Party, the New York State
affiliate of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he told those gathered that he found Buchanan a
``divisive force in American politics'' but that he would still
accept an endorsement from the party, even if Buchanan's name was
on the ballot with his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be making very clear that I accept the votes of the
Independence Party voters but I do not accept any support from Pat
Buchanan,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Honlein, executive director of the Conference of
Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, who attended the meeting,
which was organized by George Klein, a founder of the Republican
Jewish Coalition, said Lazio's stance on Buchanan might cause
trouble with Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday she would never appear on a ballot with
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his record of anti-Semitic comments, his record of
intolerant and prejudicial remarks are ones that I don't want to be
associated with,'' she said. Some present at the meeting with Lazio
said they would probably support him. ``He's like Al D'Amato, but
without the passion,'' said one participant.

YANKS PLAY THEIR BEST AGAINST   THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Yankees have mastered their sport three
of the last four years, and truth be told, the two-time defending
World Series champions get bored with the regular season. A series
in Detroit is like homework for them. What they love are the big
tests, which is why they can flunk a pop quiz against the Oakland
Athletics and then come back and stifle the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's human nature to rise to challenges, David Cone said
before Orlando Hernandez hushed the Atlanta bats Friday night in a
5-2 victory capped by another save by Mariano Rivera, the star of
last year's four-game Series sweep of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee drove in all but one of the Yankees runs with an
early three-run homer and a late double; Ledee has four runs batted
in in each of his last two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees understand what big games are all about, know the
difference between those and mundane May contests. After playing
inconsistently for two months, they will be filled with adrenaline
in the days ahead: Roger Clemens faces Atlanta's Greg Maddux
Saturday, in the first duel of pitchers with a combined nine Cy
Young awards.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing a three-game series here Sunday against the best
team this season so far, the Yankees will play the Montreal Expos,
the Mets, the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago White Sox at Yankee
Stadium, then the White Sox and the Red Sox on the road. Seven
straight series against teams with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel, the Cleveland shortstop, said recently that the
Yankees always played their best baseball against the best teams,
like ``they have something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (5-4) had something to prove. He had not won since
April 23, had missed his last start with a strained muscle in his
back, and yet El Duque pitched against the Braves the way he did
last October, when he shut them down in the first game of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a cap so new that he has not had time to curl the bill
to his liking, Hernandez got ahead in the count, threw mostly
fastballs the first time through the batting order and used his
slider with more effectiveness the next time around, always keeping
the Braves hitters off balance. He allowed four hits, one walk and
one run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez had something to prove. Manager Joe Torre made a
point of chatting with the first baseman hours before the game; it
was an attempt to soothe Martinez, who is on a pace to drive in 83
runs, woeful production for an American League first baseman in
this era.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez frets when he is not hitting home runs, but Torre
reminded Martinez that he drove the ball to center and left-center
when he was at his best.
</P>
<P>
   There was one out when Martinez batted in the fourth inning, and
with the count at 3 and 2, Kevin Millwood looked in for a sign from
catcher Javy Lopez. Fastball inside, Lopez signaled, but Millwood
did not want to throw that. Curveball inside, Lopez signaled. No,
Millwood indicated.
</P>
<P>
   As Lopez gave another sign, Martinez stepped out, tired of
waiting, then stepped back in, and when Millwood finally agreed
with Lopez and threw a fastball high and outside, Martinez smashed
it against the center-field fence, a double. Driving the ball
through the middle is what Martinez does best.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada reached a full count, as well, then ignored a
changeup that was just a fraction high for ball four. Ledee was
next and with two runners on base, Millwood did not want to dawdle;
he wanted to pump a fastball past Ledee for strike one.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee hammered this fastball, however, lifting it high toward
right field, where Brian Jordan slowly retreated, looking up at and
reaching for the wall with his gloved left hand until he bumped
into it. Jordan could go no further.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the ball landed in the seats, Clay Bellinger and then
Derek Jeter each threw up both hands in the Yankees dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, who would lose his job if the Yankees traded for a
slugger today, rounded the bases and smiled a bit as teammates
congratulated him, but it was not until he returned to left field
for the bottom half of the fourth inning that he appeared to really
relax.
</P>
<P>
   Warming up before the Braves batted, Ledee played catch with the
relief pitcher Jason Grimsley, and when Grimsley began firing his
nasty sinker and slider, Ledee laughed and waved a finger across
his throat _ cut that out, please.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was fun again for Ledee, who has something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   But all the Yankees seemed more intent, more focused, facing
three weeks of big games, big challenges.  &QL;

NEW JERSEY MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A New Jersey political donor with mysterious
sources of income and connections that reached into the White House
and both political parties pleaded guilty in federal court in
Friday to charges of illegally channeling $53,700 into the 1996
campaign of Sen. Robert Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   The donor, David Chang, 57, of Cresskill, N.J., pleaded guilty
to five misdemeanor election-law violations by making contributions
to the campaign that exceeded individual limits, by making illegal
corporate donations and by making contributions using other
people's names.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, who was raised in South Korea and served on the
Torricelli campaign's finance committee, also pleaded guilty to one
felony count of obstructing justice by trying to persuade a
potential witness to lie to a grand jury investigating accusations
of campaign finance violations in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before Judge Alfred M. Wolin four days before Chang
was to go on trial on election-law, tax, perjury and other charges
that could have sent him to prison for decades, Chang, as a
condition of his plea, also agreed to cooperate with the Justice
Department's investigation of campaign violations.
</P>
<P>
   Chang could be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined up to
$250,000 under federal sentencing guidelines, but prosecutors said
he might be sentenced to as little as two years if he provides
``substantial cooperation,'' as outlined in his plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea came one day after a Korean-born businessman,
Cha-Kuek Koo, also pleaded guilty in federal court in Newark to
election-law violations by making illegal contributions to the
Torricelli campaign and by aiding Chang in making secret
contributions in the name of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, a Democrat, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
While he has called Chang a friend, the senator has insisted that
he was unaware of the improper contributions to his campaign, which
have since been donated to charities. Among 25 people accused of
election-law abuses by the Justice Department's Campaign Financing
Task Force, Chang and five others from New Jersey have admitted
wrongdoing, but none of them have implicated the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, whose fund-raising skill led to his appointment as
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raised
$9.2 million to defeat Rep. Richard Zimmer in the 1996 Senate race.
The senator did not comment Friday on Chang's plea.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe David Lowell, a lawyer for Torricelli, said in a statement
that the Justice Department ``has confirmed that neither the
senator nor anyone in the campaign are the focus of any
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang made no statement after entering his plea. He remains
under house arrest, pending a bail hearing on Monday. His lawyer,
David Schertler, told The Associated Press that he would not
comment on what other information Chang might provide the task
force.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, who was born in Beijing and raised in South Korea where
his family moved when he was a boy, reportedly attended the
University of London, worked in the oil business in the Middle
East, came to New York in the early 1980s and has become a
naturalized American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Although he operates commodities trading and export businesses
in Bergen County, they have never posted a profit, according to
Justice Department investigators, and Chang's only sources of
income have been wire transfers from unknown sources in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chang lives in a $1.25 million home, drives a Rolls-Royce,
has run up huge business debts and gambling losses, and has given
nearly $300,000 to U.S. election campaigns since 1993 _ $240,000 to
Democrats and about $50,000 to Republicans, according to
investigators and election records.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the nation's most prolific campaign donors, Chang
reportedly has had dinner at the White House, private discussions
with President Clinton, flown on Air Force One and personal
references from former President George Bush. He also has a history
of prior campaign violations, including illegal contributions in
1992 to a California representative, Jay Kim, who later pleaded
guilty to accepting $133,000 in donations from Korean corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal laws prohibit political donations by corporations and
individuals amounting to more than $2,000 to a candidate during an
election cycle. They also bar secret reimbursements to so-called
``straw donors'' _ a way of hiding political contributions by the
person making the reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chang and Koo admitted making such contributions. Chang, in
his plea, acknowledged that he had reimbursed Berek Paul Don, a
former Bergen County Republican leader, and Don's former law
partner, Carmine Alampi, for $11,000 they had contributed to
Torricelli's campaign in their own names. Don and Alampi pleaded
guilty last year to related charges.
</P>
<P>
   Chang admitted that, as a member of Torricelli's campaign
committee, he had collected $21,000 from donors and had illegally
reimbursed them with money from one of his corporations, Bright &AMP;
Bright, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   Chang said he also used $1,700 from the same corporation to pay
for flights for the Torricelli campaign _ an allegation
Torricelli's aides have denied, saying that Bright &AMP; Bright was
reimbursed for all flights it paid for. Chang also admitted that he
gave Koo $20,000 to reimburse other donors.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors agreed to drop other charges in the latest of
several indictments, they noted in court papers that they
anticipated filing additional charges against Chang ``with respect
to payments made to a certain former government employee.'' They
declined to provide details.

DNC LINK TO DOG KILLING DENIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL AND RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Comments by the head of Los Angeles' Animal
Services Department that the city was stepping up efforts to round
up and euthanize more stray dogs for the Democratic National
Convention triggered an angry denial Friday from Mayor Richard
Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's editions, the Los Angeles Daily News had quoted
department General Manager Dan Knapp as saying the crackdown was
needed because of overcrowding at shelters. ``Point A, and the
catalyst for this change, is the Democratic National Convention.
Point B is the City Council ... emphasizing getting these stray
dogs off the streets to make the streets safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Tuesday night with rescue workers, shelter
volunteers and animal rights activists, Knapp made the same point,
linking the need to euthanize more dogs at least in part to the
convention, according to several people who attended.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to Riordan on Friday after a furor erupted,
Knapp apologized ``for any confusion or embarrassment'' he might
have caused. He said there was ``no nexus'' between the convention
and the roundup and euthanization of more stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan issued a statement acknowledging that shelters are
overcrowded and enforcement was being stepped up but he denied any
link to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we are euthanizing stray kittens and puppies to
clear the streets in preparation for the Democratic National
Convention is not only outrageous, but it's inaccurate, wrong and
must be corrected for the record,'' the mayor's statement read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, in no way have we ordered the additional roundups
of stray animals. We are making every effort to decrease the
department's euthanasia rate and increasing animal adoptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News did not report that more kittens were being
euthanized and has no information that Knapp made such a comment.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan noted the city has increased spending on animal control
in the past two years to deal with the overpopulation problem,
including doubling the department's budget to more than $12 million
and adding 75 new positions.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who chairs the council's Public
Safety Committee overseeing the Animal Services Department, said
the increase in the euthanasia rate was expected because of the
overcrowded conditions in animal shelters.
</P>
<P>
   With the new city budget taking effect July 1 and the convention
scheduled for mid-August, there was an understandable confusion in
linking the euthanasia increase with the event, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew this was going to happen,'' Miscikowski said.
``It's a coincidence of the two things coming around the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Miscikowski has proposed a $140 million bond measure for the
November ballot to build five more kennels.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp had warned of the overpopulation problems during budget
hearings this year, saying overcrowding at animal shelters was a
danger both to the animals and workers.
</P>
<P>
   The city has adopted an aggressive spay and neutering program
for pets to try to reduce the number of stray animals that roam
city streets and also has an outreach program to increase the
numbers that are adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Wyler of the Ark Trust said she is not happy to see the
increasing euthanasia rates, but considers it part of the problem
the city faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the curse of any big city,'' Wyler said. ``We're a
throwaway society and people don't take spay and neutering
seriously enough. We just don't have enough room for all of the
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   According to people who attended the Tuesday night meeting with
Knapp, he brought up the Democratic convention as a cause of the
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that in response to the Democratic National Convention
coming to town in August, that the sweeps were going to start
again,'' said Teri Austin, president of the Amanda Foundation, a
group that rescues dogs and cats from city animal shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised to hear this statement from Dan, because
traditionally, he would have come up with more humane solutions to
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Ellis, an animal welfare activist, attended the meeting
and agreed that Knapp cited the convention as the impetus for the
sweep. ``The mayor and the City Council have made it clear that we
want to present the best face for the city for these delegates,''
Ellis said. ``The bottom line, it was a big coup to get awarded
this convention. Let's face it, where the Staples Center area is
there's a larger problem than in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bell, another animal welfare activist, was also at the
meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Knapp said the department was given orders that they were
to do a sweep prior to the Democratic National Convention. He said
the city will be busy and impacted with traffic. Mr. Knapp said
that he's got to follow orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much opposed to the sweep. I'm very much on Dan's
side. I just think the department has been put in a bad spot.''

THE AD CAMPAIGN: TAKEN FROM THE HEADLINES

<P>
   This 30-second commercial, titled ``Best,'' was released
Thursday by former Gov. Jim Florio in his bid for the Democratic
Senate nomination against Jon Corzine. The commercial is running on
television stations in New York City and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER _ The Campaign Group.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN _ At the sound of a whip crack, the commercial
opens with grainy, colorless, slow-motion videotape of Corzine in
an impromptu news conference with several microphones thrust before
him. He is holding his left hand up, palm out toward the camera, in
a way that makes him look uneasy and defensive. Headlines flash
onscreen, obscuring his face: ``Your prying eyes,'' ``Corzine
lawyer put detectives on Florio.'' The nameplates of The New York
Times, The Star-Ledger and The Philadelphia Inquirer are shown
against an outline of New Jersey and the words, ``Reject Jon
Corzine.'' An editorial from The Record, in Hackensack, is quoted
from beneath the headline, ``Buying an election.'' The ad cuts back
to the tape of Corzine, now above a giant label, ``$35 million,''
and the appeal ``Show Jon Corzine New Jersey is not for sale.''
Finally, the newspaper logos are shown beneath The Inquirer's
editorial headline, ``Democrats, vote Florio,'' and a quotation:
``Jim Florio is the better choice.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT _ Narrator: ``Jon Corzine's campaign has sunk to a
new low, using private detectives to spy on his opponent. Come on,
Corzine. And that's why, from The Times and Star-Ledger in North
Jersey, to The Inquirer in the South, newspapers are urging voters
to reject Jon Corzine. The Record: `Make no mistake about it,
Corzine is trying to buy his way into the Senate.' Tuesday, show
Jon Corzine New Jersey is not for sale. For Democrats, Jim Florio
is the better choice for Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY _ The commercial accurately quotes from the newspaper
articles and editorials it cites.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD _ Florio, trailing in the polls and outspent by more
than 15 to 1, has done his best in the last week to make Corzine's
record-shattering spending the overriding issue in their Senate
contest.
</P>
<P>
   News accounts that have appeared in the past few days recounting
Corzine's heavy-handed use of private investigators to explore
Florio's background have been a boon to the Florio campaign, as
have been endorsements by the largest newspapers circulating in New
Jersey. This commercial wastes no time in exploiting such favorable
publicity.

BORDER STATE GOVERNORS AGREE TO SEEK ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION  SOLUTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The governors of the border states of Mexico and
the United States agreed Friday to look for long-term solutions to
illegal immigration problems while promoting immediate efforts to
halt border killings.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration issue rose to the top of the agenda of the 18th
annual Border Governors Conference after a recent spate of violent
incidents at the border, especially in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be challenges to our good neighbor
policy,'' said Arizona Gov. Jane Hull. ``The rush of undocumented
workers crossing in the dark shadows is not a new problem, but one
that is escalating to a crisis level. Tensions and emotions are
running high, and I am concerned for the health and safety of those
on both sides of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 455 people have died since the beginning of Operation
Gatekeeper, a 5-year-old program that increases the number of
Border Patrol agents along the southern California border. Migrant
rights advocates say the program has forced immigrants to take more
dangerous routes through deserts and mountains to avoid the patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican governors used Friday's closing ceremonies _ and a
large audience of Spanish news media _ as an opportunity to
pressure the U.S. government to make its policies more friendly to
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no secret that some immigration policies of the U.S.
government has hurt Mexican brothers, and will continue to hurt
efforts for peace and cooperation,'' said Gov. Alejandro Gonzalez
Alcocer, governor of the state of Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   Added into the joint declaration signed at Friday's closing
ceremonies was a committement for three levels of government _
local, state and federal _ to work to improve coordination and stop
the ``unfortunate incidents'' taking place along the border.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the participants agreed the solutions lie with the
two countries' federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to take constructive steps, by setting up
programs to educate people who cross the border about the laws they
have to follow,'' said Gov. Gray Davis, who hosted the two-day
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Davis praised President Clinton for including $2 million in his
budget to help implement some of the projects agreed to at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull, a Republican who has endorsed Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, said she has been frustrated with the administration and the
lack of movement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply concerned that private citizens will take the law
into their own hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made only a brief appearance Friday, choosing to skip the
closing session and press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor stayed largely out of the limelight,
attending the opening ceremonies, at which governors did not speak,
and a 90 minute work session which was closed to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the meetings as he left to fly back to Austin, Bush
said ``We talked about friendship and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Davis, described as cordial in their interaction by
several who saw the closed door sessions, did stop together in the
rotunda of the Capitol to have their picture taken with students
from Golden View Elementary School in San Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   While the discussion on immigration was the focus of many of the
closing speeches, the joint declaration included a number of
recomendations on topics from the environment to educations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the notable provisions include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Expanding the H-2A temporary agricultural workers program so
that migrant workers can help meet America's labor needs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Strengthening the trade relationship by modernizing the ports
of entry and implementing parts of the North American Free Trade
Agreement that allow for easier commerce and transportation across
the border.
</P>
<P>
   -- Working together to fight natural disasters that effect the
region, including forest fires, floods and drought.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pushing cooperation of the state agricultural agencies to
improve plant and animal health and food safety. &LR;

LODUCA WILLING TO LEND A GLOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's not that Los Angeles Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson doesn't think Chad Kreuter can handle the load of
being an everyday catcher. He'd just rather not force it upon him,
which is why Paul LoDuca was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque and
inserted into the starting lineup against the Angels on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Regular starter Todd Hundley was placed on the 15-day disabled
list with a strained oblique muscle on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter _ in the midst of an eight-game hitting streak, during
which he's batting .346 _ is expected to resume his role of being
Chan Ho Park's personal catcher today and will continue to split
time with LoDuca thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul did a good job for us last year and he's doing a good job
of catching (in Albuquerque),'' Johnson said. ``I could have gone
with Kreuter (Friday), but he'd rather play (Saturday) because
(Saturday) is Chan Ho and he's kind of been catching him and
catching him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in LoDuca. Rather than put that on
Chad right now _ I think he can handle it _ it's not something we
need to do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter LoDuca, who made his presence felt right away when he
gunned down Darin Erstad on an attempted steal in the first inning
Friday and hit a three-run homer in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca, who was batting .299 with 22 RBI in 41 games for
Albuquerque, played 36 games for the Dodgers last season, batting
.232 with three homers and 11 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca was focused on winning the backup catcher's job in spring
training this season and was disappointed when Kreuter was
selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough. Of course I was upset,'' LoDuca said while
accepting a barrage of greetings from his old/new teammates. ``I'm
human. Of course I was upset when something like that happens, but
I took it in stride. Todd and Chad are doing great and I'm not
trying to fill their shoes, I'm just trying to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Relief, please: Currently 14th among active major- league
pitchers with 144 saves, Jeff Shaw was temporarily removed from the
closer's spot after blowing the save in Tuesday's 10-5 loss to the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is suffering from ``dead arm,'' a condition he said does
not result from overuse and can limit a pitcher numerous times
throughout the course of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, fourth in the National League with 11 saves, does not
expect to have an MRI on his ailing right shoulder. He will undergo
a strength test when the Dodgers return June 7 from a three-game
road trip to play the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw did not throw on Wednesday or Thursday but did pitch a
bullpen session Friday. The biggest challenge for him is keeping up
with a new weightlifting regimen to rebuild the strength in his
shoulder. He normally does not lift weights during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Team physician Dr. Frank Jobe) asked if I would take four or
five days off and that's OK,'' Shaw said. ``Then he asked about two
weeks and I said no. I have a very high pain tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he will use Mike Fetters, Antonio Osuna and Terry
Adams, by committee, to close out games until Shaw returns to form.
He will not use Osuna and Fetters in back-to-back games because of
their history of arm problems.
</P>
<P>
   __ Closing in: Eric Karros' second-inning homer Friday gave him
15 this year and moved him to within two of tying the all-time
franchise record for a career, held by Ron Cey (228).
</P>
<P>
   __ Poking fun: Dodgers players were watching the movie
``Slapshot'' in the clubhouse before Friday's game. During the part
of the movie in which minor-league hockey players go into the
stands to fight with fans, F.P. Santangelo remarked, ``Hey, that's
the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo was of course referring to the already-infamous brawl
between the Dodgers and Chicago Cubs fans on May 16.

 FAA THREATENS TO SHUT ALASKA AIRLINES MAINTENANCE FACILITIES  &HT;     By HENRY K. LEE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In a move that could ground the airline within
months, federal regulators threatened Friday to strip Alaska
Airlines of the authority to maintain its fleet because mechanics
in Seattle and Oakland failed to properly document repairs.
</P>
<P>
   A special inspection of the airline after January's deadly crash
of Flight 261 found that Alaska employees released planes into
service without the required signatures, improperly delayed repairs
and often could not rely on maintenance records to confirm whether
work was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a paperwork problem,'' Nick Lacey, director of
flight standards for the Federal Aviation Administration, said at a
Washington news briefing. ``Aviation accidents come as a series of
small errors and the inability to detect small errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska must respond to the FAA's findings within seven days. If
the response is unsatisfactory, the agency, pending an appeal by
the airline within 30 days, could shut down Alaska's maintenance
facilities in Oakland and Seattle, effectively grounding five or
six planes a month out of a fleet of 89.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Alaska's headquarters in Seattle,
airline chairman and chief executive John F. Kelly said the carrier
has already addressed many of the FAA's concerns. Kelly said he
intends to restore public confidence in the nation's 10th-largest
airline, which until recently has enjoyed a reputation for safety
and quality service.
</P>
<P>
   While it was difficult to be ``100 percent in every little
detail,'' Kelly said, ``We've always said we're never perfect, but
we're never going to stop trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said the company's cooperation, skilled personnel and
record of completing repairs _ even if they were not properly
documented _ persuaded the FAA not to immediately shut down the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   However, a maintenance shutdown could devastate the airline,
which has suffered a spate of problems this year, the most serious
of which was the crash of Flight 261 off the Southern California
coast on Jan. 31, which killed all 88 people aboard. The ill-fated
flight was bound for San Francisco from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has grounded other airlines, but the proposed action
would be the first time the agency has sanctioned an airline for
problems associated with major maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week FAA probe in April, known as a ``white glove''
audit, came in response to the fatal crash but renewed concerns
about Alaska's maintenance practices first raised in 1998, when a
federal grand jury in San Francisco began investigating allegations
that airline mechanics in Oakland falsified repair records.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FAA's review of 79 of Alaska's planes found that
all the needed repairs had been completed and that passenger safety
did not appear to be an issue, federal inspectors said they
uncovered 150 instances in which aircraft maintenance was completed
but not properly documented.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey blamed Alaska supervisors for the ``serious'' breakdowns
in documentation and quality assurance, saying, ``We think the root
cause is really management effectiveness and, I think, a certain
amount of sloppiness.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Kelly said: ``Any record-keeping that has not been
done to perfection could be characterized with many different kinds
of adjectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wagstaff of Anchorage, an aviation attorney who has been
closely following the Alaska Airlines situation, said it remains to
be seen how the FAA proposal will affect the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paperwork was out of order, but the maintenance was done _
it's not good, it's not correct,'' said Wagstaff. ``I think Alaska
has taken some very serious hits as far as public relations is
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the way in which Alaska oversees and performs what
is known as ``heavy maintenance,'' or extensive structural
inspections. The carrier's 35 MD-80s undergo heavy maintenance at
Hangar 6 off Earhart Road at Oakland International Airport, while
its 54 Boeing 737s are primarily inspected in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said Alaska would be prohibited from contracting out its
heavy maintenance work. ``It would be illogical for them to
out-source to other companies'' if the airline could not follow its
own procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Francois, president of Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal
Association Local 37 in Oakland, declined to comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA probe of Alaska comes as the federal grand jury in San
Francisco continues to investigate allegations that airline
mechanics falsified repair records in Oakland. Since 1998, FBI
agents have seized records for 11 MD-80 planes. The probe grew &LR; 
 &LR; expanded last month to include records for the plane that crashed
January 31.
</P>
<P>
   The crash remains under investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board, the FBI and the Department of
Transportation's inspector general. The probe has focused on the
possible failure of the jackscrew, a key part of the plane's tail
stabilizer system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FAA audit has recast the spotlight on Alaska's
Oakland maintenance facility, where the grand jury investigation
began in 1998 as a result of allegations by John Liotine, 37, of
Pittsburg, Calif., a former lead mechanic and Francois' predecessor
who is on paid administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has proposed fining Alaska $44,000 and recommended that
three supervisors in Oakland have their mechanic's licenses
revoked, saying the airline operated two planes in an
``unairworthy'' manner. Alaska has denied any wrongdoing and is
challenging the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   At the airline's hangar in Seattle, 64 Alaska mechanics signed a
letter in March accusing maintenance manager Robert Falla of
pressuring them to take shortcuts on repairs. The airline has
denied that any unsafe planes were put into service.
</P>
<P>
   Falla has since been reassigned to a nonsupervisory job and has
been replaced by Kurt Kinder, a former line maintenance supervisor,
Alaska said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Flight 261 crash, Alaska has been plagued by a
series of other problems on flights this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the airline said it plans to fire two pilots for
continuing a flight in March from Portland, Ore., to San Jose with
oxygen masks deployed after they failed to pressurize the Boeing
737 jet. Also in march, a passenger tried to wrestle the controls
from a pilot during a flight from Mexico to San Francisco. &QL;

MOTOR VEHICLES CHIEF QUITS AMID ACCUSATIONS ON EMISSIONS TESTS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ The commissioner of the Connecticut State
Motor Vehicles Department, Jose O. Salinas, resigned on Thursday
amid a growing clamor over accusations of fraud in the state's
emissions testing program, which is run by an outside contractor,
Envirotest Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gov. John Rowland, Salinas said he planned to
resign effective June 29. But Rowland, who has been described by
aides as increasingly frustrated with the fraud accusations, asked
that the resignation take effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Seymour, a spokesman for the Department of Motor Vehicles,
said the resignation was unrelated to the accusations. Salinas, a
lawyer, decided to return to a post in the attorney general's
office, Seymour said, because ``his first real love was the
practice of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The emissions testing case began in March with the arrests of
three inspectors here who were charged with falsifying emissions
test results in exchange for payments from car owners of $50 to
$60.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth inspector was arrested in April, in Darien, after
officials from Envirotest told state police investigators that he
had sold a passing sticker for $80. The emissions test, required
every two years, costs $20; cars that fail must be repaired and
tested again.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said he
had received reports of widespread corruption in the emissions
testing program and wrote to Salinas urging a broad investigation
into allegations of bribery, fraud and theft.
</P>
<P>
   That same week, Rowland ordered an independent audit of
Envirotest, which has run the emissions inspection program since
1994 under a 10-year, $25 million contract from the state. The
company, based in East Granby, operates 25 testing stations and
inspects 1.5 million cars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is not a
target of the audit or the state police investigation. But some
people, including Rowland, have questioned whether the Motor
Vehicles Department exercised proper contract oversight. ``The
governor obviously is very concerned about the integrity of the
emissions testing program,'' said his spokesman, Dean Pagani.
Pagani said the governor had instructed the auditors to look at
both the private contractor and the motor vehicle agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is seriously asking whether the management at DMV has done
a sufficient job in overseeing that contract,'' Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud allegations relate to various automobile tests that
are performed by more than 300 employees of Envirotest around the
state, including exhaust-system emission tests and gas-cap tests
that check fuel vapor emissions. The arrested inspectors have been
accused of conducting multiple emissions tests on cars that they
know will pass to generate an extra pass report and sticker for a
car that would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Sanders, a spokeswoman for Envirotest, said the company
had cooperated fully with investigators and was vigilant about
fraud.

CENSUS TALLY BODES WELL FOR BORDER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 4) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Elena Garcia was off driving her school bus
when a census worker came to count her family in Valle Escondido, a
flood-prone colonia near the banks of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was glad when the census worker returned the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we were counted,'' said Garcia, who explained that
her household of five was missed in the 1990 Census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was real nice,'' she said of the census taker. ``He
read the questions twice and repeated them in Spanish if I had
trouble understanding. And he explained why he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   The census worker who twice visited the Garcia home is among the
1,500 enumerators and hundreds of Spanish-speaking helpers hired to
hand-deliver census forms to hard-to-find residents on the border.
The workers are conducting an unprecedented, door-to-door effort to
count thousands of residents living in substandard border
subdivisions, known as colonias, and other remote communities, many
without addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the first time, we'll have a really good sense of
how many colonias there are. We'll have a good sense of how many
people live there, and what their needs are,'' said Frank Newton,
spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau's regional office in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The count is significant, because population numbers are used to
determine such things as federal money for public projects and
congressional and legislative districts, which translate into
political power.
</P>
<P>
   The Garcia family, who were nearly flooded out of their
wood-frame home during torrential rains in 1990 and 1994, hope this
census will translate into federal money for much-needed services
in their rural neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need here, the most important thing is the sewage
(system),'' said Garcia, who has snapshots of a neighborhood pig
who took refuge on her front porch during the flood. ``In 1990, the
water came up almost to the windows and we have septic tanks and it
was all coming out. It was ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials estimate that they missed an estimated half
million Texans during the count 10 years ago, and many of those
were Hispanics like the Garcias who live in the 1,800 colonias from
Brownsville to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   This year, to get a more accurate count, many of the census
workers hired were residents of colonias. A major key, Newton said,
was a $90,000 grant to Texas A&AMP;M's University Center for Housing
and Urban Development, which operates community centers in eight
colonias from Brownsville to El Paso. The center trains residents
to become community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the four-county Brownsville-McAllen region, the
housing center trained nearly 1,000 colonia residents. Thirty of
those were colonia leaders, known by the Spanish term promotoras,
and all were hired to help census workers interview residents in
the area's 120 colonias.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it wasn't just a government official coming in and talking
to the people; it was one of their next-door neighbors,'' Newton
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau also worked hard to literally put many
colonias on the map, using both promotoras and aerial photographs
to help map unnamed subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, Newton said the census was slightly under 99
percent complete in the El Paso, Laredo and McAllen districts _
among the best in the nation. Early reports from officials along
the Texas border say the census strategy appears to be working.
They note that an accurate count reflecting the tremendous
population growth on the border could have significant political
and financial implications for the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, this census should open eyes especially in South
Texas, where we have had 25 percent to 30 percent growth in certain
counties. I expect the political power in those areas will have
grown considerably,'' predicts State Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, a
Democrat from El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good count to us means power and money,'' he said. ``We
learned our lesson last census that El Paso County would lose
millions of dollars with a bad count.''
</P>
<P>
   A multimedia awareness campaign was launched before the count
that included signs, bilingual television and radio commercials
featuring pitches from elected officials, the Catholic bishop and
other community leaders, said El Paso census official Jesse Acosta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached this like a political campaign,'' said Acosta, a
partnership specialist who has been doing advance work for the
census since 1998. ``The county kicked in $50,000 to help promote
the census. We went out and littered the entire county with signs _
we had signs under every rock. People couldn't miss the census, so
it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are some Rio Grande Valley residents who, although
they agree with the approach taken this year, wonder if the count
is as comprehensive as claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be more wishful thinking than reality,'' said Ray
Gill, an attorney for the Texas Civil Rights Project in San Juan.
``But there has been marked success over the last census (in 1990),
which woefully undercounted folks in the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill and others say many colonia residents are still afraid
that, despite repeated public assurances by census officials, their
immigration status will be reported to Immigration and
Naturalization Service agents. It did not help that Border Patrol
agents were raiding homes in colonias as the census began.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a lot of people who have had experiences
themselves or their families with government agencies, whether it's
the INS, the Border Patrol or state or local police, that have been
extremely negative,'' Gill said. ``People are very distrustful and
very fearful of having representatives of the U.S. government in
their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, census officials were predicting that this year's
count will encompass 99 percent of Texans before the official end
July 7, the most thorough count ever. And this time, colonia
residents won't be left out, Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the work we've done, all the preliminary things to
identify in a legal and geographic sense, where the colonias are,
and working with residents,'' Newton said, ``I've got to believe
we're going to do a lot better.''

BLAZERS' PLAY FORCES THE LAKERS TO GAME 7
</HEADLINE>
  By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ They wore determined looks and shook their
heads from side to side, gesturing to the Los Angeles Lakers
throughout Game 6 that the Western Conference finals would not end
in their house.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night the Portland Trail Blazers protected the Rose
Garden like pit bulls, stopping the Lakers at every key moment for
a 103-93 victory to tie the series at 3-3 and force Game 7 on
Sunday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by 3-1, the Trail Blazers are in position
to become only the seventh team in NBA history to win a best-of-7
series after falling behind by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith, the 31-year-old guard, fired daggers into the
Lakers' hearts throughout the game and finished with 26 points.
Rasheed Wallace added 18 and Damon Stoudamire 14. Scottie Pippen,
quiet through three quarters, contributed nine points and several
clutch defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant had 33 points and Shaquille O'Neal had 17, his
lowest total against Portland this season, and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys came out with a passion and the intensity that had
been lacking in previous games,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy
said. ``There's no fear factor for us going down there. Everybody
wanted a Game 7. Now we got one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonzi Wells energized an already raucous home crowd with 20
points in 19 minutes. Wells, who played only six minutes in three
quarters, hit back-to-back baskets to give the Trail Blazers a
79-68 lead with 9 minutes 11 seconds to play. Moments later, Brian
Grant hit two free throws to put Portland ahead by 13 and force the
Lakers to scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Games 3 and 4, when the Trail Blazers blew double-digit
leads, they held steady in the third quarter Friday night. The
Lakers could chip only two points off Portland's lead and trailed
by 71-63. A dunk and a jump shot by Wallace and two free throws
each from Pippen and Smith held off a Los Angeles surge, before
Bryant drilled a 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds left in the quarter to
move the Lakers within eight points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers cut their 10-point halftime deficit to 49-44 with a
3-point play by Ron Harper and a 3-point shot from Glen Rice. The
Trail Blazers quickly countered, though, with a 10-5 run for some
breathing space at 58-49 midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers' 49-39 halftime lead was earned without any
offense from Pippen, who took only one shot, a 3-pointer in the
second quarter. Pippen's presence was felt with three rebounds and
two assists, but mostly he left the heavy lifting to Smith,
Stoudamire and Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Stoudamire scored 12 points each and Wallace added 11
as the Trail Blazers twice built 15-point leads early in the second
quarter. Smith was 6 of 9 from the field and Stoudamire, easily
surpassing his 8.8-point average for the series, hit 6 of 10
field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace came alive late in the second quarter with seven points.
His short jump shot and dunk in the final 1:30 held off a Lakers'
rally that had twice pulled them within eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, nursing a sprained foot suffered early in Game 5, led
the Lakers in the first half with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   As for most of the series, O'Neal was ominously quiet in the
first half. With the Trail Blazers sticking to him like lint, he
made 4 of 8 field-goal attempts for eight points and grabbed five
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we got in their heads,'' Stoudamire had said
before the tip-off. ``But we gave them something to think about. I
definitely don't think they thought they were coming back to
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people had buried us. Probably the only people in the
country who thought we were going to win that last game was us.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's mission was apparent from the start. Once again, the
Trail Blazers flung themselves at the Lakers from all angles and
set a blistering pace. Smith and Stoudamire were especially hot,
carrying the Trail Blazers to a 26-15 lead through one quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was in the starting lineup despite his sprained foot,
although concern about his injury caused the Lakers to make a
defensive adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had guarded Pippen for most of the series, but was
switched to Stoudamire. Rice was assigned to Pippen, a matchup that
the Trail Blazers did not need to exploit after they blitzed the
Lakers early.

BLAZERS PLAN TO GO TO FINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ It began with Damon Stoudamire, a guy so little
that when he tucks in his jersey, the number on his back disappears
into his trunks like some minute T-baller.
</P>
<P>
   It continued with Steve Smith, the former Hawks star turned
Portland Trail Blazers role player, making like an unstoppable
force.
</P>
<P>
   It kept rolling with Rasheed Wallace, pumping fists and jumpers,
and off the bench with Bonzi Wells, and with a seeming army to
bring Shaquille O'Neal crashing down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was over, when the Blazers had pushed the Los
Angeles Lakers into a dangerous final Game 7 with a 103-93 victory
on Friday night, the Blazers were a team brimming with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The team the Lakers thought they had left for dead here last
weekend, now returns to Los Angeles very much alive, very much an
unwanted guest and very much believing it is headed for the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they knew even being up 3-1, this series was far from
over,'' said the Blazers' Scottie Pippen. ``We gave them a couple
of games and they really didn't have anything to hang their hats
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Only six teams in NBA history have ever come back from a 3-1
deficit, but with the Western Conference Finals now tied up 3-3,
the Blazers are convinced they are about to join the historic list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying since Game 1, there is no momentum,'' said
Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy. ``There is no homecourt advantage.
There's only one game at a time and you have to bring it. This
(last) one is going to finalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire did his Mighty Mite thing, sparking the Blazers
early. The Portland point guard had struggled through most of the
series. He played only 15 minutes in Portland's win in Los Angeles
in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Lakers jumped out to a quick lead, Stoudamire
became a near one-man gang. Guarded by Kobe Bryant, and no doubt
aware Bryant was struggling with a sprained right foot, Stoudamire
consistently drove to the hoop. He keyed a 12-2 spurt by the
Blazers that gave them the lead for good, scoring four of the
baskets and passing off for another. He finished with 14 points,
seven rebounds and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damon played a great game tonight,'' Dunleavy said. ``He did a
terrific job. Damon did all the things we wanted him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers act like a team clueless about stopping Smith, who's
been successful posting up Bryant and others throughout the series.
On Friday night, Smith scored a Portland-high 26 points _ nine
coming in the third quarter when the Blazers fought off the Lakers'
only real charge _ scoring from all over the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the heart and soul of our team, along with
Rasheed,'' Pippen said. ``We have a 6-8 guy who can handle the ball
and go to the basket. We have great confidence in each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells is no longer able to slip by as the Blazers' stealth
weapon. He stepped up big in the final quarter to keep the Lakers
in their place. Wells scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonzi can come in and put up some big-time numbers,'' Dunleavy
said. ``I wouldn't have him there as a go-to guy if he couldn't do
it. He's explosive. He gets on a roll and you ride him, and we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has led the Blazers throughout the postseason, and
Friday he again left the Lakers looking like they had no one to
guard him. Wallace scored 18 points on 6 of 10 field goals.

IT'S THE USUAL SUSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The winning team wangled glorious performances
out of its peripheral players, got a gritty performance from a
guard who wasn't expected to play much, attacked the boards as if
jet-propelled and did all this and more with a sneer worthy of one
of Jack Nicholson's characters.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, one of the Portland Trail Blazers stole the Los
Angeles Lakers' game plan Friday.
</P>
<P>
   We're sure the culprit would have been caught, had every
Portland player been detained long enough to be fingerprinted after
Game 6 of the Western Conference finals. The trouble was, the Rose
Garden security corps was otherwise occupied, harnessing the
revelers luxuriating in the Trail Blazers' 103-93 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Though we'll never know who absconded with the blueprint that
was supposed to work to the Lakers' advantage, the culprits who
forced a deciding Game 7 Sunday at the Staples Center were easy
enough to identify. After all, there were 20,340 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith assuredly was one of Portland's perpetrators. He
made six of nine shots in the first half and surpassed his series
scoring average of 16.8 points before the game was 36 minutes old.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Damon Stoudamire. That rascal looked to be the
ringleader.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10 point guard figured he'd be lucky to log the 15
minutes he had played in Game 5. The Trail Blazers had employed a
bigger lineup to beat the Lakers on Tuesday and it made perfect
sense for them to stick with what had brought them renewed life.
</P>
<P>
   Only Stoudamire saw the flaw in the logic. He came out and
attacked Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, who was hampered by a foot
injury that left his playing status up in the air. He held up all
right on offense _ he finished with a game-high 33 points _ but
Bryant looked as helpless as a hitchhiker on the side of the road
every time Stoudamire drove on him.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire finished the first half with 12 points, eight more
than his 7-foot-3 teammate Arvydas Sabonis. He also had one blocked
shot in that span, which was one more than the Lakers' seven
footer, Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-point lead the Trail Blazers fashioned in the first half
was a wall the Lakers couldn't quite scale. Every time they got
close to the top, they seemed to lose their footing.
</P>
<P>
   Blame Bonzi Wells. He was another unlikely culprit in the Trail
Blazers' grand theft. He came off the bench to contribute 20 points
_ 12 more than his series average _ and four rebounds, three on the
offensive end. He was leaping as if his life depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   You talk about matchup problems; there wasn't a Laker on this
night who could match Wells' will.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith and Stoudamire and Wells stealing the spotlight,
Scottie Pippen repaired to the shadows. The Trail Blazers put 47
points on the scoreboard and built a lead that stretched to as many
as 15 points before Pippen took his first shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen made his presence felt in other ways, collecting five
defensive rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots. Rasheed
Wallace and Pippen, the Trail Blazers' leading scorers, were a
combined 7 for 16 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal took one more shot than the both of them on his way to a
very, very quiet 17 points. His postgame mumblings were louder.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers' game plan from the beginning has been to
contain the Lakers' stars, O'Neal and Bryant, and make the Lakers'
other players beat them. On this night nobody but Brian Shaw (12
points in 15 minutes) answered the call.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice didn't; he missed more shots than he made on his way
to 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper couldn't; he had zero assists to go along with seven
points.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry wouldn't; he tried just four shots and made zero
3-pointers en route to six points.
</P>
<P>
   So the series will go the distance. At the beginning, the
so-called experts were predicting as much.
</P>
<P>
   This series, remember, is the NBA's answer to CBS's
``Survivor,'' with the two teams with the best regular-season
records thrown together to see who will emerge as the last one
standing in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Survival is all that matters. Style points don't count. If on
Sunday the Lakers can avoid losing three games in a row for the
first time all season, nobody will care if it took them seven games
to dispose of the Trail Blazers or five.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are 48 minutes from glory. That's what they need to
focus on, not the 96 minutes they've squandered this week.

HOT-HITTING ANGELS HAVE THEIR WAY WITH DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Interleague play hasn't been kind to the
Anaheim Angels, so they brought in a couple of ringers from the
National League Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Kent Bottenfield and second baseman Adam Kennedy's N.L.
experience might not be the answer to reversing the Angels' woes
against the National League. But the 29th worst interleague team
will take any advantage available.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield's pitching wasn't spectacular and Kennedy probably
isn't ready to declare his slump over but their contributions were
enough to lift the Angels past the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-5 before
a sellout crowd of 43,619 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Since interleague play was created three years ago, the Angels
were just 20-30 overall and 5-9 against their Southern California
neighbors. Only the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (9-25) have suffered more
interleague grief than the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield and Kennedy were acquired from the St. Louis
Cardinals in the Jim Edmonds trade on March 23. But Bottenfield has
yet to match his 1999 breakout year in St. Louis and Kennedy has
cooled considerably following a quick start.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, who went 18-7 in an All-Star year with the
Cardinals, took a 3-5 record and a 5.00 ERA into his 12th start for
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old right-hander labored at times over five innings.
He threw just 61 of 107 pitches for strikes, walked three and
allowed seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (4-5) made key pitches when needed, outside of
allowing a solo homer to Eric Karros and a three-run shot by Paul
LoDuca.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a Cal State Northridge product, was one of many heroes
in a lethal Angels offensive barrage. He helped end Darren
Dreifort's night with a three-run homer in the fourth and added an
RBI single in the sixth and a third base hit in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The homer broke an 0-for-10 tailspin for Kennedy, who had a
brief call-up to the big-league level with St. Louis last year.
Kennedy went 3 for 27 on the Angels' recent nine-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's average had sagged to .257, and after sitting down the
final two games of the trip, he was demoted to eighth in the
batting order.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just trying to get that feeling back and have
confidence at the plate,'' Kennedy said before Friday's game.
``Once that comes, I think I'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy wasn't the only Angel to escape the doldrums. Shortstop
Benji Gil doubled twice from the ninth spot, after he suffered an 0
for 24 spell that was snapped with a two-hit game on Wednesday at
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Every Angels starter but Mo Vaughn collected at least one hit
Friday, led by Garret Anderson (single, double, solo homer).
Anaheim scored in five of the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (3-3) had his third shaky start in four outings since
his brilliant two-hit shutout of the Cardinals on May 12. The
Angels almost knocked him out in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The first six Anaheim hitters reached base safely. The only out
Dreifort could record in that span was thanks to his catcher,
LoDuca, who threw out Darin Erstad stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon's run-scoring single and a two-run single by Troy
Glaus gave Bottenfield an early 3-0 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had chances against Bottenfield, but one sloppy
base-running blunder killed a threat in the third when the deficit
was still manageable.
</P>
<P>
   After Alex Cora led off the third with a double, Todd
Hollandsworth reached on an infield single that was smothered by
Gil behind second base.
</P>
<P>
   Cora never hesitated coming despite what appeared to be a stop
sign from third-base coach Glenn Hoffman. Cora was easily thrown
out by Gil and the Dodgers didn't score in the inning.

KOBE DID ALL HE COULD DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ With Shaquille O'Neal off target, Phil Jackson
stumped for answers and the Los Angeles Lakers' cool melting away,
they laid Friday night's playoff game at the feet of Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   He responded as you'd expect from a young man with one good foot
and one bad.
</P>
<P>
   The good: Bryant took up the challenge like a hero in the
making, playing all 48 minutes, raining a game-high 24 shots and
scoring a game-high 33 points.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: It wasn't nearly enough for the Lakers, who got too
little from their healthy players, lost to the Portland Trail
Blazers 103-93 and now face an all-or-nothing Game 7 in the NBA
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest test, Bryant passed and the Lakers failed.
</P>
<P>
   It figured to be his night _ one way or the other _ from the
start. From before the start.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had sprained his right foot in the Lakers' loss at the
Staples Center on Tuesday. He'd sat out the Lakers' two practices
since then. He skipped Friday morning's shoot-around at the Rose
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers listed him as a ``probable'' starter but that didn't
diminish the drama. A gametime decision was promised.
</P>
<P>
   Would he play? Would he !ital!ever emerge from his long
treatment session in the trainer's room?
</P>
<P>
   He started. Deep down, everybody knew he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a blessing in disguise,'' Lakers forward Robert
Horry said. ``He won't be able to run around so much.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Horry supposed the irrepressible 21-year-old
might not feel he had to take the offense on his shoulders, as he
often does to the detriment of Jackson's team concept.
</P>
<P>
   So, sure enough, Kobe came out . . . firing.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked down a step-back 20-footer, was fouled by Scottie
Pippen and completed the three-point play the first time the Lakers
had the ball. He took the shots on the Lakers' first three
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of nervous about it at first. I had to test it,''
he said. ``This kind of game, you've got to push through it. If I
hurt it worse, I hurt it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I started playing, I didn't think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the foot seemed to rob Bryant of his drive to the basket. Or
maybe it was the Blazers. The Lakers were down by 11 before Ron
Harper drove to their first layup.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed by 10 at halftime. The difference was the scoring
by the backcourts. Portland guards Steve Smith, Damon Stoudamire
and Bonzi Wells had 30; Pippen, unbelievably, had shot only once.
L.A. guards Bryant, Ron Harper, Brian Shaw and Derek Fisher had
combined for 18; Kobe had 14 of those.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Neal had been held to 8. The Lakers can operate as
a two-man team but not one.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever was going on beneath that black sock and shoe on his
right foot, it seemed to hurt his defense more than his offense.
</P>
<P>
   You can choose your push-off foot when you have the ball. You
have to go both directions when you're guarding Stoudamire or
Smith. Sometimes you feel as if you have to go both ways at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Kobe played OK, but I wasn't pleased with his
defense,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers kept working their way inside. The Lakers couldn't
spell defense for long stretches, giving up eight scoring
possessions in a row to fall behind 26-15, never to recover.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was getting battered under the basket, had lost the range
from the free-throw line, and finished with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice was held to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Before Brian Shaw threw in four straight 3-pointers as the
Lakers tried but failed to come back in the fourth quarter, the
guards' contribution was . . . Kobe's contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of carrying your team _ but not far enough _
showed on Kobe's face. He was reduced to a pouting kid when Arvydas
Sabonis hammered him to the red-painted floor after he split a
double-teaming defense, and Bryant didn't get the foul call.
</P>
<P>
   The 33 points, including 6 of 9 3-pointers, were Bryant's
highest in 13 games, since he tried but failed to carry them in
their game 3 defeat in the Sacramento Kings series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we expect from him,'' Fisher said of the attempted
heroism, not the defeat. ``We knew if Kobe got there, he was going
to perform well. We just have to figure out a way to put together a
consistent performance.''
</P>
<P>
   One man, on one foot, wasn't enough.

SOX LOSE IN EXTRA INNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-PHILLIES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ On their most recent tour through the National
League, the Red Sox must have found themselves asking, ``Haven't we
taken this vacation before?''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been hotter than they imagined (87 degrees at the
first pitch), quirkier than they remembered (a 19-minute light
delay), and longer than they wanted (3 hours 35 minutes). But when
all information was gathered at the end, the result was the same:
The Sox lost to an NL team.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies won it in 11 innings Friday night at Veterans
Stadium, 2-1. The game ended when John Wasdin couldn't get a
fastball by pinch hitter Alex Arias. Before pitching to Arias _ who
knocked a long single over a defense that was playing for a short
single _ Wasdin walked Brian Hunter and hit Desi Relaford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I was having some problems with my control,'' Wasdin
said. ``I thought my velocity was good and, with the heat, it was
easy to get loose.'' But as much as Wasdin struggled on this night,
the Sox have struggled with interleague play since it began in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   They were 6-12 against NL competition last season. They are
21-29 all time. They are 0-1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams might say, the kids certainly competed. But their
competition didn't lead to anything significant off righthander
Robert Person in the first six innings, although it appeared from
the start that Person would have a long night. Literally and
figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed for 19 minutes in the top of the first
because all the stadium's lights were not turned on. So, before
they could be flicked on, all of them had to be turned off first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange things happen in baseball, huh?'' Sox starter Brian
Rose said of the delay. ``If it was going to affect anybody, it
would have affected Person. He had already pitched to a guy (Donnie
Sadler) when the game was stopped. It didn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply turning the lights on here takes seven minutes. When
Person finally began to work again, he wasn't sharp. He issued four
walks in the first three innings, including a surprising one to
Rose in the second. But it was the Phillies, not the Sox, who
scored the second-inning run. Brian Hunter, who came into the game
batting .171, doubled home Kevin Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   If any team would have trouble scoring, you would think it would
be this bunch, owners of the NL's worst record. The Phillies also
are missing Rico Brogna and Scott Rolen. But the Sox were able to
give no support to Rose, who left after pitching six innings of
four-hit, three-walk (two intentional) ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not too much to say,'' said a raspy-voiced Rose, who
has been sick (clubhouse virus) the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   The look and sound of the game changed in the eighth. Philly
fans, known for their famous intensity, were almost serene with
their team leading, 1-0. That was before Carl Everett connected
with a Wayne Gomes outside breaking ball and slammed it into the
visitors' bullpen in left field. It was Everett's 18th (he had 25
all of last year), and he has homered in four consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   After the shot, fans became increasingly restless with each
single. They taunted Gomes with chants of ``Gopher.'' The reliever
allowed three consecutive singles to Troy O'Leary, Jason Varitek,
and Wilton Veras. On the Veras single, which came with two outs,
third base coach Wendell Kim tried to get O'Leary home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they score that run, that could have been the ballgame,''
Gant said. ``It was one of those do-or-die plays. You can't think
about the ball being thrown too high or too low. That's one of
those plays where you just come up firing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gant did that, making a perfect throw to Mike Lieberthal, who
blocked the plate and tagged O'Leary out. If the Sox were awarded
runs for defensive brilliance, they would have had at least two in
the first. Doug Glanville led off with a drive to center. Everett
dived for the ball, retrieved it on a hop, and then quickly jumped
off the turf as if he had been scorched, and threw a strike to
Nomar Garciaparra at second. Glanville's foot slid off the bag, and
the Sox had a spectacular 8-6 put out. But on this night, they
weren't so fortunate at the plate. The Phillies weren't much
better, but they were one run better. Which is to say, one game
better. Again.

PORTLAND PULLS EVEN IN SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Ever the patient ones, ever the
procrastinators, ever the NBA's drama queens, ever the shameless
teases, the Los Angeles Lakers sat perched and waiting to spring on
their first NBA Finals berth in nine years Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   And perched, they sat.
</P>
<P>
   And sat. And sat.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time they tried to spring, tried to replicate the
kind of late charges that put them in control of this series in the
first place, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 was lost, the Lakers' advance stalled once more, as they
fell 103-93 to the supercharged Portland Trail Blazers before a
raucous 20,340 at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, once up 3-1, have procrastinated themselves right
into a deciding Game 7 in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of disappointing, but we also realized it would be
hard toget three games up here,'' said Shaquille O'Neal. ``So we
just have to be ready on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal struggled through a sea of Blazer defenders and was held
to 17 points on 7-of-17 shooting _ a statistic he attributed to
uncalled Portland fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why I missed,'' he said. ``You all saw the
(bleeping) game.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Kobe Bryant to try to deliver the series
singlehandedly _ and with a single foot, no less _ and he came
through with a game-high 33 points, but the Lakers were otherwise
impotent. Especially on defense,as they allowed the Blazers to
shoot 50 percent, with five players in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, shaking off a the effects of a sore right foot, played
all 48 minutes and made 12 of 24 shots, including a torrent of four
3-pointers in a desperate fourth-quarter charge. But the game had
long been decided, the Lakers trailing from the first quarter on.
</P>
<P>
   So the Indiana Pacers have to wait two more days to discover the
identity of their Finals dance partner, and the Lakers and Blazers
will duel once more, Sunday at 4:30 p.m. at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we wanted,'' said Glen Rice, the Lakers' third
highest scorer with 12 points. ``But we know we have to win this
thing. That game is going to be a war. It's going to be a real
emotional game, a very rough game.''
</P>
<P>
   A brief charge at the start of the third quarter got the Lakers
within4 points, but they quickly faded again under a 9-2 Blazers
run. O'Neal made just 2 of 8 field-goal attempts in the quarter,
and the Lakers trailed by 8 points, 71-63, heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The series stayed true to form as the Blazers took control early
and took a 49-39 lead into halftime, riding a three-pronged attack
of Rasheed Wallace (11 points), Steve Smith and Damon Stoudamire
(12 each).
</P>
<P>
   But Stoudamire's inclusion in that group was one of many
oddities in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring was a zero-point effort from Pippen _ the
Blazers' most prolific scorer in their victories _ despite the fact
he was guarded by slow-footed Glen Rice, instead of Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Lakers emphasized the need to hammer Portland
inside with O'Neal, he scored just 8 points in the half, on 4-of-8
shooting. He also missed all six of his free throws _- in contrast
to his last trip here, when he went 9 for 9 in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Oddest of all was a 14-point half from Bryant to lead the
Lakers. Despite his sore foot, Bryant scored the Lakers' first two
points, later threw down a one-handed dunk and made 5 of 11 shots.
</P>
<P>
   He also had three steals in the half but otherwise seemed
limited on defense. Bryant was assigned to Stoudamire, and later
Smith, and both took advantage of his hobbled foot with drives to
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire, a bit player for most of the series, led the charge
for Portland. The Lakers led 9-6 in the first quarter before the
Stoudamire caught fire, scoring 8 points, with three layups, in a
14-2 run. The Lakers trailed 26-15 by the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Portland extended the lead to as much as 15 points in the second
quarter and shot 56.1 percent in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' shaky opening included eight turnovers in the first
half _ with two apiece by O'Neal and Bryant _ which Portland cashed
in for 12 points.

PACERS CLOSE OUT KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A little more than three years ago, he told Pacers
president Donnie Walsh he could get his non-playoff team to the
Finals, and that is exactly what Larry Bird has done.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Reggie Miller had something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about me,'' said Bird. ``It's never been about me.
I'm just so happy for the older players. They're gonna play for the
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no ageism connected with the new Eastern Conference
champion Indiana Pacers, 93-80 conquerors of the New York Knicks in
Friday night's Game 6 at Madison Square Garden. You've got Sam
Perkins, who will be 39 in 11 days; Mark Jackson, 35; Miller, 34;
Derrick McKey and Rik Smits, 33; Dale Davis, 31; and even
36-year-old Chris Mullin, who did not play but who may yet have his
moment to shine before the season is over. They've been a-knockin'
on the door of the Finals since 1994, and now they have kicked the
door down with a clutch road effort many people doubted they would
see from the supposedly soft Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we could win one road game,'' said Bird. ``I wasn't
sayin' we could win two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of guys had a hand in this, but the Man of the Match was
the Human Matchstick himself. For, absent his sweet shooting, the
Pacers would be suiting up for Game 7 in Conseco Fieldhouse Sunday
afternoon. But, in this game, Miller was, well, Bird-esque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' said Bird in reference to Miller's 34-point effort
that included five 3-pointers, three of them in the first six
minutes of the final period, when the Pacers were putting enough
space between themselves and the increasingly frustrated Knicks to
ensure they could spend the final three minutes at the foul line
(28 for 31).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that Miller was making shots. It was what he was
making. He was making shots only the truly great make _ deep,
clutch, hump-busting jumpers normal people can only dream of.
``Last year, we were beaten in this series by Allan Houston and
Latrell Sprewell, who could literally create a shot any time they
wanted,'' said assistant coach Rick Carlisle. ``Over the summer,
Reggie studied his game and their game. He worked very hard to
create a new dimension for himself. Now he isn't restricted to just
beating you off screens. He can also beat you one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   For five games, people were wondering when Miller would explode.
Friday night, they found out. His major run started with a huge
hoop, a 3-pointer with 25.2 seconds left in the third quarter that
tied the game at 62 and enabled the Pacers, having just blown a
50-41 lead with 5-for-23 third-period shooting, to enter the fourth
period on the up-tick.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, a noble loser in this one (32 points), nailed a three
to start the fourth. But, following two Austin Croshere free
throws, Miller answered with a right-wing three to regain the lead
at 67-65. It was Miller again with a three at the clock that made
it 72-65 (``Probably the biggest shot of the game,'' said Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy), and it was Miller once more with a step-back
three out of his coach's playbook that made it 75-68. The man who
long ago proclaimed how much he loved being the enemy was now being
deliciously villainous.
</P>
<P>
   New York never mounted a response, and now it was Travis Best's
turn to torment the hosts. First the Springfield, Mass., lefthander
drilled a face-up jumper. Then he got real nasty, sinking a running
hook high off the glass. That made it 81-71 with 2:25 to go. You
should have seen the natives scurrying for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana had been the aggressor from the start, grabbing a 30-25
one-period lead with some exemplary ball movement. New York got
back into it in the third, when an opening 11-2 blast turned the
game around. But the most New York could squeeze ahead by was 3,
and each of the last two times they did so, Miller had something to
say about it.
</P>
<P>
   Long, long ago, in a far more innocent world, the Pacers won
three ABA titles. Outside that little fraternity, people yawned.
Wednesday, they will begin play for the real championship. ``They
have no idea what to expect,'' said Bird.
</P>
<P>
   But Bird does. That's why Donnie Walsh hired him.

BLAZERS FORCE GAME 7
</HEADLINE>
 BLAZERS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ They came to the Rose Garden Friday night
bearing signs, balloons, hearty voices, boundless energy, and,
above all, an abiding faith in their Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   They were not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The little people and the big hitters _ how do Bill Gates, Tiger
Woods, and Steven Spielberg sound for starters? _ bore witness to
the continuing Kafkaesque story that has become the Western
Conference Finals. Down, 3-1, six days ago and on the precipice,
the resurgent Blazers took a 103-93 decision over the suddenly
submissive Lakers to even the series at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The conference champion will be determined Sunday night at the
Staples Center, where Portland already has won two games in this
series. As the victorious Blazers left the floor Friday night,
several waved their index fingers to the sky, signaling the job was
still not finished. That in itself is a remarkable gesture given
that Portland was all but cooked after losing twice at home last
weekend to fall into the aforementioned 3-1 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're even again. The Blazers got 26 points from Steve
Smith, a ``Where did that come from?'' 20 from Bonzi Wells, and a
big, long game (season-high 45 minutes) from big, long Arvydas
Sabonis. Five Blazers were in double figures, none named Scottie
Pippen. He all but avoided offense and instead focused on
disrupting the Lakers in a 47-minute stint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed him to direct the team, distribute the ball and play
defense,'' Mike Dunleavy said of Pippen. ``He does a lot for us
when he's on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers got 33 points from a gimpy Kobe Bryant, who had not
practiced for two days due to a sore right foot. He still went
wire-to-wire and had six treys. Shaquille O'Neal also played all 48
minutes, but he managed only 17 points, a playoff low against
Portland. It was all Greek to the Big Aristotle Friday night; he
was 7 of 17 from the field and 3 of 10 from the line. No one else
stepped into the breach and the margin was somewhat misleading due
to a late flurry of 3-pointers by the Lakers. Los Angeles was 12 of
19 from international waters.
</P>
<P>
   Former Celtic Rick Fox was also in it at the end, but only in a
provacative sense. He jawed with Dunleavy _ ``I was asking him for
good restaurants in LA,'' the Blazers' coach joked _ and also
baited Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   LA coach Phil Jackson said he liked Fox's energy and
aggressiveness. ``That's why he's out there,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the posturing already has begun, it would not be
necessary at this stage had not Portland staged a fairly dramatic
about-face. The Blazers became the 14th team to tie a series after
being down 3-1. Six teams have won series after being in a 3-1
hole, the last being the 1997 Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a dogfight,'' Dunleavy said. ``We wanted this
opportunity and now we have it. There's no fear factor on our
part.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers? ``They're not happy, that's for sure,'' Jackson
said. ``But they understand they only lost a battle. The war is not
over.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not. Portland made sure of that. The Blazers took an
11-point lead after one, getting a great jump-start from Damon
Stoudamire, who, in a twist, found himself guarded by Bryant. That
was due to concerns about Bryant's lateral quickness. He had been
guarding Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Portland was in Constitutional Mode:
preserve, protect, and defend. It didn't hurt that the Lakers were
brutal from the line, missing 14 of 27. Or that their bench was
invisible until the fourth quarter. Or that the usually hack-prone
Sabonis stayed out of foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made a few, anticipated bursts, but, each time, the
Blazers had the right response. LA got to within 4 early in the
third (51-47) after a Glen Rice 3-pointer. The Lakers missed a
chance to get closer and then Smith stole the ball from Rice and
went in for a layup. That kicked off a 9-2 Portland run that pushed
the lead back to 11. It was 10 at the break and 8 after three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Seven straight Laker points, capped by a pair of O'Neal free
throws, made it an 83-75 game with 5:31 left. But Pippen (9 points,
six rebounds) was fouled and made two and, after two LA misses,
Smith knocked down Portland's only trey of the night to make it
88-75.
</P>
<P>
   LA, despite knocking down eight treys in the fourth (tying a
playoff record), never got closer than 9 as Wells romped for 14 in
the fourth, bringing the Rose Garden faithful to their feet. They
can only hope it won't be for the last time.

DONALD F. EPHLIN, 74, UAW OFFICIAL WHO NEGOTIATED SATURN PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Del., Mich.)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald F. Ephlin, the senior official of the United Automobile
Workers union who negotiated the pioneering labor agreement that
created the Saturn division of General Motors, died June 2 at his
home in Dearborn Heights, Mich., a Detroit suburb. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ephlin's sons, Dennis, said that his father appeared to
have suffered a heart attack in his sleep early Friday morning, but
said that the coroner had not yet completed his report.
</P>
<P>
   Flags flew at half-staff Friday at Saturn's assembly plants in
Spring Hill, Tenn., and Wilmington, Del., in recognition of
Ephlin's central role in the establishment of Saturn's unusual
approach to labor relations. As the UAW's vice president for
General Motors negotiations from 1983 to 1989, Ephlin negotiated a
comprehensive new labor agreement with GM that allowed for an
innovative approach to labor-management relations in Spring Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional labor agreements between the UAW and the automakers
specified numerous job classifications and did not link workers'
pay to the marketplace success or failure of the cars they built.
The Saturn agreement in Spring Hill linked workers' paychecks
partly to how many Saturn cars were sold each year and eliminated
most job classifications, allowing managers, together with the
local union, to assign workers to whatever tasks most needed doing.
</P>
<P>
   The workers and their union also gained unparalleled veto power
over many management decisions, and even participated in the
selection of dealers and auto parts suppliers. In exchange, GM
promised that Saturn would not lay off workers during slow periods,
training them instead so that they could perform a wider range of
jobs with greater skill.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was long regarded with skepticism by GM executives
and traditional UAW leaders alike. The elimination of complex job
classifications irked union officials and members accustomed to a
system in which workers with considerable seniority could be
assigned less rigorous tasks, like janitorial work, and not be
asked to perform other tasks. GM management was wary of placing
limits on its ability to lay off workers, the automaker's
traditional response to recessions.
</P>
<P>
   When Saturn chose a GM factory in Wilmington, Del., to build the
Saturn midsize sedans that went on sale last year, GM and UAW
leaders decided that the factory would keep a traditional labor
agreement rather than switch to the Spring Hill system. GM has also
forced Saturn over the last several years to share more auto parts
and designs with other GM models, limiting the division's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The workers in Spring Hill have also become dissatisfied with
lower paychecks as Saturn sales have weakened with the small-car
market, and recently the workers elected new local union leaders
who have promised a slightly less unconventional approach to
labor-management relations.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ephlin said that his father had long regarded the
establishment of Saturn as his greatest achievement, but had been
deeply upset in his final years. ``He was very frustrated with
what's going on, the moving of Saturn back into the mainstream,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Mallino, a Saturn spokeswoman, said that the division
retained an independent dealer organization and a unique labor
agreement in Spring Hill. ``We're aligning with GM where it makes
sense to expand our product portfolio,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ephlin was the UAW vice president for Ford Motor negotiations
from 1980 to 1983, and negotiated a series of agreements then that
have created very close cooperation to this day between Ford and
the UAW.
</P>
<P>
   Ephlin is survived by his wife of 50 years, Theresa; three
children: Dennis, of Troy, Mich.; Donald Ephlin Jr., of Whittaker,
Mich.; and Deborah Chappo, of Novi, Mich.; and 10 grandchildren.

OLEG YEFREMOV, 72, MOSCOW THEATER DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Oleg Yefremov, one of Russia's most revered actors and
directors, heir to Konstantin Stanislavsky and chief of the Moscow
Art Theater for 30 years, died on May 24. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung disease, newspapers here reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow Art Theater was founded by Stanislavsky, whose
naturalistic style set the stage for the Method acting taught by
Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Strasberg saw the troupe
perform during its first American tour in 1922-23.
</P>
<P>
   Yefremov (yeff-FREM-off), who became the theater's director in
1970, continued its long tradition of staging Russian classics,
including the plays of Chekhov. Over the years he also championed
young playwrights and introduced directors now regarded as the best
in Russia, like Kama Ginkas and Lev Dodin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Yefremov took his troupe to New York for seven
performances of Chekhov's ``Three Sisters'' at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music. This was the third visit by the theater to the United
States in 100 years. In 1990, when everything Soviet was exotic, he
directed American actors in a cross-cultural production of
Chekhov's ``Ivanov'' at the Yale Repertory Theater. William Hurt
played the title role.
</P>
<P>
   A ceremony at the theater drew all of Moscow's theatrical elite
as well as dignitaries including Mikhail Gorbachev and President
Vladimir Putin, who said Russia had lost ``a great artist and stage
director of brilliance and infinite talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourners and the news media called his death as the end of an
era. Though Yefremov was not a dissident _ one critic described him
as ``a quiet rebel'' _ he was representative of those who came of
age in the late 1950s and '60s during the cultural and social thaw
in Soviet society. It was just as the thaw began that Yefremov and
a like-minded group of actors organized the Sovremennik Theater in
1957. (The word ``sovremennik'' means ``contemporary.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Sovremennik was the most important and popular theater of
that period and remains a center of Moscow cultural life. It has
also played in New York, most recently performing ``The Cherry
Orchard'' on Broadway in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Yefremov became a star in the Soviet Union after playing
an earnest, thoughtful taxi driver in the film ``Three Poplars on
Plyushchikha Street,'' a bittersweet comedy. But it was as a stage
actor and director that he became a legend. His last role was in
1994 as Boris Godunov in the tragedy of the same name by Alexander
Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
   In his final years Yefremov's life seemed increasingly
unsettled. The theater split in 1987 into two separate troupes, the
Gorky Art Theater and the Chekhov Art Theater. Yefremov headed the
Chekhov Art Theater, which was recently shaken by a contract
dispute with a group of actors.

EDITORIAL: A MAMBO KING BOWS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday June 3:
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra leader Tito Puente, who died Wednesday at the age
of 77, fronted a hot Latin jazz orchestra for more than half a
century and was broadly influential as a percussionist, composer
and arranger. Known in the Latino community as El Rey _ The King _
Puente is primarily viewed as a pillar of Latin music. But he was
also an American original _ and a crossover figure in the 1950s,
before the term was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York at the height of the Jazz Age, he made it his
life's mission to form a revolutionary fusion of the Afro-Cuban
rhythms of Latin music with arrangements derived from traditional
jazz. As a friend said recently, ``he came out of nowhere,''
creating a music that was both danceable and intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Puente, the son of Puerto Rican immigrants, was born in East
Harlem in 1923. After playing briefly with the noted singer and
percussionist Machito, he dropped out of school to start his own
group and remained a band leader until his death. He made more than
100 records and won five Grammys. He helped to begin the mambo
craze in the 1950s. The period featured other wildly popular Latin
bands and became the subject of ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs Of
Love,'' a celebrated novel by the Cuban-American writer Oscar
Hijuelos.
</P>
<P>
   Puente's music was clearly shaped by orchestras like those
commanded by Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Fletcher Henderson,
bands that used dance rhythms and jazz improvisations to enormous
effect. Jazz grew cerebral as the decades moved on, culminating in
the laid-back music of Miles Davis, which began in the ``Birth of
the Cool'' sessions at the start of the 1950's.
</P>
<P>
   But Puente continued to swing, with percussion-driven music that
was covered by younger musicians, including Carlos Santana. At an
age when many people have retired, El Rey was playing more than 200
gigs a year and was scheduled to perform in Manhattan on Wednesday,
when he entered the hospital for heart surgery. Tito Puente liked
to say of his beginnings in East Harlem that he was ``born in
rhythm.'' In half a century as percussionist in his bands, he spent
his life in rhythm as well.

EDITORIAL: ON WOMEN'S ISSUES, U.N. CONFERENCE MAY FIND MUCH TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 3:
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday at the United Nations, representatives of
nearly every country and thousands of non-governmental groups are
meeting to talk about what the world has done to improve the lives
of women. The delegates will evaluate what has happened since the
1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, when 187 nations
endorsed a wide range of goals and promised specific actions.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of women's needs is, of course, a broad one,
encompassing poverty _ 70 percent of the poor are female _ health,
domestic violence, armed conflict, political representation and
other issues. One achievement of the Beijing conference was its
acknowledgment that women need to be heard in debates on just about
every kind of policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing conference was the fourth U.N. conference on women,
but more than the others it established concrete targets _ such as
abolishing laws that discriminate against women economically or
increasing the number of women in public administration _ and set
timetables for measuring progress. Activists have found these
benchmarks crucial to holding governments accountable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a
New York-based network of groups, did a survey of progress. It
found that most of the governments represented at Beijing had drawn
up plans to keep their promises, and 64 countries had changed laws.
The growth of local women's groups has been the most important
reason for these advances. Some 30,000 activists attended the
Beijing conference, and they have used its platform to organize
women and to press governments to keep their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   But most of what governments call action is still just lofty
talk and not yet affecting women. The inaction stems partly from
cultural resistance and partly from lack of money to finance new
programs. Governments argue, persuasively, that they are
overwhelmed by AIDS, debt payments and budget cuts demanded by the
International Monetary Fund. But women's issues have never been a
priority, even when progress, as with educating girls, would
benefit the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many governments are not even changing egregious
laws, which costs nothing. In several countries women may not
inherit property. In much of Latin America, a rapist goes free if
he marries the victim. In several Islamic countries, a man may kill
a female relative who has disgraced the family. In Pakistan,
women's testimony has no value in rape cases. In Kuwait, women
still may not vote. ``We have prepared people to ask their
government: `Did you do what you said you would do?''' says Litha
Musyimi-Ogana, a Kenyan activist, who could be speaking for women's
groups everywhere. This is a big achievement, but the answer in too
many places is ``no.''

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S SUMMIT WITH PUTIN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 3:
</P>
<P>
   Meetings between American presidents and their Russian
counterparts pack less drama than they used to. But they still
matter. Bill Clinton's meetings with Vladimir Putin, the first
since Putin became Russia's president, provide a timely opportunity
to discuss issues ranging from nuclear arms control to market
reforms and human rights. Clinton should use his public
appearances, including a radio call-in show and an address to the
Russian parliament, to hail Putin's steps toward reform and
criticize troubling signs of authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's leadership personality is still unfolding. The theme of
his presidency so far has been the reorganization of the central
government. That is a reasonable response to the catastrophic
breakdown of services over the past decade. But there are concerns
that Putin, who was a KGB officer in the Soviet era, means to
reassert Kremlin powers at the expense of Russia's nascent civil
liberties. Last month's raid on Media-MOST, a leading private media
company, was troubling in this regard. So is Moscow's continuing
military brutality in Chechnya and Putin's legislative drive to
override the power of elected regional governors.
</P>
<P>
   More encouraging are the economic goals reflected in his cabinet
appointments and proposals to reform the income tax code. Higher
oil prices and the consequences of earlier ruble devaluations have
spurred a modest economic revival in Russia. But this windfall must
now be sustained by a coherent set of government policies including
further simplifications of the tax code and improvements in
property and bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   No breakthroughs on nuclear arms cuts or missile defense are
expected this weekend. But in an interview with NBC News Putin
acknowledged that he, too, recognizes a potential threat from
small, unpredictable nuclear powers. He said he intended to propose
a joint defensive system to counter it. The details of Putin's
ideas have yet to be filled in, but they are likely to be quite
different from the national missile defense system currently being
tested by the Pentagon. Clinton should listen carefully to any new
Russian proposal. It could ease the path to an eventual agreement.
As for offensive warheads, both sides have strong reason to move
ahead with deep new cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's presidency is just beginning, while Clinton's is drawing
to a close. But the remaining seven and a half months during which
their terms overlap should not be wasted. Clinton has full
authority to negotiate on nuclear issues through next January. As
leader of the world's foremost democracy he also has the moral
authority, and obligation, to speak out in defense of human rights
and Russia's newly won freedoms.

BLAZERS WIN BY TEARING DOWN SHAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Not long ago in this space, it was suggested
that, by virtue of two consecutive impressive wins here that gave
them a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference finals, the Los Angeles
Lakers were on the verge of winning the NBA championship,
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Lakers could still win the title.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``verge'' idea ... guess it depends on the definition
of verge.
</P>
<P>
   If verge also means ``plunging into the abyss with two straight
losses and looking so inept that national sports humiliation is
imminent,'' well, the word works.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't ... oops.
</P>
<P>
   But who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy and a small knot of his
black-clad warriors, nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Because nobody had ever heard of the Blazers' new defense
unveiled Friday night in Game 6 in the Rose Garden:
</P>
<P>
   Hijack-a-Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Blazers found a car with a trunk big enough to
stuff in Shaquille O'Neal. This morning he might well be bound,
gagged and secured in a barn on some filbert farm down the
Willamette Valley.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers don't cut him loose by Sunday's seventh game, it's
Indiana vs. Portland for the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Not a pretty thought, certainly, for a league seeking retrieval
of its luster, but at least the New York-vs.-Los Angeles conspiracy
theorists would have to retreat to another grassy knoll for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   In the Blazers' 103-93 triumph that was nearly wire-to-wire, the
Lakers behemoth scored just 17 points, missing 10 of 17 field goals
and seven of 10 free throws. On most occasions, O'Neal barely
touched the ball before a cavalcade of Blazers munchkins peeled him
down to a dermatology experiment.
</P>
<P>
   And since no other Laker stepped up until a too-late flurry in
the fourth quarter, they were left with the disturbing prospect of
having to win a final game at home Sunday against a team that has
no respect whatsoever for the alleged Staples Center homecourt
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won two there already,'' said Dunleavy. ``There is no
fear factor. We know we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The week's remarkable turnaround established that these Blazers
have shed the reputation built on six consecutive first-round
playoff exits, followed by last year's sweep out of the West finals
by San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 games this season against the team with the NBA's best
regular-season record, they are 5-5. Even a loss Sunday can't
change the fact they they have stared the monster in the eye and
didn't flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they knew, even up 3-1,'' said Scottie Pippen, ``that
this series was far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Lakers didn't know was O'Neal, a versatile fellow of
some thespian experience, could play the Invisible Man well before
the new film debuts. His total was the lowest in 14 career
playoffgames against the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job of packing it in against Shaquille,'' said
Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who for one of the few times in his
recent career found himself thoroughly outcoached. ``We never could
really establish ourselves. They played extremely well inside.
O'Neal struggled all night. We struggled with offensive spacing,
but we had some good shots we just didn't make.''
</P>
<P>
   The big gentleman was a trifle irked with the mauling. Normally
his bullrushes to the hoop put center Arvydas Sabonis, the only
Blazer with serious gravity, in foul trouble before the national
anthem has faded from the building. But Sabonis didn't draw his
first personal until the third quarter, drawing a rousing hand from
the faithful when his belated first infraction was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Sabonis stayed out of foul trouble,'' O'Neal said,
mumbling over the duct tape during his captivity, ``is because they
weren't calling anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A rather pitiful whine from someone 330 pounds, particularly in
view of the fact that even when fouls were whistled, O'Neal
reverted to form and failed to capitalize, as did his teammates.
The Lakers missed 14 of 27 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the Lakers' domination of Game 4 here, this was not
the same team of big contributions from multiple players.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was forced to go with O'Neal and Kobe Bryant the entire
48 minutes, and results were negligible. Bryant, operating on a
sore foot sustained in Game 5 that earlier threatened to keep him
on the bench, scored 33 points, but the bulk came in a late binge
of treys that gained the Lakers little ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the triumph grew obvious near the end, the Lakers turned
cranky, slugging it out with hard fouls and harder words. The
sudden appearance of aggression foretold more hostile manners
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed as the games went on that they start to turn
away from playing the game and start doing other types of
activities,'' Pippen said. ``Taking cheap shots and trying to start
altercations. I'm telling my guys to stay focused and to continue
to play hard and just try to walk away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   After having their best player hijacked, the Lakers' ill-temper
is understandable. For a night anyway, they lost not only the game
but the sport's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   While it's an embarrassing gaffe for one evening, failure to
fetch his gargantuan self by Sunday will become its own episode of
``Unsolved Mysteries.''

PORTLAND EVENS SERIES ON PROCRASTINATORS
</HEADLINE>
 ... WRITETHRU (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Ever the patient ones, ever the
procrastinators, ever the NBA's drama queens, ever the shameless
teases, the Los Angeles Lakers sat perched and waiting to spring on
their first NBA Finals berth in nine years Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   And perched. And sat.
</P>
<P>
   And sat. And sat.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time they tried to spring, tried to replicate the
kind of late charges that put them in control of this series in the
first place, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 was lost, the Lakers' advance stalled once more, as they
fell 103-93 to the supercharged Portland Trail Blazers before
20,340 at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, once up 3-1, have procrastinated themselves right
into a deciding Game 7 in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we wanted,'' said Glen Rice. ``But we know we
have to win this thing. That game is going to be a war. It's going
to be a real emotional game, a very rough game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not what anyone outside of the Rose City wanted. But having
no choice now, the Lakers are adjusting quickly to the idea of the
all-or-nothing finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone fantasizes and dreams about being in a Game 7
situation, to either win a championship or advance to the Finals,''
said Derek Fisher, ``and I think if we harp too much on the fact
that we should be there, we're going to lose on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, when the series started, people anticipated seven
games, so the way that it got there is totally amazing. But the
fact that there is a Game 7 on Sunday, the winner advances. To look
above that or beyond that or anything around that, we won't be
doing ourselves any favors.''
</P>
<P>
   They could hardly do themselves any worse than the hole they dug
the last few days, blowing chances to clinch the series both at
home and in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' victory marked the first time since Game 1 that
either team defended its home court successfully. The Lakers swept
two here last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of disappointing, but we also realized it would be
hard to get three games up here,'' said Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal struggled through a sea of Blazer defenders and was held
to a series-low 17 points on 7-of-17 shooting _ numbers he
attributed to uncalled Portland fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why I missed,'' he said. ``You all saw the
(bleeping) game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said coach Phil Jackson, ``I thought they played extremely well
on Shaquille.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Kobe Bryant to try to deliver the series
singlehandedly _ and with a single foot, no less _ and he came
through with a game-high 33 points. After shaking off a the effects
of a sore right foot, Bryant played all 48 minutes and made 12 of
24 shots, including a torrent of four 3-pointers in a desperate
fourth-quarter charge.
</P>
<P>
   But the game had long been decided, the Lakers trailing from the
first quarter on.
</P>
<P>
   They were shorthanded on offense and impotent on defense.
Portland shot 50 percent, had five players in double figures and
led continuously after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Game 7,'' coach Phil Jackson said, in summation. Was he
shocked? ``No. Are you? This is what we anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Indiana Pacers have to wait two more days to discover the
identity of their Finals dance partner, and the Lakers and Blazers
will duel once more, Sunday at 4:30 p.m. at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   A brief charge at the start of the third quarter got the Lakers
within four points, but they quickly faded again under a 9-2
Blazers run. O'Neal made just 2 of 8 field-goal attempts in the
quarter, and the Lakers trailed by eight points 71-63 heading into
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The series stayed true to form as the Blazers took control early
and took a 49-39 lead into halftime, riding a three-pronged attack
of Rasheed Wallace (11 points), Steve Smith and Damon Stoudamire
(12 each).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they dropped a little bit out of focus during the
course of the first half,'' Jackson said. ``But outside of some
mental mistakes _ Smith got a couple steals, questionable steals,
that brought them back in the ballgame and got the runouts that
were unavoidable _ but we obviously exposed ourselves offensively.
That created the defensive mismatch and a layup.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lakers emphasized the need to hammer Portland inside
with O'Neal, he scored just eight points in the half, on 4-of-8
shooting. He also missed all six of his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   It was the closing minutes of the game that gave Portland
something to think about, however. The Blazers objected to some
hard fouls, notably a flagrant by O'Neal on Pippen, and a few hits
by Rick Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started taking fouls and they put a little extra mustard
on those fouls,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``I don't
think it was appreciated at our end.''

 MOYER GIVES M'S A NICE RETURN; MARTINEZ STAYS HOT
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jamie Moyer gave the Mariners a little taste of what
they'd missed.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez gave the M's a little more of what they've
reaped.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the veterans opened interleague play in impressive
style Friday night at Safeco Field, helping the Mariners to a 7-4
victory over the San Diego Padres, a win that enabled Seattle to
reclaim sole possession of first place in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, just off the disabled list, pitched five innings and got
the win. Martinez, apparently convinced May has at least 33 days in
it, had two more hits, including a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't put any expectations on myself,'' Moyer said. ``If
you put expectations on the evening, you're setting yourself up for
a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no letdown. Moyer, pitching for the first time since
April 14, allowed two runs in five innings. The strained muscle in
his left shoulder that caused him to miss six weeks of competition
didn't seem to be a hindrance as he used his changeup and breaking
pitches to keep the Padres reasonably off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sharper than I thought he'd be,'' catcher Dan Wilson
said. ``He had good stuff and looked sharp, especially for having
all that time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer didn't come out and try to light up the night. He doesn't
have the fastball for it, so he stuck with his basic recipe _
breaking pitches and changeups _ and made it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really liked,'' pitching coach Bryan Price said, ``was
that for a guy who has been chomping at the bit to get going, he
pitched a real professional game. He didn't get over-zealous the
way pitchers can get when they're anxious to get out there. He just
stuck with his game plan and made good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had been hoping for six innings from Moyer. They
only got five, but after the left-hander served up a two-run homer
in the first inning, Moyer was close to the top of his game for his
remaining time on the mound. A hanging changeup to Phil Nevin
resulted in Nevin's 14th homer, but other than that, Moyer was in
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt decent,'' Moyer said. ``This gave me the basis of
something to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer allowed only two more hits and one walk in his remaining
four innings, and when he needed a nice defensive play to give him
a boost, he got it.
</P>
<P>
   A two-out double by Damien Jackson and a subsequent walk to Eric
Owens put the potential tying runs on base in the fifth. The next
Padres batter, Al Martin, came up with a hot smash toward first
base that was trouble. But first baseman John Olerud judged the
short hop correctly, plucked the ball out of the air on the first
hop and made the play at first, extinguishing the Padres for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer threw just 74 pitches, less than the 80-90 that manager
Lou Piniella would have considered perfect. But as usual, Moyer
gave his teammates a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, meanwhile, followed up on his American League-best
.441 average of May with two more hits, keeping his AL-best average
at .376. Martinez singled and scored a run in the third, then added
a two-run homer in the seventh, his team-best 16th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gar's homer was the big hit of the game,'' Wilson said. ``That
was what gave us the cushion we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer was the centerpiece of a three-run seventh inning that
gave Seattle a 7-2 lead before the Padres staged a late rally
against M's reliever Arthur Rhodes in the eighth. Kazuhiro Sasaki,
asked to bring home a win with a three-run lead in the ninth,
closed out the Padres on one hit for his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Martinez homer was the big blow, the Mariners were
able to put together some of the ``little ball'' Piniella has said
the club needed all along.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have had more than their share of bunts backfire
this year. But in the second inning, the M's got more than they
could reasonably expect from a bunt. David Bell tried to advance
Olerud and Jay Buhner with a sacrifice try down the first-base
line. But when first baseman Ed Sprague threw the ball away,
Seattle got two quick runs to tie the game in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had a couple of nice contributions of his own to the
offense. He had a sacrifice fly in the third, good for run No. 4
and a 4-2 lead, then singled to load the bases in the seventh,
setting up Mark McLemore's bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to drive in a run in the second, too, and I'm
disappointed I didn't get it done,'' Wilson said. ``But we finally
got some runs. Gar's homer put us where we needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the winner's circle.

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea is often
described as the most deadly in the world, fought on terrain of
little consequence while millions of people in two very poor
countries face starvation. This is all true.
</P>
<P>
   But the war _ which may finally be winding down after two years
_ is also something else, something that has become quite rare: A
war fought between the regular armies of two nations, in which both
sides generally follow the rules of war.
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony that while civilian deaths from the side effects
of war are so high, direct civilian casualties from combat are
quite low. And neither side is accused of gross violations of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in short, a very old-fashioned kind of war, the only
clearly defined conflict in the world right now between two nations
(though India and Pakistan exchange artillery fire and the armies
of Rwanda and Uganda have skirmished recently in a third country,
Congo).
</P>
<P>
   Even the fighting itself has a tinge of sepia to it: Armies
lined up in trenches battle in close quarters, in contrast to the
remote-control technological wars that rich nations favor these
days.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest in any way that this is a quaint or
``good'' war. But as Chris Bowers, a spokesman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, put it: ``It certainly
has a different character, and that is important to note.''
</P>
<P>
   In Africa since the Cold War ended, there has been a great deal
of conflict but hardly any between nations. This pattern dates to
the 1960s, when Africans gained their independence from Europe and
the newly-formed Organization of African Unity forbade African
nations from fighting each other directly. With few exceptions,
they haven't, out of concern for self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the wars in Africa have tended to be internal explosions
of ethnic violence, as in Rwanda or Burundi, or of flat-out greed
masquerading as a liberation struggle, as in Angola or Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians are often the targets in these wars: ethnic rivals are
slaughtered in Rwanda; children's limbs are hacked off in Sierra
Leone. Almost any hospital at any time in eastern Congo will have
patients _ sliced in the head with machetes, pocked with bullet
holes _ who have been caught in the fighting from one of the
uncountable factions there.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea went to war in May 1998. Unlike many
conflicts in Africa, which are the result of states falling apart,
this was in many ways about people defining themselves as nations.
Once an Italian colony, then a British protectorate, Eritrea was
formally annexed in 1962 by the Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie,
to become Ethiopia's northernmost province. In 1991, guerrillas
from both Eritrea and Ethiopia defeated Mengistu Haile Mariam, who
had ousted the emperor in 1974, and in 1993 Eritrea peacefully
became a new nation.
</P>
<P>
   But its borders were not defined and good relations with
Ethiopia never developed. So a series of border skirmishes exploded
into all-out war that the leaders of neither side had the strength
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ethiopia and Eritrea were until recently united, it
could be argued that this war is just barely one between states.
But they have fought as if it was. There were two trained armies
lined up across trenches, with tanks, planes and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   A military analyst in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa,
believes this is why Eritrea has done so badly against an Ethiopian
offensive launched on May 12: The Eritreans, he said, were
excellent guerrilla fighters during their 30-year struggle against
the emperor and then the Mengistu regime. But once they had to
fight a conventional war, the analyst said: ``They didn't have
clue. Maybe the fact that they are sovereign nation and think of
themselves as a sovereign nation induced them to fight a battle
they didn't know how to fight.'' (The Eritreans say they were not
defeated militarily at all, but simply withdrew to save lives and
fight on their own terms.)
</P>
<P>
   Early in the war, Ethiopia bombed what it said were military
sites in the Eritrean capital, Asmara, and Eritrea bombed a school
in the northern Ethiopian town of Mekele. Amnesty International has
said ``dozens'' of civilians were killed in the first round of
fighting. But since then, civilians have for the most part been
moved away from the fronts, minimizing the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the last two weeks _ as Ethiopia drove north away from
the trenches and into Eritrean territory _ there have been few
reports of civilians killed, no more than a handful on either side.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, all of that may make little difference in
the impact the war is having on these desperately poor societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The humanitarian disaster has been drought and famine
affecting both countries,'' said Martin Hill, the Amnesty
International researcher in London who follows the wars on the Horn
of Africa. ``Fortunately there hasn't been another humanitarian
disaster of killings of civilians or killing fleeing refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hill suggests, this war may have been played more by the
rules than others in Africa, but there is no taming war itself.
Ultimately, it has been extraordinarily costly.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this latest round of fighting, it was estimated that
this very conventional war had ended the lives of at least 20,000
soldiers. Last year, President Clinton put the number of dead at
70,000.
</P>
<P>
   And that is far from the only cost. There is also the question
of resources: The war diverted perhaps $1 billion that could have
gone toward development. Both nations are among the poorest in the
world and have fought at a time when 8 million Ethiopians and some
770,000 Eritreans faced severe food shortages begun by drought and
worsened by war.
</P>
<P>
   It is also estimated that some 550,000 Eritreans have been
pushed from their homes by the latest round of fighting _ most of
them in the most fertile agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations now have representatives in Algeria to talk
about peace, but there has been no cease-fire and nobody is going
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a very severe effect on civilians,'' Bowers
said. ``The food situation was not great beforehand. And this is
not going to make it any better.''

soldiers. Last year, President Clinton put the number of dead at
70,000.
</P>
<P>
   And that is far from the only cost. There is also the question
of resources: The war diverted perhaps $1 billion that could have
gone toward development. Both nations are among the poorest in the
world and have fought at a time when 8 million Ethiopians and some
770,000 Eritreans faced severe food shortages begun by drought and
worsened by war.
</P>
<P>
   It is also estimated that some 550,000 Eritreans have been
pushed from their homes by the latest round of fighting _ most of
them in the most fertile agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations now have representatives in Algeria to talk
about peace, but there has been no cease-fire and nobody is going
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a very severe effect on civilians,'' Bowers
said. ``The food situation was not great beforehand. And this is
not going to make it any better.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Wilda Severe carried the future in her
mind and body as she waited to cast her ballot last month in
Haiti's legislative elections. Though five months pregnant, she
stood for hours on a slowly moving line, hoping that her vote would
usher in a better life for her baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the conditions of the country to change,'' she said.
``The conditions are not good for anybody right now. People suffer
and there is no work. And there is insecurity. The country is still
not at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   More than five years after a U.S.-led military occupation
restored democratic rule in Haiti, the civil serenity that she and
many Haitians hoped for remains elusive. In the weeks before the
elections, politically motivated violence had left 15 people dead,
and in the slums the sense of poverty only deepened.
</P>
<P>
   When the last U.S. troops left Haiti this year, some policy
makers saw it as the end of a successful mission to restore
democracy. But the fact that the elections (in which former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party did well) found so many
Haitians still pining for peace and progress belies any boast. It
raises questions about why Haiti seems to stagger from crisis to
crisis as it tries to embark on the path to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of an answer lies just a short flight away in the Dominican
Republic _ a nation that shares not just the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti, but also a history of dictatorship, violence and U.S.
intervention. It too has had an election in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   But there, just over the border, the economy is expanding
rapidly. New roads, modernized government agencies and investment
have transformed the capital. Though many of the poorest Dominicans
felt excluded from the boom times, they peacefully voiced their
dissatisfaction at the polls, where a near majority elected
Hipolito Mejia president on May 16. And then the ruling party
abandoned its quest for a runoff and conceded defeat for the good
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like the border that separates the two countries _ where the
lush green landscape of the Dominican Republic gives way to the
barren, deforested soil of Haiti _ the contrast in political and
social fortunes is sharp. Considering that Haiti was once the more
prosperous and cosmopolitan of the two countries, and that the
violence of Gen. Rafael Trujillo's dictatorship in the Dominican
Republic 35 years ago ago rivaled if not exceeded that of the
Duvalier family here, why do the two nations seem headed in
opposite directions?
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the answer can be summed up in two words: 30
years,'' said Michele Wucker, author of ``Why The Cocks Fight,'' a
book exploring the relationship between the two nations. ``Haiti is
now where the Dominican Republic was not too long after the United
States invasion in 1965.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within the shared experience of military intervention,
however, there are differences. After the 1965 intervention, when
Joaquin Balaguer came to power and ushered in years of repressive
rule, the United States essentially kept a hands-off policy in the
Dominican Republic, Ms. Wucker said. In Haiti, the United States
restored Aristide to power in 1994, but placed narrow constraints
on the exercise of his power. Wucker said that the United States
also contradicted itself, pressing for elections while cutting aid
to help finance them. ``They talk in pretty terms about
democracy,'' said. ``But deep down they are reluctant to let Haiti
muddle its own way in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of dictatorship also played out differently. While
some Dominicans still bear scars _ physical and psychological _
from Balaguer's early years, just as many recall benefiting from
jobs, homes and other favors. So strong are those memories that
nearly a quarter of the votes went to Balaguer, even though he is
93, blind and infirm.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, the experience of a former president running again is
relatively rare, since most have gone into exile after enriching
themselves. ``They had Balaguer, we had Duvalier, but the histories
are very different,'' said Raoul Denis, a record store owner in
Port-au-Prince. ``On our side, Duvalier destroyed the institutions
and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Those institutions, like the courts and the police, still
struggle to maintain a semblance of law and order in Haiti. At the
same time, other forces that could help bring pressure to bear lack
sufficient experience to prove effective. In the Dominican
Republic, public-interest advocates have played an important role
in calling for clean elections and good government. Business
owners, aware that tourists and factory jobs can flee unless there
is social and political stability, also had a stake in the future
and supported it with investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is we in Haiti do not have an authentic
bourgeoisie that has invested in Haiti,'' said Patrick
Pierre-Louis, a law school professor. ``All their money goes to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominican business leaders were a major force for their
country's stability, said a diplomat who has worked there and in
Haiti. When the United States worried about elections in the
mid-1990s, such leaders were vulnerable to friendly pressure, since
business owners wanted trade parity with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Haiti there isn't much tourism,'' said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The assembly sector is still not
large. They weathered the embargo and other bad situations. I'm not
sure the levers we had in the Dominican Republic could work here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Haiti's elections are the first step toward achieving a
normal government, bigger obstacles remain in a country where
winner-take-all has been a rule applied literally by victorious
candidates. Haiti's political leaders have yet to understand that
the power of the vote extends beyond election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominican interests are the interests of their country,'' said
Georges Sassine, a factory owner active in civic groups. ``Here,
you have people who come here, get rich and leave. We are still a
colony of ourselves.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some months back, I took my 2{-year-old son to the pediatrician
for a checkup and got some unexpected news: he had shrunk half an
inch from his previous visit.
</P>
<P>
   No cause for alarm here. The explanation was simple enough: for
the first time, Clement had been measured standing up, not lying
down fidgeting on the crinkly paper that covered the examination
table. With this one giant leap into toddlerhood, he had,
paradoxically, shrunk a bit in stature.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal. Except that my son is already on the short end of
the height spectrum _ something of a family trait, if truth be told
_ and he could really use that half inch.
</P>
<P>
   So in the admittedly unlikely event that the question of size
comes up among his pals as they tool around the sandbox, I will not
be surprised if he lies, reclaiming that stolen half inch and maybe
even adding on another for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Clement would be in a good company. A study appearing
this month in the American Statistical Association Proceedings
reports that many Americans appear to lie about their height. Not
weight or age, though they lie about that, too. Height.
</P>
<P>
   How do we know this?
</P>
<P>
   Because researchers at St. Louis University were curious about
the accuracy of the self-reported data used in many health studies
and decided to do a little comparison. The term refers to personal
information gathered from people who volunteer it to researchers
without benefit of physical exams. If the data is inaccurate, the
results of the surveys can be skewed.
</P>
<P>
   William Hart, the nutrition and dietetics professor who led the
study, compared the heights and weights reported by subjects in one
survey with figures from another in which people were examined. He
and his colleagues took self-reported data offered by more than
6,000 people who participated in the National Health Interview
Surveys from 1988 to 1994, and put them up against actual
measurements from the more than 500,000 people examined in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that many people fudged their weight _ not
a complete surprise. But they were not prepared for the number of
people who seem to have volunteered inaccurate information about
their height.
</P>
<P>
   From ages 20 to 84, men and women exaggerated. Indeed, more
people were inclined to overstate their height than to understate
their weight.
</P>
<P>
   For health experts, the main cause of concern is not the
prevarication itself but something perhaps more serious. If the
researchers are right, Americans, already among the most obese
people in the world, could be in worse shape than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did not offer any theories for the
misrepresentation. ``Psychosocial explanations can be postulated,
but not confirmed with this data,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a psychosociologist, however, to understand why
Americans would want to be taller. Height is often equated with
power, wealth and even intelligence, said Jennifer Taylor, a
clinical psychologist at Harvard University's McLean Hospital.
``It's something that's culturally ingrained from very early on,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the sight of two schoolchildren, back to back,
trying to see who is taller _ with one or both sneaking onto
tiptoes. Even in politics, presidential candidates who are taller
are often considered to have an edge over their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Where psychosociology might come in handy is in explaining why
people would believe they could get away with lying about height.
If you decide to shave 10 pounds off your weight, who can be sure?
If you say you're five years younger, who is going to argue?
</P>
<P>
   But asking others to believe you are a couple of inches taller
than you are, when they need only compare your stature with theirs,
is another matter entirely. It requires not just an absence of
skepticism on their part but actual complicity. It's the kind of
thing that could happen only if everybody were lying about height.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another explanation is that many people don't really
know their own height, some experts say. There are few occasions in
adulthood when it is taken. And in the end, it may simply be that
people are engaging not so much in deceit as in wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: My position is that I am 5 feet 4 inches. My wife
labors under the mistaken impression that she is 5 feet 4{ inches _
which is physically impossible, of course, because she is about 2
inches taller than I am. (Want more proof she's wrong? The other
day, after I told him how tall I was, my brother declared that he
was 5 feet 5. And yet he is shorter than my wife.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lying is such an ugly word. It is true that the last
time I was measured by a doctor, my height was not recorded as 5
feet 4. But maybe they got it wrong. It would not be surprising,
since they measured me when I was standing up.

   LONDON _ Northern Ireland is locked in a grim struggle to trade
in tested old tribal instincts for risky new communal ones, and the
qualms and tensions in that swap were on display last week in
Belfast in the actions of a central figure in the peace
negotiations, David Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend Trimble, leader of the province's largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, revived what has been a
repeatedly jeopardized peace accord by persuading his quarrelsome,
doubting rank and file to trust in the disarmament promises of its
Catholic sworn enemies in Sinn Fein, which represents the Irish
Republican Army. Supporters of the 1998 accord, which aims to end
three decades of violence with the creation of power-sharing
political institutions, promptly praised him for his courage and
vision _ virtues infrequent in Ulster politics.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after achieving his narrow victory, Trimble stepped out
into the luminous gallery of glass-sheathed Waterfront Hall, which
is itself a symbol of a brighter future for the conflicted
province, and promptly reverted to an all-too-familiar
name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as democracy is concerned,'' he said of the Sinn Fein
politicians whose word he was championing moments before, ``these
folk ain't house-trained yet.'' They would have to be ``brought to
heel,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the opposition dogs and worse is standard-issue oratory
in Northern Ireland, where insult is the common currency of public
dialogue. One of those consigned by Trimble to the kennel, Sinn
Fein Assemblyman Alex Maskey, robustly protested the crude allusion
but quickly added that it was probably something the Ulster
Unionist leader felt impelled to say to keep party hard-liners on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this kind of grudging acceptance of each other's
atavistic imperatives has emerged a sense of sameness between two
rival communities that have spent generations fighting to maintain
their differences. It may not be the ultimate equality that
reformers are seeking, but it is a kind of companion conduct that
suggests consensual politics may stand a chance in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was the home rule government up and running last week
than Sinn Fein dominated debate with an argument over whether its
ministers would allow the British flag to fly over public buildings
they now occupied. It was telling behavior for a party that has
regularly mocked Protestants for devoting so little time to real
issues and so much to symbolic ones like defending their right to
wave banners and parade around the province in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble finally got his delegates' support for going into
government with Sinn Fein by warning that if they voted no, they
would be banishing themselves to the margins and leaving the main
arena to their opponents. His point _ one that has taken time to
dawn on his tradition-bound audience and produced the support of
only a slight majority _ was that the only way to keep power was to
share it. Continue trying to hold onto all of it, he was saying,
and there's the unenviable possibility of ending up with none of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Summoning his party to the center was a daring bid because it is
the fringes that often are more alluring to Ulster politicians.
George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator who brokered the original
peace agreement, once commented that while the normal movement of
politics in Western societies was toward the middle space of
reconciliation, in Northern Ireland it was toward the poles of
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has been in both places.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1944 in Bangor, a seaside resort in County Down, and
formerly a law professor, Trimble had his first political
involvement on the clamorous right wing of the unionists, whose
unionism sprang from a wish that Northern Ireland remain part of
the United Kingdom. He joined the Ulster Vanguard, which was formed
in 1972 to confront the more mainstream Ulster Unionists, and took
an active part in the hard-line protests that helped end the
Sunningdale Agreement in 1974, which was the last attempt at
power-sharing in the province.
</P>
<P>
   A result of that agitation was to bring down the home rule
government of Brian Faulkner, a Protestant moderate who occupied
the same position then, premier of Northern Ireland, that Trimble
does today as first minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper Bann district that he has represented in the British
Parliament since 1990 includes the town of Portadown, known as the
citadel of the militant Orange Order. It has been the scene of
violent standoffs every summer when the black-suited ``brethren''
in their bowler hats and orange sashes have tried to take their
parade commemorating centuries-old Protestant triumphs from
Drumcree Church along a road that wends through Catholic
neighborhoods. In 1995 Trimble attracted attention by leading the
marchers into a police formation blocking their path, hurling
himself against a patrolman and giving the officers a red-faced,
finger-wagging lecture. When the Orangemen penetrated the police
lines and reached their destination at the Portadown Orange Lodge,
he danced a victory jig arm in arm with the Rev. Ian Paisley, the
preacher-politician who is the best-known opponent of any
accommodation with Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1998, but just years earlier,
he was making his mark by acting rude, truculent and spiteful, his
occasional smiles tight, joyless and disdainful. Hardly a matinee
idol today, he has mellowed into a more relaxed and broadly
persuasive orator, indulging in the occasional hot-tempered
flashback as a reminder that his more primitive past still lurks.
</P>
<P>
   These days he is denounced by Paisley as a Judas, and Trimble's
picture hangs in a hut on Drumcree Hill, altered to show satanic
horns protruding from his forehead. His party has traditionally
been most comfortable saying no, and only 53 percent of the 862
ruling council members chose to say yes to accepting the IRA
pledges on disarmament and participating in government with Sinn
Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments, the two sponsors of the peace
effort, both believe that Trimble is the only person on the
Protestant side capable of maintaining progress in putting into
place the power-sharing arrangements that have continually
faltered. Sinn Fein also appreciates his fundamental value, and the
biggest threat to him now comes from his own co-religionists. There
will be lots of tactical maneuvering among them to try to undo what
he has done, and his leadership is sure to be challenged again.
</P>
<P>
   To the task of dealing with this crafty enemy within, Trimble
brings an important qualification. He was until recently one of
them himself.

<P>
   Last month a hyperactive computer program bearing the message
``I Love You'' ricocheted around the world's e-mail systems in less
than 24 hours and infected tens of millions of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``I Love You'' bug, allegedly launched by a computer student
in the Philippines with too much time on his hands, touched off a
cyber-flu season. More than 29 variants have emerged so far,
including diabolical derivatives with names like ``NewLove'' and
``Resume _ Janet Simons.'' Most of the mutants arrived without
tidings of love, but instead carried a software payload designed to
erase victims' disks once the message's attachment was opened.
</P>
<P>
   While ``I Love You'' was startlingly swift and effective, most
of its imitators went almost nowhere. According to some computer
security experts, the copycat cyberplagues should have spread just
as rapidly as the worm (in computer entomology, worms propel
themselves while viruses hitchhike on other documents) they were
mimicking.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what's love got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a lot, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts looking at the different contagion rates are
divided about whether Internet users learned a hard lesson in
computer hygiene or whether the world is actually a lonelier place
than anyone realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that men were much more likely to open the `I
Love You' worm than women,'' said George Cybenko, a computer
scientist at Dartmouth University and a founder of the Institute of
Security Technology Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ``I Love You'' message was so simple and beguiling
that in some cases it hoodwinked even the most sophisticated
computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Capps, a senior Microsoft software designer, padded
downstairs at 5 a.m. on the morning of the ``I Love You''
infection, poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down at his
computer to read his e-mail. It happened to be his birthday, so as
he scanned his mailbox he thought he saw a love note from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the program Capps quickly realized his error and
managed to delete the bug before it spread widely. ``What I
remember thinking was, ``How did Marie manage to sneak downstairs
late at night to send me a birthday note?'' he said sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   Capps was not alone. Hewlett-Packard &AMP; Co. acknowledged last
week that its computers suffered more than 700,000 infections from
the ``I Love You'' worm _ more than 500,000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The total damage _ primarily time spent restoring files and
cleaning out clogged e-mail systems _ may reach $950 million,
according to ICSA.net, a computer security company that tracks the
cost of computer infections.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the far more lethal ``NewLove'' bug began
infecting the address books of users of the popular Microsoft
Outlook e-mail program, sending itself to every person on the list.
But instead of delivering the endearingly named document
LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS, NewLove cloaked itself by snatching a
recent document name from its victim's hard disk and using that
name in the subject line of all subsequent messages sent from the
address list, destroying data on the hard drives of affected
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``Resume'' bug urged e-mail recipients to look at
a job seeker's fabulous curriculum vitae, helpfully included as an
attachment _ which, of course served as an electronic Trojan Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their cleverness, however, both ``NewLove'' and
``Resume'' were stopped in their tracks. ``If `NewLove' had come
before `I Love You' it would have spread more slowly but we would
have had a bigger disaster,'' said Peter Tippett, chief technology
officer of ICSA.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett, who was trained as an epidemiologist before starting an
antivirus software company in the 1980s, has long argued that
computer viruses and infections closely mimic the biological world.
</P>
<P>
   That might be another reason why the lethal ``NewLove'' was less
effective than ``I Love You.'' In the real world as well as in
cyberspace, diseases that kill their hosts quickly tend to have
limited success in spreading through large populations. ``Viruses
that kill their hosts never make it,'' Tippett said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the Darwinian imperative or the irresistible power
of love at work, experts believe the current cyber-flu season will
not be the last, especially as the millions of PCs of the 1990s are
transformed into billions of cell phones, personal digital
assistants and even toaster-connected Internet appliances by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   For each new device connected to the Internet there are dozens
of new ways to spread infection. Even now, computer security
experts are warning that the growing popularity of music and
file-sharing programs like Napster, Gnutella, iMesh and Scour
Exchange will virtually insure new vectors for diseases.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that disease in the cyberworld will become as
routine as cold season is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what concerns me,'' said Kevin Kelly, author of ``Out
of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the
Economic World'' (Addison Wesley, 1994). ``These new systems leave
us completely open to these infections and we may just have to
learn to live with them.''

have had a bigger disaster,'' said Peter Tippett, chief technology
officer of ICSA.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett, who was trained as an epidemiologist before starting an
antivirus software company in the 1980s, has long argued that
computer viruses and infections closely mimic the biological world.
</P>
<P>
   That might be another reason why the lethal ``NewLove'' was less
effective than ``I Love You.'' In the real world as well as in
cyberspace, diseases that kill their hosts quickly tend to have
limited success in spreading through large populations. ``Viruses
that kill their hosts never make it,'' Tippett said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the Darwinian imperative or the irresistible power
of love at work, experts believe the current cyber-flu season will
not be the last, especially as the millions of PCs of the 1990s are
transformed into billions of cell phones, personal digital
assistants and even toaster-connected Internet appliances by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   For each new device connected to the Internet there are dozens
of new ways to spread infection. Even now, computer security
experts are warning that the growing popularity of music and
file-sharing programs like Napster, Gnutella, iMesh and Scour
Exchange will virtually insure new vectors for diseases.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that disease in the cyberworld will become as
routine as cold season is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what concerns me,'' said Kevin Kelly, author of ``Out
of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the
Economic World'' (Addison Wesley, 1994). ``These new systems leave
us completely open to these infections and we may just have to
learn to live with them.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For nearly half a century the Cold War world's
tense stability was built on a simple bit of political philosophy.
Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured Destruction, it
held that the leader of a country advanced enough to build nuclear
weapons would never actually use them if he was assured his nation
would also be obliterated by his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Why call this a political philosophy? Because at its core, as at
the core of every political philosophy from Plato to Marx, is an
appraisal of human nature. MAD's view of human nature was,
paradoxically, surprisingly sunny. It held that a leader, no matter
how ambitious, ideological or even nutty, would never be so far
gone (or allowed to be so far gone by his cohorts) as to risk the
annihilation of his own people.
</P>
<P>
   That was the heart of deterrence: America's belief that the
Russians were rational and their belief that Americans were, too.
</P>
<P>
   As nuclear technology proliferates, however, the nuclear
equation is becoming more complicated, and a new view of deterrence
is taking hold in the United States. That view was summed up by a
bipartisan report last fall from a federal advisory commission
studying national security in the 21st century: Threats to U.S.
security will be more diffuse, harder to anticipate and more
difficult to neutralize than ever before. Deterrence will not work
as it once did; in many cases, it may not work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because in the post-Cold War world, the new thinking goes,
there are some countries and leaders who simply cannot be trusted
to be rational about nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The old line in the sand was between two ideologies, each held
by people the other believed to be capable of acting sensibly. The
new line is between people who can be counted on to behave like us
and people who can't. Under the old thinking, the best defense was
the threat of an overwhelming offense. But in the new world, the
new theorists suggest, the best defense in some cases is actually a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, embraced this view in a speech recently calling for a
robust missile defense of the United States. And President Clinton
is in Moscow this weekend to discuss the new thinking, and his own
less expansive missile defense plans, with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who holds a treaty barring the United States (or
Russia) from deploying a National Missile Defense (NMD).
</P>
<P>
   On his way to Moscow, Clinton gave a glimpse of the new
strategic view. The world, Clinton suggested during a stop in
Lisbon, can be divided between ``civilized nations,'' and
``irresponsible new nuclear powers and their possible alliances
with terrorists and other groups.'' Rest assured, Clinton said,
America would share with the civilized the technology to defend
against the irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Who belongs in this second group? Clinton named neither the
civilized nations nor the irresponsible ones, although there was a
hint he was prepared to include Russia in the civilized category
because the very phrase was one Boris Yeltsin had once used to
describe a world protected by missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But what of China, which is on the verge of modernizing and
expanding its nuclear force and openly views a system defending the
continental United States as a threat to that force?
</P>
<P>
   The Americans say it's not China they're worried about, either,
but what the Clinton administration calls ``rogue states.'' North
Korea, for example, would fall into this category. But why is Kim
Jong-il of North Korea not likely to be deterred by the threat of
national devastation, if he struck at America?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, North Korea is an isolated place, the last Stalinist
state and so economically troubled that people flee to China for a
better life. When Kim went on a secret state visit to Beijing last
week pictures released afterward showed him wearing a Mao jacket,
while China's president, Jiang Zemin, was attired in suit and tie.
Certainly he is behind the fashion curve. But does that mean he
would risk extinction?
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War there has been only one real-world
test of deterrence against a so-called rogue state, and it supports
those who say it remains effective. It came on the eve of the Gulf
War. In a variety of ways, including a direct meeting with Tariq
Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, the U.S. secretary of state,
James Baker, warned Saddam Hussein that the use of chemical or
biological weapons against allied forces would be met by ``the most
severe consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis did not use these weapons and later said they
understood the American warning to mean a nuclear response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein may have been ruthlessly expansionist, but he
did not act irrationally,'' writes Robert S. Litwak, a former
member of the national security council staff at the White House,
in his book, `` Rogue States and U.S. Foreign Policy'' (Woodrow
Wilson Center Press, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Critics of America's emerging new strategic thinking, which is
to say most of the rest of the world, seem to think that the new
theories of deterrence have more to do with the mind of America
than the mind of Saddam Hussein or of Kim Jong-il.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always seen themselves as self- reliant, and they
have placed great faith in technology. Replacing MAD with NMD
relieves you of a dependence on the rationality of your fellow man,
in favor of an independence granted by your homegrown radar,
computers and missiles. America's allies are not convinced that is
an improvement, but Americans seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that they do not know much about it, nearly
60 percent of Americans said in a survey last month that they favor
trying to build a missile defense system against nuclear attack.
Told that $60 billion had already been spent, opinion remained in
favor. One American in four wants to try to build the system
despite the cost, even if scientists conclude it probably won't
work, according to the survey, conducted by The New York Times and
CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   What most Americans have not begun to consider is that an
anti-missile system would represent a fundamental shift in how the
nation thinks about nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, the first year of the nuclear age, Albert Einstein
described atomic energy as a ``menace'' and added: ``Perhaps it is
well that it should be. It may intimidate the human race into
bringing order into its international affairs, which, without the
pressure of fear, it would not do.''
</P>
<P>
   For a half century that is what happened, more or less. What
frightens some analysts is that a shield against nuclear attack on
the United States would make Americans believe they are safe and
thus help lift from their leaders the pressure of fear, which helps
motivate the world's one superpower to work for continued order and
safety in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For years the United States has classified some
countries, like Iraq and North Korea, as ``rogue states.'' Now, as
the world becomes more democratic _ more than 60 percent of
countries have elected leaders _ something more complicated enters
the political lexicon. Call them ``rogue democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   These are democratic governments that go off the rails, either
in aggressiveness toward neighbors, cruelty to citizens or
backtracking on the promise that democracy will foster liberty and
equality.
</P>
<P>
   How to deal with this new type of rogue, or to know when to
recognize one, is not easy for established democracies. It is,
after all, tempting to assume that when other nations choose to
freely elect their leaders, good things automatically follow.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Peru is the latest example: an elected president,
Alberto Fujimori, has rewritten the constitution, cut the power of
his congress and chipped away at political liberties, all in the
name of social order. Now he is claiming a third term after an
election so riddled with irregularities that the opposition
boycotted it and the Organization of American States won't approve
it.
</P>
<P>
   What's the world to do? Shun Peru? Impose sanctions? When
Austria's voters put the xenophobe Jorg Haider near the seat of
power, Europe got together and forced his ostracism. But in Peru a
similar outcome seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   It has been obvious for some time that democracy no longer has
one universally accepted definition, and so it is hard to say when
a country ceases to be one. Consider the variety of forms in Peru,
Russia, India, Zimbabwe, the United States, Austria and Japan.
There is also a growing understanding that elections don't
guarantee free expression or fair treatment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a nation's ability to call itself a democracy often buys it
sympathy among voters in the West and among human-rights advocates
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Elected leaders on almost every continent have, indeed, long
used the forms of democracy as political wool to pull over the eyes
of those abroad who would judge their legitimacy to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Latin America, constitutions are routinely amended or
rewritten to expand the terms and power of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, where parliamentary elections are now less than
three weeks away, President Robert Mugabe has systematically
attacked the opposition under the guise of a violent campaign to
seize land from white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, lame-duck conservatives tried to block the newly
elected reformist parliament; it was seated only with the suffrance
of the Islamic republic's ``supreme religious leader,'' who can
veto such earthly procedures as elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, and now Malaysia, elected Asian governments
dominated by intolerant leaders have fashioned the most
sophisticated, perfectly legal methods of destroying political
opponents through the courts. The slow-moving prosecution on sex
charges of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's once-fast-rising deputy prime
minister, is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   As for the component parts of the former Soviet Union, tidy
definitions of democracy are surely confounded by the
criminalization of the economy and, to some extent, political life,
not to mention the tenacity of Communist-era and Communist-style
political bosses who see elections pretty much as nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been imperfect democracies; the very messiness
of the political form invites imperfection. The United States has
had segregation, the internment of Japanese-Americans and repeated
episodes of local police brutality. Europeans differ on the limits
of free expression and how to treat minorities. But those can be
seen as shortcomings in realizing democracy's ideals, not a
negation of them. A more fundamental problem arises when
institutions are too weak to provide eventual remedies to the
shortcomings _ a role often played by elected legislatures and, in
America, the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, a democracy strays into rogue territory when a country
cannot muster any checks on the power plays of an elected leader
who chooses not to step aside and rewrites the rules accordingly. A
corollary is almost always oppression of some kind, often beginning
with the political opposition. And the mix becomes lethal, as it
did in Yugoslavia, if race, ethnicity or religion are then used to
inflame political passions.
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Craner, president of the International Republican
Institute, which is supported by the Republican Party, said that in
some dodgy democracies, ``a lot of people have figured out you can
have a bad election and get away with it.'' So his organization and
its opposite number in Washington, the National Democratic
Institute, have been thinking for years that it might be better to
concentrate more on what happens between elections. European
democracy groups and the Organization of African Unity are making a
similar shift, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when there's no other reason why
countries that have poor human rights and democracy records don't
get sanctioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kaufman Purcell, president of the Americas Society in New
York, classifies the governments of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and
Fujimori in Peru as ``imperfect democracies'' _ adding that often
``it is a hard call where to draw the line between imperfect
democracies and fake democracies.'' A democracy, she says, ``at the
very least must have some basic defining characteristics, the most
important being the ability to vote an incumbent out of power
through the use of a functioning electoral process that allows
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengt Save-Soderbergh, who runs a new intergovernmental
organization in Stockholm called the International Institute for
Democracy and Electoral Assistance, says even free and fair
elections don't define democracy: ``Deep down it's a culture, with
values and also respect, tolerance _ all these things.''
</P>
<P>
   At Emory University in Atlanta, Robert Pastor, an expert on
Latin America who served in the Carter administration and who has
advised and monitored elections as far afield as China, draws a
line at downgrading the essential role of national elections. There
are those who say, for example, that building in voting experience
from the village up, as China and Pakistan say they are doing (and
as Americans did before 1789), may be more useful than imposing
periodic national elections on an inexperienced people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an argument that says democracy is more than
elections,'' Pastor said. ``I agree with that, but not when one
takes the next step and says that elections are not that important
for democracy. On that I completely disagree. Democracy should be
more than free elections, but it can't be less.''

of those abroad who would judge their legitimacy to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Latin America, constitutions are routinely amended or
rewritten to expand the terms and power of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, where parliamentary elections are now less than
three weeks away, President Robert Mugabe has systematically
attacked the opposition under the guise of a violent campaign to
seize land from white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, lame-duck conservatives tried to block the newly
elected reformist parliament; it was seated only with the suffrance
of the Islamic republic's ``supreme religious leader,'' who can
veto such earthly procedures as elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, and now Malaysia, elected Asian governments
dominated by intolerant leaders have fashioned the most
sophisticated, perfectly legal methods of destroying political
opponents through the courts. The slow-moving prosecution on sex
charges of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's once-fast-rising deputy prime
minister, is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   As for the component parts of the former Soviet Union, tidy
definitions of democracy are surely confounded by the
criminalization of the economy and, to some extent, political life,
not to mention the tenacity of Communist-era and Communist-style
political bosses who see elections pretty much as nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been imperfect democracies; the very messiness
of the political form invites imperfection. The United States has
had segregation, the internment of Japanese-Americans and repeated
episodes of local police brutality. Europeans differ on the limits
of free expression and how to treat minorities. But those can be
seen as shortcomings in realizing democracy's ideals, not a
negation of them. A more fundamental problem arises when
institutions are too weak to provide eventual remedies to the
shortcomings _ a role often played by elected legislatures and, in
America, the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, a democracy strays into rogue territory when a country
cannot muster any checks on the power plays of an elected leader
who chooses not to step aside and rewrites the rules accordingly. A
corollary is almost always oppression of some kind, often beginning
with the political opposition. And the mix becomes lethal, as it
did in Yugoslavia, if race, ethnicity or religion are then used to
inflame political passions.
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Craner, president of the International Republican
Institute, which is supported by the Republican Party, said that in
some dodgy democracies, ``a lot of people have figured out you can
have a bad election and get away with it.'' So his organization and
its opposite number in Washington, the National Democratic
Institute, have been thinking for years that it might be better to
concentrate more on what happens between elections. European
democracy groups and the Organization of African Unity are making a
similar shift, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when there's no other reason why
countries that have poor human rights and democracy records don't
get sanctioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kaufman Purcell, president of the Americas Society in New
York, classifies the governments of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and
Fujimori in Peru as ``imperfect democracies'' _ adding that often
``it is a hard call where to draw the line between imperfect
democracies and fake democracies.'' A democracy, she says, ``at the
very least must have some basic defining characteristics, the most
important being the ability to vote an incumbent out of power
through the use of a functioning electoral process that allows
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengt Save-Soderbergh, who runs a new intergovernmental
organization in Stockholm called the International Institute for
Democracy and Electoral Assistance, says even free and fair
elections don't define democracy: ``Deep down it's a culture, with
values and also respect, tolerance _ all these things.''
</P>
<P>
   At Emory University in Atlanta, Robert Pastor, an expert on
Latin America who served in the Carter administration and who has
advised and monitored elections as far afield as China, draws a
line at downgrading the essential role of national elections. There
are those who say, for example, that building in voting experience
from the village up, as China and Pakistan say they are doing (and
as Americans did before 1789), may be more useful than imposing
periodic national elections on an inexperienced people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an argument that says democracy is more than
elections,'' Pastor said. ``I agree with that, but not when one
takes the next step and says that elections are not that important
for democracy. On that I completely disagree. Democracy should be
more than free elections, but it can't be less.''

   And then there is the problem of a different kind of rogue: The
electoral democracy whose human rights record or foreign policies
fall short of international standards but don't raise eyebrows. The
contrast between attitudes in America toward India and Pakistan is
instructive, one that human rights organizations often point to.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's annual international human rights survey
is very critical of India for its treatment of women, minorities
and people declared ``untouchable'' by the Hindu majority. In the
disputed territory of Kashmir, which is under Indian military
occupation, the report found significant abuses of the local Muslim
population. Moreover, American officials say that India has only
narrowly escaped being placed on the list of terrorist nations for
its backing of unrest in neighboring nations, including bombings
and perhaps assassinations in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But at Human Rights Watch in New York, Kenneth Roth, the
executive director, said that Americans often overlook the record
because most of India's governments have been freely elected, while
neighboring Pakistan gets much closer scrutiny, having lurched in
and out of military rule. ``India has many attributes of a
democracy,'' said Roth. ``But it's too facile to embrace India as a
democracy without recognizing the flawed nature of its political
system when it comes to marginal populations or perceived security
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram Narayan Kumar, an Indian human rights leader, worries about
the precedent. ``Around India,'' he said, ``the lesson other
countries there will learn is that you just have to appear to be
democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples matter everywhere, said John Hirsch, a former U.S.
ambassador to Sierra Leone who is vice president of the
International Peace Academy, a research organization with close
ties to the United Nations. In Africa, he said, the two countries
in which to hope for continued success are Nigeria and South
Africa, both of which held open elections last year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Joseph Smith, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia, said that strong democracies ``haven't
given enough thought to maintenance and sustaining of democracy.''
In the case of Peru, he added, the United States could have given
stronger support to the Organization of American States. Instead,
the Clinton administration first endorsed, then backed away from,
an unusually bold OAS judgment that the election was flawed. Smith
and Craner said that was a bad message to send to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to mobilize the multilateral organizations to a far
greater extent,'' Smith said. ``Democracy needs constant
attention.''

PERU'S FUJIMORI: AUTOCRAT? DEMOCRAT? WELL, BOTH

   LIMA, Peru _ The year was 1991. Alberto Fujimori was Peru's
newly elected president, and diplomats were rejoicing that every
government in Latin America except Cuba's was now democratically
elected. So Fujimori joined the leaders of Peru's four Andean
neighbors in proposing a radical plan: the Organization of American
States would require all 34 member states to sever diplomatic
relations with any government that took power unconstitutionally.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, Fujimori must be happy his plan was never
adopted. This week, the Organization of American States is to
consider how to punish Fujimori for claiming a third five-year term
after an election last Sunday that was tainted by dirty tricks and
re-interpretation of the constitution, which limits Peru's
presidents to two terms. His opponent, Alejandro Toledo, wound up
boycotting the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Peru is probably safe from any drastic measures, in large
part because the United States has backed away from supporting
strong OAS condemnation, and because Peru is not alone among its
peers in slipping back into old authoritarian patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The current president of Ecuador, a civilian, came to power in
January by military coup. The elected president of Venezuela is a
former military coup leader who has made all-out war on the
Congress and the courts. Paraguay's civilian government is
teetering.
</P>
<P>
   Does this turn of events mean that the man on horseback is
coming back in Latin America? Or is it that Latin America never
completely unsaddled him?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, authoritarianism and democracy have long coexisted in
Latin America, and a swing toward elections has never meant
autocracy is dead. A pattern of generals replacing civilian
presidents only to be replaced again by generals has been the rule
from Panama to Argentina for the better part of a century. A
variant on the theme, in places like Peru and Mexico, is a civilian
leader who is elected and then rules by fiat, fraud or manipulation
of the courts and congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The box on the outside is labeled a democracy,'' said Piero
Gleijeses, a professor of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins
University, ``but inside you have an authoritarian system.''
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Paz, the Mexican essayist, once wrote that the problem
with democracy in Latin America is that it was ``imported but not
adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   So Fujimori is not so much a model of a new kind of
authoritarianism as an exemplar of something older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military regimes were never that tough and our elected
governments were never that democratic,'' said Carlos Tapia, a
former Peruvian Congressman and social critic. ``Our coups were
never initiated by the military alone. There was always a group of
civilians ready to manipulate the military to jump in.''
</P>
<P>
   The model for the civilian strongman in Peru goes back at least
to the 1919 election of Augusto Leguia, a businessman with a taste
for top hats and thoroughbred horses, who served until a coup
upended his rule in 1930. Like Fujimori, Leguia was a
master-builder of roads and ports who eagerly sought foreign
investment. He also displayed little compunction about breaking
democratic rules. He ordered the army to shut down the congress, he
closed down newspapers that opposed him, and his race horses had
remarkable success at the track during his years in office.
</P>
<P>
   As for governing Peru, neither the military nor the civilian
strongmen have a stellar record. Most recently, the military
regimes that ruled from 1968 to 1980 pushed through a radical land
reform. But it ultimately failed, leading to a slump in agriculture
and a chaotic peasant migration to the cities that created
shantytowns that are still spreading. It did little for public
confidence in military efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   When civilians returned to power in 1980 the people were
overjoyed. But the next 10 years were marked by hyperinflation,
massive corruption and the eruption of terrorist violence. This
ultimately discredited the two traditional political parties,
leaving the public in despair about their hopes for order.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the people turned to Fujimori, the ultimate outsider, a
son of Japanese immigrants who belonged to no party and promised a
clean break with the past. His popularity soared when he disbanded
the Supreme Court and Congress in 1992, claiming that their corrupt
ways were blocking his policies. In 1995 he won re-election in a
landslide; it amounted to a democratic affirmation of
authoritarianism and left advocates of democracy worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full democracy means more than elections,'' noted Carlos
Ivan Degregori, an anthropologist at the Institute of Peruvian
Studies. ``It requires sturdy institutions: strong political
parties, an independent judiciary and a Congress willing to vote
against the executive branch.'' Most often, he said, ``the boundary
between democracy and authoritarianism is not so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true in the region's poorest countries,
such as neighboring Bolivia, where the democratically elected
president is a former military dictator. But it is also true in
Latin America's more economically and politically developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chile is still governed under a constitution that was written
when Augusto Pinochet was dictator; it gives the army independent
powers over selecting its commanders and even senators. The new
governor of Buenos Aires province in Argentina, when faced with a
rising crime problem, selected as his police chief a former army
colonel who had led a 1987 uprising to block trials against former
junta leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whichever way the pendulum swings,'' said Felipe Noguera, an
Argentine political consultant, ``it's not like the people
overnight become perfect democrats and the next day become
supporters of coups. People in this region are aware of both the
weaknesses of democracy and the perils of authoritarian rule.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why in the days leading up to last Sunday's
election, opinion polls showed that even though a majority of
Peruvians said they thought the election process was tainted, they
would vote for Fujimori.

COMMENTARY: NYMPHET AT THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Lolita of tennis may be cold on the court. Anna
Kournikova flopped at the French Open in a cascade of unforced
errors and double-faults.
</P>
<P>
   But the blond knockout, who turns 19 this week, burns up the
pages of the new issue of Sports Illustrated, with bronze legs,
black patent stiletto mules and a smoldering look that you usually
only see after-hours on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever having won a major tournament, Kournikova is the
highest-earning player in women's tennis _ and outearns most men.
Only problem is, she isn't making it playing. She's making it
vamping.
</P>
<P>
   Sports was one of the last bastions where you could still sell
tickets on pure ability. Michael Jordan's flair and good looks
didn't hurt, but it was his basketball moves that made him Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   With the ascendance of Anna, eroticism trumps athleticism. ``A
hot body can count as much as a good backhand,'' Sports Illustrated
says, calling her the Jezebel of Sweat, the Ground Strokin'
Goddess, the femme fatale of serves and curves. Linesmen only have
eyes for her lines. Ball boys dive for her sweaty towels.
</P>
<P>
   Under a picture of her mile-high legs and inch-long skirt and a
leopard-skin bra at a banquet, SI intones: ``To climb to the top of
the tennis ladder, Kournikova will have to step up her game
considerably.'' Translation: She got gams, not game.
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, Eric Van Harpen, admits it is hard to motivate a girl
who already has a Porsche and jewels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men play to win,'' he says. ``Women play not to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way, baby, since Billie Jean King whupped
Bobby Riggs in an exhibition game intended to pump interest in
women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-born Anna will soon be featured in ads for Berlei
sports bras with the slogan, ``Only the ball should bounce.''
Besides her $10 million in endorsements, she snagged a part in the
new Jim Carrey movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover,'' Frank Deford writes in SI about its cover girl,
``she has achieved this status at a time when we are all supposed
to be so gender-enlightened, when pretty isn't supposed to matter
anymore in the workplace, especially in such a meritocratic domain
as sports. So here is what Kournikova proves about Homo sapiens,
male division, circa 2000: Skin-deep still counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Skin-deep still counts?
</P>
<P>
   Skin-deep rules _ even where it wasn't supposed to. America is
more obsessed with looks and sex appeal than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Once women burned their bras. Now they're lining up for bras
featuring built-in silicone bags, giving you the ``natural''
implant look.
</P>
<P>
   Silicone-deep counts.
</P>
<P>
   When Arnon Milchan, the flamboyant Hollywood producer of
``Pretty Woman'' and ``L.A. Confidential,'' pledged $120 million in
a nine-year deal for TV rights to the Women's Tennis Association
tour two years ago, he hired designers to make sexy clothes for
teen hotties like Anna, Martina Hingis and Venus Williams. This,
even though some young players already wore outfits so revealing
that the tennis analyst Mary Carillo likened it to ``kiddie porn''
and Martina Navratilova cracked, ``Why not just send them out there
naked?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Anna's fellow players can't stand her. Nathalie Tauziat,
a 32-year-old French player who ranks seventh in the world, has
written a book titled ``The Hidden Side of Tennis,'' in which she
asserts that the game is being ruined by babes who care more about
modeling than playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aesthetics and charisma are seen as more important than
sporting performance,'' she writes, ``and it won't change as long
as the box office puts Kournikova ahead of Lindsay Davenport just
because she is prettier ... For the WTA, Anna is a really powerful
cash machine, a blond godsend.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the women players try to teach the 15th-ranked
Anna a lesson: ``They all play harder to make her realize that, on
court, being the prettiest is useless.'' Anna's a diva. She expects
the cattiness.
</P>
<P>
   I covered tennis in the '70s, a period when the most famous
woman playing was a man _ Renee Richards, who had undergone a sex
change and had to go to court in New York to be able to play in the
U.S. Open. So maybe I have flexible ideas about female tennis
stars. Or maybe I just accept that life has certain verities.
</P>
<P>
   As E.M. Forster wrote, ``Beauty creates its own rules of
conduct.''

COMMENTARY: GREEN CHEESE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Argentina is a faraway country about which most people in the
United States know only what they learned from Andrew Lloyd Webber.
And while the government of Fernando de la Rua is facing serious
economic problems _ a weak recovery from last year's nasty slump,
growing labor unrest _ ``crisis'' would be far too strong a word.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Argentina has special symbolic importance in the battle
among economic ideologies. The Latin nation has been a sort of
poster child for the anti-Keynesian counterrevolution, for those
who want to banish discretion and human fallibility from monetary
policy. The nation's current difficulties won't cause the true
believers to lose faith. But the contrast between the bad economic
news in Argentina and good news elsewhere in Latin America is a
reminder that green cheese has its virtues after all.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled? Let me explain. Until the 1930s, recessions were
generally regarded as inevitable, and perhaps even desirable _ a
sort of purging process that cleansed the economy after the
excesses of the preceding boom. The government's job was to provide
sound money and balance its own budget; a depressed economy would
heal itself.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of mass unemployment some economists _ most
notably the British theorist John Maynard Keynes _ concluded that
recessions were neither healthy nor inevitable. They were, instead,
an economic pathology that resulted when too many people tried to
hoard cash instead of buying real goods and services. In a famous
passage Keynes declared that ``unemployment develops ... because
people want the moon: Men cannot be employed when the object of
desire (i.e. money) is something which cannot be produced and the
demand for which cannot readily be choked off.'' And he offered an
answer: ``There is no remedy but to persuade the public that green
cheese is practically the same thing and to have a green cheese
factory (i.e. central bank) under public control.'' In other words,
the government could and should print money to stimulate a
depressed economy.
</P>
<P>
   For hard-money types this was and remains anathema. The dream of
going back to an objective monetary standard _ preferably gold, but
anyway something untouched by human hands _ has been kept alive by
a small but well-financed group of enthusiasts. And in 1991 they
got their wish: Argentina, desperate to regain credibility after
decades of irresponsible policy, not only pegged its peso to the
dollar but backed each peso with a dollar in reserves. In effect,
the national green cheese factory was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, Argentina _ helped not only by the
end of hyperinflation but also by the removal of many controls that
had strangled business _ experienced an economic surge, and the
hard-money enthusiasts took full credit. Only last year, as the
currency of neighboring Brazil tumbled, an op-ed writer at The Wall
Street Journal held up Argentina as a model: ``No stimulating of
the economy through inflation, no improving the `competitiveness'
of exports through currency devaluation. Just money that works.''
And she went on to express her ultimate wish: ``Now if only America
could make the dollar as good as gold.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Argentina's money may work, many Argentines don't,
because they can't find jobs. The devaluation in Brazil was
followed by a flight of manufacturing to Argentina's suddenly
lower-cost neighbor. Although Argentina's government has insisted
that slashing spending and raising taxes to balance the budget will
promote recovery by restoring confidence, the actual effect _ as
Keynes could have told you _ has been the opposite: With lower
incomes, consumers are spending less, and recovery has been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   And meanwhile Brazil has bounced back: that devaluation has
turned out to be just what the doctor ordered. Chile and Mexico,
with their floating exchange rates, are doing well. Right now
Argentina has the worst, not the best, of Latin America's major
economies.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that de la Rua should devalue the peso. Too many
loans, even from one Argentine to another, are in dollars _ and
anyway the political cost would be catastrophic. At least for the
time being, I fear that Argentina is stuck. But its travails are a
lesson for the rest of us, especially those who are nostalgic for
the certainties of the gold standard: Keynes was right. Taken in
moderation, green cheese can be good for your health.

   To Be or Not to Be, Texas Style, and Bush-Lessness &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has the distinction of presiding
over more executions (131) than any governor in the country. So, on
Thursday, when he granted his first 30-day reprieve to a death-row
inmate, the political world took note: was it an instance of a man
running as a compassionate conservative trying to advertise his
charitable nature?
</P>
<P>
   Matters of life and death can become embroiled in the theater of
politics. Eight years ago, a presidential candidate who also
happened to be a governor made a special trip back to his home
state of Arkansas to be on hand for an execution, an act viewed in
political circles as a demonstration of a moderate Democrat's
tough-on-crime credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides insisted there was nothing political about their
candidate's decision, which paved the way for DNA tests to be
administered to try to clarify the condemned man's guilt or
innocence in a case of rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an opportunity to get more information now from that
test,'' said Karen P. Hughes, a spokesman for Bush. ``So he feels
it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With the candidates' daily rollout of positions on all sorts of
pressing issues _ last week Bush and Vice President Al Gore offered
their takes on, among other things, mental health care, cancer
treatment and land conservation _ voters can be forgiven for
forgetting that the politicians still hold important day jobs that
can change lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the ceremonial aspects of their offices meld with the
oratorical requirements of their campaigns, as they did for Gore on
Monday, when he addressed a Memorial Day commemoration in
Pennsylvania. Noting his own military service, which included a
five-month stint in Vietnam as an Army reporter, Gore said, ``I
know that my service doesn't in any way match that of the heroes we
honor on this day.'' One of the more unusual aspects of the speech,
delivered in a week in which polls showed the presidential contest
to be neck-and-neck: not a single mention of Bush.

   The Physicist and the Wrapper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like poets who find inspiration on the kitchen table or back
porch, physicists are rediscovering the world they can see with the
unaided eye. The trend began at least a decade ago when they began
pondering why Brazil nuts, the largest and heaviest nuggets in a
can of mixed nuts, always end up on top after being jostled during
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The movement may have found its Ferlinghetti in Dr. Eric Kramer,
a physicist at Simon's Rock College in Massachusetts, who presented
experiments to explain that plague upon opera, theater and serious
music: the maddening, inescapable crackling of candy wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the sound, Kramer and a colleague discovered
that it was not a continuous rustle but a series of brief,
unpredictable bursts just thousandths of a second long. As
theatergoers may already suspect, opening a wrapper slowly does not
quiet those bursts but only slows down the rate at which they go
off. Each snap, Kramer found, is the product of a tiny
rearrangement of one of the creases in the wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of those innumerable little rearrangements is
complex enough to keep any physicist happy. But like the Brazil nut
phenomenon, which was found to be caused by a subtle circulation in
the can, the candy wrapper research may be most interesting as
another step in the journey of physicists back from the minuscule
scale of the atom and the gigantic scale of the cosmos. Like
Ferlinghetti, they are rediscovering the mysteries of the here and
now.

   The arrival of 2 of the 11 women legislators at the opening of
Iran's new Parliament, the first dominated by reformers since the
1979 Islamic revolution, signaled a change. Elaheh Koulai from
Tehran and Tahreh Rezazadeh from Shiraz chose not to wear the
chador, the head-to-toe black covering that has been an Iranian
symbol for two decades. More reformist chic than radical, they wore
long shapeless coats and pinned their black scarves tightly under
their chins so no hair showed, which the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers' plans include increasing press freedom and
creating a more prosperous economy for an overwhelmingly young
population. The women's dress, though, stirred hope that the new
Parliament may indeed ease religious restrictions that have

of women and girls around the world may suffer abuse during their
lives, from their birth to battering later in life. Unable to
resist sexual advances by family members, girls and women become
vulnerable to disease, including AIDS, which is now infecting more
women than men in Africa.

   An End to Privacy
</P>
<P>
   For more than 2,000 adoptees in Oregon who have applied to see
their original birth certificates, the long wait is about to end.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor refused a request by
a group of birth mothers to block a law passed by the state's
voters in 1998 granting any adopted adult access to the birth
records. The birth mothers had argued that the nation's first such
voter-approved law was an unconscionable privacy violation, but
adoptees said they have an even more basic right to try to discover
where they came from _ and what their biological parents' medical
histories might be.

   Record Outs  &QL;

   Randy Velarde, the Oakland Athletics' second baseman, became the
11th player in major league baseball history to turn in an
unassisted triple play. With none out and runners on first and
second, the Athletics' opponents, the Yankees, tried a double
steal. Velarde went to cover second base. Shane Spencer hit a line
drive up the middle right to Velarde, who tagged out Jorge Posada
as he ran from first and then stepped on second base to force out
Tino Martinez. Three outs in less than three seconds. ``You have a
better chance of getting struck by lightning,'' Velarde said
afterward.

<P>
   The pervasive abuse of women is compounding AIDS in some of the
poorest countries of southern Africa and South Asia, a Unicef
survey reported. The study suggests that between a fifth and a half
of women and girls around the world may suffer abuse during their
lives, from their birth to battering later in life. Unable to
resist sexual advances by family members, girls and women become
vulnerable to disease, including AIDS, which is now infecting more
women than men in Africa.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A hot new issue is lurking just below the political
radar, ready to explode onto the American electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tests off the charts!'' said Neil Newhouse, a Republican
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Penn, President Clinton's pollster, said, ``Everybody's
seen it in their surveys _ it's pretty hard to miss. It's a pretty
powerful groundswell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who held three hearings on the
subject last week, gushed, ``Boy, you prompt it with just a couple
words and you're going to get a torrent of responses from people.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is privacy. It encompasses far more than peeping toms,
or even hackers invading Web sites or intercepting cell phone
conversations. Not only are people frightened that information
about their personal peccadillos could turn up in hostile hands,
but also that thieves could cash in on their financial data.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, people confess to pollsters, they are suspicious
of companies that have access to their financial and health care
records, and are frightened that the information will be used
against them. They are no less wary of what the government could do
with such data.
</P>
<P>
   To many voters, that their movements and activities are being
tracked on the Internet _ perhaps even by their bosses _ may not
pose a direct danger. But the very idea of it is, well, creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting an opportunity, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George
W. Bush have begun speaking out about protecting the dissemination
of private information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there is greater protection for your video rental
receipts than for your most intimate medical information,'' Gore
said in a speech at New York University two weeks ago. ``I've seen
cases where people's prescription drug histories are sold freely to
direct mail companies without their permission; where hundreds of
employees at an HMO have access to patients' records.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush offered a nod, telling Business Week recently, ``I'm a
privacy-rights person. The marketplace can function without
sacrificing the privacy of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, privacy seems like a sure-fire political issue: it
touches day-to-day anxieties triggered when people are asked to
divulge their credit card number over the telephone or when they
retrieve cash from an ATM machine. It is always a draw for press
coverage. And as Internet use burgeons, so will fears.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians face a challenge to convert privacy from being a
subliminal worry to something that will actually affect how people
vote. Complicating that challenge is that privacy is not, at first
glance, a matter that would drive voters to one party or another.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been the most aggressive in vying for the privacy
niche. They are framing it as a tension between civil libertarians
and consumers on one side and big business on the other. Already,
in the House, Democrats have zeroed in on a vote taken last July,
in which most Republicans opposed instituting rigorous privacy
protection for customers' medical and financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Although privacy comes up less in political discourse among
Republicans, they argue that it would not be out of character for
them to seize the issue. After all, libertarians have always been
big on privacy. And Republicans were the most outspoken in
condemning the Census Bureau's long form, asserting that it was an
infringement on privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hill that nobody holds, and either party could seize
the ground,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who for
months has been using flip charts to persuade his clients that
privacy ``is a huge issue waiting'' for someone to grab. ``The
issue of privacy is very much in the place that health care was a
decade or so ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that either party could potentially become
identified with privacy, Newhouse said the competition will be over
who ``can be there first and strongest and be the noisiest on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Gallup poll in March asked who would better handle
protecting ordinary Americans against invasions of privacy. Gore
drew 41 percent; Bush, 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy may be so potentially hot that some candidates did not
want to publicly admit that they were husbanding the issue for
their fall arsenals. Who wants to tip off a rival to a fresh line
of attack?
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaigns are reluctant about showing leg early on this,''
said Jim Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But candidates who face primary opponents do not have the luxury
of holding off. Last week, former Rep. Maria Cantwell, who is
running for the Democratic Senate nomination from Washington state,
began broadcasting a television commercial on privacy. Cantwell,
who lost her seat after one term in the Gingrich revolution of
1994, went on to make between $25 million and $50 million in the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Peering into the camera, Cantwell says in the 30-second spot:
``What you do on your own computer should be your business and
nobody else's. I want to make sure no child is left behind and that
the Internet remains a tool for learning, not another way for
government, banks or insurance companies to invade your privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of another Democrat, Mike Ciresi, a trial lawyer
who is seeking the Senate nomination from Minnesota, last week
swamped potential supporters with thousands of glossy brochures
featuring the headline, ``Mike Ciresi Will Protect Your Privacy!''
'
</P>
<P>
   When voters are asked what concerns them most, they seldom cite
privacy right off the bat. Yet pollsters find that when voters are
probed about issues that affect their lives, privacy shoots to the
top _ or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave me a couple of ears _ I just listen to people,'' said
Brian Schweitzer, a peppermint farmer and soil scientist from
Whitefish, Mont., who is running for the U.S. Senate. ``Everywhere
I go in Montana people want to protect their privacy. It's huge!''
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer, a Democrat who hopes to oust Sen. Conrad Burns,
accused the Republican incumbent of co-sponsoring a bill that
``would force the individual consumer to contact corporate America
and beg them not to collate and sell your personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Burns insisted that Schweitzer ``mischaracterized
the legislation'' and was simply ``trying to get his name in the
paper.'' He is just as committed, he said, to guarding people's
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether this issue will truly rouse voters in the
fall of 2000 to the same extent as health care and education. After
all, even after the tax revolt of 1978 in California, it took years
for cutting taxes to become a winning issue nationally. And despite
stirrings about smog and dirty water in the 1970s, the environment
did not emerge as a top-of-the-mind concern of American voters
until years later.
</P>
<P>
   The other challenge facing both sides is that there are no easy
remedies for protecting privacy. Even if consumers clamor about
their rights, no politician wants to be seen taking steps that
could hobble the new economy _ or provoke the Internet industry,
which has become increasingly generous in doling out contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates should also be mindful that there can be unintended
consequences when they try to capitalize on a new issue.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for Rep. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said that in
their drive to topple the incumbent Republican, Sen. Spencer
Abraham, they plan to castigate him as siding with big business _
and against consumers _ on privacy matters.
</P>
<P>
   But Abraham shot back that he intends to play up that his
campaign has an ``Internet privacy policy on our Web site _ and she
doesn't even have one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be interesting for Congresswoman Stabenow to make
that an issue,'' he said. ``We're explicit. We will protect the
privacy of people who log on to our Web site.''

 A NEWT-LESS REVOLUTION WITH A FAMILIAR AGENDA

 By   ALISON11 MITCHELL   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Gov. George W. Bush rolls out policy address
after policy address, congressional Republicans are watching him do
what Newt Gingrich, Trent &UR; 12 &LR;  Lott &UR; 13 &LR;  and the self-effacing Dennis
Hastert &UR; 14 &LR;  could not: win a fresh hearing for ideas cherished by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Newt-less revolution.
</P>
<P>
   For all the recent talk of how Bush has moved to the center, the
thrust of his campaign has been to employ more sympathetic rhetoric
and symbolism to refashion &UR; 15 &LR;  a Republican policy wish list long
familiar on Capitol Hill and in conservative think tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not speak in strident, angry tones of big government.
Rather, he focuses on how conservative ideas can help the working
poor, describing, for example, how tax incentives could help expand
home ownership. Sometimes the picture alone sends a message, with
Bush standing next to minority children or campaigning in the inner
city.
</P>
<P>
   It's this sort of thing that has helped Bush give the
Republicans the kinder, gentler face they have longed for in place
of Gingrich's steely intellectualism.
</P>
<P>
   In substance, though, Bush has done little to challenge the
basic conservative tenets that have defined his party at least
since Ronald Reagan's presidency. Yes, he has chastised House
Republicans on the budget, and told Senate Republicans not to tie
the president's hands on foreign policy. But only on education has
he broken fundamentally with his conservative allies by calling for
the federal government to play a more forceful role in America's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free market guys like me don't see in his suggestions anything
that's problematic,'' said Grover &UR; 16 &LR;  Norquist &UR; 17 &LR; , president of
Americans for Tax Reform, who had been a Gingrich adviser. ``And we
welcome his much-improved tone and rhetoric _ over Barry
Goldwater &UR; 18 &LR; , let's say.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's proposals, like diverting some Social Security
payroll taxes to individual investment accounts, have drawn rave
reviews from the conservative intellectuals. As the writer
Ramesh &UR; 19 &LR;  Ponnuru &UR; 20 &LR;  noted in a recent National Review story,
Social Security is ``symbolically what's left of the New Deal,''
and Bush is not holding it sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bush's ideas have been incubating in Republican policy
circles for years. For example:
</P>
<P>
   When Bush spoke on Social Security, he was picking up a ball
dropped by the House Ways and Means Committee, when Republican
leaders, afraid of the political risk, scuttled plans to create an
individual investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush's support of a missile defense system with
global reach has a GOP &UR; 21 &LR;  heritage stretching back to President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In advocating a $1.3 trillion tax reduction over 10 years, Bush
is aligning himself with House and Senate Republicans, who pushed
in 1999 for a $792 billion tax reduction, then retreated in
disarray after President Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, Bush's proposal for a tax credit of up to $2,000 a
family to help working people with low or moderate incomes buy
health insurance is very close to proposals pushed by Rep. Dick
Armey &UR; 22 &LR; , R-Texas, the House majority leader, and Sen &UR; 23 &LR; . Bill
Frist &UR; 24 &LR; , R-Tenn &UR; 25 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Bush's advisers occasionally become impatient
with comparisons of their candidate's ``compassionate
conservatism'' to Clinton's ``New Democrat'' break with his own
party's orthodoxy. Bush's policy agenda, one of his aides said,
``is within Republican orthodoxy but takes it to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   For congressional Republicans, who long regarded themselves as
belonging to the party of ideas, this is vindication. This time,
they feel, they have the right messenger and, as a presidential
contender, he has a megaphone almost as big as the president's.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Bush's Social Security proposal, Armey &UR; 22 &LR;  said, ``A
Republican in the House brings it up and before he can get it
before the American people it gets reframed &UR; 26 &LR;  as the secret
Republican plan to destroy Social Security. When Governor Bush
brings it up, people first say, `What is he talking about?' And
when he brings it up it has a standing with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari &UR; 27 &LR;  Fleischer &UR; 28 &LR; , a Bush spokesman who attended many House
Republican hand-wringing sessions, noted that a lawmaker with an
idea got little attention, but ``when Governor Bush gave his speech
on Social Security it was carried live on CNN and Fox TV and made
the front page of all the national newspapers the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that, despite his amiability, Bush's positions
are to the right of those of the great American middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a fairly doctrinaire conservative,'' said
Sen &UR; 23 &LR; . Charles Schumer &UR; 29 &LR; , D-N.Y. ``I think he has done a
masterful job at making himself look more moderate than the
positions he has taken in the campaign, let alone his record in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gore and his allies have been trying to portray Bush as out
of the mainstream by branding each of his proposals a ``risky
scheme.'' But this has proven harder for the Democrats than four
years ago _ and not just because of Bush's manner.
</P>
<P>
   The federal surplus has changed the political dynamics. In 1995,
when Republicans wanted to balance the budget as well as grant a
large tax cut, it meant they had to make unpopular reductions in
other programs. By contrast, Bush has been able to propose both a
large tax cut and new social spending. And Democrats, in trying to
co-opt or defuse some Republican ideas, have made them harder to
demonize.
</P>
<P>
   Take missile defense. Last year the White House dropped its veto
threat against legislation calling for a national missile defense
after some language was inserted committing the nation to build
such a program only when it became ``technologically possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That accommodation _ as well as a newly perceived threat from
rogue nations _ helped shift the debate so that the battle was no
longer over whether to have a missile defense, but what kind and at
what cost.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton's call for the government itself to invest
some Social Security taxes in the stock market, coupled with his
proposal to give lower income taxpayers up to $300 a year for a new
type of retirement account, makes it harder for Democrats to argue
against Bush's innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Public attitudes also change over time and over generations. The
Bush campaign is betting that with nearly half of American
households now owning stock, fewer Americans will so fear the
market that they will insist that Social Security remain as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has
come,'' Armey &UR; 22 &LR;  said. The Democrats are hoping mightily that
Bush's timing is off.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   BKN-ARATON-COLUMN (New York) _ There was symbolism and symmetry
to the end of another Knicks' season Friday night, when their drive
to make it cross country, to the finals, featured Latrell Sprewell
at the wheel, steering an offense that offered little communication
and less companionship. By Harvey Araton.

</P>
<P>
   BKN-KNICKS (New York) _ A year ago, it had been different in so
many ways. The season lasted only five games longer last year, but
the joy would last all summer long. As the Knicks stuffed their
belongings into garbage bags in the crowded locker room after
Friday night's season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers, there was
no hint that this team wanted to recall the events of the season,
or that they much wanted to consider the possibility of seeing each
other again in October. By Steve Popper.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-PACERS (Undated) _ Only when Reggie Miller turned into the
best version of himself, demanding the ball and then letting his
shots silence the crowd in Game 6 at Madison Square Garden Friday
night, was Indiana's transformation complete. By Liz Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-LAKERS-TRAILBLAZERS (Los Angeles) _ If nothing else, as they
prepare to return home for Game 7 of the Western Division finals,
the aura of invincibility surrounding the Los Angeles Lakers has
been shattered. By Tom Spousta.

Hardaway is probable, Grant Hill and Tim Duncan are questionable
and Allen Iverson is extremely doubtful. As injuries pile up for
the U.S. men's Olympic team, the alternate list keeps growing.
While Hardaway's injured foot is expected to heal in time for the
Summer Games in Sydney, which begin in September, Hill and Duncan

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CHERNOBYL-REVISITED (CHERNOBYL, Ukraine) _ They are gardening
again at Chernobyl. Rounding the last corner on the road to the
destroyed reactor of Unit No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant, the most striking discovery at the site of the worst
radiation accident in history is the two young women in white masks
picking gingerly at the earth with hoes and rakes. By Patrick E.
Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CLINTON (Moscow) _ In his final visit to Moscow as
president, Bill Clinton arrived here Saturday to find Russia and
its new leader, Vladimir Putin, absorbed with domestic politics, a
wrenching set of economic reforms just getting under way and an
unresolved war in Chechnya. By Patrick E. Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   THIRDWAY-LEADERS (Berlin) _ When they met in Italy one year ago,
they were leaders of a ``Third Way'' and their founding members
were President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Saturday, as Clinton joined 12 other left-of-center presidents and
prime ministers here in Berlin, the ``Third Way'' was banished in
favor of ``Progressive Governance.'' And Blair, pleading the need
to help his wife care for their new-born baby, decided to stay
home. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-EUROPE (Warsaw, Poland) _ Having finally achieved full
NATO membership only a year ago, Poland finds itself caught
awkwardly between its European aspirations and its loyalty to the
United States. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-GAY-PARENTS (Jerusalem) _ Four-year-old Matan
Berner-Kadish has always had two mothers. But it was not until
Monday that the state of Israel accepted that basic fact of his
existence, with a watershed court ruling that drew howls of outrage
from the religious right. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE-U.S. (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ As Sierra Leone
slid back into war last month, the British were conspicuous as the
one Western power willing to shore up the faltering U.N.
peacekeeping force. Their presence merely emphasized the absence of
the United States, which last year was a major backer of the peace
agreement that granted amnesty to a brutal warlord, Foday Sankoh,
and even brought him into government. By Norimitsu Onishi with Jane
Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   RED-CROSS-LEADER (Geneva) _ While most international officials
of his rank are out on this city's thriving cocktail party circuit,
Jakob Kellenberger, a courtly but determined former Swiss diplomat,
heads home from the International Committee of the Red Cross,
getting an early night for his customary 7 a.m. start next day.
Kellenberger, 56, has taken the helm of the 137-year-old
International Red Cross when global humanitarian agencies are
facing more challenges than ever before. By Elizabeth Olson.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-TORTURE (Istanbul, Turkey) _ When a harsh report
asserting that torture is widespread in Turkey was released, the
surprise was not just the amount of damning evidence it contained,
but also the source. Rather than being prepared by a private
advocacy group, the report was the work of the parliamentary
committee on human rights. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RACE-CHURCH (Decatur, Ga.) _ Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m Sunday
the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. And yet, the
Tabernacle is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What
draws its members is the intensity of their Pentacostal faith,
which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all
believers, regardless of background. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   (First in a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived in
America.'')
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-TEACHERS-TAXES (Los Angeles) _ Gov. Gray Davis' proposal
to show support for California's public school teachers by
exempting them from state income taxes has run into unexpected
opposition. Legislative leaders of both parties in both houses in
Sacramento oppose it as bad policy and the start of a slippery
slope toward similar demands from other public employees. Even the
teachers' unions oppose the plan. They fear it would leave them
open to attacks from fellow government workers, and prefer salary
increases instead. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   APPALACIA-MARIJUANA (Hindman, Ky.) _ Countless hidden marijuana
patches dot the springtime ``hollers'' of Appalachia the way
moonshine stills used to. ``Moonshine went out in the late '70s,
just when marijuana started big around here,'' said Sheriff Wheeler
Jacobs. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-PROTESTS (Detroit) _ For the next three days, anyone
wearing a mask in this city or carrying gasoline in a portable
container will go to jail. And those in possession of ammonia,
urine, feces or squirt bottles can expect intense police scrutiny.
This is Mayor Dennis Archer's response to human rights campaigners
who plan, starting on Sunday, to unleash the same kind of protests
that left Seattle with $2.5 million in damage last December after a
meeting of the World Trade Organization. The protests planned here
are directed at a three-day summit being held across the Detroit
River in downtown Windsor, Ontario. Delegates from the Organization
of American States, a coalition of 34 nations, are gathering to
discuss ways to bolster trade in North and South America. By
Nichole M. Christian.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-QUANDARY (Chicago) _ The nation's biggest food companies
face a marketing quandary in the debate over genetically altered
crops, which environmentalists contend are potentially dangerous
but which the Food and Drug Administration has deemed entirely
safe. By David Barboza.

   BUSH-IMAGE (Austin, Texas) _ Are George W. Bush and his allies
overplaying his disdain for intellectualism, to the point where
they are sometimes making him out to be a self-satisfied boob? By
Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   TRIAL-LAWYERS-POLITICS (Undated) _ The powerful Association of
Trial Lawyers of America has vowed to do everything to defeat Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who has long made changes in liability
laws a centerpiece of his campaign. But while the trial lawyers
have given Al Gore a great fund-raising advantage, they have also
given the Republicans a ready target in their campaign to link Gore
to the image of greedy trial lawyers. By Barry Meier.
</P>

   CAMPAIGN-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Term-limit reneger gets party help;

PUTIN HINTS AT COLLABORATION WITH U.S. ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his final visit to Moscow as president, Bill Clinton
arrived here Saturday to find Russia and its new leader, Vladimir
Putin, absorbed with domestic politics, a wrenching set of economic
reforms just getting under way and an unresolved war in Chechnya
that spawned Putin's political rise.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders were dining Saturday night at the Kremlin
palace, where they were expected to air their views on a broad
range of topics, from anti-missile defense strategies to human
rights concerns over the war in the Caucasus. Formal negotiating
sessions will take place on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has come to a Russia that is relatively stable, poised
for economic recovery and more politically united _ though disputes
abound _ than at any time since the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. This is a sharp contrast with Clinton's most recent visits
here _ in 1996 when former President Boris Yeltsin was fighting for
his political life against an entrenched Communist opposition, and
in 1998 when the Russian ruble and much of the country's economy
had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Like a younger Bill Clinton (Clinton was 46 when he became
president eight years ago; Putin is 47), Putin has taken command of
the Kremlin with an apparent determination to focus on his
country's economic problems and other pressing domestic issues
while keeping things quiet on the foreign policy front. There,
America still looms as an enormous force in Russia's calculations
on everything from financial assistance and debt restructuring to
NATO expansion and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking agreement to modify a 1972 treaty and thus go
ahead with a national anti-missile defense; Russia has so far
refused.
</P>
<P>
   Right after his inauguration last month, Putin, a former KGB
officer, stirred liberal fears about his commitment to democracy
when heavily armed police raided the offices of a top news media
organization. On Sunday, Clinton will sit for a radio interview _
with live questions from the audience over the Internet _ on the
popular Ekho Moskvy station in what is intended as a gesture of
support for the freedom of the press in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton will address the Russian Duma, or lower house
of parliament, which has formed a strong pro-reform, and pro-Putin
majority, since elections last December, though many battles over
land ownership, regional autonomy and national investment lie
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The economic reality that Russia faces was highlighted most
glaringly by Putin himself after he was named acting president on
New Year's Eve when Yeltsin resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reach the production level of Portugal and Spain, two
countries that are not known as leaders of the world economy,''
Putin said, ``it will take Russia approximately 15 years'' even
under optimistic growth assumptions of 8 percent a year. Only twice
in this century, he said, had Russia been so weak, ``after the
October Revolution in 1917, and in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, as a political unknown whose disposition, to the Western
eye, is somewhat dour, seems unlikely to achieve with Clinton the
easy-going ``Boris and Bill'' chemistry that dominated Yeltsin's
two terms. Putin seemed a little uncomfortable when the Japanese
prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, announced during an April summit
meeting in St. Petersburg that the two leaders would call each
other by their diminutive names, Yoshi and Volodya.
</P>
<P>
   Under Putin, still very much the man in the gray suit, a more
pragmatic and businesslike style prevails these days in the
Kremlin, though he has bonded in an openly friendly manner with
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin has betrayed a certain admiration for Clinton. When
the two leaders met last fall in New Zealand at a meeting of
Asian-Pacific leaders, Putin was still a novice prime minister,
whose popularity among Russians was soaring due to his resolute
prosecution of the war in Chechnya. Putin admitted to a group of
interviewers from the newspaper Kommersant that he was charmed by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that first meeting, he paid special attention to me,''
Putin said, referring to Clinton. ``He made a point of coming up to
me. We had been seated at different tables. We talked about
something for a while, and then he said, `Well, shall we go?' All
the heads of state lined up. And he and I walked together along
that corridor. We exited the hall to the sound of applause. I
appreciated this sign of special regard,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin will meet three more times this year, in July
in Okinawa at a meeting of the world's wealthiest nations, in New
York in September at the United Nations and in Brunei in November,
where the Asian Pacific leaders will gather once again.
</P>
<P>
   While clearly Putin has strong views, especially on NATO
expansion and on the restoration of Russian power and national
dignity in international affairs, he has shown great pragmatism in
avoiding confrontation with the West, where he says he sees
Russia's future as a European nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton adopted that theme on Friday, when he used a speech
accepting a prestigious European award to appeal to western
Europeans to admit Russia, eventually, to both NATO and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult problems facing Clinton in the
relationship is that both leaders know that history has assigned
them different time slots in different decades. Clinton is almost
at the end of his term, and Putin is just embarking on his. And
this difference may do more to define the psychology at this summit
meeting than any other factor. Clinton has come here seeking to
make progress on his proposal to build a system of national missile
defense that requires an agreement to amend the treaty banning such
nationwide systems signed by Moscow and Washington more than 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If accepted by Russia, the American proposal represents a
profound turning point from offensive to defensive strategies by
the world's two largest nuclear powers, one with the potential to
reignite an arms race and alienate China, whose small nuclear
arsenal would loose its deterrent credibility. Putin sent his
foreign minister to the United Nations last month to warn that
America's missile defense plans could destabilize three decades of
arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an interview with ``The NBC Nightly News'' just
before Clinton's arrival, Putin hinted that the United States and
Russia might collaborate on new ways to shoot down enemy missiles
soon after they were launched, and thus address the problems posed
by nuclear weapons being acquired by so-called rogue states.
Clinton says the United States seeks an anti-missile defense only
to address that threat, although the Russians and Chinese are
skeptical that this is the true purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin will certainly engage Clinton's arguments, the
Russian leader knows that he also has the luxury of waiting for the
next American president. That gives him an advantage over Clinton,
who is in a hurry to improve the final cornice work of his
presidency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, Putin has opened his term with a strategy
to strengthen federal power over Russia's vast region in
preparation for slogging economic reforms. He has also chastened or
bullied some of the country's most powerful oligarchs and launched
cogent tax reform proposals in hopes of establishing a level of
fiscal health in Russia that can outlive the current economic
boomlet that derives from high oil prices and a recovery among
export industries who profited from the massive devaluation of the
ruble in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has proposed legislation to gut and remake the upper house
of parliament, bolster the independence of the judiciary and weaken
the power of Russia's 89 governors. His proposals appear so
sweeping that his critics have attacked him for trying to recreate
the vertical power structure of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader's personal views on the subject have only
deepened those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, Russia was created as a
supercentralized state,'' he told interviewers this spring.
``That's practically laid down in its genetic code, its traditions
and the mentality of its people.''

MATAN HAS TWO MOMMIES, AND ISRAEL IS TALKING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Four-year-old Matan Berner-Kadish, the center of a
swirling debate about alternative families, is not at all
conflicted about his identity. He knows he is a Power Ranger,
fiercer than any Ninja warrior by far.
</P>
<P>
   Towheaded with floppy bangs, Matan was completely nonplused by
the photographs of his parents on the front page of Israeli
newspapers last week. ``Mommy,'' he said, pointing to Nicole
Berner-Kadish, ``and Eema,'' he added, using the Hebrew word for
mommy and pointing to Ruti Berner-Kadish.
</P>
<P>
   For Matan, there has never been any question. He has always had
two mothers, or, to be precise, one mom who is American-born and
speaks to him in English and one eema who is Israeli-born and
speaks to him in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until Monday that the state of Israel accepted
that basic fact of his existence, with a watershed court ruling
that drew howls of outrage _ but not much more _ from the religious
right.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli High Court ordered the government to register Nicole
Berner-Kadish, an American-Israeli who adopted Matan in California,
as his second mother and to list him on her national identity card.
Matan _ whose name means ``gift'' _ was conceived and planned as
the child of both women. But after Ruti Berner-Kadish, who was
artificially inseminated, gave birth to him, Israel, unlike
California, refused to recognize Nicole's parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   A classic Israeli idiom, which means to proclaim that there's no
one like mom, says, ``There is only one mother.'' And the
government felt that the catch phrase should be taken literally: It
was biologically impossible, the government insisted, for anyone to
have more than one.
</P>
<P>
   The two women, who hold dual nationality, expected this. But as
children of the 1960s who both spent their formative years in
California, and many of them in Berkeley, they were raised to do
battle for their rights and everybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole, 35, a lawyer, and Ruti, 36, an academic, say they felt
well positioned to charge ahead on an issue that makes many
Israelis squeamish. Fresh-faced, well-scrubbed professionals, they
put people at ease because they themselves are at ease, even in
religious, conservative Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're what's known as white-picket-fence lesbians, or whatever
the Israeli equivalent would be,'' Nicole Berner-Kadish said.
``We're like perfect poster children for alternative families.''
</P>
<P>
   Represented by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, they
petitioned the High Court two years ago. While their case was
pending, Nicole Berner-Kadish was artificially inseminated and gave
birth in Israel to the couple's second son, Naveh. He is the next
legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1988, the state outlawed homosexual acts in its criminal
code, and gay life was extremely closeted. Gay and lesbian bars
moved furtively from one location to another.
</P>
<P>
   But that began to change in the '90s and civil rights advances
began to occur. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
was outlawed and major court cases _ against El Al, the state
airline, and the army _ set the precedent for benefits to be
awarded to gay spouses and widows.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, when Matan was 3, he and a playmate were strapped
into their child seats, riding in the back of the couple's car.
Matan's friend suddenly said, ``Where's Matan's daddy?'' And, while
Ruti held her breath, Matan answered, ``I don't have a daddy. I
have an eema and a mommy. You're the one who has a daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, provoked by the question, Matan asked his
mother why he did not, after all, have a father. Then he asked why
he did not have a sister, and why he did not have a pet. Having
long anticipated the moment, his mothers launched into an speech
about how there are all different kinds of families, and not long
into their explanation, Matan nodded his head and asked for a fruit
smoothie.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing their case, the women had the powerful documentary
support of a California adoption certificate. That allowed the case
to be argued on technical issues, separating legal definitions from
biological ones.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli case law says that the Interior Ministry has to register
citizens as they define themselves if they can show an official
document supporting what they claim.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel rejected the government's argument. But the
decision was narrow, addressing the registration alone and not the
principle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dissenting judge _ the only man on the panel _ and
almost everyone else saw it to have broader social implications.
Judge Abd al-Rahman Zouabi said that registering Nicole
Berner-Kadish as Matan's second mother would create an ``abnormal
family unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berner-Kadishes had fought successfully to keep their case
from being secret; the state not only listed Nicole as Jane Doe but
sought to bar media coverage. And when they won on Monday, on the
sixth anniversary of their unofficial wedding ceremony, they were
jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups called it a momentous day, but religious groups were
outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Ravitz, a strictly Orthodox legislator, said the High
Court was turning Israel into a ``Sodom and Gomorrah, in which
every possible perversion is sanctioned by law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Emuna Elon, who is a religious, right-wing pundit, tried to
calm the debate in an op-ed piece. ``This precedent-setting ruling
does not turn `Eema and Mommy' into a married couple,'' she wrote.
``But it does grant security and satisfaction to two good and
loving women who have decided to be life partners and to raise
children, and there isn't anything wrong with that according to
Jewish law, either.''
</P>
<P>
   With the speed of the Israeli news cycle, Matan became part of
popular culture in a day. This happened even at a time when Israel
was still reeling from the quick withdrawal from Lebanon, which had
been fought for by a grass-roots group called the Four Mothers
Movement, started by soldiers' mothers.
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon showed a little boy telling an Israeli soldier, ``I
have two mothers!'' And the soldier said, ``I've got four!''
</P>
<P>
   Matan did not have a clue that he was caricatured in the
newspaper. Sitting on a couch with a plastic sword in his lap, he
watched ``Bambi.'' Occasionally, he and a friend jousted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pow,'' Matan said, thrusting his fists through the air. ``Pow,
pow.''

TURKISH STUDY FINDS TORTURE OF PRISONERS IS WIDESPREAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ When a harsh report asserting that torture is
widespread in Turkey was released last week, the surprise was not
just the amount of damning evidence it contained, but also the
source.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being prepared by a private advocacy group, the
report was the work of the parliamentary committee on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Turkish leaders have sought to play down accusations
that torture is widely practiced here. That will be harder after
what the parliamentary committee found.
</P>
<P>
   Its report contains transcripts of interviews with many
prisoners who said they had been abused. It also includes photos of
torture equipment and floor plans that show where torture cells are
supposedly located in various police stations. No report by a
government human rights body has ever been nearly this extensive or
graphic.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members and investigators interviewed more than 8,500
prisoners over two years. They also conducted unannounced visits to
50 prisons and two dozen police stations, said the vice chairman,
Sebgetullah Seydaoglu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee has existed for seven years but it hasn't been
functioning properly,'' said Seydaoglu, who represents the
southeastern city of Diyarbakir, where the mostly Kurdish
population has long complained of bad treatment by police. ``In the
last year we've become very decisive about our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, members of the committee presented a copy of their
report to the minister of justice, Hikmet Sami Turk. Afterward he
said the report would ``hold up a light for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Torture is a crime against humanity,'' Turk said. ``Turkey
will resolve this issue. No country can justify torture on the
grounds that other countries practice it. Claims of torture will be
followed up with resolve. Torture has never been and never will be
state policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says that when inmates of Istanbul's main women's
prison were interviewed, ``all recounted details of the torture and
abuse they suffered.'' Most prisoners interviewed at jails in the
eastern cities of Sanliurfa, Erzurum and Erzincan told similar
stories.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders have repeatedly told their Turkish counterparts
that Turkey must improve its human rights record if it hopes to
join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department said in its latest human rights report
that during 1999 ``torture, beatings and other abuses by security
forces remained widespread, at times resulting in deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates are unhappy with the government's record.
The bluntness of the new parliamentary report suggests that
impatience for change is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report says what we have been saying for years, that
torture is extensive and systematic in Turkey,'' said Nazmi Gur,
chairman of the Human Rights Association, which has often been at
odds with the government. ``This could be the beginning of progress
toward meeting European legal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have expressed fear of what might happen if the
Turkish police are forced to abandon their traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are happy with the performance of the police,'' the
deputy interior minister, Sami Sonmez, asserted at a parliamentary
hearing last year. ``The police are capable of extracting
confessions from the culprits. What's the use of creating a lot of
fuss as long as public opinion endorses what the police do?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Gov. George W. Bush rolls out policy address
after policy address, congressional Republicans are watching him do
what Newt Gingrich, Trent Lott and the self-effacing Dennis Hastert
could not: win a fresh hearing for ideas cherished by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Newt-less revolution.
</P>
<P>
   For all the recent talk of how Bush has moved to the center, the
thrust of his campaign has been to employ more sympathetic rhetoric
and symbolism to refashion a Republican policy wish list long
familiar on Capitol Hill and in conservative think tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not speak in strident, angry tones of big government.
Rather, he focuses on how conservative ideas can help the working
poor, describing, for example, how tax incentives could help expand
home ownership. Sometimes the picture alone sends a message, with
Bush standing next to minority children or campaigning in the inner
city.
</P>
<P>
   It's this sort of thing that has helped Bush give the
Republicans the kinder, gentler face they have longed for in place
of Gingrich's steely intellectualism.
</P>
<P>
   In substance, though, Bush has done little to challenge the
basic conservative tenets that have defined his party at least
since Ronald Reagan's presidency. Yes, he has chastised House
Republicans on the budget, and told Senate Republicans not to tie
the president's hands on foreign policy. But only on education has
he broken fundamentally with his conservative allies by calling for
the federal government to play a more forceful role in America's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free market guys like me don't see in his suggestions anything
that's problematic,'' said Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform, who had been a Gingrich adviser. ``And we welcome
his much-improved tone and rhetoric _ over Barry Goldwater, let's
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's proposals, like diverting some Social Security
payroll taxes to individual investment accounts, have drawn rave
reviews from the conservative intellectuals. As the writer Ramesh
Ponnuru noted in a recent National Review story, Social Security is
``symbolically what's left of the New Deal,'' and Bush is not
holding it sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bush's ideas have been incubating in Republican policy
circles for years. For example:
</P>
<P>
   When Bush spoke on Social Security, he was picking up a ball
dropped by the House Ways and Means Committee, when Republican
leaders, afraid of the political risk, scuttled plans to create an
individual investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush's support of a missile defense system with
global reach has a GOP heritage stretching back to President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In advocating a $1.3 trillion tax reduction over 10 years, Bush
is aligning himself with House and Senate Republicans, who pushed
in 1999 for a $792 billion tax reduction, then retreated in
disarray after President Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, Bush's proposal for a tax credit of up to $2,000 a
family to help working people with low or moderate incomes buy
health insurance is very close to proposals pushed by Rep. Dick
Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, and Sen. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Bush's advisers occasionally become impatient
with comparisons of their candidate's ``compassionate
conservatism'' to Clinton's ``New Democrat'' break with his own
party's orthodoxy. Bush's policy agenda, one of his aides said,
``is within Republican orthodoxy but takes it to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   For congressional Republicans, who long regarded themselves as
belonging to the party of ideas, this is vindication. This time,
they feel, they have the right messenger and, as a presidential
contender, he has a megaphone almost as big as the president's.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Bush's Social Security proposal, Armey said, ``A
Republican in the House brings it up and before he can get it
before the American people it gets reframed as the secret
Republican plan to destroy Social Security. When Governor Bush
brings it up, people first say, `What is he talking about?' And
when he brings it up it has a standing with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman who attended many House
Republican hand-wringing sessions, noted that a lawmaker with an
idea got little attention, but ``when Governor Bush gave his speech
on Social Security it was carried live on CNN and Fox TV and made
the front page of all the national newspapers the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that, despite his amiability, Bush's positions
are to the right of those of the great American middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a fairly doctrinaire conservative,'' said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I think he has done a masterful job at
making himself look more moderate than the positions he has taken
in the campaign, let alone his record in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gore and his allies have been trying to portray Bush as out
of the mainstream by branding each of his proposals a ``risky
scheme.'' But this has proven harder for the Democrats than four
years ago _ and not just because of Bush's manner.
</P>
<P>
   The federal surplus has changed the political dynamics. In 1995,
when Republicans wanted to balance the budget as well as grant a
large tax cut, it meant they had to make unpopular reductions in
other programs. By contrast, Bush has been able to propose both a
large tax cut and new social spending. And Democrats, in trying to
co-opt or defuse some Republican ideas, have made them harder to
demonize.
</P>
<P>
   Take missile defense. Last year the White House dropped its veto
threat against legislation calling for a national missile defense
after some language was inserted committing the nation to build
such a program only when it became ``technologically possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That accommodation _ as well as a newly perceived threat from
rogue nations _ helped shift the debate so that the battle was no
longer over whether to have a missile defense, but what kind and at
what cost.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton's call for the government itself to invest
some Social Security taxes in the stock market, coupled with his
proposal to give lower income taxpayers up to $300 a year for a new
type of retirement account, makes it harder for Democrats to argue
against Bush's innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Public attitudes also change over time and over generations. The
Bush campaign is betting that with nearly half of American
households now owning stock, fewer Americans will so fear the
market that they will insist that Social Security remain as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has
come,'' Armey said. The Democrats are hoping mightily that Bush's
timing is off.  &QL;

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ As Sierra Leone slid back into war last
month, the British were conspicuous as the one Western power
willing to shore up the faltering U.N. peacekeeping force. To many,
their presence merely emphasized the absence of the United States,
which last year was a major backer of the peace agreement that
granted amnesty to a brutal warlord, Foday Sankoh, and even brought
him into government.
</P>
<P>
   To critics, including senior officials in the U.S. State
Department, that agreement amounted to a Band-Aid response by the
Clinton administration to criticism of its African policy after
President Clinton went to Africa in 1998, talked of an African
renaissance and promised greater involvement in the continent.
</P>
<P>
   To backers of the Lome agreement _ named for the capital of
Togo, where it was signed last July _ the inclusion of Sankoh and
amnesty for his gunmen's atrocities was the only effective way to
stop a war that outsiders would not help end militarily. A Clinton
administration official said the choices were Lome or ``chaos,''
adding that the accord was intended to ``end the killing, restore
order, point a way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's violence has pointed up the quandary facing
Western governments in the post-Cold War world of geopolitically
insignificant but spectacularly brutal conflicts. In the Balkans,
and last year in East Timor, outside powers have intervened to halt
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, many critics say, the Clinton administration has been
unwilling to risk the lives of U.S. troops since the death of 18
soldiers in Somalia in 1993. The administration faces congressional
constraints in paying for international peacekeeping efforts and,
the critics say, pays only intermittent attention.
</P>
<P>
   Whether justified or not, a result of this criticism is that
Washington's offers to help calm Sierra Leone's most recent
violence have largely been spurned. Kofi Annan, secretary-general
of the United Nations, rejected an offer to fly fresh U.N. troops
to Sierra Leone, because the price of U.S. military planes was too
high.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Clinton's special envoy for
democracy in Africa, came to West Africa to help defuse the crisis,
he was forced to cancel a stop in Sierra Leone because he was not
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was given the role of special envoy to Africa after
helping to keep the black vote solidly behind Clinton in 1996. He
is a vocal proponent of intervening in Africa's conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   In May last year, Jackson criticized the administration for
protecting Kosovo Albanians but leaving Africans to defend
themselves so that Sierra Leone's war was ``fought in the dark''
for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks helped to train U.S. attention on Sierra Leone,
where Sankoh's rebels had killed, raped and hacked the limbs off
thousands of inhabitants in an assault on Freetown in January 1999.
Last summer, peace talks that had limped along in Lome suddenly
yielded an agreement to share power and hold elections in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   This embrace of Sankoh was distasteful to many. ``It seemed to
be yet another indication of the U.S. being unwilling to invest the
political capital to ensure that a sustainable peace could be
arrived at by incorporating the broader issues of human rights,''
said Janet Fleischman of Human Rights Watch. ``When you do that,
you may have a short-term solution, but it will not buy you peace
in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, an administration official said, three
high-ranking officials _ Harold Koh, the assistant secretary of
state for human rights; David Scheffer, the ambassador at large for
war crimes; and Julia Taft, the assistant secretary of state for
refugees _ recorded their opposition to giving Sankoh a role in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hoped they could eventually wrest control of Sierra
Leone's diamond mines from Sankoh, who became chairman of the
commission that manages vital resources. His men have long
controlled the mines, using diamonds to buy arms.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, even supporters see the flaws. ``Bring Sankoh
into the government? Make him the head diamond counter? What were
we thinking?'' said another U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to reach the Lome accord began to build after
Sankoh's assault on Freetown. Nigeria, which was leading a West
African intervention force known as Ecomog, managed to recapture
the town from the warlord's Revolutionary United Front. But
Nigeria's involvement in Sierra Leone was costly _ in cash and
human lives _ and increasingly unpopular back home. After taking
office in May last year, Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo,
pledged to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and several congressmen,
searching for a way to fill the vacuum that Nigeria would leave,
began looking to Jackson and his long friendship with Charles
Taylor, the warlord-turned-president of Liberia, Sierra Leone's
eastern neighbor, who in turn was a friend and ally of Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said U.S. decision makers on Sierra
Leone decided to overlook the conflict of interest between Jackson
and Taylor for the sake of ``political expediency and the pressure
from Nigerians to get out.'' Jackson leaned on Taylor to lean on
Sankoh to go to Lome, the official said, and the accord was signed.
</P>
<P>
   As a corollary, a U.N. force with no U.S. soldiers was envisaged
to keep peace and to win the U.S. financing that Congress had
refused for the West African force.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the accord was that the government Sankoh
joined and its president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, were _ and remain _
powerless and unpopular, dependent on outsiders for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah, a former U.N. Development Program official, rarely seems
to leave his hilltop presidential palace; his presence is
manifested mostly as a voice in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leonean and U.S. officials with knowledge of the peace
talks say negotiators believed that Sankoh was central to any
lasting peace. A deal signed in 1996 unraveled precisely because it
had no role for him. What is more, after Sankoh was arrested on an
arms-trafficking charge in Nigeria and later sentenced to death for
treason in Sierra Leone in late 1998, his men went on their ghastly
spree of maiming and killing.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty was granted, not only to Sankoh and his men, but also to
other militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the government point of view, the benefits outweighed the
costs of having that provision in the accord,'' said Septimus
Kaikai, Kabbah's spokesman. ``If you look at the war from '91 to
'99, the amount of people who have lost their lives, or were maimed
or raped or had their properties destroyed _ granting amnesty was
to bring peace and create the environment for the government to get
things back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the potential embarrassment of giving amnesty to
Sankoh, the United Nations signed the Lome accord with a notation
declaring that the amnesty did not apply internationally _ a ruse
that allowed the accord's backers to argue that Sankoh could
eventually be tried outside Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's participation was capped last
October by a visit from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
Freetown. Albright toured a camp for mutilated victims, cuddled a
3-year-old girl who had no hands, and _ in a building carefully
placed off limits to photographers and journalists by her aides _
met Sankoh, who was several hours late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sankoh is delivering the right message,'' she said, ``and I
hope very much he will continue to intensify his efforts to ensure
full adherence to the Lome accord.''
</P>
<P>
   After Albright's visit, Washington's interest in Sierra Leone
waned. The United Nations dispatched soldiers from India, Pakistan
and other African nations to serve as peacekeepers. But when, in
late April and early May, that force tried to go to the area of the
diamond mines, and simultaneously the last of the Nigerian troops
left Sierra Leone, Sankoh's men took 500 peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced that Jackson would come to
West Africa to help negotiate the hostages' release. But even
before he left the United States, Jackson angered people in
Freetown by saying that Sankoh ``should be coaxed back into the
political equation'' and by drawing a parallel between Sankoh's
Revolutionary United Front and Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After intense pressure from the State Department, Jackson later
adopted a harder stance against Sankoh. But it was too late.
Jackson's friendship with Taylor is viewed askance in Freetown, and
his safety could not be guaranteed here.
</P>
<P>
   Salih Booker, a senior fellow at the Africa Policy Information
Center in Washington, said the reliance on Jackson is a symptom of
a muddled policy and lack of commitment toward Africa in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just flies out with his own God-given talents and allows
the administration to wish him well and distance itself in some
ways,'' Booker said. ``If he fails, it's his failure. If he
succeeds, it's the Clinton administration's success.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics, like Annan, said that new, complex peacekeeping
efforts such as those in Sierra Leone were severely limited by the
United States' lack of willingness to provide direct military
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, Clinton announced $20 million in aid to the United
Nations and several individual nations, including Nigeria, for
their operations in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra Leone's people have suffered far too much, for far too
long,'' Clinton said, ``and they need immediate assistance to
prevent a return to full-scale civil war.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BLAMING EWING IS A PATHETIC EXCUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was symbolism and symmetry to the end of
another Knicks season Friday night, when their drive to make it
cross-country, to the finals, featured Latrell Sprewell at the
wheel, steering an offense that offered little communication and
less companionship.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, when Sprewell spurned the Knicks' South
Carolina training camp to test America's speed limits and was
``punished'' with a corporate wink and a rich new contract, the
Knicks spiritually became his team, on his terms. Sprewell was soon
more popular than ever, more the Knicks' spokesman, more the name
and number that drove their merchandising machine.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing as the franchise's vital force was clearly passe.
Wherever these Knicks were going, the mercurial Sprewell would be
taking them. He led them into the fourth quarter of Game 6 of the
Eastern Conference finals _ carried them, really _ and then Reggie
Miller jumped the Knicks by the side of the road again late in the
New York night. Latrell Sprewell's Knicks thus suffered the kind of
numbing playoff breakdown that has haunted Patrick Ewing's Knicks
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I think the Miami series took a lot out of us,''
Sprewell said after the Pacers had eliminated the Knicks, 93-80,
and when it finally was Miller's time to play for a ring. ``I know
how tired I was and how banged up I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Who isn't at this time of spring?
</P>
<P>
   Miami has come up a point short against the Knicks two years
running with Tim Hardaway barely able to move. A year ago, the
Knicks took these same Pacers out when Miller had a bad ankle, when
Travis Best pulled a groin and, let's be honest, Rik Smits has
played hurt for years.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries do not make for great sports talk radio so, of course,
there was bound to be more blaming of Ewing, a sad, solitary figure
Friday night as he walked off the court to unwarranted derision, to
ice his aching right foot and dwell on another round of unfulfilled
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' 27th consecutive season without a championship was
no more his fault than anyone else's, but it was a convenient
excuse before and after the Knicks blew an 18-point lead in Game 5.
Sprewell ran with the Ewing won-lost playoff numbers against the
Pacers on the record because he generally speaks his mind, and if
the coach and the organization do not appreciate it, well, that's a
bridge they all crossed back in October.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy recognized what was happening, that several of
his players, fearing their own failure, were ready to make Ewing
their scapegoat. After the way Ewing stood up to Alonzo Mourning in
Games 6 and 7 of the Miami series, made the winning shot of that
series to get them to Indianapolis, it was almost pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pacers intensified their defensive rotations in Games 5
and 6, it was a reminder of how inconsistent the undersized and
always hurting Larry Johnson has been here as a power player, and
how underskilled Marcus Camby is on the offensive end. Too many
Knicks anonymously mumbled about how Ewing clogged the paint while
forgetting all the possessions he would jog out to the 3-point line
and just stand there as a side was cleared out for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornly proud Ewing deserved criticism in the past, but
it got to be a bad habit and then an excuse. The truth is, he has
only been a part-time piece to the puzzle for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   This was Sprewell's team that did not make it back to the
finals, and he was not exactly Michael Jordan in the fourth quarter
these past few weeks. During Ewing's prime, he often had games just
like the one Sprewell had Friday night, and usually did not hear
the end of it. That was fair. It came with the star territory, with
the grand stage of expectations of midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell valiantly kept the Knicks close in Game 6 and got them
the lead, 65-62, with a 3-pointer with 11 minutes 40 seconds
remaining. It was his last significant basket. Sprewell scored 32
points on 26 shots, 2 points fewer than Miller, but the lasting
playoff images are made in the fourth quarter. Soon Miller hit the
first of a trio of three-balls that cut the Knicks' heart out, the
last of which he launched from 25 feet away over Sprewell's
fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Pacers went from 3 points behind to 7 ahead,
Sprewell rushed and missed three crucial jump shots, which he later
wished he could ``take back.'' No one else had much going by then,
so there is little point in second-guessing, unless the others were
stone-cold from standing around and watching Sprewell do his thing,
which is how it has always worked for Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that Sprewell did not want the responsibility
of the franchise player role on a bad team in Golden State. Other
than the training-camp thing and chronic lateness, he was a team
player, a team leader, this season. Yet at the end, it was a
disturbing sign that he preferred the Knicks' fate to be more a
reflection on a 37-year-old center whose body is conceding, joint
by joint, and who pretty much did all he could.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Knicks will now make a push for Grant Hill. Maybe they
will dangle Allan Houston, who played poorly from start to finish
Friday, and maybe he is inhibited more by Sprewell than by Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised _ this is the NBA,'' Sprewell said,
when asked if he expects changes to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the star is here, he inherits those 27 years of
championship-less basketball. When another season ends, Micheal Ray
Richardson flashes by, out of control. Charles Smith again misses
four shots under the basket. John Starks keeps misfiring in
Houston. Bernard King reinjures his knee. The Ewing of yesteryear
fails in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Blame? No. Fact? Yes. With Sprewell's pedal-to-the-metal
approach sputtering in the fourth quarter Friday night, the Knicks
are 0-1 in the playoffs with him as their undisputed marquee man. &QL;

<P>
   CHERNOBYL, Ukraine _ They are gardening again at Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding the last corner on the road to the destroyed reactor of
Unit No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the most striking
discovery at the site of the worst radiation accident in history is
the two young women in white masks picking gingerly at the earth
with hoes and rakes.
</P>
<P>
   They were preparing a flower bed in the shadow of the
``sarcophagus,'' the mammoth concrete and steel structure, riddled
with leaks and cracks, that now encases the shattered reactor hall
where nearly 200 tons of radioactive fuel lie melted and fused with
sand, concrete and other debris from the explosion and fire that
erupted on April 26, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, we would have had flowers growing long ago,'' said
Katya Premak, 33, explaining why nothing was coming out of the
ground so late in the spring. ``But we are going very slow,'' she
added, leaning on her hoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, they found a hot spot over there,'' she said,
pointing to where a scoop of earth had set off a radiation monitor
during a routine sweep. ``We wear these masks because we are
stirring up the dust and it can be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   To any visitor, it seems more than unusual that thousands of
people still come to work here every day, 14 years after a disaster
that killed 28 people outright with high radiation doses and
touched off a still accelerating epidemic of thyroid cancers among
children who lived downwind of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, something is to change.
</P>
<P>
   President Leonid Kuchma has declared that Ukraine will close the
last operating reactor at Chernobyl, Unit No. 3, sometime this
year. He said he would announce a specific closing date during
President Clinton's two-day visit to Kiev, which begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ourselves want to shut down the last remaining unit,''
Kuchma said in an interview in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, 80 miles to
the south. ``So this is not a political game. We will shut it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But the shutdown is only the beginning of a new chapter in the
life of the ill-fated power station, whose radioactive wastes and
debris must be guarded for decades, if not centuries, to prevent
them from further poisoning the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do tens of thousands of Ukrainians depend on the plant
for jobs and power, but Ukraine faces an acute energy crisis, even
now, before Chernobyl is closed. Despite intensive medical
investigations into the health effects of the huge amount of
radiation released from the explosion and fire that ripped through
reactor No. 4 in 1986 after an experiment went disastrously wrong,
the overall health of the plant workers remains good, though more
questions than answers remain about Chernobyl's long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question is who will pay for what needs to be done
here. Since 1986, Chernobyl's endgame has been marked by unceasing
recriminations among Ukraine, the United States and the world's six
other wealthiest industrial nations over financing for major
decommissioning projects and the replacement of Chernobyl's
electrical output.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine would like to complete two nuclear power plants that
were under construction in western Ukraine before the Soviet Union
collapsed, but the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, responsible for Western financing, has failed to offer
lending terms Ukraine can afford, in the view of Kuchma and his
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electricity deficit has been catastrophic in our
industries, so if we just shut down a unit that has been producing
1 million watts,'' Kuchma said, referring to Chernobyl, ``it will
be a complete disaster for the Ukrainian economy because nuclear
power is the cheapest.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, controllers from Kiev enforce rotating blackouts for
as long as eight hours a day in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chernobyl closes, the costs of monitoring what happens
inside the sarcophagus, and keeping radiation firmly encased, will
run on. A permanent corps of safety engineers is needed. Moreover,
a new sarcophagus costing as much as $750 million will probably
have to be built, since the current one rests on potentially
unstable foundations and suffers from intrusions of rainwater that
create clouds of humidity in the radioactive darkness, corroding
the maze of pipes and steel girders and increasing the risk of
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   A plant for processing radioactive waste will be needed, and a
$100 million heating plant and new electricity supplies to run all
the support facilities. Leaders of the seven wealthiest nations
have pledged about $400 million of the money needed for the
sarcophagus, but Kuchma said Western aid had been slow to
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like closing a big door and putting a big lock in
place and then forgetting about it,'' he said. ``We have to
continue servicing this plant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Kuchma indicated that Ukraine would seek
Russian help, if necessary, to replace Chernobyl's electrical
output, a step that would undermine the Western goal of reinforcing
Ukrainian independence at a time when President Vladimir Putin of
Russia is emphasizing the ``common roots'' between his country and
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably look for a compromise with Russia because 90
percent of the equipment in these plants was made in Russia, and so
economically and politically it's highly profitable and interesting
to the Russians,'' Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks may have been intended to put pressure on the West
in advance of the July meeting of the Group of Seven leaders with
Russia in Okinawa, but he nevertheless is under considerable
pressure at home, where the energy sector is notoriously corrupt
even as major industries go begging for electricity supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of what to do about Slavutich, the
city of 28,000 built in the 1980s to house Chernobyl's corps of
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Units No. 1 and 2 of Chernobyl operated until the early 1990s.
Unit No. 2 was shut down in 1991 after a fire swept through its
turbine hall, causing extensive damage, though not to the reactor.
And Kuchma agreed to shut down Unit No. 1 in 1994 after the Group
of Seven pledged to help finance an overall plan to decommission
the Chernobyl complex _ assistance that has been halting at times.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From Slavutich, Chernobyl's denizens ride an electric train 40
minutes to ``the zone,'' the depopulated area of abandoned farms
and villages where 135,000 people once lived within an 18-mile
radius of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there was farmland, weeds and brambles have taken
over, enveloping houses and hiding earthen mounds where radioactive
trucks and bulldozers are buried and equipment yards where
irradiated helicopters that dumped tons of sand and boron on the
burning reactor still are quarantined. Some pilots died from the
radiation they received.
</P>
<P>
   In man-made canals that once carried cooling water to and from
the reactor, hefty carp and catfish have taken over. And in the
nearby forests the swelling deer population has attracted poachers
who ply the trails of the zone at night.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of 1986, Chernobyl became a symbol of nuclear
devastation that incited a numbing fear in Ukraine and Belarus, a
fear that researchers suggest has so far been more destructive to
public health than the huge release of radiation. The accident also
laid bare industrial incompetence and a contempt for the
environment that helped to fracture the Soviet edifice.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 6,000 Chernobyl workers and their dependents today
in independent Ukraine, the power station represents more than
anything a paycheck and a guaranteed apartment when so many in the
former Soviet Union are without both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a student in electrical engineering in Moscow and came
here two years after the accident,'' said Irina A. Kolbich, who
works for the plant administration. ``Frankly I came for financial
reasons because living here on 1,300 rubles a month with your own
apartment was better than living in Moscow on 130 rubles a month
with no apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir A. Komarov calls himself ``a patriot of Chernobyl''
because he has worked here for 20 years. ``If you talk to our
experts, all agree that this plant could be operated until 2006 or
maybe longer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The culture of safety still is not exactly pervasive. Neither
Premak nor her co-worker, Natasha Poplegina, were wearing their
dosimeters, which measures radiation, while gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are supposed to wear them all the time, but I keep mine in
my locker,'' Premak said.
</P>
<P>
   In the flower bed, the radiation, though low, was about four
times higher than the naturally occurring levels in the
environment. ``Since you don't see it, who knows what to expect
anyway?'' Poplegina said.
</P>
<P>
   On the deck that overlooks the sarcophagus, where Vice President
Al Gore stood briefly during his visit to Chernobyl in 1997, the
radiation goes from four times to 10 times the naturally occurring
level, still not necessarily dangerous but not recommended for
extended exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Control Room No. 3 operates Chernobyl's last functioning nuclear
dynamo. On a recent afternoon, Alexander N. Yelchishev, 46, a shift
supervisor, monitored the reactor closely.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of Unit No. 4, Yelchishev lost a classmate and a
neighbor to radiation poisoning in 1986. Still, he remains a
believer in nuclear power, and laments that the closing of Unit No.
3 will constitute a waste of about $300 million in safety
improvements financed by the United States and other Western
donors.
</P>
<P>
   The fixes are intended to prevent the reactor from surging out
of control, as Unit No. 4 did during a low power test in 1986,
setting off steam and hydrogen explosions that ripped apart the
graphite reactor core, blew off the roof and spewed radioactive
material into the atmosphere for days.
</P>
<P>
   Yelchishev does not blame the West for the pressure to close
Chernobyl as much as he blames Ukraine's leaders for allowing
corruption and inept reforms to retard economic development.
</P>
<P>
   In the accident, about 50 tons of radioactive dust and debris
was carried by winds and rain to virtually every country in the
Northern Hemisphere, but the worst contamination was in the areas
near the zone, especially southern Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Thyroid cancer rates have increased tenfold in Ukraine and as
much as 84 times in parts of Belarus. In 1996, about 800 thyroid
cancers had appeared in Ukraine and Belarus, but the numbers have
since risen sharply and continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of today, we have operated on about 1,500 children in
Ukraine alone,'' said Dr. Valery P. Tereshchenko of the Institute
for Endocrinology and Metabolism in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   The health effects from other long-life radioactive elements,
like cesium and strontium, have been difficult to measure. There
have been no clusters of leukemia or other cancers in the fallout
zones where the thyroid cancers have appeared, but the latency
period for other health effects may be longer, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. conference on Chernobyl concluded in 1996 that the only
clear change evident in health to date was a ``highly significant''
increase in thyroid cancer rates among people who were children in
1986 in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' said Dr. Mykola D. Tronko, director
of Ukraine's thyroid cancer institute, ``even 14 years after the
accident, we have more questions than answers.''

YOUTH COURT OF TRUE PEERS JUDGES WITH FIRM HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball caps and do-rags are dutifully removed while court is
in session. The prosecutor is a deliberative, soft-spoken young man
of 16 with a crown of cornrows. The defense lawyer is 16, too, only
recently out of jail on a charge of attempted murder. On the
six-member jury sits a girl with searing eyes and the memory of
juvenile jail still fresh in her mind. And when the accused, a
gawky 15-year-old charged with graffiti writing and weapons
possession, rattles off the names of gangs he has a ``beef'' with
at school, the courtroom congregation nods and murmurs knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not a high school moot court, where students pretend
to be players in a court of law. This is a court of law, a small,
quiet experiment in which Bronx teen-agers arrested on misdemeanor
charges and even minor felonies _ anything from graffiti writing to
small-time robberies and drug sales _ are judged, quite literally,
by a jury of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   They are all first-time defendants. They are referred here by a
probation officer or a judge, as an alternative to prosecution in
the city's overtaxed Family Court, where children under 16 are
tried.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers who run the Bronx Youth Court, begun two years
ago by youngsters organizing inside the city's juvenile jail, see
their mission as nothing short of what the Constitution guarantees:
a speedy trial before a jury of one's peers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them have been through the juvenile justice maze, what
they universally call ``the system.'' They know well the inside of
a juvenile jail (19 months in the case of Francisca Martinez, 16,
the defense lawyer, known in Youth Court as youth advocate). They
know how ponderously the Family Court can move (three and a half
months in detention for one juror, Latoya Orr, accused of stabbing
another girl, until a judge ruled in her case). Indeed, the court
seems to derive its very credibility from the youngsters' firsthand
knowledge of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got to talk to my lawyer the way I wanted to,'' said
Martinez, who was convicted of the stabbing. ``I wanted to be there
for somebody, being that nobody was there for me,'' she said in
explaining her mission.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of such youth courts is largely unproven, but
they have emerged across the country in the last decade, spurred by
a general sense of frustration with the juvenile justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 650 youth courts exist nationwide, compared with 50
in 1991, according to the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention. They handle mostly nonviolent
first-time defendants: children accused of shoplifting, vandalism,
starting schoolyard brawls and committing other crimes unlikely to
be prosecuted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feel-good quality to them,'' said Jeffrey Butts, a
senior research associate with the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based research organization, who is conducting a
national evaluation of youth courts for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   That same quality gives experts like Butts a sense of deja vu.
``A hundred years ago, we invented juvenile court to get kids out
of the bureaucratic criminal court system,'' he said. ``Now we're
inventing youth courts to get them out of juvenile court, or to
create alternatives to that system.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four such courts in New York City, all fairly new. Two
were established by the state court system, in Harlem and in Red
Hook, Brooklyn. A third, in Hollis, Queens, was begun by civic
leaders and the city corporation counsel's office, which prosecutes
children in Family Court. All but the Bronx court handle youngsters
arrested for the smallest of infractions. A fourth of all the cases
tried in the Brooklyn Youth Court, for example, involve truancy, an
infraction that is not prosecuted in Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Youth Court is unusual because it judges more serious
offenses _ drug possession with intent to sell, robbery, weapons
charges. The idea is not to punish, but to help steer the accused
away from crime and provide some restitution to the community.
Among the judges, jurors and lawyers are those whose own sentences
include serving in youth court.
</P>
<P>
   Not many get off. Of the roughly 70 youngsters who have appeared
in the Bronx Youth Court in the last two years, only two have been,
in effect, acquitted, according to statistics maintained by Youth
Force, the youth-run community group that established the court.
</P>
<P>
   The City Probation Department does not keep exact figures,
though officials there say anecdotal evidence suggests that the
program is effective.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The other day, as the late afternoon sun streamed in through the
barred windows at Youth Force's headquarters in Mott Haven, the
court was weighing the case of a freshman at Columbus High School.
Police believed that he had been a lookout for a graffiti crew. The
defendant, who agreed to allow a reporter to attend his trial on
the condition that his name not be used, said he had merely been
standing on the sidewalk trying to hail a cab while his friends
were ``bombing'' a wall with graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Peppering the defendant with questions, the jurors homed in on
certain details: The police had found a knife in the defendant's
pocket, and, it turned out, he had missed nearly three months of
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who carries a knife in their pocket, if they get
busted, there should be some sort of consequence,'' argued Dante
Motes, the prosecutor, known in the court as a community impact
assessor.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, removing his baseball cap at Martinez's urging,
said he felt unsafe at school. His friends, fellow
Albanian-Americans, had angered several gangs, and some were shot a
couple weeks before. That was why he wasn't going to school, he
said, and also why he carried a knife. ``People are looking to jump
me, shoot me,'' he cried. ``How you expect me to feel safe?''
</P>
<P>
   Some jurors were skeptical. His friends were shot only two weeks
ago, but he hadn't been in school for several months. If he really
felt unsafe, why didn't he go to the principal to seek a transfer
to another school?
</P>
<P>
   What did he do in his spare time? Were there youth centers near
his home? Why had he been hanging out with these friends, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   So it went for nearly two hours, as the jury struggled to
decipher the penal code and asked questions to understand the
defendant's life better.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, they learned, was in Yugoslavia. He lived with his
sister and brother in the Bronx. He was not in a gang. He was
trying to transfer to another school. He liked to play football.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for 20 minutes in a closed room upstairs, the
jurors found him guilty on all counts. They sentenced him to a
two-hour legal rights workshop (mandatory for all Bronx Youth Court
defendants), four hours on a Youth Court jury, and 16 hours working
on a Youth Force community project. Such projects have included
voter registration drives and undercover stings against stores that
sell alcohol to minors.
</P>
<P>
   What lasting effect, if any, this will have on the young man
remains to be seen. Recidivism rates of Youth Court defendants are
only anecdotal, but supporters of the Bronx Youth Court and others
point to the alarmingly high recidivism rates in the juvenile
justice system. A recent study by the State Division of Criminal
Justice Services, for example, found that among boys incarcerated
in the state juvenile justice system, 81 percent were rearrested
within three years of their release.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Bronx Youth Court like to point out to their
peers how they fared in the juvenile justice system. ``From arrest
through court through incarceration, we went through feeling
confused, powerless and alone,'' reads a paragraph from a pamphlet
given to all defendants. ``Almost all of us came out of the system
disillusioned, better criminals, less educated and without the
resources needed to succeed.''  &QL;

CALIFORNIA LOTTERY REFORMULATED FOR BIGGER JACKPOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Come Wednesday, winning at least some money in
California's lottery becomes much easier with the first drawing of
the new SuperLotto Plus.
</P>
<P>
   But don't buy that Jaguar and mansion just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpots will be bigger, but the odds of winning them are
much worse. On the flip side, the chance of winning at least
something will get much better.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, California lottery officials expect to reverse
declining ticket sales with this game, emulating the multistate
Powerball and Big Game lotteries - the ones that have grabbed
national headlines and players' dollars with their massive jackpots
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning at least something are increasing from one
in 60 to one in 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that, the players stay interested in the game much
longer than in a conventional lottery game,'' said Edward Stanek,
director of the Iowa lottery and inventor of Powerball. ``The
customer is looking for the chance at that really big prize, but
they're only going to continue playing if they keep winning
something on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The new SuperLotto Plus play slips will begin appearing today.
</P>
<P>
   To win, players must pick five numbers from one through 47, and
a sixth ``mega-number'' from one through 27. The mega-number is the
equivalent of the Powerball in the game of that name.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the jackpot still requires matching all six numbers, but
that becomes far harder because the mega-number is chosen from a
different bin from the first five. That allows for a repeated
number in the sequence, and vastly decreases the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having only four chances to win, by matching three,
four, five or six out of six numbers, players will now have nine
opportunities to win.
</P>
<P>
   A player can win a dollar by simply matching the mega-number or
can win even more by matching the mega-number and any other
combination of numbers. Two matches plus the mega-number will net
about $10, for example, Hasegawa said. Or a player can win by
matching three, four or five of the regular balls.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning the top prize in the SuperLotto Plus will
drop to about one in 41 million from the current one in 18 million.
With longer odds, the jackpots will swell by rolling over more
often.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, two Big Game ticket holders split a $363
million jackpot - the largest in the nation's history. The previous
record was a $296 million Powerball jackpot that 13 Ohio machinists
split in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For California, the previous high for the California Lotto was a
``mere'' $118 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   With the new SuperLotto Plus, players will get a head start on
larger jackpots, as the state is raising the minimum to $7 million
instead of the current $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   And SuperLotto Plus will feature more chances to win lesser
amounts. The Powerball-type game features a larger second prize -
about $20,000 for a near-miss instead of the current $1,500 - and
increased chances to win lesser amounts.
</P>
<P>
   After sales of SuperLotto tickets began to dip in the past year,
California Lottery officials in April decided to change the game
slightly to revive interest. This year, for the first time, sales
of scratch-off tickets outpaced SuperLotto tickets, $1.15 billion
to $975 million, said Jim Hasegawa, game development manager with
the California Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa said the state decided to go it alone with SuperLotto,
instead of joining the 20 states and District of Columbia playing
Powerball, or the seven states playing Big Game. Officials felt
California was large enough to support its own game, and wanted to
keep the income and the winnings in-state, Hasegawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the $2.85 billion expected from California lottery sales
in the coming year will go toward prizes, while 34 percent of the
proceeds fund public education needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the theory works, the game will immediately produce more
winners. And lottery officials say that fact, and the higher
jackpots, will attract more players.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that isn't such a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lottery is to gambling what marijuana is to drug use. It's
an entry-level activity,'' said Tom Tucker, executive director of
the California Council on Problem Gambling. ``They're going to get
more people, there's no question about it. Gamblers are really
hooked on the high, the thrill of the chase.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the possible payoff is sky-high, ``the existing problem
gamblers are going to reach deeper into their pockets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the California Lottery has reached an agreement for the
council to start answering its gambling problem assistance line,
(888) 277-3115. And Tucker said they're trying to persuade the
state to increase its gambling-problem education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the California Council has its own counseling hot
line, (800) GAMBLER, and a Web site at www.calproblemgambling.org.
</P>
<P>
   Stanek said the Powerball-style game can be more beneficial for
low-income players, as it offers larger middle-level prizes and
greater chances to win them. For someone not making a lot of money,
winning $20,000 for picking five of six can have a huge impact, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the potentially huge jackpots will attract even well-to-do
players, who might not be swayed by a $15 million SuperLotto kitty,
but could be intrigued by a $100 million SuperLotto Plus jackpot.
That might get them to drop a few dollars on Quick Picks, just for
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of games means they have to be entertaining. You
can only play a game so long, unless you have something very
interesting to keep it alive,'' Stanek said. ``I think California
is going to be very happy with this.''

PROPOSAL MAY END FREE PRINTED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's librarians have raised a storm of
protest over a House budget-cutting plan that could deny the public
access to thousands of free government books, brochures and
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee voted on May 9 to cut funding
for the Federal Depository Library program, which distributes
printed materials for free to more than 1,350 city, county and
college libraries, including 47 sites in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents, led by cost-conscious Republicans, argue the move
would save the Government Printing Office $18.3 million annually.
They also say the public can now gain access to many government
documents via the Internet. An estimated 50 percent of all
government documents are now available on line at
www.access.gpo.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, led by the Chicago-based American Library
Association, say that most libraries and their patrons are
ill-equipped to go online and that the public has a right to access
all printed documents that are compiled and produced at taxpayer
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this move as reducing access,'' said Mancy Mahr,
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Public Library. ``In many
cases, library patrons are precisely the people who don't have
computers or training and who depend on us and printed material for
their information.''
</P>
<P>
   Foes of the measure are hoping to get funding restored when the
House reconvenes this week. The measure must still be voted on by
the full House and the Senate, which has opposed the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Government Printing Office, which has been using local
libraries as depositories since 1858, last year distributed 16.1
million copies of 40,000 titles nationwide at a cost of
approximately $30 million. Most items are in print form, but a
number of documents are also produced on CD-ROMs and microfilm.
</P>
<P>
   Titles popular with the public include brochures on student aid,
small business loans and other programs, occupational outlook
guides, detailed census data, reports by federal agencies, the U.S.
Code (a listing of all federal laws) and the Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-branch Los Angeles County library system includes eight
Federal Depository Libraries that keep large numbers of government
documents on hand as reference materials. Smaller numbers of
documents are available at all branches.
</P>
<P>
   Mahr, the library's spokeswoman, noted that Internet access is
still in its infancy in the county system, which only last fall
finished installing needed wiring and placing computer terminals in
each of its 84 branches.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the branches have only one terminal and customers must
reserve them in advance. Public use is free, but customers are
often limited to 30 minutes online.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Curzon, dean of the library at California State University,
Northridge, said her facility serves a predominantly computer-savvy
student clientele, but she still is concerned about access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone ought to be concerned about the potential
loss of a rich treasure trove of information,'' said Curzon, who
noted that CSUN's government document collection, staffed by
full-time librarians, is used extensively by students, faculty and
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government's intent is to go digital, why not have a
strategic plan and work with us on new ways to disseminate
information?'' she added. ``This proposal will only widen the
digital divide and disenfranchise those who can't afford or can't
access technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanore Schmidt, Long Beach's director of library services,
echoed those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Long Beach, Schmidt
called the depository program at the city's main library ``one of
the great bargains of government. The Government Printing Office
supplies the publications, but libraries provide the space to house
them, the staff to help the public and the computers, photocopiers
and other equipment needed to use the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt also said that, if printed materials were eliminated,
Long Beach ``would be unable to provide enough computers to meet
the demand.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Frito-Lay announced in January that it would stop
using biotechnology-based corn in its chips. Gerber Products has
banned genetically modified ingredients from its baby food. And
McDonald's has asked its suppliers not to send it genetically
altered potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these recent announcements, all made in response to
public concerns over genetically altered foods, none of these
companies is actually abandoning biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   PepsiCo, Frito-Lay's parent company, continues to use corn syrup
made from genetically altered crops in its soft drinks. Novartis,
the parent of Gerber, remains one of the leading producers of
genetically altered seeds. And McDonald's cooks french fries in
vegetable oil made from genetically altered corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   These seeming contradictions reflect the marketing quandary
facing the nation's biggest food companies in the debate over
genetically altered crops, which environmentalists contend are
potentially dangerous but which the Food and Drug Administration
has deemed entirely safe.
</P>
<P>
   Though nearly all the big food producers publicly support
biotechnology, a growing number of companies are quietly limiting
its use. But many say that biotechnology crops are so pervasive
that it would be prohibitively expensive, and in some cases nearly
impossible, to eliminate them entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you, the food companies wish this issue would go
away,'' said Robert Goldin at Technomics Inc. in Chicago, a
food-industry consulting and research firm. ``They're being very
cautious. They're trying to find out how much of this is just
noise, and frankly, they don't want to get caught with their pants
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, biotechnology crops have come to
dominate the food industry. Genetically altered corn and soybeans _
the United States' two biggest crops _ were planted on over 60
million acres of farmland last year. These grains are used in the
processing of snacks, breakfast cereal, vegetable oil and countless
other products.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Grocery Manufacturers of America estimates that
about 70 percent of grocery-store food may have been made with
biotechnology crops.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says that ridding the nation of biotechnology-based
ingredients would require a huge and costly reform of the
agriculture system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no system in the U.S. to segregate GM from non-GM,''
said Mark Dollins, a spokesman at Quaker Oats in Chicago, referring
to genetically modified foods. ``Any company that says it can
segregate, we'd like to know how they do it. Do they have separate
silos? Separate train tracks? There's literally not a system in
place to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some food giants are investing in organic or
natural food units. Last year, Kellogg bought Worthington Foods,
which makes vegetarian dishes. Earlier this year, Kraft Foods
bought companies that make nutrition bars and soy burgers, while
General Mills, the cereal maker, and Mars, the candy maker, now
offer organic foods.
</P>
<P>
   Many big food companies, meanwhile, are avoiding public comment
on genetically modified foods, while others are engaging in a
seemingly contradictory marketing gambit. They announce that one
line of products is not genetically altered, while continuing to
produce many other items from genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a position; we're not for it, we're not against
it,'' said Walt Riker, a spokesman at McDonald's, which last month
said it went along with other fast-food chains in asking farmers
not to plant genetically altered potatoes. ``This issue is way
beyond McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether McDonald's continues to make food from genetically
altered crops, Riker said: ``Yes, because it's in the food stream.
So we're like consumers who use all these things. We're not saying
we're GM-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major food companies are reading from the same
script. They insist that the science behind biotechnology is valid
and safe, and that they have faith in the federal regulatory
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the regulatory agencies have done a good job in this
area and we support their work,'' said Christine Ervin, a Kellogg
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Although many European consumers appear to be troubled by
genetically modified foods, U.S. companies say American consumers
are not alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer sentiment is pretty supportive,'' said Betsy D.
Holden, the new chief executive at Kraft Foods in Northfield, Ill.
``Consumer calls here are very low. We get more calls about
aspartame.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Mudd, a Kraft spokesman, added: ``Don't think of
this as Kraft leading the charge for biotechnology. We're more
neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Many big food producers are betting heavily on the success and
future profitability of genetically modified corn and soybeans.
Today such crops are typically altered to resist pests and
chemicals. Someday the industry expects that crops will be
manipulated to create new, more nutritious foods, even foods that
deliver drugs, proteins and vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some companies are dropping genetically modified foods
from their products, trying to avoid what could be a
public-relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to eliminate ourselves from the debate,'' said
Sheldon Jones, a Gerber spokesman in Summit, N.J. Gerber dropped
genetically modified ingredients from its products last summer.
``We don't think it's fair to our customers _ the parents _ to have
this issue fought out over baby food.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerber officials say Novartis, its Switzerland-based parent and
the maker of genetically altered seeds, understood the subsidiary's
position.
</P>
<P>
   H.J. Heinz has also dropped genetically altered crops from its
baby food, but not from its other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still fairly limited in scope,'' said Goldin at
Technomics, referring to companies that have dropped genetically
altered foods. ``With Heinz, baby food is small. Ask them if
they're going to go GM-free in ketchup. Tomatoes are highly
genetically engineered.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain Foods, the world's largest maker of french fries, said it
had decided to drop genetically engineered potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is simple: We believe it's very good science,''
said Frank Van Schaayk, a spokesman at McCain Foods USA, in Oak
Brook, Ill. ``The difficulty is that consumer acceptance of this
science was not complete. We're in the business of giving consumers
what they want, not what we want them to eat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are scientific disputes about what constitutes genetically
altered foods. The industry says that even when hogs have been fed
grain grown from modified seeds, the meat has not been genetically
altered, because the genetic material has been dissolved. Pepsi
insists that its soft drinks do not contain genetically altered
foods, because the corn syrup that is made from genetically altered
corn has been similarly broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. Dr. Michael Hansen at Consumers Union says that
whether or not genetic material can be detected in soft drinks,
they are genetically altered foods.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies say they have detected the beginnings of a
backlash against such food among American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult question that food companies are
facing,'' said Lynn Markley, a spokeswoman at Frito-Lay. ``In late
'99, we did see increasing questions from our consumers, and we're
a consumer products company, so we said, `This year, let's not do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those that have dropped genetically altered foods, however, are
those that were able to do so. Gerber said that its baby food
contained only tiny amounts of corn and soybeans, and that the
company could therefore control its supply channels.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's and some of its suppliers said that less than 6
percent of potatoes grown in the United States were genetically
altered _ so it was not difficult to drop them. And Frito-Lay,
which contracts with corn growers who plant to the company's
specifications, simply told them to use traditional corn.
</P>
<P>
   But for the biggest companies, steering clear of genetically
altered corn and soybeans is very difficult. The companies buy
largely on the open market and most commodity suppliers do not
separate out biotechnology grains.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many food companies say they do not even know whether
their products contain genetically altered crops. They suspect,
simply based on the odds, that their products do, but they are not
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible some of the ingredients in our food are from
genetically modified sources,'' said Theresa Herlevsen, a
spokeswoman at Sara Lee. ``But we don't know which products those
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are pressing regulators and lawmakers to push for
mandatory labeling of genetically altered foods, so that consumers
will know what they are buying and eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be mandatory labeling, because the consumer ought
to know if GM is in their food,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, a longtime
opponent of biotechnology. ``It's the most radical food experiment
we've ever engaged in. Is it safe? We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the food industry opposes labeling, however, saying it
might alarm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery
Manufacturers Association, which represents most major food
companies, says the decision by several companies not to use
genetically altered foods is evidence that the food industry is
finding a way to sort out the issue for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is proof there is choice in the market,'' he said. ``You
don't need government interference. The worst thing you can do is
mandatory labeling or government action.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Winston Porter, a consultant to McDonald's, said the debate
is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a real internal struggle between the
public-relations people and the scientific people,'' Porter said.
``Many of the companies are in a conundrum. They think there's bad
public relations in the short term but great promise in the long
run.''

   Lynne Bradley, director of government relations for the American
Library Association, said the federal government's Internet
operation is still woefully inadequate compared to its publications
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of reports and data that are still
available only in print,'' said Bradley. ``And even if everything
were online, there are still issues with the speed of connections
and librarians using their limited time to teach specialized
computer programs to patrons.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Taylor, R-North Carolina, sponsor of the library
budget cut and chairman of the House Legislative Appropriations
Subcommittee, said in a May 9 congressional report that ``the
committee recognizes that the public availability of government
information is a basic right that must be maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   But he went on to say that the program ``could be performed with
more cost effectiveness by making greater use of electronic
information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   House staffers said a few days ago that many GOP members are
having second thoughts about scrapping the depository program. The
cuts are already opposed by most Democratic members, including Rep.
Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles, a member of the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been motivated to revisit the issue in part by
the Senate Appropiations Committee, which voted May 18 to fully
fund the library program.
</P>
<P>
   House GOP leaders will be meeting this week to decide whether to
rescind the cuts, which are embedded in the proposed 2000-01
operating budget for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One of those GOP leaders is Rep. David Dreier, R-Covina,
chairman of the House Rules Committee. Dreier said Thursday that he
is sympathetic to the needs of librarians and patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must strive to improve access and efficiency in government
without creating new hurdles for people and the local institutions
that serve them,'' Dreier said. ``While I support new technology to
expand Americans' access to government, I share the concerns of
those who worry that such a major change in distributing federal
documents may go too far, too fast.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Four-year-old Matan Berner-Kadish, the center of a
swirling debate about alternative families, is not at all
conflicted about his identity. He knows he is a Power Ranger,
fiercer than any Ninja warrior by far.
</P>
<P>
   Towheaded with floppy bangs, Matan was completely nonplused by
the photographs of his parents on the front page of Israeli
newspapers last week. ``Mommy,'' he said, pointing to Nicole
Berner-Kadish, ``and Eema,'' he added, using the Hebrew word for
mommy and pointing to Ruti Berner-Kadish.
</P>
<P>
   For Matan, there has never been any question. He has always had
two mothers, or, to be precise, one mom who is American-born and
speaks to him in English and one eema who is Israeli-born and
speaks to him in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until Monday that the state of Israel accepted
that basic fact of his existence, with a watershed court ruling
that drew howls of outrage _ but not much more _ from the religious
right.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli High Court ordered the government to register Nicole
Berner-Kadish, an American-Israeli who adopted Matan in California,
as his second mother and to list him on her national identity card.
Matan _ whose name means ``gift'' _ was conceived and planned as
the child of both women. But after Ruti Berner-Kadish, who was
artificially inseminated, gave birth to him, Israel, unlike
California, refused to recognize Nicole's parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   A classic Israeli idiom, which means to proclaim that there's no
one like mom, says, ``There is only one mother.'' And the
government felt that the catch phrase should be taken literally: It
was biologically impossible, the government insisted, for anyone to
have more than one.
</P>
<P>
   The two women, who hold dual nationality, expected this. But as
children of the 1960s who both spent their formative years in
California, and many of them in Berkeley, they were raised to do
battle for their rights and everybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole, 35, a lawyer, and Ruti, 36, an academic, say they felt
well positioned to charge ahead on an issue that makes many
Israelis squeamish. Fresh-faced, well-scrubbed professionals, they
put people at ease because they themselves are at ease, even in
religious, conservative Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're what's known as white-picket-fence lesbians, or whatever
the Israeli equivalent would be,'' Nicole Berner-Kadish said.
``We're like perfect poster children for alternative families.''
</P>
<P>
   Represented by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, they
petitioned the High Court two years ago. While their case was
pending, Nicole Berner-Kadish was artificially inseminated and gave
birth in Israel to the couple's second son, Naveh. He is the next
legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1988, the state outlawed homosexual acts in its criminal
code, and gay life was extremely closeted. Gay and lesbian bars
moved furtively from one location to another.
</P>
<P>
   But that began to change in the '90s and civil rights advances
began to occur. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
was outlawed and major court cases _ against El Al, the state
airline, and the army _ set the precedent for benefits to be
awarded to gay spouses and widows.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, when Matan was 3, he and a playmate were strapped
into their child seats, riding in the back of the couple's car.
Matan's friend suddenly said, ``Where's Matan's daddy?'' And, while
Ruti held her breath, Matan answered, ``I don't have a daddy. I
have an eema and a mommy. You're the one who has a daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, provoked by the question, Matan asked his
mother why he did not, after all, have a father. Then he asked why
he did not have a sister, and why he did not have a pet. Having
long anticipated the moment, his mothers launched into an speech
about how there are all different kinds of families, and not long
into their explanation, Matan nodded his head and asked for a fruit
smoothie.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing their case, the women had the powerful documentary
support of a California adoption certificate. That allowed the case
to be argued on technical issues, separating legal definitions from
biological ones.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli case law says that the Interior Ministry has to register
citizens as they define themselves if they can show an official
document supporting what they claim.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel rejected the government's argument. But the
decision was narrow, addressing the registration alone and not the
principle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dissenting judge _ the only man on the panel _ and
almost everyone else saw it to have broader social implications.
Judge Abd al-Rahman Zouabi said that registering Nicole
Berner-Kadish as Matan's second mother would create an ``abnormal
family unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berner-Kadishes had fought successfully to keep their case
from being secret; the state not only listed Nicole as Jane Doe but
sought to bar media coverage. And when they won on Monday, on the
sixth anniversary of their unofficial wedding ceremony, they were
jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups called it a momentous day, but religious groups were
outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Ravitz, a strictly Orthodox legislator, said the High
Court was turning Israel into a ``Sodom and Gomorrah, in which
every possible perversion is sanctioned by law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Emuna Elon, who is a religious, right-wing pundit, tried to
calm the debate in an op-ed piece. ``This precedent-setting ruling
does not turn `Eema and Mommy' into a married couple,'' she wrote.
``But it does grant security and satisfaction to two good and
loving women who have decided to be life partners and to raise
children, and there isn't anything wrong with that according to
Jewish law, either.''
</P>
<P>
   With the speed of the Israeli news cycle, Matan became part of
popular culture in a day. This happened even at a time when Israel
was still reeling from the quick withdrawal from Lebanon, which had
been fought for by a grass-roots group called the Four Mothers
Movement, started by soldiers' mothers.
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon showed a little boy telling an Israeli soldier, ``I
have two mothers!'' And the soldier said, ``I've got four!''
</P>
<P>
   Matan did not have a clue that he was caricatured in the
newspaper. Sitting on a couch with a plastic sword in his lap, he
watched ``Bambi.'' Occasionally, he and a friend jousted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pow,'' Matan said, thrusting his fists through the air. ``Pow,
pow.''

AFTER TWO REELING LOSSES IN NEW YORK, MILLER TOOK CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers never trailed in the Eastern Conference
finals. And yet, after losing two lackluster games to the Knicks in
Madison Square Garden last week, they seemed like a train derailed,
the players ready to scatter their separate ways to free agency, if
not their summer tee times.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose said the offense was staid and predictable. Travis
Best hinted that speed would be a better starting option at point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   And Reggie Miller was out of character altogether, having scored
no more than 19 points a game in a series he supposedly could not
wait to dominate, against a team he hated with a well-documented
passion.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Miller turned into the best version of himself,
demanding the ball and letting his shots silence the Garden crowd
in Game 6 on Friday night, was Indiana's transformation complete.
They started rebounding. They started playing defense. They adopted
the intensity their third-year coach, Larry Bird, had as a
Hall-of-Fame player. And they became the team that brought
Indianapolis its first appearance in the NBA finals in franchise
history.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored a game-high 34 points, 17 in the decisive
fourth-quarter, and finished with five rebounds and four steals in
the Pacers' 93-80 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 7 would have been, to tell you the truth, too much
pressure for us,'' Miller said. ``We wanted to end it here. Tonight
was our Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller sank a trio of 3-pointers and all eight free throws in
the fourth quarter, bringing the Pacers their first Eastern
Conference championship, breaking a string of two devastating
near-misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and time again, he made the big plays,'' Dale Davis said.
``Every time they made a run, he stuck a basket at the most crucial
times.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks were making a final run, Miller said he told Bird,
``Just run the offense every single play through me. Either I will
get a good look or someone else will get a good look, but I had to
have my hands on the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of urgency _ missing in Miller in last year's Game 6
loss to the Knicks at the Garden _ emerged before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would flip the switch and ask the guys, `If it
came down to one game, one game to move on to the big show, where
would you want to play?''' Miller said. ``Personally, I would want
to play it here and want to play against New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, almost 35, is one of six Pacers who will become free
agents after the season. His message was not lost on the Pacers.
``Reggie's the guy who takes it personal when we don't play well
against New York,'' Rose said. ``Everybody knows he doesn't like
them and they don't like him for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added, ``He wasn't going to be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor were the rest of the Pacers. For the fourth time in six
games, Davis had 16 rebounds. For the second straight game,
Indiana's point guards Mark Jackson and Travis Best outplayed and
outscored Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, combining for 19 points
and eight assists to 12 points and 11 assists for Ward and Childs.
Rose scored 11 points, second-highest on the team.
</P>
<P>
   And in the fourth quarter, the Pacers outrebounded the Knicks,
12-4, and limited the Knicks to six field goals and three free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two games ago players were questioning what I was doing, and
all I told them,'' Bird said, `You got to believe and you got to
get up and play harder and if you lay it on the line, it will work.
If you are soft, they will take advantage of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You hear Jalen say you need some new plays and
that's not good, but then they believe in the system and they end
up winning two good games.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for the first time in 10 trips to the playoffs, four to the
conference finals, the Pacers advanced to the NBA finals. In 1987,
the year the Pacers drafted Miller out of UCLA, the Knicks drafted
Mark Jackson out of St. John's and Brooklyn. Thirteen seasons
later, Jackson had 9 points and four assists for Indiana, and he
was on the podium next to his close friend, Miller, wiping tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reg and I have been talking about this for years and years and
years and time and time again, keeping each other up all night
long, calling in the middle of the night and wondering how are you
feeling,'' Jackson said. ``We have gotten there time and time
again, but to finally finish it off was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Brooklyn native Sam Perkins was the only Pacer to have
previously reached the finals, with Seattle in 1996. After scoring
6 points and getting three of his four rebounds in the final 10
minutes Friday night, Perkins could not stop grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' he said of winning at New York. ``We kept digging
down,'' Perkins said. ``All those things going into the season
about how old we are'' _ Perkins is the oldest Pacer, just 10 days
from his 39th birthday; Rose is the youngest at 27 _ ``we didn't
need to be reminded of that. It was just worthwhile for this day,
right now, it's satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment will be all too fleeting, though. ``We're not really
content _ we've got four games left,'' Perkins said, just as
Portland was sending the Western Conference finals to a seventh
game against favored Los Angeles. ``No matter who we play we'll
probably be the underdog.''

   Yankees, Red Sox: A Race With Only Winners?
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox appear to be in a race that
will very likely not turn out to be a race at all. How can there be
a race when no one loses?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly much can happen in the remaining two-thirds of the
season, but from the vantage point of the first weekend of June and
the first interleague series of the season, the Yankees and the Red
Sox have the look of playoff teams. The only question would be
which will go as the division champion and which as the wild card.
Therein, some people believe, lies the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty old school,'' John Valentin, the Red Sox third
baseman, said before sustaining a season-ending knee injury last
Tuesday. ``I'd rather fight them in a pennant race and be the
winner and have no wild card. Then these games would mean a lot
more. They really would. Right now these could be pennant-type
ballgames. They're exciting now, but they're not going all out. The
atmosphere is different.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the collection of 10 games the Yankees and
the Red Sox have in a four-week span (why they are playing all of
those games this early in the season is another issue). The games
are less meaningful, Valentin suggested, because no matter who
prevails in them, no matter who winds up in first place at the end
of the season, the other team expects to be right there, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Stanley, his teammate, disagreed about the value of the
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a fan of the wild card until the first year, '95,
when we won it,'' Stanley said, referring to the Yankees, the team
he played for then. ``I came back with the Yankees in '97 and we
were the wild-card team. In '98 and '99, I was with this team and
we were the wild-card team. So every year except '96 I've been on
the wild-card team, so I'm a big fan of it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ultimate goal is to get into the playoffs,'' the
wild-card king added. ``You're just looking for a spot to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig acknowledged that the existence of the
wild card could dilute the excitement of a division championship
race but only if the loser of that race is guaranteed the wild-card
spot. And, he noted, baseball offers no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that the one that doesn't win is guaranteed the
wild card,'' he said, referring to the Yankees and the Red Sox.
``You have an interesting Chicago-Cleveland scenario, and Toronto
isn't far behind the Yankees and Red Sox. There could be quite a
race for the wild card as well as for the division championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Orza, the No. 2 man at the players association, said
wild-card races were more likely to produce excitement than
division races. ``The wild card has the potential that division
races do not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of teams in a division race, Orza added, is limited
by the number of teams in the division. A wild-card race can
include any number of teams from all of the divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The National League wild-card team has been decided the past two
seasons by playoff games. The Chicago Cubs defeated the San
Francisco Giants in 1998, and the Mets knocked off the Cincinnati
Reds last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has its pluses and minuses,'' Selig said, ``but I
think the pluses with the wild card outweigh the minuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the schedule is that if the Yankees and the Red Sox
were playing at least half of their games in the second half of the
season, as they have been accustomed to doing, the dilution of
their race for first place could be even greater because they would
be in a better position to know their chances of reaching the
playoffs as the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   No one has a specific explanation for why the teams play 10 of
their 13 games before the end of June and why the Red Sox play in
New York twice in three weeks, the second time before the teams
play in Boston for the first time. Perhaps more interestingly,
according to a person with knowledge of the schedule-making,
neither team raised the chronology as undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since the American League went to a
balanced schedule with expansion in 1977 that the Yankees and the
Red Sox were scheduled to play the majority of their games in such
a short period. In 1978, they had seven games in 16 days in June
and early July, but they played eight other games that season,
including six in a memorable September.
</P>
<P>
   Katy Feeney, a major league schedule expert, was not involved in
planning the AL's 2000 schedule, but she said interleague play had
affected schedules generally. Special team requests and travel
patterns also influence the schedule, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' Home Run Pace
</P>
<P>
   In a spring training conversation about the increase in the
number of players who have hit 50 home runs in recent seasons,
Barry Bonds of San Francisco was asked if he thought he could hit
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never hit 50 so I'll never say I can hit 50,'' said Bonds,
whose career high is 46. ``If I had done it before, I'd say yes,
but I've never hit 50. I'm not going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, entering the weekend, had slugged 20 home runs in the
Giants' 50 games, placing him only 1 behind Mark McGwire, the major
league leader. His home run ratio would project to 65 for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   When Marquis Grissom of Milwaukee hit a home run last Monday, he
relinquished his lead in the race among players who do not know the
baseballs are supposed to be livelier this season. Grissom produced
his first home run of the season on his 197th time at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, the new leader was Miguel Cairo of Tampa
Bay. He had hit no home runs in 173 at-bats. He was followed by
Homer Bush of Toronto at 150 and Mickey Morandini of Philadelphia
at 142.
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Fletcher of Toronto hit three grand slams in his first
944 major league games, a career that spanned nine years of major
league service. But in his first 41 games this season he matched
that total, slugging grand slams against Kent Mercker of Anaheim on
April 20, Jason Johnson of Baltimore on May 8 and Doug Brocail of
Detroit on May 26. Fletcher leads the majors this season with three
grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson Unbeatable
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield struggled through five seasons with five
different teams and compiled an 18-27 record. Then last season he
won 18 games and lost seven for St. Louis. The Cardinals traded him
to Anaheim for Jim Edmonds in March because they felt Garrett
Stephenson was ready to start for them. Stephenson had pitched in
four seasons with four different teams, emerging with a 14-12
record. Stephenson went into his start against Cleveland Saturday
night with an 8-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel, who was Tampa Bay's scheduled starter against
the Mets Saturday night, has pitched one complete-game shutout and
seven innings in each of two other shutouts for his only victories
of the season. In his other nine starts, he had allowed 41 earned
runs in 43 and two-thirds innings for an 8.45 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of five days, the Chicago White Sox lost the first
of James Baldwin's eight starts, the Arizona Diamondbacks lost the
first of Brian Anderson's eight starts and the Mets lost the first
of Al Leiter's nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Alignment Plans
</P>
<P>
   Officials plod on trying to devise an alignment and a schedule
format for next season. The prevailing plan is the one that would
have 16 teams in the National League and 14 in the American, withArizona and Tampa Bay switching leagues. The players association,
however, has submitted an idea for two leagues of 15 teams each,
with Houston moving to the AL.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the 15-15 alignment would be that the leagues
and their avenues to the playoffs would be symmetrical _ three
divisions of five teams each with three division champions and a
wild card for the playoffs. Under the 16-14 setup, the NL would
have four division winners and no wild card and the AL would have
two four-team divisions and one six-team division.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials don't like 15-15 because it would require
seasonlong interleague play. The officials prefer their interleague
games in two clusters, as they are scheduled now. But the union has
devised a format for an unbalanced schedule, which is the No. 1
goal of Commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   The union format provides for 72 games against division
opponents (18 each), 72 games against the other 10 teams (seven or
eight each) and 18 interleague games (three each against five
same-division teams and three against a geographical rival or
otherwise selected opponent).
</P>
<P>
   Other than having seasonlong interleague games, the alignment
has two problems:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Texas Rangers have wanted out of the AL West to play more
games in their own time zone for television purposes, but a
lucrative new 10-year television contract has apparently rendered
that problem moot. Furthermore, the Astros would join the Rangers
in the AL West, creating a Texas-sized rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Astros' owner, Drayton McLane, has said he does not want
to change leagues, and he can veto a move. He would have to be
convinced it would be in the best interests of baseball for the
Astros to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response from the players has been overwhelming,'' Gene
Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said. ``They're very
enthusiastic about it. They like the absolute balance. They like
the idea of everybody playing the same kind of schedule, having the
same number of teams and having the same ways of getting to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The players have to approve any change in the leagues'
alignment.  &QL;

NBA NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roster For the Olympics Remains Unsettled
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway is probable, Grant Hill and Tim Duncan are
questionable, and Allen Iverson is extremely doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   As injuries pile up for the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team,
the alternate list keeps growing. While Hardaway's injured foot is
expected to heal in time for the Sydney Games, which begin Sept.
15, Hill and Duncan are question marks after recent surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all indicated that they want to play,'' Craig Miller,
the director of USA Basketball, said. ``It's all about their
recovery time now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who was passed over for the previous teams, does not
want to miss an opportunity to compete in the Olympics. But if Hill
is out, Kobe Bryant is the favorite to be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who is recovering from knee surgery, is also a question
mark. Antonio McDyess, Eddie Jones or Shareef Abdur-Rahim would
most likely take the spot. But the committee has not ruled out
approaching Shaquille O'Neal, who originally turned down the
request to play.
</P>
<P>
   Two USA Basketball officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Iverson was a long shot to make the team because of
the team's depth at guard.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate decisions will not be made until mid-June, Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the team will not be hurting for talent although its
presence will not rival the pageantry surrounding the original
Dream Team in 1992. The 2000 team will open preliminary play on
Sept. 17 against China, then play Italy on Sept. 19, Lithuania on
Sept. 21, New Zealand on Sept. 23 and France on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the injured players, Ray Allen, Vin Baker, Vince Carter,
Kevin Garnett, Allan Houston, Jason Kidd, Alonzo Mourning, Gary
Payton and Steve Smith will represent the United States.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady Appears to Be Moving
</P>
<P>
   All Arn Tellem, the agent for Tracy McGrady, will say is,
``We're keeping all our options open.'' But it is looking more and
more as though McGrady, the skywalking Toronto Raptors forward,
will not be helping Vince Carter much longer.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady, the pick of the free-agent litter with Tim Duncan,
Grant Hill and Eddie Jones, is leaning toward signing with Orlando
or Chicago _ the teams with the most salary-cap money stockpiled.
According to a person familiar with McGrady's plans, McGrady's
decision may come down to what other prominent free agents the
Magic or the Bulls sign before McGrady commits.
</P>
<P>
   If Glen Grunwald, Toronto's general manager, feels he is going
to lose McGrady to another team for nothing, the possibility of a
sign-and-trade deal grows exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the long-held notion that McGrady would not leave
the Raptors because of his close relationship with Carter is fading
fast _ almost as fast as the notion that McGrady enjoys playing for
Coach Butch Carter enough to remain in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   His tale is tied to a larger one to be played out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   If McGrady, Hill, Duncan and Jones command the maximum-allowable
salary for a player of their experience levels, the money left for
those second-tier free agents whose current teams decide not to
re-sign them will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Deemed one of the major setbacks to players in the new
collective-bargaining agreement, free agents like Glen Rice, Toni
Kukoc, Ron Mercer, Jalen Rose and Rashard Lewis can only hope their
teams want to retain their services and pay fair-market value. If
they do not, they may end up playing for $2 million exceptions for
teams that do not have the money to compensate them.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on. Avery Johnson. Antonio Daniels. Kurt Thomas.
Kendall Gill. Tim Thomas. Tim Hardaway. Players like those and
Maurice Taylor, Cuttino Mobley and Tariq Abdul-Wahad may have to
scramble to find a salary commensurate with their skill levels
after all the big money is paid out.
</P>
<P>
   Great system, no? The elite players are about to get richer as a
plethora of former and potential all-stars may have to work for Joe
Kleine-type wages. It will be the price extracted for cutting down
on widespread player movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Falk Influence
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn's joining the Nets as president and chief of
basketball operations not only gives the organization a bona fide
presence in the front office, but it also squelched the notion that
the agent David Falk was somehow running the team through the
connection with his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, who represents Stephon Marbury, Keith Van Horn and Kerry
Kittles also has a close friendship and business relationship with
John Thompson, whom the Nets interviewed for the position. Falk has
often been accused of leveraging the contract extensions of Van
Horn and Kittles against delivering Marbury to the Meadowlands from
Minnesota. Falk was deeply involved in the blockbuster trade, but
had no say in other personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost a break for Thompson that he did not get the job.
His personal association with one of the game's most powerful
agents would have unfairly distorted the perception his own job
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Nets Top Pick Up For Auction?
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are already talking about moving their No. 1 pick in
the draft, according to a Western Conference general manager who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Nets are not enthralled
with any of the most likely top four picks _ Chris Mihm, Kenyon
Martin, Stromile Swift and Marcus Fizer _ and have considered swaps
with both Orlando, which has the fifth, 10th and 13th selections,
and Chicago, which has the fourth, seventh and 24th picks.
Vancouver has also been talking with Orlando about shipping its No.
2 pick to the Magic for a compilation of Orlando's picks, according
to an Eastern Conference team official.

NFL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders' organization and much of the National
Football League remain saddened _ and puzzled _ over the death of
Raiders safety Eric Turner last Sunday from complications of
abdominal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the league, especially his teammates and coaches,
wondered how the cancer could have so quickly struck down a top,
young athlete with seemingly little warning. In a matter of months,
Turner, 31, went from a Pro Bowl player who last season was a
contributing member of the Raiders, to recently losing 70 pounds
from his 215-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who two weeks ago denied reports that he was seriously
ill, died at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Because
of privacy concerns, the Raiders and family members have released
little information about his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's death has caused some players, especially his
teammates, to make themselves more aware about cancer. One agent
said he had asked his clients, with the Raiders and others
throughout the league, to see their team doctors for a checkup. One
Raider said that because he eats ``a lot of greasy bad food'' he
planned to get a screening for abdominal cancer soon.
</P>
<P>
   Abdominal cancer, according to Dr. Martin Oster, an oncologist
at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, is an insidious disease
that is hard to detect, and once it spreads, it kills quickly. Even
the detailed physical exams administered to NFL players would not
have most likely detected the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of cancer might begin without any specific
symptoms,'' Oster said. ``The patient may have vague symptoms, like
stomach pain or weight loss. In a healthy young person, those
symptoms do not alarm. So the cancer advances.''
</P>
<P>
   Such symptoms would not have most likely alerted Turner, or
almost any other player. Football players are used to enduring
physical discomfort. They routinely play with broken fingers, sore
knees, battered ribs and other injuries. So Turner would have
barely noticed a stomach ache, and any weight loss might have been
attributed to workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know all of the details of his case of course, but
there is a stage in this type of cancer, like many types of cancer,
where it is early, and the cancer is curable,'' Oster said. ``But
this cancer is an iceberg cancer. The symptoms can be few while the
cancer grows. Then by the time it is diagnosed, it can be beyond a
surgical cure.''
</P>
<P>
   While the exact details of when the stomach cancer was diagnosed
are unknown, what is known is that last season he was playing. So
the diagnosis had to have come in the past year _ it is hard to
imagine a doctor diagnosing stomach cancer in Turner during the
season and then Turner continuing to play _ which means the disease
was most likely diagnosed after the season and in the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for this type of cancer to spread rapidly and
do massive amounts of internal damage. ``About 10 to 20 percent of
the people who get this cancer may live five years or longer after
the diagnosis,'' Oster said. ``But for the vast majority, about 80
to 90 percent, it is not uncommon to see death within a year.''
</P>
<P>
   As Turner's illness worsened, he withdrew from some teammates
and friends. Terry Donahue, who coached Turner at UCLA, said he had
sent him a note several weeks ago after word of his illness leaked
out, but he never heard back from him. Several teammates tried to
contact Turner by phone, but could not reach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, he was exceedingly private in cloaking this
illness in the most private of terms,'' said Art Modell, the
Baltimore Ravens owner, whose Cleveland Browns drafted Turner
second over all in 1991. ``It's very sad that a young man that age
has to be taken that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players questioned how a young person in outstanding
physical shape could lose his life so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in good shape and taking care of yourself never hurts,
no question,'' Oster said. ``But overall, I'm afraid, it means very
little. It doesn't help you fight the cancer. Why you get the
cancer is a function of genetics and what you eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Raiders are remembering Turner as a gregarious,
friendly person, as well as an unselfish player. Oakland Coach Jon
Gruden said Turner was ``a great guy who will be sorely missed by a
lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon Kaufman, the Oakland running back, said: ``He was
compassionate and a class act. It was truly a pleasure to have
known Eric and I will miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders May Join Redskins
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Cowboys' team official said he hated the idea that
cornerback Deion Sanders might end up playing for the rival
Washington Redskins, but conceded it would probably happen.
Sanders, who was released Friday by the Cowboys, could sign with
the Redskins soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys believe Sanders is still a good player, but they
simply could not afford to keep him on their roster. If Dallas did
not cut Sanders before Friday, his contract for the next two years
_ a $10 million roster bonus and $500,000 in base salary for the
coming season and a $13 million salary for next season _ would have
been guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has been working with a speed coach, and the Pro Bowl
player believes he is in great shape. The Redskins and other teams
agree. Tampa Bay and Denver are also interested in Sanders and the
Dallas owner Jerry Jones will not rule out an attempt to re-sign
Sanders at a cheaper price. But look for Sanders to end up in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles Budgeting Well
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Eagles are in the best position of any team to
take advantage of the remaining free-agency period, since last week
the team was an astounding $7 million under the $62 million salary
cap. Even though the Eagles will use $4 million to sign draft
picks, the remaining cash will allow them to sign one or two
quality free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have had a tremendous off season so far, acquiring
linebacker Carlos Emmons, fullback Stanley Pritchett and offensive
lineman Jon Runyan through free agency. In the April college draft,
they selected defensive tackle Corey Simon of Florida State, a
possible future Warren Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia is definitely a team to watch next season in a
division, the NFC East, that is certain to be one of the toughest
in football.
</P>
<P>
   Young Torn Between Options
</P>
<P>
   According to someone close to the quarterback, Steve Young
simply cannot make up his mind about his future. One day, Young
will talk to friends about how he would like to finish his career
in Denver playing for Coach Mike Shanahan, one of the most
innovative minds in the game. Then the next day, Young says he will
retire, and the next, Young expresses the desire to finish his
playing career with the 49ers. Young has also expressed the desire
to become a football television analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Young's indecision was the reason he asked San Francisco for
extra time _ until June 10 _ to make a decision regarding his
future. Privately, the 49ers said they would like Young to retire
because they feared for his health. Young has sustained a number of
concussions, and San Francisco's line next year is expected to be
porous.

POLITICAL MEMO: IS BUSH OVERPLAYING HIS IGNORANCE?  

</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the annals of politics, it will undoubtedly
go down as one of the strangest pitches ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Selling Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to the voters at a rally in
Albuquerque, N.M., this week, Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico
recounted a conversation that he and Bush had once had about the
speakers at a conference of state leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``George turns to me,'' Johnson recalled, ``and says, `What are
they talking about?' I said, `I don't know.' He said, `You don't
know a thing, do you?' And I said, `Not one thing.' He said,
`Neither do I.' And we kind of high-fived.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a populist tribute to Bush as the antithesis of an
egghead, or at least it was supposed to be. But the way it came
across raised a serious strategic question: are Bush and his allies
overplaying his disdain for intellectualism, to the point where
they are sometimes making him out to be a self-satisfied boob?
</P>
<P>
   In February, Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., talked Bush up in
South Carolina by reassuring audience members that a president does
not have to be clever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy clever,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly four months since then, Bush has repeatedly curled
his lip at the thought or mention of Ivy League types who tote
mental suitcases jammed with facts and figures, and he has
deflected questions about gaps in his experience with a sunny,
ready pledge to assemble and rely on the keenest, most scrupulous
advisers he can find.
</P>
<P>
   He did it again on Friday, when he addressed the participants at
a celebration of the 20th anniversary of CNN. In response to a
question from a Saudi Arabian journalist about international
affairs, Bush did not claim to be well read on the subject or well
along the road to erudition (although, in fact, Bush has slogged
through thick tomes on Russia and the Balkans in recent months).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush suggested that raw knowledge had been overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can expect any president to know all things
about all subjects,'' he said, adding that one of the roles of a
leader was ``to surround himself with excellent folks'' and ``to be
able to listen and to be able to delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   That perspective may not be revolutionary or reckless. But
Bush's sustained promotion of it _ along with his tendency on the
campaign trail to throw stones at ivory towers and challenge any
suggestion that book learning could trump horse sense _ is
unusually aggressive, something akin to a defiant reverse snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   And some political analysts see it as risky. They say this
strategy may bet too heavily on the belief that Americans hanker
for a folksy, ordinary guy in the White House and that it may pay
too little heed to their desire for someone who exudes confidence
about solving complex problems without summoning a supplementary
brain trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't want a know-it-all,'' said Stephen J. Wayne, a
political scientist at Georgetown University whose specialty is the
American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they do want a president with some intellectual ability,''
Wayne said. ``What Bush has to watch is that he doesn't reinforce
stereotypes that there is not much there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides are attuned to that. Aboard his campaign plane on
Friday afternoon, one of them looked vaguely panic-stricken and did
a quick survey, presumably looking for cameras, when the Texas
governor appeared among a few members of the press corps cradling a
book titled ``Spanish for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was not Bush's, and he was merely using it to tease a
reporter. But the alarmed aide seemed to understand that a
photograph of the moment would not convey such distinctions and
would yield to less flattering interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   It would also, ultimately, bother Bush, whose frequently sharp
wit suggests that he is plenty bright and who really wants to have
it all ways.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to distinguish and separate himself from Ivy League
intellectuals and any arrogance associated with their educational
milieu.
</P>
<P>
   But he repeatedly invokes Yale, from which he got his bachelor's
degree, and Harvard, from which he got a master's in business
administration, as proof that people who question his smarts are
foolish to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush is clearly defensive about the intimations of
intellectual vacuousness that are fed by his disinclination to
store or brandish certain details and information.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, he presented a television network producer
who had graduated from Harvard with an advertisement for audio
tapes, torn from a magazine, that promised ``a Harvard graduate's
vocabulary in just 15 minutes a day!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just ordered several,'' Bush scribbled across the page.
``What do you think? Do I have a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he fumed at the memory of one of the many times in
the presidential campaign when he felt his degree of intellectual
engagement was being underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Bantering with Chris Matthews, the host of the television news
program ``Hardball,'' during a commercial break in a taping of the
show, Bush remembered that he had once publicly told Matthews that
his favorite author was Winston Churchill, and that a pundit
subsequently suggested that Bush's comment had been a scripted
effort to please Matthews, a known Churchill devotee.

   ``Do you think I'd take time out of my life to research what the
hell you like?'' Bush asked Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read a hell of a lot more books than you give me credit
for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is undoubtedly so, but it is sometimes Bush and his allies
who are denying the Texas governor the credit.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was not Bush's thoughtfulness or eagerness to be
informed that Johnson saw fit to praise during his remarks on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Johnson saluted Bush as the rare ``somebody who
will rather admit _ or rather talk about _ the things they don't
know and make that really evident.''

BLAZERS FIRED UP AND READY FOR GAME 7 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Intensity turned into raw emotion and spilled
toward the Portland Trail Blazers' bench with 36.6 seconds left in
Game 6 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, perhaps in a flashback to his playing days, Coach Mike
Dunleavy decided to add emphasis to his team's 103-93 victory over
the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   As officials cleared away an altercation on the court, Dunleavy
rushed to the defense of his players and jumped in the face of the
instigator, Rick Fox. Dunleavy offered a few heated words that
might make a lip reader blush. Both the Portland coach and the
Lakers reserve forward were whistled for technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asking him for a good restaurant in Los Angeles,''
Dunleavy said, ``because I knew I was going to be down there this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers forced the four-of-seven-game Western
Conference finals to Game 7, which will be played in Los Angeles at
7:30 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and again avoided elimination
with stubbornness as much as skill. After losing twice at the Rose
Garden, they protected their home court like pit bulls and left the
Lakers asking how a 3-1 series lead evaporated into the showdown at
the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: equal parts Lakers' denial and Blazers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shocked,'' said Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, dismissing
any thoughts that his team might be reaching the panic stage. ``We
anticipated this would be a seven-game series.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant said: ``We're fine. On defense, we need to buckle
down. We just need to bring it all to the table on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' focus was apparent from the start in Game 6. Once
again, they flung themselves at the Lakers from all angles and set
a fast, physical pace. Portland's balanced scoring was led by Steve
Smith, with 26 points, and Bonzi Wells delivered the clinching
performance by scoring 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, a backup guard, hit five of seven shots, made all four of
his free throws, grabbed two rebounds and had two assists to help
fend off any rallies by the Lakers. Often posting low on the
smaller Brian Shaw and Ron Harper, Wells suddenly became the focal
point of the Blazers' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like street ball for a few minutes there,'' Wells
said. ``You get your basket, I'll get my basket. Mine just kept
going in.''
</P>
<P>
   On playing against Shaw and Harper, Wells added: ``I definitely
like to explore those matchups, and my teammates know it. I played
some forward before in college, so I'm not a stranger to playing
with my back to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against them, it's just a matter of making my shots. They
don't really respect me a lot, because I haven't done anything in
the league yet. I'm the youngest guy on our team, and to have the
guys go to me like that really means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Also for Portland, Rasheed Wallace continued his fine series
with 18 points and Damon Stoudamire scored 14. Defensively, the
Blazers did their best job on Shaquille O'Neal, holding the Lakers
center to 17 points on seven-of-17 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Neal, Bryant played the entire game. Playing with a
sprained foot from Game 5, Bryant scored 33 points. Beyond the
Lakers' two stars, though, nobody was able to close out Portland.
Glen Rice and Brian Shaw added 12 points each.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to stop us,'' Wells said. ``They've got to key on
five guys, not two, which is all we have to really concentrate on.
We've got a lot of different matchups that are causing them
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, despite two victories each at the other's arena, the
series will end with the Lakers having the home-court advantage.
Still, the Blazers have the momentum and are now in position to
become only the seventh team in National Basketball Association
history to win a four-of-seven-game series after falling behind by
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no momentum; there's no home-court advantage,''
Dunleavy said. ``It's one game now. You've got to come, and you've
got to bring it.'' &QL;

PUTTING A COURSE ON FISHING TO PRACTICAL USE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, the Honors Program
sponsors a course called ``The Epistemology of Fly Fishing.'' The
point of the class, says the school's syllabus, is to ``use fly
fishing as a way to know the world, or at least as a window to
explore biology, literature, gender, physics and environmental
issues,'' as well as to teach students how to catch a fish with a
fly.
</P>
<P>
   The class is heavily subscribed, mainly, it is thought, because
of the Robert Redford-directed film of Norman Maclean's book, ``A
River Runs Through It,'' set just to the north, in Montana. The
book is required reading for the class.
</P>
<P>
   As someone interested in both fishing and writing, I had the
luck to be invited along on the class' climactic April field trip
on the Green River, Utah's most famous blue-ribbon trout water.
Last year, the guest was Peter Matthiessen. Next year, it will be
Richard Ford.
</P>
<P>
   We arose at 5 a.m. and headed in a motor caravan for the Flaming
Gorge Dam, in the northeast corner of the state, so called for the
redness of the rock in the 750-foot-high banks of the gorge where
the dam was built in 1963. We arrived at about 9, a party of 14
students (9 men and 5 women), two teachers (both men), two male
friends of the teachers, along to help out and for their love of
the sport, and me.
</P>
<P>
   We parked at Little Hole, some seven miles downriver from the
dam. The teachers helped the students to rig up their outfits,
reminded them of some of the basics of wading, and loosed them on
the water, telling them to be back at the parking area by 5.
</P>
<P>
   Then four of us _ the two teachers, one of their friends and I _
drove up to the dam to fish the intervening length of the river in
boats. The friend, Duane Allport, mounted his catamaran-style,
single-seated pontoon boat and set off on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining three of us boarded a Mackenzie drift boat,
elevated in the bow to negotiate the rapids comfortably and beamy
amidships to allow for excited jumping around, and weighed anchor.
The point of this exercise was partly to test the possibility of
taking the entire class drifting next year, but mostly to do just
about the best kind of fishing there is.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Scadden, the class's technical expert, rowed. Dave is
something of a legend in northern Utah, considered to be one of the
most skilled outdoorsmen in the West. He began trapping furs and
learning to live off the land as a boy. By his late teens, he had
grown so expert that Redford used him as a consultant and a
stand-in for his 1972 film on mountain men, ``Jeremiah Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave now owns four fishing-equipment outlets in the Salt Lake
area, collectively called Angler's Inn, which runs a guiding
service. He is also developing his own line of lightweight portable
single- and double-hulled pontoon boats for fishing previously
untouched waters. He was recently back from Siberia, where he had
been hired by the Russians to show local guides how to fish the
Sadanka River by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Oberg, the chairman of Weber State's microbiology
department and the fly-fishing class's main teacher, sat in the
stern. Although he assumed the role of student to Dave, a neighbor
and good friend of his, he proved a pretty handy angler himself. I
got to fish from the seat in the raised bow.
</P>
<P>
   As we moved downstream, I had the illusion, perhaps because of
the steepness of the bluffs on either side, that the river was
tilted at a 10 degree angle downward, so that I was not only
drifting over trout but also falling into them.
</P>
<P>
   Standing up in the bow with my legs braced comfortably against
special notches, I could look down into the transparent pea-green
water and watch pods of fish feeding near the surface and big
loners cruising below. There had been talk of an abundant
blue-winged-olive hatch to come at about noon and of the good odds
of taking a 20 on a 20, meaning a 20-inch trout on a No. 20 hook.
Needless to say, I was practically trembling in anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeding fish weren't breaking the surface hard that
morning. Instead they were taking something just below and
occasionally coming up to sip gently enough not to make any kind of
splash.
</P>
<P>
   So Dave rigged up Craig and me with double flies set 18 inches
apart on a 6X leader, a No. 16 parachute Adams dry fly up-line and
a No. 20 BWO emerger at the end. I cast to a pod of three and held
my breath as a husky fish investigated my lure.
</P>
<P>
   At a flash of white mouth, I snapped my rod back and was on to a
14-inch rainbow trout. He came to the net lazily and after
unhooking and releasing him, we fell into a happy rhythm of
catching and releasing fish, rainbows, cutthroats and cutbows, a
hybrid of the two. For the first time, I understood what they mean
by casting to the fish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a while, Dave suggested we start casting to the edge of
the river, where the stone cliffs ascended, and where, he assured
us, bigger browns were feeding. He maneuvered the boat with his
oars, and we started trying to place our casts within six inches of
the bluff.
</P>
<P>
   But a problem developed. The fish would come up and take our
flies visibly enough, but when we struck, there was nothing there.
Time and again our lines would zing through the air embarrassingly.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dave intervened. ``The fish are collecting multiple
flies in their mouths before they go back down and swallow,'' he
told us. ``So you have to wait before you try to set the hook. You
have to watch the fish take the lure and then wait for a count of
three before you strike. I know it goes against every instinct, but
you've got to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   I cast again. I could barely see the dry fly floating on the
water in the shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Dave said in a low voice: ``Here he comes. Wait. He's taking the
emerger. Wait.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw the dry fly disappear beneath the surface, but held my rod
tip still.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Dave said urgently, ``Now!'' I lifted my rod tip and
after a good fight, we had an 18-inch brown in the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Craig congratulated me but added that it was too bad that now I
would have to walk back to Ogden. A moment later, he landed his own
18-inch brown and he said that all was forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   We drifted on down the stream and lost ourselves in the dreamy
heat of the day and the rhythm of the fishing. Duane came alongside
and described the good fish he had caught.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we arrived back at Little Hole. It was 5:30. As we
loaded the boat onto Dave's trailer, Craig looked at his watch and
snarled that any students back at the parking lot on time would
flunk the course for lacking the proper time-oblivious enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   When we got to the rallying point, all the students and their
supervisors were there, babbling happily about the fish they had
caught. Dave strode into their midst, and announced that the lesson
of the day was that the fish had been sipping multiple small flies
before swallowing because they had to be compensated for the energy
expended in chasing them. The students nodded attentively.
</P>
<P>
   Craig announced in his big voice that all of them had flunked
for showing up back at the rendezvous on time. They obviously
weren't true fishermen and women.
</P>
<P>
   The students looked too tired and happy to care.

POLAND IS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO LOYALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ Having finally achieved full NATO membership
only a year ago, Poland finds itself caught awkwardly between its
European aspirations and its loyalty to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   European officials, led by France, have pressured Poland to be
more accommodating toward a new European defense initiative, asking
the Poles to decide whether they really want to be members of the
European Union, senior Polish officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been told, `You have to make a choice _ be with the
U.S. or with us if you want to be Europeans,''' said a senior
Polish official. ``This poses a serious challenge for our foreign
policy, and it could be another pretext or justification for
delaying Polish accession to the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   While defense issues will not decide the fate of Poland's
application to join the European Union, Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek has said privately that he feels torn between his
Francophilia and his concept of Poland's national interests, which
call for a strong U.S. military presence in Europe and an
undiminished NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue is the European Strategic Defense Plan, an
effort pressed by France _ and formally supported by the United
States _ to create a solely European armed force of 60,000 troops
capable of being deployed quickly to a place like Kosovo, for
example, and then staying for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Authorized in December, the force would be the military arm of
the European Union, with its own command staff, and would give the
nascent federal Europe the force to back up what is supposed to
become a single foreign and defense policy. The main civilian
charged with making this notion a reality by 2003 is the former
NATO secretary-general, Javier Solana, a Spaniard respected in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Poland, as a NATO member that wants to be in the European
Union, feels it has been frozen out of the planning for this
European military arm that it will have to join later. And many
Polish officials believe the reason for this exclusion is that
France believes Poland will act as a ``Trojan horse'' for U.S.
preferences inside the new grouping.
</P>
<P>
   Given Poland's history of conflict with Russia, Poland is deeply
skeptical about a European defense that does not keep the United
States intricately involved with its superior force, technology,
intelligence and nuclear might.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply don't believe that Europe without the United States
is safe,'' a senior Polish official said. ``If this century has
taught us anything, it's that Europe and North America are one
strategic space.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland is also being dragged unhappily into the trans-Atlantic
debate over U.S. plans for a missile-defense system, which
Europeans worry will separate their security from the United
States', at least in American minds.
</P>
<P>
   On these issues, the Poles are close to the British, full
members of both the European Union and NATO, which continental
Europeans often regard as too close to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although they strongly back the European defense initiative, the
British have worked closely with the Poles, arguing for
consultation by the 15 full members of the European Union with the
six non-European-Union members who are full members of NATO _
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Iceland and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   British officials argue that Poland, a large country with a
strong military tradition, will be crucial to any new continental
force and should be involved in the planning.
</P>
<P>
   But French officials have made it clear that the planning will
be done by current European Union members only. With British
prodding, however, the European Union has just had its first
``consultations'' with the six other nations, including Turkey,
which has been even more vocal than Poland in raising alarms about
the possible dilution of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a senior Polish official and others said, Poland has
been facing French pressure and lobbying on issues ranging from the
percentage of European content in domestic broadcasting to vodka
trademarks to military procurement decisions. And they say the
French have hinted that membership negotiations on difficult topics
like agriculture and the environment will be easier if Poland
follows the federalist European line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not impressed with this policy of pressure and
gestures,'' said another senior Polish official. ``This is a
typical European dance around serious issues. And we will not be
forced to choose between NATO and the European Union _ both are
essential to Poland's future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He grimaced. ``It seems ridiculous to us that the 15 are not
taking our experiences and interests into account. The French
sometimes push too far and lose touch with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials here dismiss the accusation of pressure, with
one senior diplomat saying, in jest: ``Push them around? We haven't
even tried yet!''
</P>
<P>
   The French official said the Poles were too quick to run to the
Americans to complain about the European defense initiative. ``We
told the Poles that this appeal to Washington, making roughly the
same case as Turkey, was tactically wrong, and damaged the claim
that stems from their history.''
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France met with Geremek this spring
and reportedly asked him whether Poland wanted to be part of Europe
or to be ``the 51st state.'' They met again, later, when Chirac
insisted ``This idea of pressure is not true,'' the French official
said. France simply wants to build the new defense corps with
current European Union members, he said, ``and when we've decided
among ourselves, we will consult, so please be patient and accept
being outside for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Polish official involved in foreign and defense policy
answered: ``If we're not involved in the planning, and if our
application for the European Union is not acted upon until 2004 or
2005, then we can hardly prepare our forces to take part in the
ESDI. That strikes me as counterproductive for the whole
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Geremek, with a pained look, said slowly: ``Because of our
traumatic history, we want to belong to both NATO and the European
Union. Poland is attached to its sovereignty, and if we can give up
some part of it to Europe, it is only to defend our national
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the European initiative has produced the usual
schizophrenia: complaints about European unwillingness to ``share
the burden,'' and then nervousness whenever the Europeans,
traditionally prompted by the French, begin to act independently.
</P>
<P>
   These tensions are not conducive to further NATO expansion,
another senior Polish official said, especially since the likely
new candidates will include more strong advocates of Washington's
continued, pre-eminent role in NATO. Russian objections to
expanding NATO aside, the official said, ``The French fear that if
they enlarge NATO they'll get more American Trojan horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way through ``the triangle of the United States, the
European Union and Russia will be a very subtle task for Polish
foreign policy,'' the official said _ ``more difficult than joining
NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo proves the logic of a European foreign and security
policy capable of action, the official said. ``But we have to
preserve the coherence of the NATO alliance and the American
umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kulakowski, Poland's negotiator with the European Union,
said: ``We're asked, `Are you for America or Europe?' It's like
choosing your mother or your father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be a Trojan horse for the U.S. in Europe. We are a
European country, and we will show our solidarity, which doesn't
mean we have to challenge the United States. But on some issues,
we'll participate in some decisions of the EU that the U.S. won't
appreciate.''

POLICE BRACE FOR PROTESTS IN WINDSOR AND DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ For the next three days, anyone wearing a mask in this
city or carrying gasoline in a portable container will go to jail.
And those in possession of ammonia, urine, feces and squirt bottles
can expect intense police scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   This is Mayor Dennis Archer's response to human rights
campaigners who plan, starting on Sunday, to unleash the same kind
of protests that left Seattle with $2.5 million in damage last
December after a meeting of the World Trade Organization. In that
protest, demonstrators, some wearing gas masks, hurled Molotov
cocktails, rocks and excrement at delegates and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The protests planned here are directed at a three-day summit
being held across the Detroit River in downtown Windsor, Ontario.
Delegates from the Organization of American States, a coalition of
34 nations, are gathering to discuss ways to bolster trade in North
and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Archer hopes his new emergency ordinances will dissuade
protesters from even showing up. The police in Canada are bracing
for thousands of demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Both Detroit and Windsor, which are connected by the Ambassador
Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, are on edge because they
share North America's busiest border, with 12,000 vehicles crossing
every day. But customs and border officials on both sides said they
had no plans to close either entry point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw what happened in Seattle,'' said Greg Bowens, a
spokesman for Archer. ``In Seattle, the police were caught off
guard. We don't intend for that to happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups that plan to protest say the authorities are
overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're retirees, we're union members, we're students,'' said
Brent Patterson, an organizer for the Council of Canadians, a
public interest group. ``We're not a bunch of anarchists bent on
throwing rocks and breaking windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said many of the three busloads of protesters he had
signed up for the trip to Windsor from Toronto were afraid and
asked how the police could ``expect a positive, nonviolent protest
when they're creating a climate of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the demonstrations will be comparatively
small. In Detroit, a labor union stronghold, protest groups have
failed to win the support of any major union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an international contingent of law enforcement agencies _
the Detroit police, the FBI, the U.S. Border Patrol, the Windsor
police, the Ontario Provincial Police and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police _ devoted much time recently to planning strategy.
Bowens said the Detroit police had conducted riot training and put
4,000 officers on call.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, while police officers in Detroit were trying to
quietly step up their presence at the border, visitors to the other
side were greeted by a formidable police presence. As drivers left
the tunnel, they were met by Ontario Provincial officers, who stood
like sentries at each lane.
</P>
<P>
   And the officers' presence was no less obvious around Windsor's
usually tranquil downtown. Officers stood on virtually every
corner. And they walked some streets six deep, in sunglasses and
bulletproof vests. Mayor Mike Hurst of Windsor vowed to have more
than 1,700 officers out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels so scary to see so many,'' said Yergalem Hagos of
Windsor, as she watched Canadian officers walk by her family's
restaurant. ``You don't know if it is better to stay open or to be
safe and shut down.'' A few shops nearby have nailed plywood to
their windows.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst said the lessons of Seattle had forced officials to be
cautious. ``We don't have the luxury of a crystal ball,'' he said.
``No one knows what will happen here or in Detroit. What I do know
is that they have a right to come here and peacefully protest and I
have the right to make sure we're prepared for anything.''

REAPING MARIJUANA IN HILLS EMPTIED OF STILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES

<P>
   HINDMAN, Ky. _ Call it green lightning, the seedling crop of
countless hidden marijuana patches now stippling the spring time
``hollers'' of Appalachia the way moonshine stills used to when
Sheriff Wheeler Jacobs was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moonshine's a lost art around here,'' said Sheriff Jacobs,
driving up a back road near Yellow Mountain, a remote area he has
watched blossom as a cornucopia of marijuana. ``Moonshine went out
in the late '70s, just when marijuana started big around here.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sheriff wheeled about his domain recently, he could think
of only two tired old moonshiners left in these hills, in contrast
to the 54 youthful ``holler dopers'' arrested during the last two
years here in Knott County alone.
</P>
<P>
   The back-road yield of illegal marijuana has so multiplied that
federal officials, alarmed at a $4 billion cash crop surpassing
legal tobacco in some areas, have designated 65 Appalachian
counties here and in West Virginia and Tennessee as a ``high
intensity drug trafficking area.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 31 such regions in the nation, and the only one
with marijuana as the single targeted drug, an indication of this
region's prodigious rise as a source of high-grade marijuana
amounting to an estimated two-fifths of the nation's supply, much
of it for the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost replaced the moonshining of years gone by as
something embedded in the culture and as a way of making an
antigovernment statement,'' said Joseph C. Peters, assistant deputy
director of the White House Drug Control Policy Office, which
singled out Appalachia for the crackdown two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 1,900 arrests have been made and 5,000
patches of marijuana have been uprooted. Yet Jacobs has found a
fresh seasonal force of marijuana cultivators already tilling the
land, cyclical as Ecclesiastes in working a crop that sells for up
to $3,500 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana, a variety of the same plant species that produces
hemp, was an outgrowth of the local rope industry, which filled a
vital defense need in World War II, the sheriff said. While
moonshining continues to thrive in spots like the Virginia-North
Carolina border, law enforcement officials in this part of
Appalachia are far more concerned with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The federal help means that National Guard helicopters have
already swept through on their spring reconnaissance of the most
remote marijuana patches, gathering photo intelligence for harvest
time. It means that Jacobs has the overtime money to put his four
deputies out on the hillsides alongside state troopers this summer
for the rugged work of cutting and burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in planting time right now; the marijuana's only a foot
high,'' said the sheriff, gently summoning over a young man who had
been warily watching the law pull up to his trailer home. ``So this
is watching time for me. Destroy it now, and they'll have enough
time to plant a fresh crop.''
</P>
<P>
   In the folksiest of exchanges, the young man casually mentioned
the return from prison of a local marijuana grower, a bit of
intelligence the sheriff already knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to talk to these boys,'' Jacobs said as he drove
on, then discreetly pointed out a new path snaking off like a raw
scar toward a lush hollow beyond the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think we got us a patch up there,'' he said, stowing
his suspicion for when the marijuana grows higher, up to 18 feet.
At that point growers reap their crops, and the sheriff reaps some
growers.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff and state troopers are regional leaders in arresting
marijuana growers and destroying their crops, and are appreciated
in this coal mining county of 18,000, said Charlotte Hicks Caudill,
a reporter for The Troublesome Creek Times. The paper occasionally
reports a marijuana raid in sleepy hamlets like Mousie, but a
feature on the exploits of Wilbur Conley, an intrepid beekeeper,
seems to be the preferred reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if people are becoming kind of tolerant of
marijuana,'' Caudill said. ``They better not.''
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian growers were brazen at first, planting 10,000 or
more plants in a single marijuana patch, each plant worth about
$1,000 in retail produce, Jacobs said. The first notable lesson
that pot does not pay occurred 10 years ago when Donna Hall, a
local schoolteacher, her husband and their son were sentenced to
prison and their home was confiscated after they were convicted of
growing 14,000 plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A patch of 250 plants is considered big these days,'' said
state Trooper Dean Craft who, through 13 years of patrols, has
watched the growers become more devious, particularly in using
remote acreage of innocent land owners or bountiful glades of the
Daniel Boone National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Some marijuana growers use machetes and all-terrain vehicles to
chew their way to the sunny sanctuaries deep in the forest they use
for their illicit crop. Others boldly use the edges of cemeteries
to grow their crops. The police watch for people in the forest
depths with telltale paraphernalia, like woodsmen packing sawed-off
hoes, or hauling a large supply of garden fertilizer, potting soil,
water or deer fencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deer and groundhogs are our friends,'' Jacobs said. ``They
love pot.''
</P>
<P>
   A smart grower nowadays tills three patches, said the sheriff:
``One for us to find, one for his livelihood and the third for his
competitors to steal.'' He described a cutthroat competition among
growers who booby-trap their patches with skunks, snakes, air
horns, fish hooks and even explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's deputy, Chris Collins, said few tasks were more
fun than tracking growers like some modern species of woodland
varmint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's work but I love it,'' the deputy said. ``On an early
morning with the dew out there, you can even smell a pot patch.''
</P>
<P>
   Highways make smuggling easy, with the marijuana stashed in
false gas tanks and other niches. And it is easy to sell to
visitors at the Gingerbread Festival, an annual harvest gala for
the region where delectable fruits of the land change hands and a
small sack of pot may elude notice. But Jacobs, who admits that his
father did a little moonshining in the old days, said that
residents don't tolerate growers the way they did moonshiners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's public support for eradicating it, busting the
dopers,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs and his deputies have burned more than $180 million worth
of plants in the last two years, much of it found, he said, after
quiet tips from people who fear city-style corruption if it is
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people complain I'm cutting down the livelihood of poor,
starving people around here,'' said the sheriff. ``I say this money
doesn't change their lifestyle. All the dopers want is a new TV, a
dish antenna, another ATV to drive up to their patch.''

SAILING DOWNWIND AND INTO A DIFFERENT AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y. _ ``I won't do cheesy to win; I won't
protest when it's not necessary,'' said Amanda Clark, allowing the
qualifying conjunction to begin tacking around her port side. ``But
I will not let the girls think that they can beat me. I will try to
keep the image of advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   If that means a jabbing remark or two flung into the wind as
boats come close in open sea, well, Clark is 18 years old now and
there are regattas in which she is the old lady fiercely determined
to qualify for the big race. She has set her mind on competing in
Sydney, Australia, this year, but she will have to wait until
December, long after the Olympics are over.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is a year older, 15 pounds heavier with weight-room muscle
and slightly colder-eyed than when we last met her. She was then
about to embark on a downwind summer that would fill her sails and
her potential to become a teen-aged member of the Olympic team. But
she didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic trials for the Europe Class in San Francisco in
April, she got the jitters and started poorly. She made a
spectacular run from 18th place among 23 racers to finish third.
Only the winner would go to the Games, and that was Courtenay Dey,
who had coached Clark in a more innocent time.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, sitting as she was last week in the sunny, airy
living room of her parents' spacious house on this summer resort
island off the East End of Long Island, Clark remembered a
revelatory day with Dey when ``everything clicked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat just felt so good,'' Clark said. ``I wasn't fighting
the helm. The shape of the sail was right, nothing twisted, no big
wrinkles, and I felt the power of the boat and I felt in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going downwind,'' Clark recalled. ``I knew my limits and
I sailed the line, just how far I could push the boat without
flipping over. I had it. I knew it was time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   She moved from Optimists to the more competitive Europe
dinghies. There was another coach. The 2000 Olympics seemed
possible. The Shelter Island Yacht Club was at the heart of a
campaign that would eventually raise more than $50,000. There was a
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Courtenay Dey figured in a revelation, the older
woman was leaning out of her own boat at the Olympic trials and
saying, in a way that Clark found cutting and intimidating and
appropriate, ``Oh, you got a little close to the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Dey, who is 35, had won a bronze medal in 1996 in the Europe
class. Her rivals were relieved when she entered the Olympic trials
in the 470 class earlier this year. But after she finished second,
she climbed back into a Europe dinghy. When Dey showed up at San
Francisco in April with a new mast and sail, Clark was nervous.
Many of the younger women told each other that the experienced Dey
would have the added advantage of old friends among the officials
who would cut her slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably true, but it's life,'' Clark said. ``A lot of
racing is psychological, and if people think you have some kind of
advantage, it's better to let them keep thinking that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clark has been operating mostly on determination and
genes. Her grandfather, Albertus ``Toots'' Clark, was a
professional captain. Her father, Dennis, a painting contractor
here and one of the few local members of the yacht club, put
Amanda, her sister, Rebecca, and her brother, Greg, on his sailboat
just as soon as they were big enough to be rail meat. Her mother,
Ellen, who runs a recruitment agency for pharmaceutical scientists,
remembers that Amanda was never afraid as she became a tireless,
driven sailor.
</P>
<P>
   The family supported her passion, which has been expensive and
time-consuming; six-hour round trips to regional training centers
and regattas have become months in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The dream goes on. Clark is a child in the sport, although she
will begin traveling alone soon. Later this month, she will be
graduated with honors from Shelter Island High School. Before she
enters Connecticut College in the fall (there is a sailing team,
but no athletic scholarships), she will compete in the European
Championship in Spain and the Leiter Cup, in Newport, R.I., which
is the qualifying event for the Youth World Championships in Sydney
in December. Last year, Clark won a bronze at the Youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I'm going to be the Courtenay, the old lady,''
Clark said. ``It'll be my last chance to compete in the Youth, and
I want to win the gold. My plan for the summer is to get the fun
back in sailing and to play around with what I learned at the
trials. I'm preparing for 2004, too, the Athens Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   She says, just a little too perkily, that she was not
disappointed at missing the Olympic cut; when your biggest rival is
old enough to be your mother, there is time. Besides, she still has
kids to scare in her final 18-and-under regattas. She's been very
aware of a 15-year-old, still raw, but with a lot of ``spunk.''
Clark was reminded of herself, and those are just the ones you need
to intimidate and sail away from fast. &QL;

YOUTH COURT OF TRUE PEERS JUDGES WITH FIRM HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Adds NY dateline.) 
By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baseball caps and do-rags are dutifully removed while
court is in session. The prosecutor is a deliberative, soft-spoken
young man of 16 with a crown of cornrows. The defense lawyer is 16,
too, only recently out of jail on a charge of attempted murder. On
the six-member jury sits a girl with searing eyes and the memory of
juvenile jail still fresh in her mind. And when the accused, a
gawky 15-year-old charged with graffiti writing and weapons
possession, rattles off the names of gangs he has a ``beef'' with
at school, the courtroom congregation nods and murmurs knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not a high school moot court, where students pretend
to be players in a court of law. This is a court of law, a small,
quiet experiment in which Bronx teen-agers arrested on misdemeanor
charges and even minor felonies _ anything from graffiti writing to
small-time robberies and drug sales _ are judged, quite literally,
by a jury of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   They are all first-time defendants. They are referred here by a
probation officer or a judge, as an alternative to prosecution in
the city's overtaxed Family Court, where children under 16 are
tried.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers who run the Bronx Youth Court, begun two years
ago by youngsters organizing inside the city's juvenile jail, see
their mission as nothing short of what the Constitution guarantees:
a speedy trial before a jury of one's peers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them have been through the juvenile justice maze, what
they universally call ``the system.'' They know well the inside of
a juvenile jail (19 months in the case of Francisca Martinez, 16,
the defense lawyer, known in Youth Court as youth advocate). They
know how ponderously the Family Court can move (three and a half
months in detention for one juror, Latoya Orr, accused of stabbing
another girl, until a judge ruled in her case). Indeed, the court
seems to derive its very credibility from the youngsters' firsthand
knowledge of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got to talk to my lawyer the way I wanted to,'' said
Martinez, who was convicted of the stabbing. ``I wanted to be there
for somebody, being that nobody was there for me,'' she said in
explaining her mission.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of such youth courts is largely unproven, but
they have emerged across the country in the last decade, spurred by
a general sense of frustration with the juvenile justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 650 youth courts exist nationwide, compared with 50
in 1991, according to the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention. They handle mostly nonviolent
first-time defendants: children accused of shoplifting, vandalism,
starting schoolyard brawls and committing other crimes unlikely to
be prosecuted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feel-good quality to them,'' said Jeffrey Butts, a
senior research associate with the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based research organization, who is conducting a
national evaluation of youth courts for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   That same quality gives experts like Butts a sense of deja vu.
``A hundred years ago, we invented juvenile court to get kids out
of the bureaucratic criminal court system,'' he said. ``Now we're
inventing youth courts to get them out of juvenile court, or to
create alternatives to that system.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four such courts in New York City, all fairly new. Two
were established by the state court system, in Harlem and in Red
Hook, Brooklyn. A third, in Hollis, Queens, was begun by civic
leaders and the city corporation counsel's office, which prosecutes
children in Family Court. All but the Bronx court handle youngsters
arrested for the smallest of infractions. A fourth of all the cases
tried in the Brooklyn Youth Court, for example, involve truancy, an
infraction that is not prosecuted in Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Youth Court is unusual because it judges more serious
offenses _ drug possession with intent to sell, robbery, weapons
charges. The idea is not to punish, but to help steer the accused
away from crime and provide some restitution to the community.
Among the judges, jurors and lawyers are those whose own sentences
include serving in youth court.
</P>
<P>
   Not many get off. Of the roughly 70 youngsters who have appeared
in the Bronx Youth Court in the last two years, only two have been,
in effect, acquitted, according to statistics maintained by Youth
Force, the youth-run community group that established the court.
</P>
<P>
   The City Probation Department does not keep exact figures,
though officials there say anecdotal evidence suggests that the
program is effective.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other day, as the late afternoon sun streamed in through the
barred windows at Youth Force's headquarters in Mott Haven, the
court was weighing the case of a freshman at Columbus High School.
Police believed that he had been a lookout for a graffiti crew. The
defendant, who agreed to allow a reporter to attend his trial on
the condition that his name not be used, said he had merely been
standing on the sidewalk trying to hail a cab while his friends
were ``bombing'' a wall with graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Peppering the defendant with questions, the jurors homed in on
certain details: The police had found a knife in the defendant's
pocket, and, it turned out, he had missed nearly three months of
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who carries a knife in their pocket, if they get
busted, there should be some sort of consequence,'' argued Dante
Motes, the prosecutor, known in the court as a community impact
assessor.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, removing his baseball cap at Martinez's urging,
said he felt unsafe at school. His friends, fellow
Albanian-Americans, had angered several gangs, and some were shot a
couple weeks before. That was why he wasn't going to school, he
said, and also why he carried a knife. ``People are looking to jump
me, shoot me,'' he cried. ``How you expect me to feel safe?''
</P>
<P>
   Some jurors were skeptical. His friends were shot only two weeks
ago, but he hadn't been in school for several months. If he really
felt unsafe, why didn't he go to the principal to seek a transfer
to another school?
</P>
<P>
   What did he do in his spare time? Were there youth centers near
his home? Why had he been hanging out with these friends, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   So it went for nearly two hours, as the jury struggled to
decipher the penal code and asked questions to understand the
defendant's life better.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, they learned, was in Yugoslavia. He lived with his
sister and brother in the Bronx. He was not in a gang. He was
trying to transfer to another school. He liked to play football.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for 20 minutes in a closed room upstairs, the
jurors found him guilty on all counts. They sentenced him to a
two-hour legal rights workshop (mandatory for all Bronx Youth Court
defendants), four hours on a Youth Court jury, and 16 hours working
on a Youth Force community project. Such projects have included
voter registration drives and undercover stings against stores that
sell alcohol to minors.
</P>
<P>
   What lasting effect, if any, this will have on the young man
remains to be seen. Recidivism rates of Youth Court defendants are
only anecdotal, but supporters of the Bronx Youth Court and others
point to the alarmingly high recidivism rates in the juvenile
justice system. A recent study by the State Division of Criminal
Justice Services, for example, found that among boys incarcerated
in the state juvenile justice system, 81 percent were rearrested
within three years of their release.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Bronx Youth Court like to point out to their
peers how they fared in the juvenile justice system. ``From arrest
through court through incarceration, we went through feeling
confused, powerless and alone,'' reads a paragraph from a pamphlet
given to all defendants. ``Almost all of us came out of the system
disillusioned, better criminals, less educated and without the
resources needed to succeed.''  &QL;

   WHOLESOME _ WASHINGTON _ On June 6, 1906, the House Committee on
Agriculture was embroiled in a debate on what should be covered by
a bill on food safety. Everyone agreed that meat ``unfit'' for
human consumption should be banned. But what about something that
might not hurt a person but might be ``offensive to his ideas as to
what he will consume?'' The bill said food should be ``wholesome,''
a term meat industry executives wanted cut. Despite nearly a
century of legislation, regulations, investigations and exposes,
the debate that began on that day 94 years ago is still very much
alive. (Jaspin, Cox News Service).

   CHINA-EVICTIONS _ BEIJING _ Zhao Zhifeng and her extended family
have lived in their modest one-story house all their lives. In
fact, they've owned it going back 200 years, or seven generations.
But one morning in March, about 30 men showed up, she says,
accompanied by two bulldozers and police in plainclothes, and
turned most of their house to rubble. Across Beijing, city planners
have been demolishing traditional courtyard-style homes to make way
for high-rises and wider roads. In most cases, officials have
helped displaced residents find new homes at the edge of town and
given them a cash incentive to leave without protest. But in
extreme cases, like that of Zhao and her family, regulations are
flouted. Beijing is aggressively transforming itself into a
cosmopolitan metropolis, but can it afford the human cost? (Chao,

from an earlier, healthier theatrical time. Cats and Miss Saigon,

   DIMAGGIO-ATTORNEY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ 04 (56 inches,
developing): Morris Engelberg is the sole trustee of Joe DiMaggio's
will, but few attorneys identify so closely with their clients. For
that matter, the average attorney does not name his office plaza
``Yankee Clipper Center,'' spend $8,500 on a marble plaque
memorializing his most famous client outside the front door, or
drop another $2,300 to create museum-like rooms inside, with scores
of DiMaggio photographs and other memorabilia. When DiMaggio died
last year at his Hollywood, Fla., home at age 84, no one had more
control over his life than Engelberg. ``I'm obsessed,'' Engelberg
said. ``I admit it. He was like a father to me. My own father died
three months before I was born. As a child in New York, I used to
tell people Joe DiMaggio was my father.'' In fact, they never met
until DiMaggio reached the final two decades of his life, but the
attorney came to assume a powerful role in the slugger's final
years. That role would put him at odds with political leaders in
San Francisco, members of the Hollywood (Fla.) Chamber of Commerce
and DiMaggio's own brother Dom. (Elmore, Palm Beach Post). 56. ETA:

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his final visit to Moscow as president, Bill Clinton
arrived here Saturday to find Russia and its new leader, Vladimir
Putin, absorbed with domestic politics, a wrenching set of economic
reforms just getting under way and an unresolved war in Chechnya
that spawned Putin's political rise.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders dined Saturday night at the Kremlin palace,
where they were expected to air their views on a broad range of
topics, from anti-missile defense strategies to human rights
concerns over the war in the Caucasus. Formal negotiating sessions
will take place on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin shook hands and greeted each other, without
interpreters, and then proceeded to the third floor of Putin's
residence in the Kremlin for supper with top security aides and a
jazz concert described as a tribute to Louis Armstrong by one of
Russia's best-known bandleaders, Oleg Lundstrem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has come to a Russia that is relatively stable, poised
for economic recovery and more politically united _ though disputes
abound _ than at any time since the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. This is a sharp contrast with Clinton's most recent visits
here _ in 1996 when former President Boris Yeltsin was fighting for
his political life against an entrenched Communist opposition, and
in 1998 when the Russian ruble and much of the country's economy
had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Like a younger Bill Clinton (Clinton was 46 when he became
president eight years ago; Putin is 47), Putin has taken command of
the Kremlin with an apparent determination to focus on his
country's economic problems and other pressing domestic issues
while keeping things quiet on the foreign policy front. There,
America still looms as an enormous force in Russia's calculations
on everything from financial assistance and debt restructuring to
NATO expansion and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking agreement to modify a 1972 treaty and thus go
ahead with a national anti-missile defense; Russia has so far
refused.
</P>
<P>
   Right after his inauguration last month, Putin, a former KGB
officer, stirred liberal fears about his commitment to democracy
when heavily armed police raided the offices of a top news media
organization. On Sunday, Clinton will sit for a radio interview _
with live questions from the audience over the Internet _ on the
popular Ekho Moskvy station run by the media group in what is
intended as a gesture of support for the freedom of the press in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton will address the Russian Duma, or lower house
of parliament, which has formed a strong pro-reform, and pro-Putin
majority, since elections last December, though many battles over
land ownership, regional autonomy and national investment lie
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The economic reality that Russia faces was highlighted most
glaringly by Putin himself after he was named acting president on
New Year's Eve when Yeltsin resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reach the production level of Portugal and Spain, two
countries that are not known as leaders of the world economy,''
Putin said, ``it will take Russia approximately 15 years'' even
under optimistic growth assumptions of 8 percent a year. Only twice
in this century, he said, had Russia been so weak, ``after the
October Revolution in 1917, and in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, as a political unknown whose disposition to the Western
eye is somewhat dour, seems unlikely to achieve with Clinton the
easy-going ``Boris and Bill'' chemistry that dominated Yeltsin's
two terms. Putin seemed a little uncomfortable when the Japanese
prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, announced during an April summit
meeting in St. Petersburg that the two leaders would call each
other by their diminutive names, Yoshi and Volodya.
</P>
<P>
   Under Putin, still very much the man in the gray suit, a more
pragmatic and businesslike style prevails these days in the
Kremlin, though he has bonded in an openly friendly manner with
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin has betrayed a certain admiration for Clinton. When
the two leaders met last fall in New Zealand at a meeting of
Asian-Pacific leaders, Putin was still a novice prime minister,
whose popularity among Russians was soaring due to his resolute
prosecution of the war in Chechnya. Putin admitted to a group of
interviewers from the newspaper Kommersant that he was charmed by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that first meeting, he paid special attention to me,''
Putin said, referring to Clinton. ``He made a point of coming up to
me. We had been seated at different tables. We talked about
something for a while, and then he said, `Well, shall we go?' All
the heads of state lined up. And he and I walked together along
that corridor. We exited the hall to the sound of applause. I
appreciated this sign of special regard,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin will meet three more times this year, in July
in Okinawa at a meeting of the world's wealthiest nations, in New
York in September at the United Nations and in Brunei in November,
where the Asian Pacific leaders will gather once again.
</P>
<P>
   While clearly Putin has strong views, especially on NATO
expansion and on the restoration of Russian power and national
dignity in international affairs, he has shown great pragmatism in
avoiding confrontation with the West, where he says he sees
Russia's future as a European nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton adopted that theme on Friday, when he used a speech
accepting a prestigious European award to appeal to western
Europeans to admit Russia, eventually, to both NATO and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult problems facing Clinton in the
relationship is that both leaders know that history has assigned
them different time slots in different decades. Clinton is almost
at the end of his term, and Putin is just embarking on his. And
this difference may do more to define the psychology at this summit
meeting than any other factor. Clinton has come here seeking to
make progress on his proposal to build a system of national missile
defense that requires an agreement to amend the treaty banning such
nationwide systems signed by Moscow and Washington more than 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If accepted by Russia, the American proposal represents a
profound turning point from offensive to defensive strategies by
the world's two largest nuclear powers, one with the potential to
reignite an arms race and alienate China, whose small nuclear
arsenal would loose its deterrent credibility. Putin sent his
foreign minister to the United Nations last month to warn that
America's missile defense plans could destabilize three decades of
arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an interview with ``The NBC Nightly News'' just
before Clinton's arrival, Putin hinted that the United States and
Russia might collaborate on new ways to shoot down enemy missiles
soon after they were launched, and thus address the problems posed
by nuclear weapons being acquired by so-called rogue states.
Clinton says the United States seeks an anti-missile defense only
to address that threat, although the Russians and Chinese are
skeptical that this is the true purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin will certainly engage Clinton's arguments, the
Russian leader knows that he also has the luxury of waiting for the
next American president. That gives him an advantage over Clinton,
who is in a hurry to improve the final cornice work of his
presidency.

   On the domestic front, Putin has opened his term with a strategy
to strengthen federal power over Russia's vast region in
preparation for slogging economic reforms. He has also chastened or
bullied some of the country's most powerful oligarchs and launched
cogent tax reform proposals in hopes of establishing a level of
fiscal health in Russia that can outlive the current economic
boomlet that derives from high oil prices and a recovery among
export industries who profited from the massive devaluation of the
ruble in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has proposed legislation to gut and remake the upper house
of parliament, bolster the independence of the judiciary and weaken
the power of Russia's 89 governors. His proposals appear so
sweeping that his critics have attacked him for trying to recreate
the vertical power structure of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader's personal views on the subject have only
deepened those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, Russia was created as a
supercentralized state,'' he told interviewers this spring.
``That's practically laid down in its genetic code, its traditions
and the mentality of its people.''

POLICE BRACE FOR PROTESTS IN WINDSOR AND DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>

feces and squirt bottles.')

   DETROIT _ For the next three days, anyone wearing a mask in this
city or carrying gasoline in a portable container will go to jail.
And those in possession of just about anything that could cause a
disruption can expect intense police scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   This is Mayor Dennis Archer's response to human rights
campaigners who plan, starting on Sunday, to unleash the same kind
of protests that left Seattle with $2.5 million in damage last
December after a meeting of the World Trade Organization. In that
protest, demonstrators, some wearing gas masks, hurled Molotov
cocktails, rocks and excrement at delegates and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The protests planned here are directed at a three-day summit
being held across the Detroit River in downtown Windsor, Ontario.
Delegates from the Organization of American States, a coalition of
34 nations, are gathering to discuss ways to bolster trade in North
and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Archer hopes his new emergency ordinances will dissuade
protesters from even showing up. The police in Canada are bracing
for thousands of demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Both Detroit and Windsor, which are connected by the Ambassador
Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, are on edge because they
share North America's busiest border, with 12,000 vehicles crossing
every day. But customs and border officials on both sides said they
had no plans to close either entry point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw what happened in Seattle,'' said Greg Bowens, a
spokesman for Archer. ``In Seattle, the police were caught off
guard. We don't intend for that to happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups that plan to protest say the authorities are
overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're retirees, we're union members, we're students,'' said
Brent Patterson, an organizer for the Council of Canadians, a
public interest group. ``We're not a bunch of anarchists bent on
throwing rocks and breaking windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said many of the three busloads of protesters he had
signed up for the trip to Windsor from Toronto were afraid. How can
the police ``expect a positive, nonviolent protest when they're
creating a climate of fear?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site, Stop the OAS, says that ``thousands of people will
gather in Detroit/Windsor to nonviolently reclaim the streets and
creatively block access to the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the demonstrations will be comparatively
small. In Detroit, a labor union stronghold, protest groups have
failed to win the support of any major union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an international contingent of law enforcement agencies _
the Detroit police, the FBI, the U.S. Border Patrol, the Windsor
police, the Ontario Provincial Police and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police _ spent much of last week planning strategy. Bowens
said the Detroit police had conducted riot training and put 4,000
officers on call.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, while police officers in Detroit were trying to
quietly step up their presence at the border, visitors to the other
side were greeted by a formidable police presence. As drivers left
the tunnel, they were met by Ontario Provincial officers, who stood
like sentries at each lane.
</P>
<P>
   And the officers' presence was no less obvious around Windsor's
usually tranquil downtown. Officers stood on virtually every
corner. And they walked some streets six deep, in sunglasses and
bulletproof vests. Mayor Mike Hurst of Windsor vowed to have more
than 1,700 officers out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels so scary to see so many,'' said Yergalem Hagos of
Windsor, as she watched Canadian officers walk by her family's
restaurant. ``You don't know if it is better to stay open or to be
safe and shut down.'' A few shops nearby have nailed plywood to
their windows.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst said the lessons of Seattle had forced officials to be
cautious. ``We don't have the luxury of a crystal ball,'' he said.
``No one knows what will happen here or in Detroit. What I do know
is that they have a right to come here and peacefully protest and I
have the right to make sure we're prepared for anything.''

EVEN BENEFICIARIES OPPOSE PLAN TO REWARD TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was supposed to be a slam-dunk, a bold
aggressive play from a politician usually thought of as anything
but. Instead, Gov. Gray Davis' proposal to show support for
California's public school teachers by exempting them from state
income taxes has not been anywhere near the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders of both parties in both houses in Sacramento
oppose it as bad policy and the start of a slippery slope toward
similar demands from other public employees. Even the teachers'
unions, initially flattered, oppose the plan, which would reduce
the average experienced teacher's state tax by about $1,350 a year.
They say that it may leave them open to attacks from fellow
government workers and that they prefer salary increases instead.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about the only ringing endorsement has come from the
California Association of Highway Patrolmen, whose president, Mark
Muscardini, wrote Davis last week: ``Yes, we admit that our first
reaction was, `us too.' However, we would simply like to put our
own selfish interest aside long enough to express appreciation to
the teachers of California.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the proposal shows the pitfalls when policy
innovation meets interest-group politics, along with the enduring
difficulty of reaching consensus on how best to address the
problems of California's troubled schools, which once led the
nation by many measures but have drifted toward the bottom over the
last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, has repeatedly vowed to make education his
top priority, but he has come under increasing fire from fellow
Democrats and the state's biggest teachers' union for not moving
quickly enough to return California's per-pupil spending on
elementary and secondary education to something like the national
average. The teacher tax exemption was part of some $3 billion in
new spending for education that he proposed in his nearly $100
billion budget for the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis aides described the exemption as the first such peacetime
tax break for any occupation in American history and hatched it in
greatest secrecy, planning to make a national splash with an
announcement in Sunday newspapers last month. It won big national
headlines, but a Bronx cheer from the audience of politicians whose
support was required to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not a good idea to exempt people from paying taxes
based on their profession, because one's favorite is not somebody
else's favorite,'' said John Burton, the Democratic president pro
tem of the State Senate and an old-line liberal from San Francisco.
``Start with teachers and go to cops and firefighters, go to social
workers, go to emergency room docs and news reporters. It's a very
slippery slope.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor counter that the state tax code is already
full of some $14 billion in special expenditures and preferential
treatment, for homeowners, the elderly and other groups. Davis
vowed to ``fight for this puppy,'' and his advisers expressed
puzzlement that the idea of exempting teachers had fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, teachers are the only constituency group in
California that still wants to pay taxes,'' one state official said
dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' communications director, Philip Trounstine, said:
``What's appealing about it as an idea is that it makes a bold
statement, and the governor still believes this, both throughout
the state and across the country: that teaching is an extraordinary
profession and deserves extraordinary recognition and that in the
context of a shortage of perhaps 300,000 teachers over the next
decade and national competition to attract teachers to California,
this was a terrific way to let everyone know that teachers' work
was valued here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Johnson, president of the 500,000-member California
Teachers Association, the state's largest teachers' union, replied,
in essence, thanks but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're somewhat uncomfortable in saying, `We understand you're
really trying to help us, but we just don't care much for the
idea,''' Johnson said. He said a poll of the union's membership
found that the measure was opposed by 60 percent and that when
other elements of the proposal were explained (including the fact
that teachers' federal taxes would rise because they could no
longer deduct state income taxes), opposition rose to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers that I'm talking to are saying that if this
proposal is going to cost roughly $500 million a year,'' Johnson
said, ``then take the $500 million and put it into the education
budget up front and let us bargain for it. They seemed to be far
more in favor of that kind of approach. I've heard things like,
`Well this singles us out, it makes us a sacred cow, alienates fire
and police and other public employees.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, since teachers consistently argue for higher taxes to
support public education and finance bonds for school construction,
he said, they do not want to be in the position of winning special
tax breaks that others could criticize. And because the tax
exemption would not constitute a direct expenditure on education,
it would not be counted as part of the percentage of state spending
that, by law, must be devoted to education.
</P>
<P>
   Davis can be stubborn, and as the first Democrat to lead the
state in 16 years, with partisan majorities in both legislative
houses, he has been used to getting his way since taking office
last year. Efforts are under way in Sacramento to find some form of
compromise that would let the governor claim moral victory while
quietly burying his big idea.
</P>
<P>
   These include proposals like raising starting salaries for
teachers, providing tax credits to teachers who buy supplies for
school and making new bonuses tax-free for teachers in schools that
improve their academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to value teachers, as we all do, there's a way to
do it: give them more money,'' said Burton, the Senate Democratic
leader. ``Increase starting pay, or reimburse them for certain
expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the governor's thinking suggested that he
might find some sort of general tax credit for teachers acceptable,
perhaps one phased in with rewards based on experience.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jack O'Connell, a Democrat and former social studies
teacher from San Luis Obispo, on the central coast, sponsored a
bill that passed the Senate this week, aimed at increasing starting
teacher salaries to about $38,000 a year, from the present range of
$26,000 to $32,000. It would reimburse districts that raise
starting salaries and would cost about $325 million.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he thought that the governor was willing to
entertain various ways of achieving his goal of attracting and
retaining teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor is totally wedded to the idea of making
teaching more attractive,'' he said. ``I just don't believe he is
wedded to any one particular concept. He's a bottom-line guy.''

 &HT;    By the Grace of God and Dollie Cole
 &HT;    By Michael Corcoran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Miss Dollie Cole! Miss Dollie Cole! `` a
buzz-headed boy of about 15 says when the well-dressed,
well-coiffed woman in oversized black-and-gold-framed glasses steps
out of her Suburban. ``I love my watch, Miss Dollie Cole.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiles and heads toward the horse stable to check the
condition of a horribly bony horse, which had just been snatched
from a life of mistreatment in Arizona. Two more kids in crew cuts
look up from their job of feeding and watering down the pony.
``Miss Dollie Cole!'' they say. ``Miss Dollie Cole!''
</P>
<P>
   It is a name that Robert Ellis remembers hearing over and over
when, after five years as a counselor at Darden Hill in Dripping
Springs, he launched his own residential treatment center for boys
near Lockhart. It was early 1990 and Ellis found an early supporter
in Brian McCoy, whose McCoy Building Supply Centers donated
materials to erect Pegasus School on land about five miles out of
town. When he asked the community for more help, people kept
telling Ellis that he needed to talk to Dollie Cole, the
charity-minded Lockhart rancher and widow of former General Motors
President Edward Cole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just called her up cold and told her about my plans,'' says
Ellis. She heartily agreed with his belief that the best way to
break the cycle of abuse is to give troubled kids positive role
models, and said she'd be getting in touch with him. A few weeks
went by, however, and Ellis still hadn't heard back from Cole, so
he was wondering whether she'd given him the brushoff.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Miss Dollie Cole just drove up to the Pegasus
School towing a trailer full of desks, chairs, appliances and other
things the school would need before it opened in November1990. ``I
checked you out and heard good things, so I'll be helping you from
now on,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ellis and Cole have developed a mother-son
relationship. The 40-year-old Ellis even has to hide his cigarettes
from her. ``Dollie caught me smoking once in front of the boys and
she said, `Robert, you spend all your time and energy trying to
save these boys' lives; why do you want to show them how to kill
themselves?' '' By cashing in their pasts for the good of the
future, this unlikely pair has found a shared purpose and watched
enrollment at Pegasus soar from 15 to 97 boys.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the secondhand circuit with vigor, Cole completely
furnished Camp Pegasus, which opened in 1993 on land donated by
Austin's Robert Meyer. She bought three Capital Metro mini-buses to
transport the boys and pick up food and supplies and also gave
money as needed. Cole, who turned 70 May 13, also started getting
some of her oldest friends involved, including Redken founder Paula
Meehan, New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson and hotel heir Barron
Hilton. Meehan paid for a road to be built, Benson gave money for a
basketball court, and Hilton made sure the school and camp were
stocked with toiletries from the Hilton chain. The kids, most of
whom had never stayed in a hotel before, had never seen such small
bottles of shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the kids, she's the fairy godmother,'' says Ellis. ``It's
never `Miss Cole,' never `Miss Dollie.' Always `Miss Dollie Cole.'
'' The name has a rhythm that suggests buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   She good-naturedly credits ``a touch of insanity'' with
inspiring her move back to Texas in 1983. How else could a woman,
then 53, leap from the lap of luxury into the rugged life of a
rancher? She named her spread Briarpatch Ranch after the prickly
bush that Brer Rabbit kept finding himself being thrown into.
</P>
<P>
   Before she met Robert Ellis, the unsinkable Dollie Cole had a
dream of her own in Lockhart. She wanted to open a historical Texas
village that would educate and entertain schoolkids and history
buffs. She bought and hauled the old Luling train depot, the house
of the first doctor in Caldwell County, and even the
still-operational Fentress skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Dollie overestimated the demand of the public
to revisit the Texas of old, and the Embassy closed in 1993. In May
1996, Pegasus offices moved into the village, and Dollie donated
300 acres south of Lockhart so Ellis and the boys could open Camp
Comanche and Cole Ranch, expanding the number of residents to 97.
The only problem was that the new locations, which included
administration offices, were seven miles from the Pegasus School.
So the plan is to close the original two campuses and move the
entire Pegasus operation to a central location on Cole Ranch. Ellis
expects the new Pegasus School to be completed in time for the 10th
anniversary celebration in November.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis credits his closeness with Cole to ``an absolute mutual
respect for what each other has accomplished on their own.''
They've found common ground in Lockhart, but the duo arrived there
through completely different paths. Ellis grew up poor in Lockhart,
suffering nightly beatings and sexual abuse from an alcoholic
stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while trying to escape the drunkard's wrath through a
narrow fence opening, Robert got stuck and his stepfather jumped on
the 12-year-old's leg and broke it in two places. Authorities sent
Ellis to a home for boys, but eight months later he was returned
home.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached 13, Ellis had had enough. ``My stepfather just
started whaling on me in the car one night, punching me in the face
while he drove, and I just opened the door and rolled out with the
car going.'' Ellis, whose name was originally Hill, ended up at the
doorstep of his best friends, Carl and Earl Ellis. Eventually the
Ellis family adopted Robert, who took his rage out on opposing
quarterbacks as a defensive end for the Lockhart High School team.
</P>
<P>
   But where some battered boys turn to crime, Ellis was able to
right himself because of what he calls ``an all-encompassing belief
in God. Even at a young age, in the midst of all that abuse, I felt
that someone was watching over me.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven years working for a demolition company right out of
high school, Ellis attended the University of Texas with the
intention of becoming an English teacher. Instead, destiny took him
to a job as camp counselor at the now-defunct Darden Hill
residential treatment center for emotionally disturbed boys. ``I
knew that this was what I wanted to do, but I wanted to do it a
little bit differently than they way they did it at Darden Hill,''
Ellis said. ``I wanted to start a place that was more about
positive reinforcement and less about discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the year Ellis was brought into the world by a single
mother, a Fort Worth rancher's daughter named Dollie Cole became
queen of Detroit, marrying General Motors President Edward N. Cole.
``As a rule, auto executives' wives tend to be relatively
anonymous,'' says Charlotte Craig, who covered the auto business
for the Detroit Free Press for 21 years. ``But that wasn't Dollie.
She was more flamboyant and outspoken than the rest, and she was
admired by some and resented by others because she stood out.''
</P>
<P>
   While married, Dollie wrote articles for the Saturday Evening
Post and eventually became a senior editor at the Post's parent
company, Curtis Publications. But even as she strived for her own
identity, Dollie says that ``my top priority was to be Mrs. Edward
Cole.'' When he died on May 2, 1977, after the British Beagle
aircraft he piloted ran into bad weather and crashed, Dollie was
devastated. ``I had to stay strong for (my son) Nick, though,'' she
says. ``He was only 10 years old when it happened, so helping him
through the tragedy became my focus.'' Dollie's three children from
her previous marriage to a Naval officer were adopted by Cole, but
they had already moved on to their careers by the time of the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   After years racing Corvettes, the car his father developed, Nick
Cole currently manages Dollie's expansive ranch, where the Coles
raise more than 40 racehorses, as well as the abandoned pets that
are often tossed over the ranch fence.
</P>
<P>
   She owns the desk Gen. McArthur used in the Philippines, but by
far the piece of furniture Dollie Cole values most is her husband's
old desk from when he was General Motors president from 1967 to
1975. She bought it after he retired and surprised him with it when
she redecorated his home office. Unable to part with the castle of
her own Camelot, Dollie kept the Michigan mansion, built and
designed by her husband, for 20 years after his death, though she
rarely stayed there. Finally, it got too expensive, with a tax bill
of $40,000 a year and rising upkeep costs, so Dollie sold her house
of memories two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the smartest man I ever met,'' Dollie says of the
automobile innovator who landed on the cover of Time magazine in
1959 after he designed the Corvair, America's first economy car.
She went to Stanford (majoring in special education), but Dollie
says, ``The best education I got was being married to Ed Cole. He
included me in everything. He taught me the auto business.''
</P>
<P>
   She's had quite a life, and nothing tells the story of her past
better than the walls of her eccentrically decorated house. Photos
of Dollie's young adult life as a glamour gal, modeling in ads for
Dr Pepper and winning the 1950 Miss West pageant, share wall space
with pictures of her with such world leaders as Margaret Thatcher,
Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater, George Bush and John Glenn. Her
best friends from the world of entertainment are also represented,
including Jim Nabors (``like a brother''), Phyllis Diller and
Florence Henderson. Her pal A.J. Foyt (``the greatest race car
driver who ever lived'') smiles back from several snapshots, and
from the business sector, there are pictures of Dollie with
manufacturing kingpin Rick Bowen (whose 70th birthday gift to
Dollie was a check for $10,000 to Pegasus).
</P>
<P>
   But don't call her a socialite. ``I hate that word,'' Dollie
says. ``To me a socialite is someone who wears expensive clothes
and jewelry and shows up at charity events to be seen. They might
not even know what the cause is. But I've never been someone who
just shows up and writes a check. I need to be in the trenches,
where the real work is.'' Busy'' describes Cole's schedule about as
meagerly as ``forceful'' does a Shaquille O'Neal dunk. She sits on
several boards, including Project HOPE, is chair of the National
Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Ky., and is vice chair of the
Smithsonian's Air &AMP; Space Museum. She travels so often that Nanci
Falley, her personal assistant for the past 14 years (and a fellow
ranch owner), is the president of the board of Pegasus School, so
she can sign off on items when Dollie's out of town.
</P>
<P>
   There always seems to be enough time, however, to go out
trolling for something useful or unusual to buy. ``When I first met
Dollie, she said, `I don't drink and I don't smoke,' '' Ellis
recalls. `` `The only vice I have is auctions.' Boy, is that the
truth. Just last week Dollie bought four big gymnasium scoreboards
at an auction, then she spent all this time on the phone trying to
find someone who needed one.''
</P>
<P>
   A firm believer in creating beauty from the discarded, Cole
built her house piecemeal, using lumber she salvaged from the
Lockhart Cotton Compress. The finishing touch (at least for now),
is a Wendy's restaurant that Dollie bought at auction and had
hauled from Ben White to her ranch. After it sat in a field for two
years, Cole finally attached it to her house and uses the room to
entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sheehan of the Gaston &AMP; Sheehan auction house in
Pflugerville said the regulars get a big kick out of the elegant
Dollie, ``until she starts bidding on something they want,'' he
said. ``She's a super person, but she can be real shrewd and hard
as nails.'' The local bidding brigade knows that when Dollie sees
something that the school could use _ from bulldozers to
blackboards _ she'll go all out to get it. Another cause
well-served by Cole's auction addiction are the volunteer fire
departments in towns surrounding Lockhart. Dollie has provided
several firetrucks to towns, which repay the cost with no interest.
</P>
<P>
   It's Pegasus, however, that is foremost in Dollie's charitable
mind, and when she hears that a graduating senior had to scramble
for a cap and gown, she wishes she had been in town to help. Under
a sign that says ``Thou Shalt Not Whine,'' John B. thanks all his
teachers and staff of Pegasus and Miss Dollie Cole. ``I'm sorry for
some of the things I've done in the past, but I wouldn't trade my
experiences here for all the money in the world,'' he says, as his
grandmother weeps and hugs his sister. ``You were with me when I
was down and with me during the good times,'' he says to his
classmates. In the back of the room stands a group of Pegasus
``Colts,'' who at ages 9 to 13 look too young to be returning to
barrack-style dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the extreme example of latchhkey kids,'' Ellis says of
the Colts. ``In most cases their parents are too busy getting drunk
or taking drugs to care for their kids, so they're out running in
the streets at age 6,7,8.''
</P>
<P>
   John's the only one who graduated from the Pegasus School campus
this year, because most residents stay only about 18 months, or
when the money from their home counties runs out. Ellis says the
cost per kid is between $2,500 and $3,000 a month, most of which
goes to pay the staff of 85.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the drawbacks of the system is that we can fix a kid,
but then he'll often go back to the same broken environment,'' says
Ellis, who knows from experience. ``I look at what some of these
kids have gone through, and it seems like my life was Disneyland in
comparison. Some of them have never owned a toothbrush. They've
never been taught hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   To give these forgotten children a better sense of self-worth, a
big part of their therapy is helping to revive distressed animals.
``It's great to feel needed,'' says Pegasus chief administrator
Mark Lowman, who followed Ellis from Darden Hill, along with
several other key personnel. ``The animals give these kids an
incredible amount of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis shows a photo of a teen (though his face is not shown per
the school's confidentiality policy) feeding a crippled piglet with
a baby bottle. ``This kid came to us in shackles, being led by two
officers,'' he says. ``He had so much anger and rage inside him
that the cops were afraid he'd attack them. But once he started
working with animals, we started seeing a new kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the residents in the Pegasus system are from the inner
city. They've never communed with nature before, but they learn to
camp, rock-climb and canoe. Several 16- and 17-year-olds even built
an Indian sweat lodge, where they are led in chants by counselor
John Sergent, who has performed tribal ceremonies with the Lakota
Indians for five years. And every year a group of Pegasus kids
earns a camping trip to Colorado through their good behavior and
grades. They're such a polite, hard-working bunch that you'd never
guess that, according to Ellis' estimates, 90 percent of the boys
had been sexually abused and all of them had been in trouble with
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Judging the recidivism rate by how many kids don't end up in
jail or prison, on probation or in other restrictive settings five
years after their stay at Pegasus, Ellis estimates that the program
is successful in about 80 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis says that wayward kids truly do want some structure, some
guidance in their lives. Every morning the boys rise at 7 a.m. and
tackle one of 20 daily chores.
</P>
<P>
   Amen, says Dollie Cole, who's always preferred sweat to
champagne. ``God never meant this world to be easy,'' she says.
``If you don't spend your life trying to make it better for others,
then you're really missing out on a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to derail the cycle of abuse, Robert Ellis told her
in that out-of-the-blue phone call 10 years ago, is to expose
troubled kids to role models worth following.
</P>
<P>
   For Edward Cole's funeral, which was held at Detroit's St.
Francis School for Boys, one of the couple's favorite charities,
Dollie wrote a letter ``To My Children'' and signed it Edward Cole.
An actor friend read it at the service, and although Dollie has a
copy of the letter framed on her wall, she can't bear to read it.
It's just too sad to remember that time in her life. Instead, she
lives the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give, don't take, for happiness is giving,'' was one passage.
It's the philosophy that guides Dollie Cole in all the good that
she does. Don't call her a socialite. Robert Ellis certainly
wouldn't.

 &HT;    Historic route along Mississippi a story of extremes
 &HT;    By Rheta Grimsley Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALONG THE RIVER ROAD, La. _ Save your breath. This well-tramped
path defies description.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing subtle about the River Road _ nothing subtle or
common or middle-class or in-between. It is paved with extremes.
</P>
<P>
   The River Road _ not really one road at all but several _ is the
historic route between Baton Rouge and New Orleans along both sides
of the Mississippi River. At any given point through your car
window, the scenery is either dramatically rich or pitifully poor,
breathtakingly beautiful or terribly tacky. It is excess and want,
neglect and care, industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The River Road rolls through half a dozen parishes and a
multitude of towns with musical names: Gramercy and Vacherie,
Carville and Reserve, Plaquemine, Donaldsonville, White Castle and
Convent. It subdivides some of the richest land known to man, rich
both agriculturally and rich with oil. Then, of course, there's the
logistical cherry on top: It is situated next to one of the
nation's mightiest thoroughfares, the wet way to market, the
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Once this was the heart of Louisiana's sugar cane and cotton
plantation country. Now the petrochemical industry rules.
</P>
<P>
   But experts warn that oil reserves are playing out. Who knows
what we'll find a decade from now on Louisiana's River Road?
</P>
<P>
   Today there's no question what you'll find in the slow drive
down from Baton Rouge to the Big Easy. You'll find color. Riotous
color. A vine-wrapped little church posts the commandment ``Thou
Shalt Not Kill'' right beside its front door. A satellite dish
blooms in front of a century-old shotgun house.
</P>
<P>
   There are antebellum mansions in every stage of upkeep and
neglect, with tours 10 to 5, or No Trespassing signs. In fact signs
of all kinds are everywhere: Bill's Bail Bonds. Po Boys Served
Daily. Get Us Out of the United Nations. Repent!
</P>
<P>
   Cemeteries full of Catholic aristocrats and ornate shrines are
chockablock to ugly refineries, and industrial conveyors crisscross
the road like a hungry octopus' tentacles. Majestic live oaks shade
hubcap emporiums, and fine French lace hangs in the wavy windows of
gentrified cottages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The River Road is a study in juxtaposition that the modern age
has supplied,'' author Richard Sexton says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a reflection of ourselves, and what we feel is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   With his gorgeous book _ ``Vestiges of Grandeur: The Plantations
of Louisiana's River Road'' (Chronicle Books, $40) _ Sexton does
what no photographer really has done since Clarence John Laughlin
shot the derelict plantation homes half a century ago. ``Ghosts
Along the Mississippi'' is a classic and its creator, Laughlin,
``the predecessor I had to lurk in the shadow of,'' Sexton says.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton, 46, is an Atlanta native who grew up in small-town
Colquitt in Miller County. His family lived in a house just off the
courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   Young Richard graduated from Emory University in political
science, but while in college he also bought his first camera, a
Nikon F. That purchase changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Sexton moved to San Francisco, where he went to the Art
Institute for a spell. He began a notable career as a photographer
of architecture, interiors and gardens, or, as he puts it, ``the
human condition framed by architecture.'' In 1991, he moved back
home, to the South, to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't his first visit to that thrumming town. En route to
South America as a teenager, he had driven his Datsun to New
Orleans, his first stop after Colquitt. The city had impressed him
then, but he missed a few dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relocating to New Orleans was a move to a new and exotic city
and a return to the familiar climate and terrain of the Gulf
South,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The return seems predestined. Though he has numerous books to
his credit, Sexton's Louisiana photography is exceptionally
organic. He writes about the ``swampy infinity'' of the River Road
as if he grew up here, and nobody packs such a wallop with a shot
of cracked ceiling plaster.
</P>
<P>
   He knew about the River Road plantations _ that some had been
``prettied up too much and some had gone to seed'' _ but hesitated
to tackle the well-traveled theme. But after he finished the photo
essay book ``New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence,'' Sexton decided
to put his stamp on the River Road subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   He'll tell you he has tandem desires. To shoot compelling,
artistic images, but only the ones that document a particular place
and a particular time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell stories with photos,'' he says. We are seated in his
New Orleans studio on Dauphine Street near the French Quarter. His
old Creole cottage is the color of mustard. In the courtyard behind
us pink impatiens overflow a pot. The streets are steamy, and the
whole world seems one big photo essay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Colquitt when I was growing up, we didn't have art museums
and galleries. But in our home we did get all the big picture
magazines _ Life and Look. That was really my inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton was met with ``some reticence'' when he asked permission
to photograph the plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the owners are not proud of the condition of the
houses,'' he says. (Petroleum companies own many of them.)
</P>
<P>
   But Sexton stressed he was searching for ``the inherent beauty
still within.'' He began shooting any surviving vestiges of the
historic River Road, from the perfectly restored houses to rubble.
He steadfastly refused to be judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book represents as flattering a view of the landscape as
one can take,'' he insists. And that claim seems true, even when
blue sky shows through a collapsed ceiling of a neglected parlor
filled with ruined antiques, or a fine old home is dwarfed by
smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   There were many examples of both ``corporate responsibility and
lack thereof,'' he says. But the petrochemical companies that now
wield the power on the River Road are not the entire picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic vitality is a national story, along with the
evolution of land use. One of the most dramatic evolutions that's
ever occurred was here. And it's not over. The oil reserves will be
depleted and the landscape will morph into something else, maybe go
back to nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton hopes agriculture will survive in some form along the
River Road. Growing up in South Georgia gave him an appreciation
for the family farm, and he rues the fact that each year fewer
Americans claim agribusiness as a livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   But any wide open spaces along the River Road are long gone,
vanished. Any time a petrochemical company chooses a new site, it's
got to be at the expense of something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``A historic building will be torn down, a Native American
burial site disturbed . . .''
</P>
<P>
   At book signings along the River Road, Sexton sometimes heard in
person from the owners of his architectural subjects. Most comments
were approving. Owners of the once-grand homes still felt ``some
sort of pride, no matter how tainted by the condition,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still see in this something positive, that vestige of
grandeur.''

 &HT;    Yoel Levi: The exit interview
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some things never change in the Yoel Levi clan. The
family still scavenges for pets in the woods near its Sandy Springs
home and gives them names like Egmont (from the Beethoven overture)
and Berlioz. Oldest son Eyal, 21, is still into long hair and heavy
metal. And the maestro, in his final days as conductor of the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, remains as enigmatic as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Like another lame duck baby boomer, President Clinton, Levi
seems to have no idea what he's going to do next. He recently lost
his cell phone. He's never bothered to get on the Internet. He is
being managed by a Dutch talent agency. But this much is certain:
As he kicks off the monumental cycle of Beethoven concerts marking
the end of his 12-year tenure with the ASO, he is holding true to
his essential self: kind-mannered, yet emotionally cloistered,
bittersweet but determined not to show it _ a picture of
undiminished pride, egotism and musical vigor.
</P>
<P>
   How history will deal with Levi is an open question. Only 49, he
could end up a globe-trotting orchestra builder, the Jimmy Carter
of classical music. Or he might be remembered as a political
bungler _ paranoid, misunderstood, yet ultimately hallowed, like
Richard Nixon. On this day, Levi sits stiffly through a lunch at
his restaurant of choice, then sticks on his best Bill Clinton
smile for a photo shoot at a nearby Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a stylish, European-cut gray suit, a black mock
turtleneck and an up-to-the-minute Nike joggers' watch, he is at
first resistant to talk about much of anything _ his personal life,
his future, even his beloved Beethoven. ``People are always asking
me, `What are you going to do? What is your next job?' They don't
understand: You don't need to have a job as a permanent conductor.
You can just do guest conducting.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to put a positive spin on his exit, he refuses to
dwell much on the controversy surrounding his dismissal. Yet he is
quick to point up the need for a new Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he surrenders to the childlike flights of fancy that
have characterized him in the past, going off on a riff about the
``special breed of musical flies'' that appear when he's onstage at
Symphony Hall. And he proudly shows off a program from his middle
son Amir's recent Atlanta International School production, where
the graduating senior staged a music and dance revue that included
his older brother and family friend Amber Boardman, whom the Levis
have taken under their wing.
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened backstage after your Mahler concerts a couple
of weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``First of all, there were a lot of people, a lot, every
night. It was very tense, very emotional. People were crying and
couldn't hold back. Thank God, I hold my ground, because I really
don't like to lose my composure. But people are very sincere, very
emotional, very thankful. There was an old lady in my room who I'd
never met. She asked me if I would forgive them (the ASO board that
fired him). I said: `It's OK. Everything is fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel like you have made your peace with the
organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I think so, and there is no question that I will always be
grateful for the role of (recently departed board chairman) A.D.
Frazier for making things happen and trying to heal this community.
I will always consider him a personal, dear friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And have you achieved what you set out to do here?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Yes, anyone who listens to our records, 30 records, will
hear that this is incredibly, truly a great-sounding orchestra, and
I hope that's what is going to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: As you say goodbye, what do you want to say to the community?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Thank you. (He pauses as if that's all he has to say.)
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's more than thank you. It's a community I can't thank
enough for their support. The support they have shown me is
something I will never forget. It is something that has never
happened in the history of U.S. orchestras. I don't know if it will
ever happen again. But it's something that means a lot to me, the
support, the letters, the way they react every time I step on the
podium _ it's something I will always take with me in my heart, and
I will always be very grateful for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And to the musicians?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I will thank them for everything they have done for me _
all the wonderful concerts, recordings, tours, for working hard and
rising to the occasion every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And to the board?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I would thank them for everything they have done for this
organization, because at the end of the day, you cannot do it alone
and you need help. I just thank them for the opportunity they gave
me. I only gave my best. Now the responsibility belongs to someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What advice do you have for new music director Robert Spano?
</P>
<P>
   A: (He laughs) ``Ah? Advice? I don't know. Just to make great
music. He's getting a very precious instrument in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: He has said so publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``And I really appreciate that. If people think it's the same
orchestra I got when I came here, they have a very short memory or
a lack of understanding or are practically ignorant. Or deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ASO President Allison Vulgamore said recently that she
regretted the decision not to renew the tenure of the six musicians
(which ultimately led to the musicians strike of 1996). Do you have
any regrets?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Maybe. You can always look back at things and say, `Well,
maybe I would have done it differently here or differently there.
There is no point in going back, because you cannot change what
happened in the past. You have to go forward. But you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you offer a better explanation of why your relationship
with the ASO did not work out?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I think every relationship has a life. I only know what I
did. I did my best to bring this orchestra to where I promised I
would bring it from Day One... This is what I did. I cannot comment
for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you glad you stayed these last two years?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Absolutely, absolutely. Except even now, they still have a
gap of one year that there's almost no one there. Who knows what
would have happened? But in any case, I am very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's lacking in Atlanta's cultural life?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The commitment, the vision. I mean, we have been talking
about a new concert hall for how many years? Since Day One that I
arrived here. And yes, there is a moment again, so I believe in
this coming decade probably something will happen, but why does it
have to take so long? The resources are here. It's one of the
richest cities in America. . . . Obviously, it's not on the
priority list. It's sad. Atlanta is really behind almost any other
city in having a first-class facility, whether you look at Dallas
or Baltimore or St. Louis or Pittsburgh. Wherever you look! They
have a better facility than here in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will it take to change that?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I don't know. If people don't have enough reasons up to
this moment, then they will never have enough reasons. It's about
how much they really care, truly care about how Atlanta is
portrayed in the world. That's the bottom line. They can tell you,
`Oh, we are really proud. We really care.' But do they really care?
If they really cared about the cultural ambition of this city, we
would have had here a great concert hall five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you be willing to help raise money for a new hall?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I can always try to help. I cannot guarantee what people
will do. I let them always use my name for anything they need, and
I do not see why they cannot use it in the future. As long as our
relationship continues, I will be very happy to help. I rarely say
no to anything. But there's only so much I can do after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you pick Beethoven for your last concerts?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``To do a marathon of this nature, very few people have ever
done it. Ever. Period. Very few people have the talent or the
capability or the understanding to do it. For me, to do all the
Beethoven symphonies and concertos in two weeks, it's one of the
highest musical achievements that anyone can really dream of.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the orchestra, Beethoven is one of the most difficult
things. You are exposed. You cannot hide. You have to produce true
quality. This is a marathon for everyone, not only for me, but for
each musician. . . . Who knows if they will ever have this
challenge again?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have anything new to say with it intellectually?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``There's always new things about Beethoven. You always find
a different way to do it, a different experience, a different
meaning. And you accomplish it in the rehearsals and hopefully it
comes alive in the concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are you not doing the Missa Solemnis?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We just don't have time. I did the Missa Solemnis a few
years ago, and this was something very special. That was the only
time I worked with Robert Shaw. He prepared the chorus and it was a
very special time with him, talking about the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: He loved to talk about it!
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Yeah, and he told me the last time he had prepared the
Missa Solemnis was for Toscanini, and I told him how much I really
appreciated it. I will never forget what he has done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you must be taking a long vacation after these concerts?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No, I have to go to Florence. I will be doing Puccini's
`The Girl of the Golden West.' I will be a month there.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else is on your plate this season?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I want to take some time off. I really need it. This will
be the first time in over 20 years that I can have a little bit of
time off to do things, to read, relax, travel, do what I want, look
at the world a little bit differently. That's what I am going to do
next year. I will still conduct from time to time, but I will not
be pushing myself to run from one place to the next. I want to
spend time with my young one (Daniel, 10), the only one that is
going to be home now.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you are going to be working more in Europe
than America.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Maybe in the short term I am going to dedicate myself more
to projects in Europe. But in the long term my future will be here
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the long term, do you want to be music director of another
major U.S. orchestra?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Sure. Eventually. Maybe not now, but eventually. I have
proven to myself that I can take an orchestra at a certain level
and change them and create a great orchestra, so I believe I can do
it anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But if it's a second-tier orchestra, you will not go there?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No, I will not go there. But I can always take any level of
orchestra and make them absolutely one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you want to be known as The Orchestra Doctor?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, not really. That's the role of any conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's one of the funniest things that's ever happened to you
onstage?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I don't know that anyone knows that we are developing a
very special breed of musical flies at the concert hall. This is a
very funny phenomenon. Sometimes they interfere with the
conducting. As a matter of fact, I must tell you that at one of my
last concerts, the Mahler, it sat on my right hand in the middle of
the piece. During the rehearsal, when we see the fly, I say, `Oh,
he's back! He likes Mahler!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when the musicians see a quick movement from me that
was not meant to be, then they realize it was a fly. At one point
it even sat on my baton in the middle of a concert. I could not
believe it: On the end of the baton was a fly! Sometimes I tell the
musicians: `Whoever destroys the fly gets a bonus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that the end is here, you seem OK with it.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Change is something good for you. There is no question that
I am a much stronger person than I have ever been in my life,
wiser, more experienced, and I am very happy what the future will
bring to me. There's a saying in the Jewish tradition: When God
closes one door, he opens another door. Look, a man should be happy
with what he's blessed with. As long as you have your health, your
talent, your family _ not necessarily in that order _ as long as
you have these ingredients, there is no reason to look back.''

   MIAMI _ Havana, sometime before 1994: As dusk descends on the
quaint seaside village of Guanabo, two young men kick a soccer ball
back and forth and back and forth across the sand. The tall one,
Joel Ruiz, is black. The short, wiry one, Achmed Valdes, is white.
</P>
<P>
   They are the best of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, January 2000: Valdes is playing soccer, as he does every
Saturday, with a group of light-skinned Latinos in a park near his
apartment. Ruiz surprises him with a visit, and Valdes, flushed and
sweating, runs to greet him. They shake hands warmly.
</P>
<P>
   But when Valdes darts back to the game, Ruiz stands off to the
side, arms crossed, looking on as his childhood friend plays the
game that was once their shared joy. Ruiz no longer plays soccer.
He prefers basketball with black Latinos and African-Americans from
his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The two men live only four miles apart, not even 15 minutes by
car. Yet they are separated by a far greater distance, one they say
they never envisioned back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to the
white one, they have grown apart in the United States because of
race. For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of
their skin defines the outlines of their lives _ where they live,
the friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what
they eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I am here and he is over there,'' Ruiz said. ``And
we can't cross over to the other's world.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that they were unaware of their difference in color
while growing up in Cuba's mix of black and white. Fidel Castro may
have decreed an official end to Cuba's long history of racism, but
that does not mean racism has simply gone away. Still, color was
not what defined them. Nationality, they had been taught, meant far
more than race. They felt, above all, Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America, Ruiz still feels Cuban. But above all he feels
black. His world is a black world, and to live there is to be
constantly conscious of race. He works in a black-owned bar, dates
black women, goes to an African-American barber. White barbers, he
says, ``don't understand black hair.'' He generally avoids white
neighborhoods, and when his world and the white world intersect, he
feels always watched, and he is always watchful.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who is 29, a year younger than his childhood friend, is
simply, comfortably Cuban, an upwardly mobile citizen of the Miami
mainstream. He lives in an all-white neighborhood, hangs out with
white Cuban friends and goes to black neighborhoods only when his
job, as a deliveryman for Restonic mattresses, forces him to. When
he thinks about race, which is not very often, it is in terms
learned from other white Cubans: American blacks, he now believes,
are to be avoided because they are delinquent and dangerous and
resentful of whites. The only blacks he trusts, he says, are those
he knows from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Havana on separate rafts in 1994, the two friends
have seen each other just a handful of times in Miami _ at a
funeral, a baby shower, a birthday party and that soccer game, a
meeting arranged for a newspaper photographer. They have visited
each other's homes only once.
</P>
<P>
   They say they remain as good friends as ever, yet they both know
there is little that binds them anymore but their memories. Had
they not become best friends in another country, in another time,
they would not be friends at all today.
</P>
<P>
   GROWING UP IN CUBA
</P>
<P>
   They met on a bus, No. 262, the one that took Joel from his home
in the racially mixed neighborhood of Penas Altas to middle school,
35 minutes away. Achmed got on in Guanabo, and they sat together
talking, as boys do, about everything and nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Both grew up in orderly homes, with hard-working parents who
supported the Castro government. Their fathers worked for the state
oil company. Their mothers _ Joel's was a nurse, Achmed's an
administrator in stores for tourists _ knew each other and
sometimes met for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' friendship was cemented through school and sport. They
stood up for each other against troublemakers. ``Just to know we
were there for each other was good,'' Ruiz recalls.
</P>
<P>
   When Joel's girlfriend got pregnant in high school, Achmed was
the first person he told. They played soccer and baseball and ran
track. Joel often stayed for dinner at Achmed's, where there was a
color television and an antenna powerful enough to pick up American
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her job, Achmed's mother had access to some of
Havana's best restaurants. Every year she would take him out for a
birthday dinner, and every year he would invite his best friend,
Joel. ``I couldn't think of anybody I would rather spend my time
with,'' Valdes recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But as they grew older, each became restless with the
limitations of life in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Achmed was in sixth grade when an aunt who had fled to Venezuela
gave him a pair of white sneakers. He loved them so, he immediately
wore them to school. Almost as immediately, the principal visited
him at home to warn him about the troubling political implications
of those foreign sneakers. At the university, too, his professors
wondered why he wore foreign clothes and rode a nice bicycle. He
wondered right back why he could not wear and ride whatever he
wanted. When he was expelled for failing two classes, he saw it as
punishment for being politically incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Achmed found work at sea, trapping lobsters and
selling them for $4 each. In a country where most people earn less
than $10 a month, it was a living, though not a life. When the
government allowed thousands of Cubans to leave in small boats and
rafts in 1994, he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Joel was ready, too, though it had taken him far
longer to make up his mind. Indeed, given Cuba's racial history, it
is hardly surprising that black Cubans have generally been far less
eager than whites to flee to America. After all, in
pre-revolutionary Cuba, blacks and whites had lived largely
segregated, separated by huge disparities in economic and social
standing. But two months after seizing power in 1959, Fidel Castro
ordered whites to look upon blacks as equals and began leveling the
economic and educational playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Joel was very small, his family lived crammed into one room
of an old carved-up mansion. Soon, the government gave them a
three-bedroom apartment in a development that Joel's father had
helped build. Before the revolution, Joel's mother had made a
living cleaning white people's homes. It was Fidel, she told him
over and over, who had given her the chance to become a nurse. And
so Joel came to believe that it was no big deal, being black in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As for America, he had seen the images on government television:
guards beating black prisoners, the police loosing dogs or training
hoses on civil-rights marchers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cuba's economy fell apart in the 1990s, he began to see
things differently. He left military school for a cooking program,
hoping for a well-paying job at a tourist hotel. But once he
graduated, the only job available was washing windows. Look around,
co-workers told him, look who's getting the good jobs. The answer
was whites.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed, too, when he watched the American channels at
Achmed's house, that some blacks seemed to live well in America. He
saw black lawyers, politicians, wealthy athletes. It made him
think: ``It's not so bad over there. Blacks are all right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1994, Ruiz boarded a raft and made for Florida. Like
his friend before him, he was intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard
and sent to the U.S. base at Guantanamo, Cuba. The next year, they
were freed _ first Valdes, then Ruiz _ and they headed straight to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A SHOCK OF IDENTITY
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Joel Ruiz discovered a world that neither American
television nor communist propaganda had prepared him for. Dogs did
not growl at him and police officers did not hose him. But he felt
the stares of security guards when he entered a store in a white
neighborhood and the subtle recoiling of white women when he walked
by.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is deeply segregated, and when Ruiz arrived, he settled
into one of the black urban sections, Liberty City. He had family
there. His uncle Jorge Aranguren had arrived in 1980 and married an
African-American. Ruiz took a job at his uncle's liquor store and
started learning English.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Ruiz noticed about his new world was the absence
of whites. He had seen barrios in Havana with more blacks than
others, but he had never lived in a place where  &UR; everybody &LR;  was
black. Far from feeling comfortable, he yearned for the mixing he
had known in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, he says, he had been taught to see skin color _ in his
case, the color of chocolate milk _ as not much more important
than, say, the color of his eyes. But this was not Cuba. This was
Miami, and in Miami, as the roughly 7 percent of the area's Cubans
who are black quickly learn, skin color easily trumps nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz began to understand that in earnest on Valentine's Day
1996, three months after his arrival in Miami. He had gone to
dinner with his uncle Ramon Suarez at Versailles, a popular
restaurant in Little Havana, a bastion of white Cuban-Americans.
They took three light-skinned girlfriends along. Ruiz wore one of
his nicest outfits _ black jeans and a red-and-green checked shirt.
He was new to the country and unsure how to behave, but he felt
comfortable at Versailles. After all, he remembers thinking, he was
among Cubans. He knew the food, he could read the menu, and he
could talk to the waiters.
</P>
<P>
   The five sat in the back. Ruiz concentrated on the conversation
and on his meal. More than four years later, he remembers what he
ate: a breaded steak with rice and beans and fried plantains.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight, the five left in a new red Nissan. One
of the women drove. Suarez sat next to her, taking pictures of his
nephew and the other women laughing in back. Twenty blocks from the
restaurant, four police cars, lights flashing and sirens wailing,
stopped them. The woman who was driving saw them first and yelled
for Suarez to drop the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, with weapons drawn, ordered them out of the car.
Terrified, Ruiz did as he was told, spreading his legs and leaning
face down on the car as the officers frisked him. It seemed like a
very long time before they were allowed to go.
</P>
<P>
   That was when one officer, a white Cuban-American, said
something in Spanish that forever changed Ruiz's perspective on
race. ``I've been keeping an eye on you for a while,'' Ruiz recalls
the officer saying. ``Since you were in the restaurant. I saw you
leave and I saw so many blacks in the car. I figured I would check
you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz and his uncle stood speechless until an African-American
officer approached them, apologized and sent them on their way.
Afterward, his uncle said he was sure the police had been called by
restaurant patrons uncomfortable with Ruiz's racially mixed group.
His English teacher, an African-American, told him that white
police officers liked to single out blacks driving red cars. Ruiz
is not sure what to believe, but the truth is not in the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until that day, I thought all Cubans were the same,'' he
says. ``It took a while to sink in, but that incident made me start
thinking in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   All at once, he had to learn how a person with dark skin should
behave in the United States: If an officer is following your car,
do not turn your head; the police don't like it. Do not stare at
other drivers, especially if they are young and white and loud. He
has even learned how to walk: fast in stores, to avoid security
guards; slower in the streets, so as not to attract the attention
of the police. On the street, he avoids any confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   He pays bills in cash because of an incident at a bank two years
ago. When he asked to buy a certificate of deposit with $6,000 in
lottery winnings, the bank officer, a white Cuban woman, looked
puzzled, he recalls, and told him: ``This is different. Your kind
likes to spend the money, not save it.'' Since then he has not had
a checking account.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, he avoids Cuban restaurants in white
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cuba, I walked as if I owned the streets,'' he says. ``Here
I have to figure out where, what, when, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As he learns to be black in America, he often finds himself
caught between two worlds. Whites see him simply as black.
African-Americans dismiss him as Cuban. ``They tell me I'm
Hispanic. I tell them to look at my face, my hair, my skin,'' he
says. ``I am black, too. I may speak different, but we all come
from the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   He has started to refer to himself as Afro-Cuban, integrating,
indeed embracing, the ways of his black neighbors. He enjoys what
he calls black food _ fried chicken, collard greens, grits _ though
he still lusts for a Cuban steak and plantains. He listens to
rhythm and blues at home and at work; in the car, though, where he
keeps a Cuban flag, he listens to a Cuban crooner whose romantic
ballads he has memorized. He dresses ``black,'' he says, showing
off his white velvet Hush Puppies and silk shirts. When he speaks
English, he mimics black Miamians, but his words carry an
unmistakably Spanish inflection.
</P>
<P>
   Some months after the Versailles incident, when Achmed Valdes
first saw his old friend, he was puzzled. ``Joel has changed,'' he
said. ``He is in another world now.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A SEAMLESS TRANSITION
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much anywhere else in America, Achmed Valdes would fit
nicely into the niche reserved for Hispanic immigrants. If the
question of race came up, he would be called a light-skinned
Hispanic. Here in Miami, such distinctions do not apply. Here he is
not a member of any minority group. He is Cuban and he is white.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is a city run by Cubans _ white Cubans. Not
only are the mayors of Miami and Dade County Cuban, so are 7 of 13
county commissioners and 3 of 5 city commissioners. Spanish is the
dominant language heard in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes' transition to this world has been seamless, so much so
that he does not really think of himself as an immigrant at all.
His self-image is of someone well along on a sure, quick path to
the middle class, someone who would be right at home in a quiet
neighborhood of well-kept houses and neatly mowed lawns. And that
is where he lives, with his wife, Ivette Garcia, and his mother in
a one-bedroom apartment off 17th Avenue in southwest Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He drives the car he likes, a 1998 Nissan that he plans to trade
in soon for a newer model, says whatever is on his mind and dreams
of opening his own business selling mattresses in a strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   He has had to learn about punctuality and paying bills on time,
but being white and Cuban, he has not had to learn how to behave.
His English is tentative, but that does not matter too much here.
His childhood friend may wrestle with a new identity, but when
Valdes is asked how he has adapted in a strange land, he looks
dumbfounded and jokes: ``What are you talking about? I was born in
Hialeah Hospital.'' Hialeah is South Florida's most Cuban city,
often the first stop for Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he struggles the immigrant struggle. He has held a dozen
jobs, from delivering Chinese food for tips to cleaning monkey
cages for $6.50 an hour. Each time, he has traded up a bit, to the
point where today he makes $9.60 an hour, with paid vacations and
frequent overtime, to drive an 18-wheel Restonic mattress truck all
over the state.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, however, he looks refreshed and energized,
positively glowing with the middle-class knowledge of having earned
his weekly respite.
</P>
<P>
   It is 2 p.m. one recent Saturday, and Valdes is home from his
soccer game. Before he is out of the shower, the apartment fills up
with his crowd _ athletic white couples, all friends from Cuba. The
men drive delivery trucks. The women, like his wife, work as
medical or dental assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The men plop themselves on the couch and watch soccer on
television.
</P>
<P>
   The women cluster around the kitchen table, talking about the
pill. They are all in their late 20s, all childless, focused on the
English classes or professional courses that will advance their
careers. The pill is pharmaceutical insurance for their dreams:
having children later, owning businesses, buying suburban homes. It
is all planned.
</P>
<P>
   With some pride, Valdes shows recent pictures of his house in
Cuba. When he comes to one of his father with his new wife, his
mother recoils at the sight of her ex-husband with his arm around a
black woman. Valdes concentrates on the coconut trees he planted in
the backyard years ago. ``Look how tall they are,'' he says, as if
surprised that his house, his father, his trees have gone on
without him.
</P>
<P>
   The talk drifts back to Cuba, as it so often does in Miami. Like
much of Miami's Cuban community, Valdes is quite conservative
politically. A favorite topic is how much he says he has learned
about the Cuban government since arriving here _ the political
prisoners, the human-rights abuses. ``They should all be killed,''
he says of Cubans who support the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   He listens to Miami's Cuban exile radio every day, particularly
enjoying a program in which the host regularly reads the names of
the men and women who have died in prison or were killed trying to
overthrow the Castro government. Like most Cubans in Miami _ but
unlike Ruiz and most Americans _ he believes that Elian Gonzalez,
the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor, should stay in the United States
rather than return to Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Valdes has ended up back in Cuba _ albeit a new and
improved Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I miss from Cuba is being able to see the ocean
from my windows,'' he says. ``Everything else I need and want is
right here. This is exactly the country that I always imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   CONFINED IN A COMFORT ZONE
</P>
<P>
   ``Que bola, acere?'' (``What's up, brother?'') Joel Ruiz asks a
friend who has stopped to share neighborhood gossip. It is noon on
a Tuesday, Ruiz's only day off.
</P>
<P>
   The friend leans in the window of Ruiz's 1989 Buick, and they
talk about a shootout in front of the friend's house the day
before. Drugs, for sure. Both men know the shooters from the
neighborhood, and his friend is worried that they may come back.
His little daughter was in the front yard when the gunfire started.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz cuts him off politely and heads to the house of another
friend, a middle-aged Cuban woman who, he says, loves him like a
son. What she would really love today, though, is $30 for rice and
meat. ``I don't have any money in the house,'' she says, lighting a
cigarette. ``It's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Having just cashed his paycheck _ $175 for six days of work at
the bar _ Ruiz has money in his pocket. He peels off two 20s, and
as he drives away, the woman yells after him, ``Come by tonight and
I'll make you dinner.'' He waves her off. He is in a rush. As
always on these days of rest, relaxation is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Like Achmed Valdes, Joel Ruiz is a man of middle-class
ambitions. He is studying English and wants to be a physical
therapist. With the help of his uncles, he bought a house in
Allapatah _ a neighborhood of dark-skinned Latinos and
African-Americans _ and rents out half of it for extra income.
Sure, he would like to be spending his day off hanging out, having
a beer, watching sports on TV. But this day, like all his days, is
circumscribed by race and the responsibilities that come with being
a black man in a poor place.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, blacks are outsiders in this racially charged
city, the scene of some of America's worst race riots. Blacks,
especially black Cubans, lack economic and political power and
resent the white Cubans who have so much of both. Steadily,
relentlessly, the problems of Miami's poor have become Ruiz's, too.
</P>
<P>
   When his uncle was imprisoned for drug dealing, Ruiz was shamed
and told almost no one. But the uncle had helped him get started in
Miami, and so he stepped in to keep his bar going and help support
his little girl. When another uncle was killed by a drunken driver
and left his family with no insurance, Ruiz stepped in to help the
widow and her 3-year-old daughter. He also sends money to his
11-year-old son in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   His entire routine, almost his entire life, is focused on a
20-block area around his home. Occasionally he ventures to South
Beach, the fashionable zone where race is not much of an issue.
Once, he went to a park in Little Havana, where Cubans, mostly
retirees, gather to play dominoes and reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I left right away,'' says Ruiz, whose politics, despite a
dislike of the Castro government, are more moderate than Valdes'.
``I couldn't be sitting around talking about Cuba and Fidel all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if his life is confined, he also feels comfortable in
this place where he can be black and Cuban, where he can belong. As
he drives with the windows down, he waves at people he knows, black
men and women, Cubans and non-Cubans alike.
</P>
<P>
   He has ambitions for the evening _ basketball with friends, a
date with his girlfriend, a black Cuban woman, to see ``Best Man,''
a film about a reunion of successful black professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But 4 o'clock finds him at the bar, Annie Mae's, getting things
ready for the night. He puts beer in the cooler, sweeps the floors,
cleans the bathrooms, polishes the tables and waits for the women
who are supposed to run the bar when he is off. He waits, goes out
for a while, then waits some more. Still no relief. He turns on the
TV and begins watching the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you noticed there are no blacks on television?'' he says
suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   He should have been playing basketball by now, but instead he
begins to play video tennis, his eyes fixed on the ball's glowing
path through the darkness of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ENCOUNTERING THE UNKNOWN
</P>
<P>
   When Valdes arrived in Miami, friends and relatives did not just
give him the obligatory immigrant lessons on how to fill out forms
and apply for jobs. They also sent him a clear message about race,
one shared by many, though not all, white Cubans: Blacks in America
are different from Cuban blacks. Do not trust them and do not go to
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has visited his old friend's home just once. In late
1995, when he heard that Ruiz had arrived in Miami, he went to see
him in Liberty City. Following his friend's directions, Valdes
found the place _ a small wood-frame house set far back in a huge
grassy lot. An aluminum fence surrounds it, and there is an air of
abandonment about it, but it is not a place that inspires fear.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he felt uneasy, the only white man in a black
neighborhood. The houses were ugly, he says; the few people on the
streets stared at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's just because, for us, that world is the unknown,
but we felt uncomfortable,'' says his wife, who is as talkative as
her husband is reserved. ``It's like this: In Cuba I ventured out
into the ocean, swimming by myself, because I knew the water, the
currents. Here, when I swim, I never stray far from shore because I
don't know what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Valdes' early jobs was delivering Ritz soda. Twice, he
says, his truck was broken into in black neighborhoods. He lost 16
cases of soda and $2,000 in checks. ``Everywhere else, you leave
the truck open and nothing happens,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Those experiences have left him with no interest in the black
world and not a kind word for African-Americans. ``They basically
have kids and go on welfare,'' he says. ``What else is there to
know?''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, he says, he grew up with blacks. It was almost
impossible not to, and so he never gave it much thought. His
immediate neighbors were mostly white, and he never dated a black
woman _ ``I just don't find them attractive,'' he explains _ but he
attended racially mixed schools, and several of his soccer buddies
were black.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, his contacts with African-Americans are limited to
chance encounters at work, his relationships with blacks to those
he knows from Cuba. ``As far as blacks,'' he says, ``I only trust
those I know, because I know they are not delinquents.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Valdes does not flinch when expressing his feelings about
blacks. He is passionate and definitive, but he can also be
generous and kindhearted, a man who shared his food with children
in Guantanamo and regularly sends care packages to his friends,
black and white, in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, he explains, is not his only black friend here. He is also
friendly with Fernando Larduet, a man he knew marginally in Cuba
but grew to like at Guantanamo. In a video of their time there that
Valdes likes to watch to relive his daring escape from Cuba, there
is an image of Valdes, who, for lack of a mirror, is gently shaving
Larduet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm racist,'' Valdes says. ``But even in Cuba, I
had a vague sense blacks were different. That becomes more real
here. In Cuba, everybody's the same, because everybody's poor. Not
so here.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after they arrived in Miami, Valdes and his wife went to
visit a friend at a hotel downtown. On their way, they made a wrong
turn and ended up deep in black Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cold night and it was really dark, even though it was
early,'' his wife says, over dinner at a restaurant in Coral
Gables, a fashionable and very white area of Miami. ``People were
walking around with sheets over their heads, and there was a fire
in a trash can in every corner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the houses were boarded up with pieces of wood to keep the
cold away,'' her husband chimes in, barely lifting his eyes from
his lasagna. ``And people were smoking crack in the middle of the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   She shudders. ``We got out of there fast,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   IN CUBA, THE LIMITS OF EQUALITY
</P>
<P>
   The soccer field where Joel and Achmed played back in Guanabo is
still a busy place, a scrum of young men vying to put the ball into
a goal strung together with scraps of fish netting. On this January
day, the game is still an easy mix of blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, in the main plaza of the University of Havana,
about 200 students of all colors form a circle around a troupe of
dancers. They are not clustered by race. At one point, they form a
human chain and then they, too, begin to dance, a rainbow of Cuba's
best and brightest bathed in sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, Cuba might seem to be some kind of racial
utopia. Unlike the United States, where there is limited cultural
fusion between blacks and whites, Cuban culture _ from its music to
its religion _ is as African as it is Spanish. But despite the
genuinely easy mixing, despite the government's rhetoric, there is
still a profound and open cultural racism at play.
</P>
<P>
   The same black students who were part of that dancing rainbow
say it is common to call someone ``un negro,'' or ``black,'' for
doing something inappropriate. ``When a man insults a woman in the
street, I will shout at him, `You are not a man, you are black!'''
said Meri Casadevalle Perez, a law student who is herself black.
</P>
<P>
   And a white mechanic named Armando Cortina explained that he
would never want his daughters to marry a black. ``Blacks are not
attractive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, he added with conviction, commit the overwhelming
majority of crimes in Cuba _ a statement impossible to assess in a
country that seldom publishes crime statistics. Even Cuba's racial
breakdown is uncertain, with blacks thought to make up between 30
and 60 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that while the revolution tore down most
economic barriers between blacks and whites, there is inequality at
the top. Blacks hold few important positions in government or
tourism. They are underrepresented at the university and in the
nicest neighborhoods. And the few blacks who have tried to organize
around the issue of civil rights have been jailed or ostracized.

   Bill Brent, a former Black Panther leader who lives in Cuba,
said he had arrived full of hope that the government had found the
``antidote to racism.'' Not only does racism persist, he lamented,
but black Cubans lack the racial identity to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revolution convinced everyone that they are all Cuban and
that their struggles were all the same, not separate or different
because of their race,'' he said. ``If a Cuban raises his voice to
say, `I am being discriminated against because I am black,' then he
would be labeled a dissident.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a voice of black identity can occasionally be heard.
</P>
<P>
   In a sun-scorched neighborhood outside Havana, that voice
resonates in the angry rap of Tupac Shakur. It blasts from a
boombox at the feet of a group of young black men propped casually
against a wall, dressed in a fair imitation of American hip-hop
fashion: baggy jeans, oversize T-shirts, Nike sneakers and khaki
caps with the brims turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives in Miami sent them the clothes and the rap tapes, they
say. As they listen to the music now, it is clear they have not
mastered the English lyrics and have only a sketchy sense of the
song's meaning. But it does not seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the lives of black people,'' says 18-year-old
Ulysses Oliva. ``It is for us. That is why we love it.''
</P>
<P>
   TWO MEN IN TWO MIAMIS
</P>
<P>
   When Joel Ruiz told his mother that he, too, would be joining
the migration to America, she fell to her knees and begged him to
stay. Only when she realized she could not change his mind did she
get up, dry her tears and cook him his favorite meal _ sugar-coated
ham with rice and black beans. Then she accompanied him to Guanabo
and cried and cried and waved his wisp of a raft out toward the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz rarely talks about his mother; at the thought of her, his
eyes seem to melt under a curtain of tears. But he says he does not
for a minute regret leaving Cuba. It's not that he isn't acutely
aware of the way his blackness has guided his story so far in
America. He understands the bargain he has made. In Cuba, he says,
he did not think about race, but he had no freedom and few options.
Here he cannot forget about race, or his many responsibilities, and
he has grown apart from his best friend. But instead of the limits,
he focuses on the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To eat a good steak in Cuba, I had to steal it from the
restaurant where I worked,'' he says. ``Here, I may not want to go
to Versailles because I feel uncomfortable, but I can go anywhere
else I choose, and no one can stop me at the door because it is
illegal and I know my rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his identity as a black man, he has found refuge in a
community that welcomes him. And he has acquired an American
vocabulary to frame his Cuban past. Thinking back, he points to
instances of racism that he once shrugged off.
</P>
<P>
   Once, on a bus, he got into a scuffle with a man he felt had
stolen his seat. Afterward, a white friend's mother told him he had
behaved like a black man. ```Te portaste como un negro,' that's
what she told me,'' he says. ``Now, what could she possibly have
meant by that, and how come I didn't see it then?''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, at one of those special birthday dinners with
Valdes, the maitre d'hotel stopped him at the door and asked, ``And
who is this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he really meant was, `Who's the nigger?''' Ruiz says.
``If that happened to me now, I would know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz insists he does not dislike whites. He cites his friendship
with Valdes as an example of his open-mindedness, just as Valdes
uses their relationship to establish that he is not racist. And
talking to the two men, watching them in one of their rare times
together, it is impossible not to feel their fierce loyalty and
genuine affection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both also know that theirs is now mostly a friendship of
nostalgia. They are adults with ambitions and jobs and bills to
pay, they point out, with little time to talk on the phone. When
they do they seldom discuss anything beyond their families in Cuba
or how busy they are with work.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to race, Ruiz will give his friend the benefit of
the doubt. Ruiz is proud that when he turned 30 in February, Valdes
ventured to black Miami for the party at Annie Mae's. ``I
understand that it is more difficult for him to cross the line than
it is for me,'' Ruiz says. ``It's not his thing and I respect
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes seems uncharacteristically thoughtful when discussing his
friend's life. His friend, he says, has chosen to live as a black
man rather than as a Miami Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were him, I would get out of there and forget about
everybody else's problems and begin my own life,'' he says. ``If he
stays it is because he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz thinks his friend cannot possibly understand. Even after he
moved in April to an apartment south of Miami to escape the
pressures of his needy relatives, Ruiz could not cast his family or
his blackness aside. He spends most of his time back in Allapatah,
near the bar and the neighbors who have embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he would do anything for me if I ask him to, but the
one thing he can never do is to walk in my shoes,'' Ruiz says of
his old friend. ``Achmed does not know what it means to be black.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes and Ruiz have never talked about race. When told of his
friend's opinion of blacks, Ruiz shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that?'' Ruiz asks, lifting his eyebrows. ``I don't
know why he would think that blacks are delinquents. I know he
doesn't think that of me, and I'm black. I've always been black.''
A pause. He thinks some more. ``He grew up with blacks,'' he says.
``I don't understand it. Maybe something bad happened to him. I am
sure he is talking about American blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has never told him about his experiences in Miami's black
neighborhoods, just as Ruiz has never told him about the police
outside the Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ruiz says he understands his friend's fear of crime in black
neighborhoods. There are parts of Liberty City even he avoids. What
he is wariest of, though, are white neighborhoods. Thinking back on
that encounter outside the Versailles, he says: ``Now I know enough
to be grateful we weren't killed that night. The police could have
thought Ramon's camera was a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ruiz's new world, whites, even white Cubans, have become a
race apart, and while they are not necessarily to be avoided, they
must be watched and hardly ever trusted. He can no longer see
himself in a serious relationship with a white woman. ``Not for
marriage,'' he says. ``Not for life.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is working in the bar, the only man running a place
where money, alcohol and loud music flow into the early hours of
morning, the customers who catch his attention are the white men
who sometimes wander in.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat at a corner table right before Christmas, a black
plastic Santa smiling down at him, Ruiz was relaxed, debating
whether to leave for a quick basketball game or stay to help out.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, two white men walked in. It was easy to tell they
were Cuban. They walked as Ruiz does, that chest-first Cuban walk.
Ruiz perked up. He trailed the men with his eyes. They ordered
beers, and as they walked over to the pool table they were
momentarily blinded by the light reflecting from a hanging ball of
mirrored glass. Averting their eyes, they looked toward the
darkness. There they found Ruiz's cold stare. He stared them down
until they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' he said, relaxing again, ``this is why I can't
leave this place. You never know who is going to walk in.''

 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Baron has perhaps the best party house for fund-raisers in
the whole state of Texas, a 15,000-square-foot Dallas mansion
designed by Robert A.M. Stern. And Baron, a wealthy plaintiffs'
lawyer, has plenty of rich friends to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   So when he agreed last year to work as a big fund-raiser for
Vice President Al Gore, he had all the right tools.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, Baron will be the new president of the powerful
Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which has vowed to do
everything to defeat Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has long
made curbing civil litigation and limiting jury awards and lawyers'
fees a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But while Baron has given Gore a great fund-raising advantage,
he has also given the Republicans a ready target in their campaign
to link Gore to the image of greedy trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on a widely publicized memorandum written by a paralegal
in Baron's law firm that some asbestos defense lawyers said was
used to elicit false testimony in asbestos cases, conservative
columnists and politicians have repeatedly pounded Baron, and
asbestos companies have castigated him in advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Baron come as the trial lawyers engage in what is
probably their most critical and intensely fought presidential
election. Beyond picking judges, the next president will shape
federal policy on issues in which the trial lawyers have a big
stake. The lawyers have taken the lead in major legal battles
against big tobacco companies and, with help from the federal
government, are seeking to make it easier to sue gun manufacturers
and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has long cited tort reform _ laws that restrict civil
litigation and limit jury awards _ as one of his greatest
accomplishments as governor of Texas, and has vowed if elected
president to take to the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election goes right to where trial lawyers live,'' said
Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a former
Democratic attorney general of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, lawyers like Baron are fighting back. In 1999,
trial lawyers, who historically give the bulk of their
contributions to Democrats, gave $4.4 million to Democratic
candidates and political committees. That figure was 2 1/2 times
more than they gave in the same 12-month period during the previous
presidential cycle, according to Common Cause. And many trial
lawyers were among big givers at a gala Democratic dinner on May 24
in Washington that raised $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is against this backdrop that Baron, whose firm gave $135,000
in campaign contributions in 1999 to Democrats, finds himself
pushing the interests of trial lawyers, while defending his own
reputation as a bruising litigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk around with a bull's-eye on my head,'' said Baron, a
short, trim man who wears expensive suits and wire-rim glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial memorandum, which emerged in 1997, instructed
claimants never to testify that they saw a warning label on
asbestos packages or knew about its dangers. Some asbestos
companies sought court-ordered sanctions against Baron's firm and a
Texas judge asked a state district attorney to investigate the
memorandum. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Dallas also apparently
made some preliminary inquiries into the matter, according to
people who said they were interviewed by federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Those inquiries, however, soon fizzled out. Also, several lower
court findings by Texas state courts against Baron's firm were
thrown out on appeal. Baron said that he is also confident that the
last remaining legal dispute over the document, which is taking
place in Ohio, would be resolved in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Baron has repeatedly said that the memorandum was the work of an
overzealous paralegal and has declared himself exonerated. Still,
even as he takes over a group that is a cornerstone of Gore's
support, he remains haunted by the document and its implications of
witness coaching.
</P>
<P>
   While the document was the subject of numerous newspaper
articles in 1997, it was cited again earlier this year in newspaper
advertisements paid for by the GAF Corp., an asbestos producer, and
others then pressing Congress for legislation limiting asbestos
lawsuits. ``You should be aware of the FACTS concerning Baron and
his modus operandi,'' proclaimed one advertisement, which described
the memorandum as one of his many ``flagrant abuses'' that make a
``mockery of our legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Olsen, an adviser to Bush on tort reform, said he was
surprised that the trial lawyers' group elected Baron president,
given the document's controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that he is going to be representative of a whole
industry after the disclosure of the memo suggests a boldness on
their part or an imperviousness to public criticism,'' said Olsen,
a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who has written
articles critical of Baron.
</P>
<P>
   Baron said that tort-reform advocates like Olsen and
conservative opinion shapers like the editorial page of The Wall
Street Journal had kept the memorandum controversy alive as a way
of smearing him. To defend himself he has hired legal
troubleshooters like Abbe Lowell, the chief investigative counsel
for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during the
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also struck back at his accusers with zeal. Some
companies that filed legal challenges against Baron's firm over the
legal document soon found themselves negotiating settlement deals
favorable to him after he threatened to bring more asbestos claims
against them. And he has intensified his pursuit of a former
asbestos company executive who Baron contends spearheaded the
assault against him, charging in court papers that the executive
stole millions earmarked for asbestos claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned early that it's best to let the other guy take the
first shot,'' Baron said. ``And then you come back at him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tactic that Baron has used frequently in a career that
has mirrored the transition of many trial lawyers from scrappy
advocates for workers and consumers to wealthy businessmen eager to
influence policies and politics.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Baron, who was also a major contributor to President
Clinton, plays golf with the president and dines several times a
year at the White House. In recent years, he has been the host of a
party for the Democratic National Committee at its annual retreat
in Aspen, Colo., where he and his wife, Lisa Blue, a former
prosecutor who is now a partner in his firm, have a second home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of Texas Law School, Baron went to
work in the early 1970s for a Dallas law firm whose clients
included the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union. He was asked
to look at conditions at an asbestos insulation plant in Texas and
said he found them appalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disgusting,'' he said. ``People were working in there
shoveling up asbestos and they weren't even wearing masks.''
</P>
<P>
   He soon joined forces with a small group of lawyers around the
country who had uncovered documents showing that asbestos producers
like the Johns Manville Corp. long knew that asbestos, a mineral
fiber that is now banned, could cause fatal diseases. By the 1980s,
thousands of workers exposed to asbestos had filed lawsuits and
Baron's firm, Baron and Budd, would handle more claims than any
other firm.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he was an extremely wealthy man whose political
influence and contributions were felt in elections for Texas state
judges, both Democrats and Republicans said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred is a very likable guy who throws a lot of parties,'' said
Tom Pauken, who was chairman of the Texas Republican Party from
1994 to 1997. ``He pays close attention to who is running and who
isn't, and he has an ability to influence the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron also played a critical role in a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court
decision that still hangs over asbestos cases today.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some major lawyers representing asbestos claimants,
including some of Baron's longtime colleagues, struck a deal with
producers under which all current and future asbestos cases would
be settled as part of a huge class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Baron, who opposes the use of class-action lawsuits as a
means of resolving legal disputes, led the fight against the plan.
He poured $4 million into opposing it, hiring experts like Prof.
Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School to argue against it before
the Supreme Court, which struck down the settlement as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics asserted that Baron's motive was profit, not legal
principles, saying that his once-pioneering firm had evolved into
an asbestos ``mill'' that raked in a large fee for every claim it
handled, and the stream of cases would have been shut off under the
settlement. But even some plan supporters disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opposing the case was in Baron's economic interest but he is a
more complex person,'' said John Aldock, a lawyer for a consortium
of asbestos companies involved in the failed plan.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1990s, Baron said, he decided it was crucial for him
to get involved in the trial lawyers' lobbying group as its battles
with advocates of tort reform intensified. One possible
inspiration: When Bush signed the sweeping tort reform bill in
Texas in 1997, ending a legal mechanism that Baron had helped
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Under it, asbestos claims from other states could be filed in
Texas state courts. Ralph Wayne, the president of the Texas Civil
Justice League, a tort reform group in Austin, said a 1996 study by
his group found that Baron's firm had filed the majority of some
56,000 out-of-state asbestos claims pending in Texas courts.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne said that many of those cases had been filed in Texas
jurisdictions with reputations for high jury awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows courts in Texas and he knows where to file the
cases,'' Wayne said of Baron .
</P>
<P>
   It was also around that time that the memorandum controversy
erupted. While a lawyer from Baron's firm turned over the document
to defense lawyers in pre-trial testimony in an asbestos case, the
lawyer said that publicity about it was fueled by a former asbestos
company executive who had been his longtime nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Baron and that executive, Craig Smith, a
former top official of the Raymark Corp., have waged a lengthy
court battle over the assets of the bankrupt concern. In 1988, a
federal judge in Oregon found that Smith had engaged in a number of
complex business transactions in a bid to escape Raymark's asbestos
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Baron and others said in court papers filed in
U.S. District Court in Hartford, Conn., that Smith and his family
members engaged in a scheme to illegally divert millions of dollars
earmarked for asbestos claims for their own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Smith, who now runs a business in
Wales, denied any wrongdoing in the bankruptcy proceeding. But he
acknowledged meeting with FBI officials in 1997 to encourage the
agency to look at the controversial memorandum. He also said he
hired lawyers who, among other things, publicized the memorandum
and filed lawsuits against Baron and other asbestos lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith insisted, however, that his actions were driven not by any
animus toward Baron but by his belief that many of the asbestos
claims filed by the Texas law firm were groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they are undermining the industrial strength of this
country,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Baron's interpretation of Smith's motives is quite different.
``He is absolutely a down-in-the-dirt crook,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   Some defense lawyers involved in asbestos litigation said that
while Baron and his firm might have escaped sanctions in connection
with the memorandum, they remained convinced that his firm had used
questionable tactics to press dubious claims.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth L. Phifer, an outside lawyer in Dallas for the
Borg-Warner Corp., which challenged Baron over the memorandum, said
that asbestos claimants she had questioned in pre-trial testimony
over the past decade had repeatedly given the same answers to
questions about events that happened decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is remarkable how similar the answers sound,'' Phifer said.
</P>
<P>
   Baron is unmoved. After Borg-Warner challenged him he brought
two asbestos cases to trial, winning large judgments. The company
soon withdrew its legal challenge and now settles claims with
Baron's firm for more than it previously did, the Texas lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is bitter,'' said Baron, referring to Phifer. ``She
lost.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Havana, sometime before 1994: As dusk descends on the
quaint seaside village of Guanabo, two young men kick a soccer ball
back and forth across the sand. The tall one, Joel Ruiz, is black.
The short, wiry one, Achmed Valdes, is white.
</P>
<P>
   They are the best of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, January 2000: Valdes is playing soccer, as he does every
Saturday, with a group of light-skinned Latinos in a park near his
apartment. Ruiz surprises him with a visit, and Valdes runs to
greet him. They shake hands warmly.
</P>
<P>
   But when Valdes darts back to the game, Ruiz stands off to the
side, arms crossed, looking on as his childhood friend plays the
game that was once their shared joy. Ruiz no longer plays soccer.
He prefers basketball with black Latinos and African-Americans from
his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The two men live only four miles apart. Yet they are separated
by a far greater distance, one they never envisioned back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In ways that are obvious to the black man but less so to the
white one, they have grown apart in the United States because of
race. They now inhabit a place where skin color defines the
outlines of their lives _ where they live, the friends they make,
how they speak, what they wear, even what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I am here and he is over there,'' Ruiz said. ``And
we can't cross over to the other's world.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that they were unaware of their difference in color
while growing up in Cuba's mix of black and white. Fidel Castro may
have decreed an official end to Cuba's long history of racism, but
that does not mean racism has simply gone away. Still, color was
not what defined them. Nationality, they had been taught, meant far
more than race. They felt, above all, Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America, Ruiz still feels Cuban. But above all he feels
black. His world is a black world, and to live there is to be
constantly conscious of race. He works in a black-owned bar and
dates black women. He generally avoids white neighborhoods, and
when his world and the white world intersect, he feels always
watched, and he is always watchful.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who is 29, a year younger than his childhood friend, is
simply, comfortably Cuban, an upwardly mobile citizen of the Miami
mainstream. He lives in an all-white neighborhood, hangs out with
white Cuban friends and goes to black neighborhoods only when his
job, as a deliveryman for Restonic mattresses, forces him to. When
he thinks about race, which is not often, it is in terms learned
from other white Cubans: American blacks, he now believes, are to
be avoided because they are delinquent and dangerous and resentful
of whites. The only blacks he trusts are those he knows from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Havana on separate rafts in 1994, the two have
seen each other just a handful of times in Miami _ at a funeral, a
baby shower, a birthday party and that soccer game. They have
visited each other's homes only once.
</P>
<P>
   They say they remain as good friends as ever, yet both know
there is little that binds them anymore but their memories. Had
they not become best friends in another country, in another time,
they would not be friends at all today.
</P>
<P>
   GROWING UP IN CUBA
</P>
<P>
   Achmed and Joel met on a school bus. Both grew up in orderly
homes, with hard-working parents who supported Castro. Their
fathers worked for the state oil company. Their mothers _ Joel's
was a nurse, Achmed's an administrator in stores for tourists _
knew each other and sometimes met for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' friendship was cemented through school and sport. They
stood up for each other against troublemakers. ``Just to know we
were there for each other was good,'' Ruiz recalls.
</P>
<P>
   When Joel's girlfriend got pregnant in high school, Achmed was
the first person he told. They played soccer and baseball and ran
track. Joel often stayed for dinner at Achmed's, where there was a
color television and an antenna powerful enough to pick up American
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her job, Achmed's mother had access to some of
Havana's best restaurants. Every year she would take him out for a
birthday dinner, and every year he would invite his best friend,
Joel. ``I couldn't think of anybody I would rather spend my time
with,'' Valdes recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But as they grew older, each became restless with the
limitations of life in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Achmed was in sixth grade when an aunt living abroad gave him a
pair of sneakers. He immediately wore them to school. The principal
promptly visited him at home to warn him about the troubling
political implications of those foreign sneakers. At the
university, too, professors wondered why he wore foreign clothes
and rode a nice bicycle. When he was expelled for failing two
classes, he saw it as punishment for being politically incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when the government allowed thousands of Cubans to
leave in small boats and rafts, he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Joel was ready, too, though it had taken him longer
to make up his mind. Given Cuba's racial history, it is hardly
surprising that black Cubans have generally been less eager than
whites to flee to America. In pre-revolutionary Cuba, blacks and
whites had lived largely segregated, separated by huge disparities
in economic and social standing. But soon after seizing power in
1959, Castro ordered whites to see blacks as equals and began
leveling the economic and educational playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   When Joel was very small, his family lived crammed into one room
of an old carved-up mansion. Soon, the government gave them a
three-bedroom apartment in a development that Joel's father had
helped build. Before the revolution, Joel's mother had made a
living cleaning white people's homes. It was Fidel, she told him
over and over, who had given her the chance to become a nurse. And
so Joel came to believe that it was no big deal, being black in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for America, he had seen the images on government television:
guards beating black prisoners, the police loosing dogs or training
hoses on civil-rights marchers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cuba's economy crumbled in the 1990s, he began to see
things differently. He entered a cooking program, hoping for a
well-paying job at a tourist hotel. But once he graduated, the only
job available was washing windows. Look around, co-workers told
him, look who's getting the good jobs: whites.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed, too, when he watched American television, that some
blacks seemed to live well in America. He saw black lawyers,
politicians, wealthy athletes. It made him think: ``It's not so bad
over there. Blacks are all right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1994, Ruiz boarded a raft for Florida. Like Achmed,
he was intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard and sent to the U.S.
base at Guantanamo, Cuba. The next year, they were freed _ first
Valdes, then Ruiz _ and went to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A SHOCK OF IDENTITY
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Joel Ruiz discovered a world that neither American
television nor communist propaganda had prepared him for. Dogs did
not growl at him and police did not hose him. But he felt the
stares of security guards when he entered a store in a white
neighborhood and the subtle recoiling of white women when he walked
by.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is segregated, and when Ruiz arrived, he settled into one
of the black urban sections, Liberty City. He had family there. His
uncle Jorge Aranguren had arrived in 1980. Ruiz took a job at his
uncle's liquor store and started learning English.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Ruiz noticed about his new world was the absence
of whites. He had seen barrios in Havana with more blacks than
others, but he had never lived in a place where  &UR; everybody &LR;  was
black. Far from feeling comfortable, he yearned for the mixing he
had known in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, he says, he had been taught to see skin color as not
much more important than, say, eye color. But in Miami, as the
roughly 7 percent of the area's Cubans who are black quickly learn,
skin color easily trumps nationality.
</P>
<P>
   One night in early 1996, Ruiz and his uncle Ramon Suarez were
driving in a new red Nissan with three light-skinned girlfriends.
Suddenly, four police cars, lights flashing and sirens wailing,
stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, weapons drawn, ordered them out of the car.
Terrified, Ruiz spread his legs and leaned face down on the car as
the officers frisked him.
</P>
<P>
   Then one officer, a white Cuban-American, said something in
Spanish that forever changed Ruiz's perspective on race. ``I've
been keeping an eye on you for a while,'' Ruiz recalls the officer
saying. ``I saw so many blacks in the car. I figured I would check
you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz and his uncle stood speechless until an African-American
officer approached them, apologized and sent them on their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until that day, I thought all Cubans were the same,'' he
says. ``It took a while to sink in, but that incident made me start
thinking in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he had to learn how a person with dark skin should
behave in the United States: If an officer follows your car, do not
turn your head; the police don't like it. Do not stare at other
drivers, especially if they are young and white and loud. He has
even learned how to walk: fast in stores, to avoid security guards;
slower in the streets, so as not to attract the attention of
police. On the street, he avoids any confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cuba, I walked as if I owned the streets,'' he says. ``Here
I have to figure out where, what, when, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As he learns to be black in America, he often finds himself
caught between two worlds. Whites see him simply as black.
African-Americans dismiss him as Cuban. ``They tell me I'm
Hispanic. I tell them to look at my face, my hair, my skin,'' he
says. ``I am black, too. I may speak different, but we all come
from the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   He has started to refer to himself as Afro-Cuban, integrating,
indeed embracing, the ways of his black neighbors. He enjoys what
he calls black food _ fried chicken, collard greens, grits _ though
he still lusts for a Cuban steak and plantains. He listens to
rhythm and blues at home and at work; in the car, though, he
listens to a Cuban crooner. He dresses ``black,'' he says. When he
speaks English, he mimics black Miamians, but his words carry a
Spanish inflection.
</P>
<P>
   A SEAMLESS TRANSITION
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much anywhere else in America, Achmed Valdes would fit
into the niche reserved for Hispanic immigrants. If the question of
race came up, he would be called a light-skinned Hispanic. Here in
Miami, such distinctions do not apply. Here he is not a member of
any minority group. He is Cuban and he is white.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes' transition to this world has been seamless, so much so
that he does not really think of himself as an immigrant at all.
His self-image is of someone well along on a sure, quick path to
the middle class, He lives with his wife, Ivette Garcia, and his
mother in a one-bedroom apartment in southwest Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He drives a 1998 Nissan that he plans to trade in soon for a
newer model, says whatever is on his mind and dreams of opening his
own business selling mattresses in a strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   He has had to learn about punctuality and paying bills on time,
but being white and Cuban, he has not had to learn how to behave.
He has not had to wrestle with a new identity like Ruiz has.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he struggles the immigrant struggle. He has held a dozen
jobs, such as delivering Chinese food and cleaning monkey cages. He
has advanced to the point where today he makes $9.60 an hour, with
paid vacations and frequent overtime, driving a Restonic mattress
truck all over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, however, he looks refreshed and energized, glowing
with the middle-class knowledge of having earned his weekly
respite.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of Miami's Cuban community, Valdes is politically
conservative. A favorite topic is how much he says he has learned
about the Cuban government since arriving here _ the political
prisoners, the human-rights abuses. He listens to Miami's Cuban
exile radio every day. Like most Cubans in Miami _ but unlike Ruiz
and most Americans _ he believes that Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old shipwreck survivor, should stay in the United States
rather than return to Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Valdes has ended up back in Cuba _ albeit a new and
improved Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONFINED IN A COMFORT ZONE
</P>
<P>
   It is noon on a Tuesday, Joel Ruiz's only day off. He has just
cashed his paycheck _ $175 for six days of work at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Que bola, acere?'' (``What's up, brother?'') Joel Ruiz asks a
friend who has stopped to share neighborhood gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The friend leans in the window of Ruiz's 1989 Buick, and they
talk about a shootout in front of the friend's house the day
before. Drugs, for sure. Both men know the shooters from the
neighborhood, and his friend is worried that they may come back.
His little daughter was in the front yard when the gunfire started.
</P>
<P>
   Like Achmed Valdes, Joel Ruiz is a man of middle-class
ambitions. He is studying English and wants to be a physical
therapist. With the help of his uncles, he bought a house in
Allapatah _ a neighborhood of dark-skinned Latinos and
African-Americans _ and rents out half of it for extra income.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, blacks are outsiders in this racially charged
city, the scene of some of America's worst race riots. Blacks,
especially black Cubans, lack economic and political power and
resent the white Cubans who have so much of both. Steadily,
relentlessly, the problems of Miami's poor have become Ruiz's, too.
</P>
<P>
   When his uncle was imprisoned for drug-dealing, Ruiz was shamed
and told almost no one. But the uncle had helped him get started in
Miami, and so he stepped in to keep his bar going. When another
uncle was killed by a drunken driver and left his family with no
insurance, Ruiz stepped in to help the widow and her 3-year-old
daughter. He also sends money to his 11-year-old son in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   His entire routine, almost his entire life, is focused on a
20-block area around his home. Occasionally he ventures to South
Beach, the fashionable zone where race is not much of an issue.
Once, he went to a park in Little Havana, where Cubans, mostly
retirees, gather to play dominoes and reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I left right away,'' says Ruiz, whose politics, despite a
dislike of the Castro government, are more moderate than Valdes'.
``I couldn't be sitting around talking about Cuba and Fidel all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if his life is confined, he also feels comfortable in
this place where he can be black and Cuban, where he can belong. As
he drives with the windows down, he waves at people he knows, black
men and women, Cubans and non-Cubans alike.
</P>
<P>
   ENCOUNTERING THE UNKNOWN
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has visited his old friend's home just once. In late
1995, when he heard that Ruiz had arrived in Miami, he went to see
him in Liberty City. He felt uneasy being the only white man in a
black neighborhood. The houses were ugly, he says; the few people
on the streets stared at him.
</P>
<P>
   One of Valdes' early jobs was delivering soda. Twice, he says,
his truck was broken into in black neighborhoods. He lost 16 cases
of soda and $2,000 in checks. ``Everywhere else, you leave the
truck open and nothing happens,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Those experiences have left him with no interest in the black
world and not a kind word for African-Americans. ``They basically
have kids and go on welfare,'' he says. ``What else is there to
know?''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, he says, he grew up with blacks. It was almost
impossible not to, and so he never gave it much thought. His
immediate neighbors were mostly white, but he attended racially
mixed schools, and several of his soccer buddies were black.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, his contacts with African-Americans are limited to
chance encounters at work, his relationships with blacks to those
he knows from Cuba. ``As far as blacks,'' he says, ``I only trust
those I know, because I know they are not delinquents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, he explains, is not his only black friend here. He is also
friendly with Fernando Larduet, a man he knew marginally in Cuba
but grew to like at Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm racist,'' Valdes says. ``But even in Cuba, I
had a vague sense blacks were different. That becomes more real
here. In Cuba, everybody's the same, because everybody's poor. Not
so here.''
</P>
<P>
   IN CUBA, THE LIMITS OF EQUALITY
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, Cuba might seem to be a racial utopia. Unlike
the United States, where there is limited cultural fusion between
blacks and whites, Cuban culture _ from its music to its religion _
is as African as it is Spanish. But despite the genuinely easy
mixing, despite the government's rhetoric, there is still a
profound and open cultural racism at play.
</P>
<P>
   The same black students who were part of that dancing rainbow
say it is common to call someone ``un negro,'' or ``black,'' for
doing something inappropriate. ``When a man insults a woman in the
street, I will shout at him, `You are not a man, you are black!'''
said Meri Casadevalle Perez, a law student who is herself black.
</P>
<P>
   While Castro's revolution tore down most economic barriers
between blacks and whites, there is inequality at the top. Blacks
hold few important positions in government or tourism. They are
underrepresented at the university and in the nicest neighborhoods.
And the few blacks who have tried to organize around the issue of
civil rights have been jailed or ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brent, a former Black Panther leader who lives in Cuba,
said he had arrived full of hope that the government had found the
``antidote to racism.'' Not only does racism persist, he lamented,
but black Cubans lack the racial identity to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revolution convinced everyone that they are all Cuban and
that their struggles were all the same, not separate or different
because of their race,'' he said. ``If a Cuban raises his voice to
say, `I am being discriminated against because I am black,' then he
would be labeled a dissident.''
</P>
<P>
   TWO MEN IN TWO MIAMIS
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz says he does not regret leaving Cuba. It's not that he
isn't acutely aware of the way his blackness has guided his story
so far in America. He understands the bargain he has made. In Cuba,
he says, he did not think about race, but he had no freedom and few
options. Here he cannot forget about race, or his many
responsibilities, and he has grown apart from his best friend. But
instead of the limits, he focuses on the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To eat a good steak in Cuba, I had to steal it from the
restaurant where I worked,'' he says. In America, he noted, while
there might be restaurants where he would feel uncomfortable, ``no
one can stop me at the door because it is illegal and I know my
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz insists he does not dislike whites. He cites his friendship
with Valdes as an example of his open-mindedness, just as Valdes
uses their relationship to establish that he is not racist. And
talking to the two men, watching them in one of their rare times
together, it is impossible not to feel their fierce loyalty and
genuine affection.
</P>
<P>
   But as both men point out, today they are adults with ambitions
and jobs and bills to pay, with little time to talk on the phone.
When they do they seldom discuss anything beyond their families in
Cuba or how busy they are with work. They both know that theirs is
now mostly a friendship of nostalgia.

PERIPATETIC SPORTING LIFE OF A YANKEE PROSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWICH, Conn. _ Like many of his classmates at the University
of Michigan, Drew Henson spent the week of spring break in Florida.
But for Henson it was no week on the beach, but a week of baseball
with Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill and other Yankees at the team's
spring training complex in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, Henson was back on the Michigan campus in
Ann Arbor throwing passes to his receivers during the start of
spring football practice. Then, a week after the 15 football
practices ended, on April 15, Henson took his last final exam. The
next day, he flew back to join the Tampa Yankees, the parent club's
Class A affiliate in the Florida State League. Two weeks later,
after hitting .333 in five games for Tampa, Henson headed north to
join the Yankees' Class AA affiliate, the Norwich Navigators of the
Eastern League.
</P>
<P>
   Such has been the peripatetic academic and sporting life of Drew
Henson, who will be Michigan's starting quarterback this fall _ and
presumably also in 2001 _ and who, in a few years, is expected to
take over at third base for the Yankees. In fact, Mark Newman, the
Yankees' vice president for baseball operations, says he will not
be surprised if Henson, who is 20, is in a Yankee uniform by next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about an extraordinary baseball talent here,''
Newman said. ``Drew is not just your everyday good baseball
prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   So good that the Yankees gave the 6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound
Henson a $2 million signing bonus after he graduated from Brighton
(Mich.) High School in 1998 while knowing that he had accepted a
football scholarship to Michigan and that he planned to play four
years of college football. Under his arrangement with the Yankees,
this season and next, Henson will play his last baseball game on
July 31 so that he can be in Ann Arbor the next day for the start
of preseason football practice.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Henson is not about to complain about the
difficulty of playing two sports whose seasons interlock.
``Physically, it's no problem,'' Henson said before Tuesday's game
at Dodd Stadium in Norwich. ``But at times I could use a mental
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   A smooth fielder with a rifle arm and good range who hits both
for average and power, Henson is regarded as the Yankees' next best
prospect after first baseman Nick Johnson, whom Henson is expected
to join on the Class AAA Columbus Clippers next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Before he threw his first pass for Michigan in the 1998 season,
Henson had already spent one season with the Tampa Yankees of the
rookie Gulf Coast League, where he batted .318. Last year Henson
hit .280 with 13 home runs in 69 games for the Class A Tampa
Yankees of the Florida State League.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday night's game in Binghamton, N.Y., Henson was
hitting a team-high .302, with 25 hits, three home runs, 16 runs
batted in and a .477 slugging percentage in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for Drew is not to expect too much too soon,'' said
Dan Radison, a career minor leaguer who is in his first year as
manager at Norwich. ``He's in a learning process here, and he's got
to remember that. He's not going to tear up the league at the
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Radison has seen enough to be impressed. ``Drew is
something special,'' Radison said. ``He has a relaxed manner, nice
soft hands in the field and an easy swing that can send the ball a
long way. He's the real deal _ the whole package _ and he can't
miss.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been the whole package since high school, where he was a
straight-A student, the co-valedictorian of his graduating class
and a member of the National Honor Society, scoring 1,360 on the
College Boards. As a senior, he was not only rated the top football
prospect in the Midwest and one of the top three in the nation, but
he was also named high school player of the year in baseball by
Baseball America after setting a national high school record of 70
home runs over four seasons. In addition, he set a school scoring
record in basketball while averaging more than 20 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Henson comes by his athletic genes naturally: his father, Dan,
was a college football coach and his mother, Carol, taught and
coached basketball. Henson's sister, Brittany, is a star basketball
and volleyball player at Brighton High. The family moved to
Michigan from Utah during Henson's freshman year in high school
when his father became the offensive coordinator at Eastern
Michigan. The elder Henson is now the head football agent at the
International Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   Henson is a dean's list student at Michigan, where he will be
starting his junior year in September. As the backup quarterback to
Tom Brady the last two seasons, Henson appeared in 18 games,
completing 68 of 137 passes for 800 yards and six touchdowns. As
the starter this season, he is expected to be one of the top
quarterbacks in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to appreciate what Drew has done playing football
and baseball,'' said Lloyd Carr, the Michigan football coach.
``He's so talented as a football player that if he stays in the
game he'll be one of the first three or four quarterbacks picked in
the NFL draft in 2002. If he wasn't playing baseball, he'd be even
further advanced, but he's trying to climb both Mount Everest and
Mount Annapurna.''
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, Henson will decide to climb as high as he can in
the Yankees' system and perhaps play alongside a fellow
Michigander, Jeter, on the left side of the infield. Mainly because
of Jeter, Henson is represented by Jeter's agent, Casey Close, who
is with the International Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what I'll do, but I won't play both
professionally,'' Henson said. ``I'll base my decision on what
sport I think I can play the longest without serious injury.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Henson is looking ahead to returning to Michigan and
plans to start throwing a football soon to some of his Navigator
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find a high school field, and I'll throw some,'' he
said. ``I also plan to fly in two of my receivers at Michigan _
Dave Terrell and Marquise Walker _ in July and throw to them,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   A $2 million ``bonus baby'' can afford to do such things. &QL;

TERM LIMIT BATTLE ROUND 2; THE NADER CHALLENGE; THE KASICH
NONCANDIDACY; NEVADA GOP'S ABORTION VOTE; A BUSH LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Nev., Ohio)   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reinforcements are coming to the aid of Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, since Nethercutt broke his pledge to serve
only six years in the House, he has been the target of a relentless
advertising assault by U.S. Term Limits. The advocacy group's
no-punches-pulled message: George Nethercutt is a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt has fought back with his own advertising campaign,
calling officials of U.S. Term Limits felons. But the Washington
State Republican Committee, seeing the need for even stronger
measures, has just opened a $100,000 advertising blitz that it
hopes will ensure the Spokane-area seat does not fall into
Democratic hands. The committee's message, delivered in a
commercial drawn up by the National Republican Campaign Committee:
U.S. Term Limits is engaged in ``mudslinging paid for by secret
donors.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the betting is that Nethercutt will probably be
able to hang on. Still, few House races in the country are more
bitterly contested than this one. But, then, few have the
love-gone-sour aspect this one has.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994, U.S. Term Limits made Nethercutt its poster boy
when his pledge to serve only three terms on Capitol Hill helped
him unseat Speaker Tom Foley, a 15-term Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Hell hath no fury ...
</P>
<P>
   NADER GROWS HEAVIER IN POLLS
</P>
<P>
   Now and again Ralph Nader may come forth with a play on words,
as in the title of his book on the auto industry, ``Unsafe At Any
Speed.'' But with him, the issue is the thing, and so he is mostly
seriously serious.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment he is seriously serious about running for
president _ so serious that he is pulling close to 5 percent of the
vote in many national polls, much of it at the expense of Vice
President Al Gore. There is serious talk that he could cost the
Democrats the White House.
</P>
<P>
   To get to that 5 percent level, Nader has been working the
college circuit hard, using his anti-establishment pitch to appeal
to the just-old-enough-to-vote crowd. And that crowd, all baggy
pants and tattoos and go-Ralph laughter, seems to be having a
relaxing effect on the buttoned-down 66-year-old consumer crusader.
</P>
<P>
   Nader tells them heavy things, like, for example, ``What this
campaign is really about is breaking the grip of the two-party
duopoly on American politics.'' Then he might segue into a light
riff about how he was asked to go on a Superman television special
to warn about ``the dangers of kryptonite.'' After that, he lets
drop that, well, he may look square but he's hip, with a list of
supporters and fund-raisers that includes the likes of Jackson
Browne, Phil Donahue, the Indigo Girls, Pearl Jam, Willie Nelson,
Paul Newman, Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt and Susan Sarandon.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the teen-ager, leather-clad, body-pierced, hair
dyed Day-Glo pink, who crowded close to him at a recent rally on
the Boston Common.
</P>
<P>

   OHIO: KASICH WITH AN EYE ON THE FUTURE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, was one of the first candidates to
drop out of this year's race for the presidential nomination. And
though he is chairman of the House Budget Committee, a major power
post, he is not seeking re-election to a 10th term in Ohio's 12th
Congressional District, which stretches north from Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   So is Kasich abandoning politics for good, having spent almost
half his 48 years in elective office?
</P>
<P>
   No way, he insists.
</P>
<P>
   While he has started looking for a nonpolitical job to settle
into once he leaves Congress, perhaps something in the business
world, he says he will stay involved in politics and may even run
for office again, possibly president. To that end, he disclosed
last week, he has formed a political action committee, the New
Century Project, with the goal of raising $500,000 over the next
year for distribution to candidates around the country who strike
his political fancy _ limited-government conservatives like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my way of continuing to be in public service without
holding public office,'' Kasich told The Columbus Dispatch. ``And
to do that, frankly, you have to have some resources, some staff,
an organization. It will allow me to build a network of people
around the country who I will have a relationship with and who are
potential supporters for me in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: His presidential campaign committee, Kasich 2000, is
still in operation and will finance his political travels this
year. It has almost $1 million in the till, according to the latest
Federal Election Commission report.

   NEVADA: GOP SAYS NO TO ANTI-ABORTION RESOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   Nevada is a state in which voters are always given an extra
choice on the ballot: ``None of These Candidates.'' And ``None''
has been known to finish first in some minor races.
</P>
<P>
   It follows, then, that Nevada politics can sometimes be
unpredictable and filled with surprises. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   In last weekend's Republican State Convention in Carson City,
the delegates passed resolutions opposing legalized marijuana,
same-sex marriages and openly gay people serving in the military.
</P>
<P>
   No surprises there. Then the delegates passed a resolution
opposing U.S. membership in the United Nations and calling for the
United Nations and its staff to be moved off American soil.
</P>
<P>
   That raised an eyebrow or two.
</P>
<P>
   But the real eye-opener came when the delegates, after noisy
debate, voted 166 to 149 to kill a resolution declaring that the
party opposed all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   With many leading Nevada Republicans opposed to abortion, the
expectation going into the convention was that the anti-abortion
resolution, having already made it through committee, would be
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the resolution carried the day by contending that
the party would do better in the fall elections if it took no
position on abortion and allowed individual candidates to express
their individual views. Many of those delegates wore buttons
warning: ``GOP Pothole Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   POLLS SAY BUSH LEADS IN ELECTORAL VOTES
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline, the popular Internet political tip sheet, keeps a
running tab of presidential preference polls in various states as
they become available. Here is how things stood overall at the end
of last week:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush led in 26 states, worth 282 electoral votes.
Vice President Al Gore led in 13 states, worth 178 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Needed to win: 270 electoral votes.

GROWING CLUB OF LEADERS STRAINS TO FIND A CLEAR FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ When they met in Italy one year ago, they were leaders
of a ``Third Way'' and their founding members were President
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as Clinton joined 12 other left-of-center
presidents and prime ministers here, the Third Way was banished in
favor of ``Progressive Governance.'' And Blair, pleading the need
to help his wife care for their new baby, decided to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was that although the meetings were unshakably
friendly _ the main agenda was ``dialogue,'' interspersed with a
few good meals _ leaders found themselves struggling for words.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody agreed that they stood for a new brand of
social-democratic leaders who support free trade and globalization
yet are determined to soften their harsher effects through strong
government support for social justice, education and public health.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps inevitably, most of the conclusions beyond that were
murky.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Saturday, the Third Way had brought German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder a measure of political heartburn. In a
move he later admitted was a mistake, Schroeder infuriated
left-wing traditionalists in his Social Democratic Party last year
when he signed a ``Third Way'' declaration with Blair praising
economic deregulation and greater support for business.
</P>
<P>
   The new mantra of Progressive Governance appears to have several
virtues. It implies modernization and a focus on the future, both
key themes for Europe's new generation of pragmatic
social-democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the word ``progressive'' carries echoes of
more traditional Socialist goals like income redistribution and
strong government.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Perger, an editor of the influential German news weekly
Die Zeit and a German delegate to Saturday's meeting, said that
those echoes were enough to set themselves apart rhetorically from
center-right leaders like French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, who is neither Third Way nor Progressive, was not
invited. But Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France, one of
Europe's most traditional Socialist leaders, is a charter member of
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Although some members, like Blair, have strongly pro-business
views, the leaders here rarely if ever mentioned the word
``reform.'' Perger said that may have reflected a recognition that,
in Europe at least, ``reform'' has become largely synonymous with
deregulation and reduced government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who helped coin the phrase Third Way and wanted to make
the new club of like-minded leaders a part of his legacy, admitted
he was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Third Way because it is sort of easy to remember,''
he said wistfully Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada had his own proposal for
a new label: ``I am the radical center,'' he remarked.
</P>
<P>
   In their concluding communique, the leaders praised the
so-called New Economy and said they accepted economic globalization
but were duty-bound to temper the harsher effects of reliance on
unfettered market competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are leaders who are aware of the opportunities of
globalization, without denying the dangers,'' the communique said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization must lead to higher living standards for all and
not a destructive race to the bottom at the expense of
environmental and worker protections.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference Saturday was the first time that the former Third
Way club has invited leaders from Latin America and South Africa.
The newest members were President Ricardo Lagos of Chile, President
Fernando de la Rua of Argentina, President Henrique Cardoso of
Brazil and President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion made identifying the criteria for membership more
difficult. The group, for example, does not include the
social-democratic president of Finland, one of the Europe Union's
fastest-growing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the group include Jose Maria Aznar, the center-right
prime minister of Spain who is arguably closer in mind-set to the
Progressives than he is to Spain's own Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   There was enormous speculation about whether Blair was now
trying to distance himself from the group because it had tilted too
much toward the likes of Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder of Germany made a special point of denying such
rumors, saying Blair stayed in London purely because he wanted to
help his wife, Cherie, with their baby.
</P>
<P>
   There were political reasons to believe those claims: Blair had
come under a fair amount of political razzing in Britain because he
refused his wife's request to take time off from work for paternal
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with a grin, jumped in with assurances on the question.
``The Third Way and Progressive Governing are pro-family,'' he
said.

<P>
   If the mouse roared in cyberspace, would anyone hear it?
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of Internet history, June 5, 2000, may be
remembered as the date that a hardy band of true believers tried to
establish the first independent colony in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a small international group of computer rebels plans
to introduce what they are calling a data haven, perched
precariously on a World War II military fortress six miles off
England's coast.
</P>
<P>
   They are hoping that the installation, connected to the Internet
by high-speed microwave and satellite links, will become a refuge
from governments increasingly trying to tame and regulate the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their company, Havenco, has struck a financial arrangement with
Roy Bates, an eccentric retired British army major who in 1968
briefly gained notoriety when he landed at the abandoned fortress
and declared it a sovereign nation _ the Principality of Sealand _
outside the reach of British law.
</P>
<P>
   The Havenco founders are loosely associated with a movement of
American computer mavens known as cypherpunks, a largely
libertarian group espousing the idea that advanced computer
encryption technologies can create electronic privacy and provide
liberty and freedom from potential government Big Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to offer its data haven to a diverse
clientele that may wish to operate beyond the reach of large
nations for reasons of privacy or financial necessity. They expect
their customers to include people who wish to keep their e-mail
safe from government subpoenas as well as other businesses seeking
to avoid regulation, like international electronic commerce,
banking and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has made it easier to move information and hide
information,'' said Sean Hastings, a 32-year-old U.S. citizen who
is the chief executive and co-founder of Havenco. ``Soon it will be
impossible to trace where money is and who has money, and that will
eventually force governments to move away from income taxes and
toward consumption taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In its bid to offer both security and sovereignty, Havenco has a
formidable task. Computer security experts generally say no
networked computer systems can be proved to be perfectly secure,
and e-mail by its very nature is a two-way communication. Legal
experts also said that while Britain might have done little to
assert jurisdiction over the offshore enclave in the past, any
prospect of its use for digital money laundering, gambling or tax
evasion might quickly force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, as a programmer for a similar effort to
create an offshore data haven on the island of Anguilla in the
British West Indies, Hastings sharpened his ideas on building
computer systems that offered what he calls genuine privacy and
security.
</P>
<P>
   While there he designed an anonymous digital currency system
intended to help create an efficient barter system in cyberspace
safe from the world's taxation systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the government of Anguilla was unwilling to give the
assurances Hastings felt were necessary to set up a secure data
haven.
</P>
<P>
   So last year he began his search for another sympathetic base of
operations, turning to a book called ``How to Start Your Own
Country,'' from which he learned about Bates and his Principality
of Sealand, a former antiaircraft bunker sitting in 20 feet of
water east of London.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, Bates used the abandoned concrete fortress as a
platform for a pirate radio station, operating without license from
the British government. He says he is struck by the parallels
between pirate radio and the idea of a pirate Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had dozens and dozens of proposals and we've turned them
all down,'' he said. ``This is the first one that seemed to be
really suited to what we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Sealand has had a variety of legal skirmishes with the British
government since 1968, at one point even firing warning shots at a
British naval vessel trying to reach the fortress. It has managed
to maintain a semblance of legal independence, although the issue
of sovereignty has never been formally tested, Bates acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to confront them directly,'' he said. ``They've
always ducked and dodged the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he was in the final stages of raising $3 million
to start his company, which is incorporated in Anguilla. He said he
believed that Sealand's sovereignty would stand up to a court
challenge, but some American legal experts are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offshore markets have become a focus of attention recently
among the G-7,'' the conference of leading industrialized nations,
said Michael Mann, a Washington lawyer who is the former director
of international enforcement for the Securities and Exchange
Commission. He said the flaw in the Havenco plan was that
cyberspace markets must still have points of contact with the
world's conventional economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the secrecy and protection in the world as
long as you don't need to write a check or wire a dollar,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Havenco executives may find their haven illusory, said Mann,
who was involved in a number of law enforcement actions with
investors who tried to establish offshore havens while he was at
the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so ironic about the Internet is, as impersonal as it
is, it creates the ultimate paper trail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility has not deterred Hastings and his colleagues,
who have moved three power generators to the offshore site. The
group is now finishing the work, including that on a special room
housing hundreds of server computers, and expects to open for
business within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To forestall some government alarm, Havenco has established an
``acceptable use'' policy banning its customers from using the
service for sending the unsolicited bulk e-mail, or spam, mounting
attacks on other computer systems or trafficking in child
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else Hastings considers fair game, and he said his tiny
cybernation had stockpiled a year's worth of food, fuel and other
supplies in case of a blockade.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was willing to take a political stand if necessary
and acknowledged that he might become an exile from the United
States as a consequence. He said the company was already looking at
several small nations that might shelter similar islands in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, the 78-year-old ruler of Sealand, says he does not
believe that his data haven deal will lead to a confrontation with
the larger island nation next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do anything to offend England,'' he said. ``I'm an
Englishman.''

DALLENBACH TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT PIECES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach finished 28th in last Sunday's Coca-Cola 600,
but for the veteran driver, it's not about where he finishes now.
It's about where he finishes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach is the driver of Darwin Oordt's Galaxy Motorsports
Ford. Although Dallenbach has been in NASCAR 10 years, his team has
been together less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Oordt recently hired Newt Moore to take over as crew chief. Like
Dallenbach, Moore has moved around trying to find the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to this team, things were as bad as I've ever seen
them,'' Dallenbach said candidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get the right people. At the start of the year,
everybody's set. Everybody's optimistic and talking about winning
the championship,'' he said. ``Then things happen and you start
having changes. When people become available, you've got to pick
them up,'' Dallenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   So Galaxy Motorsports has been doing that, hoping, in the
process, to strengthen the team. Dallenbach thinks they are on the
right track, which is why he is not overly concerned with where he
finishes now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only important to have good people, you need to have
people you like to be around because you probably spend more time
with them than you do your family,'' Dallenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach has a wealth of experience to draw from. He's been
with two powerhouse organizations, driving for both Jack Roush and
Rick Hendrick. He's also been with owners who have had to scramble,
like Bud Moore and Junie Donlavey. And he's been with Richard Petty
and Felix Sabates, who can never seem to get it right no matter how
much money he spends.
</P>
<P>
   Running with a top team like Roush or Hendrick and not cutting
it can leave a driver with a stigma, but Dallenbach is comfortable
with the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to worry about it, but I haven't the last two or three
years,'' he said. ``I think I've shown that if you put me in a good
car, I can make it run. I don't think any of the teams I was with
can say I didn't contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, he never had much of a shot with either Roush or
Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   When Dallenbach joined Roush in 1992, his first full season in
Winston Cup, he was a team car to Mark Martin. The emphasis was on
making Martin a winner. Dallenbach's program was pretty much an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he drove the third Hendrick car, but Hendrick's
primary focus was Ray Evernham and Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at Hendrick ``they said we all had access to the
same things, but there really wasn't a lot of information going
back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At Roush, Jack gave me my start and I'll always be grateful to
him for that, but if I went out and qualified really well, that
motor would be out of my car and in Mark's for the race,''
Dallenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach is not bitter about the past. He's trying to make it
work for him. He has definite ideas about how a race team should be
set up and how it should function, and much of that was picked up
at Roush and Hendrick, two of the winningest organizations in
NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach thinks Galaxy Motorsports is in the process of
putting the pieces together, and says he's going to do everything
in his power to see they're put together right.

MAYOR TAKES BABY STEPS TOWARD CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other day, something extraordinary happened at City Hall:
The city's two top elected officials had a conversation with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   To be specific, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had a private, cordial
meeting with his longtime tormentor, Mark Green, the public
advocate. At a bill-signing ceremony the same day, the mayor even
patted Green on the shoulder and whispered in his ear, ``Good job,
good job.'' Green, who has been a frequent target of the mayor's
ire, said afterward that his new relationship with the mayor felt
good but ``strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also initiated a meeting last week with Alan Hevesi,
the city comptroller, with whom he has been at war, and told him,
Hevesi said, that he ``wanted to take some steps to repair the
relationship.'' Around the same time, Giuliani called Virginia
Fields, the Manhattan borough president, and asked to meet with her
as part of what he promises will be a new relationship with the
city's minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after he dropped out of the race for U.S. Senate,
saying that he wanted to be a better person and a better mayor,
Giuliani has started to make tentative overtures to former enemies.
But as he continues to research his treatment for prostate cancer
and sort out his messy personal life, it is clear that any mayoral
transformation is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new Rudy,'' if such a creature exists, is still in his
cocoon. City Hall remains in limbo, waiting for the mayor to decide
on his cancer treatment as well as the initiatives that he promised
would redefine his mayoralty in its last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Giuliani does not appear to have talked with many of the
city's black leaders, even though he said in his withdrawal speech
that he wanted to bring down the ``barrier'' that he had erected
between himself and some communities he had alienated. Nor has he
contacted the family of Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed black man
shot dead by the police in March, although he said he wanted to
find a way to belatedly express his sympathy to them. He has not
reached out to Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem, a Democrat and the
dean of New York's congressional delegation, or to former allies
like the Rev. Calvin Butts and the Rev. Michel Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sent him a couple of messages,'' said Faulkner, the
pastor of the Central Baptist Church, who went on a fast and prayer
vigil to protest the mayor's repeated attacks on Dorismond. ``I
haven't heard back from him.'' He added: ``I know that his personal
situation takes pre-eminence over what's going on, but I hope he
would understand the seriousness of the condition of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, Giuliani remains an engaged and energetic
mayor, with a schedule full of the substance and ceremony of his
job. His main business the last two weeks has been directing
negotiations with the City Council over a pending $37 billion city
budget package, plus monitoring intense talks between his top
deputies and officials in Albany over legislation that would affect
the city's pension costs and ability to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   He has also, in the 15 days since withdrawing from the race,
given six speeches, held at least six news conferences, attended
three funerals, marched in three parades, appeared on two radio
programs, presided over two receptions, had one town hall meeting,
sworn in two judges and cut one ribbon. His four deputy mayors,
meanwhile, are said to be working on initiatives intended to revise
his legacy, but short of race relations there is no indication of
what form they might take.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Giuliani does not appear to miss the
Senate race or his brief campaign trips upstate. Asked the other
day whether he had followed the Republican Party's nomination of
Rep. Rick Lazio, who replaced him in the race against Hillary
Rodham Clinton, Giuliani replied, ``somewhat _ not in great
detail.'' Then he added offhandedly, ``I was doing other things
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's personal life remains complicated. He has had quiet
dinners in midtown restaurants with his ``very good'' friend,
Judith Nathan, a district sales manager for Bristol-Myers Squibb
who is divorced and has a teen-age daughter. Friends say he is in
love with her.
</P>
<P>
   But he also celebrated his 56th birthday last Sunday at Gracie
Mansion with his two children and his estranged wife, Donna
Hanover, who recently hired a divorce lawyer to work out the
couple's separation agreement as they live in the same house. ``She
got him a gift, and they shared an ice cream cake with the
children,'' said Joannie Danielides, Hanover's press secretary.
Later that day, he was honored at a party with some 50 staff
members and friends at an Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``new Rudy,'' Giuliani sometimes seems as skeptical
as his critics. ``No, there isn't a new Rudy,'' he told Rich Lamb
on the WCBS radio show ``Ask the Mayor'' on Thursday night. ``You
grow from things. Things that happen to you make changes in you.''
He added that his illness ``has changed me in certain respects''
and is ``probably going to change me even more, but not into a
totally different person.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping out of the race ``was the right decision, oh yeah,
sure,'' he said. ``I haven't looked back.''

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To prosecutors, it was a classic organized-crime
case. The mob forced a contractor renovating a hotel in midtown
Manhattan to make weekly payments to prevent interference from
unions.
</P>
<P>
   But charges against one defendant fell apart, prosecutors said,
because of a weakness in New York's money-laundering laws, even
though they were able to prove that the defendant had forced the
contractor to give him $50,000, which was transferred to an account
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The case was one of several that law enforcement officials cited
after Gov. George Pataki proposed legislation last week to expand
the definition of money laundering in the current statute and to
increase penalties for laundering money.
</P>
<P>
   The governor cited concerns that too many money-laundering cases
in New York were slipping through the cracks. His proposal has
gained strong support from state and federal law enforcement
authorities, and some powerful members of the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow state prosecutors to file hundreds of
additional charges against potential defendants each year, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities often use laws against money laundering _
the transfer of money to make proceeds from criminal activities
appear to be legitimate gains _ to pursue criminals who would
otherwise be difficult to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   The federal statute is broader than the New York one. Under the
New York law, a person cannot be convicted of money laundering
unless the money being laundered is exchanged for other currency or
a narrow list of other valuable items.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes money orders, travelers' checks, precious
metals, jewelry and stamps, but does not include personal checks or
goods like furniture, vehicles and construction equipment, making
it easier to devise exchanges that are not covered by the state
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In money-laundering schemes, criminals often transfer money from
illegal activities to companies they control, where it is used to
purchase products that can be used in those businesses or sold,
transforming the money into a clean asset. The transactions often
involve vehicles and construction equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The current law ``was designed by someone who never wanted to
see it used,'' said Bridget G. Brennan, a special narcotics
prosecutor in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   She said the governor's bill would lead to more prosecutions by
broadening the definition of an exchanged good to include anything
that prosecutors could prove was received in exchange for money
derived from criminal activity. This is similar to the definition
in the federal money laundering law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense that the monetary instrument statute is so
narrow that it does not cover wire transfers,'' said Robert M.
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, whose office drafted
the bill proposed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill ``will make it easier to prosecute major drug dealers,
organized crime and white collar criminals,'' Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also increase the maximum sentence for money
laundering from seven years in prison to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law would also be useful to prosecutors working for
state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, whose office has taken on a
rapidly increasing number of white-collar crime cases.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the current statute ``provides a safe haven for
criminals'' who are aware that wire transfers and payments by
personal check are not covered by the state laundering law.
</P>
<P>
   In the state Senate, the Republican majority leader, Joseph
Bruno, has expressed support for the measure, and Speaker Sheldon
Silver of the Assembly, whom Morgenthau has personally lobbied, is
expected to announce his support in the coming weeks, officials
said. Efforts to contact Silver through an aide were unsuccessful
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Some business leaders have objected to the bill, fearing that it
may increase the liability of financial institutions that are used
as conduits for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   In the hotel extortion case, prosecutors under Morgenthau were
able to indict the defendant, William Capparelli, on extortion
charges, but they said the case took much longer to investigate
than a money laundering case would have.
</P>
<P>
   Capparelli could not have been convicted of money laundering
under state law because of its narrowness. And while his actions
might have violated broader federal money-laundering statutes,
federal prosecutors do not have enough resources to pursue every
case, officials said.

   NEW YORK _ Symbolism fans must have relished the 1999-2000
Broadway season. With the century's close, it was indeed the end of
an era for commercial theater, marked by finales for two
blockbuster musicals and the deaths of two prominent impresarios
from an earlier, healthier theatrical time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats `` and ``Miss Saigon,'' two British blockbuster musicals
that dominated Broadway for the past 18 and 10 years respectively,
have posted their closing notices. No more prancing kitties or
roaring helicopters for awhile. But the new productions of this
season, which ends tonight with the 54th annual Tony Awards
telecast, prove that Broadway is having trouble finding durable
musicals for a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for finding producers with sufficient artistic
vision, financial resources and gambler's instincts. That was
underlined by the passing this spring of the irascible David
Merrick, who assembled shows such as ``Gypsy'' and ``Hello, Dolly!
`` while importing prestige items such as ``Marat''/''Sade;'' and
his rival Alexander Cohen, whose credits ran from ``Angel Street''
to this season's ``Waiting in the Wings.'' In their place are
faceless committees _ it took 11 producers to bring the
three-character ``Copenhagen'' from London _ and monolithic
corporations like Disney, which spent untold millions on a pop rock
version of the opera ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a season without anticipated new shows from Broadway's
usual suspects. Stephen Sondheim's Palm Beach-themed musical about
the Mizner Brothers, ``Wise Guys,'' had a workshop presentation
off-Broadway, but no full production. The long gestating,
much-revised Martin Guerre , by the ``Les Miz''/''Miss Saigon
``team of Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, began a tuneup
tour that derailed before arriving on Broadway. And Neil Simon
churned out another comedy, ``The Dinner Party,'' premiering it in
his adopted hometown of Los Angeles, then deciding it needed more
work before bringing it to New York.
</P>
<P>
   If the old guard did not deliver, the first season of the new
century was marked by emerging young talents who may or may not
stay around to put their stamp on the commercial theater. The
busiest tunesmith this season was certainly Michael John LaChiusa,
the composer-lyricist-playwright of both ``Marie Christine,'' a
modern, Americanized retelling of the Medea legend, and ``The Wild
Party,'' a fictional slice of Jazz Age social history based on a
1928 narrative poem by Joseph Moncure March.
</P>
<P>
   Such double exposure earned LaChiusa four Tony nominations, but
has yet to produce much audience interest for his hard-edged,
melody-stingy style. ``Marie Christine `` ran briefly this winter,
but was most notable for its leading lady, that classically trained
force of nature, Audra McDonald. The lurid ``Wild Party'' was on
the verge of closing when it pulled in seven Tony nominations _ as
many as any new musical this season _ and it probably needs an
upset win tonight to stay open. LaChiusa is among a new generation
of theater composers who seem more suited for not-for-profit arenas
than the commercial, often middlebrow, taste of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a dominant creative whirlwind today, it is
director-choreographer Susan Stroman, who also copped four Tony
nominations for her sugary revival of ``The Music Man'' and her
inventive dance-musical, ``Contact.'' This latter show is the
front-runner for the season's best new musical Tony (it already won
the Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards), now that the
nominating committee has decided, begrudgingly, that ``Contact ``
actually is a musical.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this series of three dance-driven stories has no
singing, no new music written for the stage and no live music.
Still, it is an enormously audience-friendly evening and an assured
Broadway directing debut for Stroman, who is expected to return
next season with a musical based on Mel Brooks' audacious show
business farce, ``The Producers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with an armload of Tonys, ``Contact'' will never be the
popular success that Disney's ``Aida'' has become. Roundly panned
by critics, it is nevertheless the third hit in a row (after
``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The Lion King'') for the theater
divisions of the Mouse Factory. Following a false start at
Atlanta's Alliance Theatre two years ago, the show was overhauled
at an estimated cost of $20 million, certainly a Broadway record.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the critical carping, audiences have clamored for
tickets _ a tidy $752,890 in sales last week, which is 99 percent
of capacity, better than any other new show. ``Aida'' and her
Nubians will be circling the globe soon, making the initial
investment seem like chump change. Much is uncertain about the
future of Broadway, but the Disney presence seems assured, with a
stage version of ``Hunchback of Notre Dame'' on deck and a live
``Little Mermaid `` on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   While Disney proves that Broadway can be good business _ if you
have a family-oriented, spectacle-heavy musical _ it continues to
be treacherous territory for dramas. To fill the new play category
this year, the Tony committee had to take the dubious position that
any work not presented before on Broadway is new.
</P>
<P>
   That means Sam Shepard's ``True West,'' written 20 years ago and
prominently presented off-Broadway, competes for the award
alongside Arthur Miller's ``The Ride Down Mt. Morgan,'' a slight
effort that London theatergoers saw a decade ago and off-Broadway
audiences last season. If it had been deemed worthy, the late Noel
Coward's 1960 ``Waiting in the Wings'' could have competed as a new
work. Presumably, Broadway's head-in-the-sand producers find this
preferable to admitting that most serious plays _ at least those
without box office stars in them like Patrick Stewart (''Mt.
Morgan''), Kelsey Grammer (''Macbeth'') or Lauren Bacall
(''Waiting/Wings'') _ now go off-Broadway, where the last three
Pulitzer Prize winners could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, one can see the 2000 Pulitzer winner ``Dinner With
Friends,'' the delightful ``Fully Committed,'' August Wilson's
acclaimed ``Jitney,'' John Guare's early utopian drama Lydie Breeze
and a docudrama about the Matthew Shepard case, ``The Laramie
Project,'' but they are all off-Broadway. The American theater is
alive and healthy, just not on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are two worthy new plays on Broadway, the
serious-minded ``Copenhagen'' and the more playful, heartfelt
``Dirty Blonde,'' but for how long? Plays there have the half-life
of the nuclear isotopes that ``Copenhagen `` is concerned with.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, this has been a record year for Broadway, with a
new all-time sales mark of $603 million and a second-highest-ever
11.4 million attendance level. Next year, no matter how good a
season it becomes, those totals will probably be down without the
considerable business from ``Cats'' and ``Miss Saigon.'' At
tonight's Tony ceremony, there will be the usual bombast about
Broadway, but the really good performances will come from those who
can flash wide smiles without showing the nervousness behind them.

 &HT;    And the award should go to . . .
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Tony Awards are Broadway's biggest party of the
year. For theater-loving kids like me, who grew up in the Midwest,
the annual event was the most magical night of the year. It beat
Oscar. And the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   PBS telecasts the first hour of tonight's awards, during which
the Tonys for direction (play and musical), choreography, original
score, book of a musical, costume design, scenic design,
orchestration, lighting design and regional theater (the Utah
Shakespearean Festival) will be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Do not skip this hour and wait until 9 p.m. The PBS telecast
always provides a seductive backstage look at how Broadway shows
are made. In many ways, it is far superior to the CBS portion.
</P>
<P>
   And now, here's an educated, if admittedly biased, handicapping
of tonight's top races:
</P>
<P>
   BEST PLAY
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: ``Copenhagen'' by Michael Frayn; ``Dirty Blonde''
by Claudia Shear; ``The Ride Down Mt. Morgan'' by Arthur Miller;
and ``True West'' by Sam Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: ``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: ``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Why: Frayn's play of ideas focuses on two friends who did early
work on nuclear fission but find themselves on opposite sides of
World War II. It's considered one of the strongest plays in years,
perhaps since the ``Angels in America'' twofer, and has a
first-rate cast _ Philip Bosco, Michael Cumpsty and Blair Brown.
Darkhorse: Shear's ``Dirty Blonde,'' a funny, poignant, human look
at Mae West.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MUSICAL
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: ``Contact,'' ``James Joyce's The Dead,''
``Swing!'' and ``The Wild Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: ``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: ``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Why: Director/choreographer Susan Stroman's dance play stretches
the boundaries of what a Broadway musical can be. It is beautifully
performed, with each of its three dances holding a surprise twist
for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   BEST REVIVAL OF A MUSICAL
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: ``Kiss, Me Kate;'' ``The Music Man''; ``Jesus
Christ Superstar''; and ``Tango Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Why: ``Tango'' what? And answer this: Why would anyone want to
resurrect the painfully dated ``Superstar?'' This clearly is a race
between ``Kate'' and ``The Music Man,'' a beautifully staged visit
to Meredith Willson's Iowa of days gone by. ``Kate,'' Cole Porter's
play-within-a play sendup of Shakespeare's ``Taming of the Shrew,''
is, as The New York Times' Ben Brantley put it, ``One ear-to-ear
grin.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST REVIVAL OF A PLAY
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: ``Amadeus,'' ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ``The
Real Thing'' and ``The Price.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: ``The Real Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: ``The Real Thing'' or ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten.'' Both are worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Why: ``The Real Thing,'' Tom Stoppard's play about love and
betrayal, features Tony nominees Stephen Dillane and Jennifer Ehle.
Eugene O'Neill's ``Misbegotten'' features Tony nominees Cherry
Jones, Roy Dotrice and Gabriel Byrne. Both are serious,
audience-pleasing works with seriously strong performances. Go with
the Brits. It's a hunch.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING ACTOR IN A PLAY
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Gabriel Byrne, ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'';
Stephen Dillane, ``The Real Thing''; Philip Seymour, ``True West'';
John C. Reilly, ``True West''; and David Suchet, ``Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Dillane.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Dillane, Seymour or Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Why: Dillane's work has earned nothing but praise, as has the
work of Seymour and Reilly. But the fact that they alternate in
``True West's'' main roles may hurt them. Who do you vote for? For
which role, which night? Byrne doesn't catch fire until midway
through Act 2. Suchet is the forgotten man. Go with Dillane.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING ACTRESS IN A PLAY
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Jayne Atkinson, ``The Rainmaker''; Jennifer Ehle,
``The Real Thing''; Rosemary Harris, ``Waiting in the Wings'';
Cherry Jones, ``A Moon for the Misbegotten''; and Claudia Shear,
``Dirty Blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Ehle or Shear.
</P>
<P>
   Why: This, one of the toughest categories of the evening, pits
mother (Harris) against daughter (Ehle). Wouldn't a tie be nice?
Expect to see Harris on the podium, though, for what amounts to a
lifetime achievement award and for giving the only palatable
performance in Noel Coward's creaky ``Waiting in the Wings.'' Some
consider Jones (a Tony winner for 1995's ``The Heiress'') miscast.
But Shear can't be counted out.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING ACTOR IN A MUSICAL
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Craig Bierko, ``The Music Man''; Brian Stokes
Mitchell, ``Kiss Me, Kate''; George Hearn, ``Putting It Together'';
Mandy Patinkin, ``The Wild Party''; and Christopher Walken, ``James
Joyce's The Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Why: Call it justice for the Tony he didn't get two years ago
for ``Ragtime.'' And he's very good as the arrogant, swaggering
showman Frederic Graham/Petruchio in Kate. The other nominees _
even Bierko making a charming Broadway debut _ aren't in his
league.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Toni Collette, ``The Wild Party''; Heather
Headley, ``Aida''; Rebecca Luker, ``The Music Man''; Audra
McDonald, ``Marie Christine''; and Marin Mazzie, ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Headley.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Mazzie.
</P>
<P>
   Why: Perhaps the toughest category to call. Tony voters seem to
love Hollywood (Collette), but Headley gives a starmaking
performance in the weak ``Aida.'' Honoring her could be a way to
toss Disney a bone, even though her performance has grown less
theatrical and more diva-like with time. Luker is as exciting as
white bread. McDonald, already a three-time Tony winner at age 29,
is deserving, but voters may say enough is enough. Mazzie stops her
show eight times a week with ``I Hate Men.'' As the chilly Lilli
Vanessi/Kate, she sings songs that challenge the best of voices.
And delivers. If Tony has a brain (and it often doesn't), this is
her year.
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTOR/PLAY:
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Michael Blakemore, ``Copenhagen''; James Lapine,
``Dirty Blonde''; David Leveaux, ``The Real Thing''; and Matthew
Warchus, ``True West.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Blakemore.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Blakemore.
</P>
<P>
   Why: He'll win for ``Copenhagen'' _ and for directing a show
that couldn't be further from it _ ``Kiss Me, Kate.'' Yes, he's
nominated for best director of a musical, but that will go to Susan
Stroman (more on her later), so this is a way to honor him for
both.
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTOR/MUSICAL:
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Michael Blakemore, ``Kiss Me, Kate''; Lynne Taylor
Corbett, ``Swing!''; Susan Stroman, ``Contact'' and ``The Music
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Stroman.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Stroman.
</P>
<P>
   Why: Put aside her popularity and the fact that she lost her
husband, director Mike Ockrent, to cancer in December, the
medallion is hers. Stroman achieved something rarely done in
American musical theater, putting two critically praised and
popular shows on their feet in the same season. Not only did she
direct and choreograph ``Contact,'' she co-conceived it. Couple
that with her exhilarating _ if not perfect _ work with ``The Music
Man,'' and you might as well rename her prize ``The Susan.'' She'll
win for ``Contact.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1.2 million college graduates in the nation's class of 2000
are entering an unusually strong job market that is a result of a
flourishing economy and, especially, the boom in high technology.
</P>
<P>
   From Northeastern University in Boston to the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, from the University of
Michigan to the University of Texas, colleges, universities and
professional schools are reporting a record number of recruiters
competing to hire students in a time of low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering students from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and other universities in the East have been flown to
Silicon Valley and Seattle for audiences with billionaire
executives, while investment banks have flown Stanford University
students to New York for high-priced dinners accompanied by job
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Some graduates have landed jobs paying more than $60,000 a year.
With unemployment near its lowest level in three decades, despite
the increase in unemployment announced on Friday, salaries overall
for this year's graduating class are up 6 percent over last year's,
job placement experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gangbusters,'' said Carol S. Lyons, dean of the
department of career services at Northeastern University. ``There
are even more jobs now than last year. Obviously the hot market is
high-tech, but if you're any kind of a business major, you're in
fine shape. And even if you're a liberal arts major there are
plenty of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But those in computer sciences are doing best of all. Many
technology companies are offering signing bonuses of $5,000, with
stock options often added on top. One graduate of Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., has taken an $82,000-a-year
job in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   This year's computer science graduates have landed jobs
averaging $48,500, while graduates in accounting average $37,200
and liberal arts graduates, $29,100, according to the National
Association of Colleges and Employers, which represents employers
and college job placement officers.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Lowe, a senior at Stanford who majored in product design
engineering with a minor in computer science, said she would earn
about $60,000 next year with a software company in San Diego, and
that is before the $5,000 signing bonus and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had five job offers, including one from a company in Arizona
that agreed to fly me to San Diego every weekend to visit my
fiance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some university officials see troubles behind this bright
picture. A smaller percentage of students from this year's
graduating class is planning to go to graduate school. At Columbia,
administrators say, about 20 percent of this year's graduating
seniors said they would attend graduate school next year, down from
a high of 70 percent in decades past, usually during recessions.
This trend makes many college officials fear that a smaller, and
possibly less capable, group will choose to become professors.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, university officials say, is that at a time
when educators and government officials see an acute need for more
_ and more talented _ teachers, the lavish starting salaries
offered by the private sector are drawing away potential teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem isn't so much the high-tech salaries, but the
level of teacher salaries,'' said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president
of the American Council on Education, an association of 3,500
colleges and universities. ``Can you imagine a high school teacher
of physics or mathematics receiving a paycheck that might be
$25,000 a year, as opposed to the $50,000 or $75,000 in a
comparable role in business? It's a tough choice for a young person
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Some college officials say a bidding war between technology
companies, investment banks and consulting firms has pushed salary
offers to record levels, with average salaries jumping nearly 20
percent from three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In one unusual episode, several Columbia students who had
accepted $45,000-a-year jobs from a New York bank were delighted
this spring when the bank, fearing it would lose them to
competitors, announced that it was raising their starting salaries
to $55,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if the starting salaries for this year's college
graduates are the same as that MBAs were receiving seven years
ago,'' said Margaret O'Hara, a senior consultant with the Hanigan
Consulting Group, which advises scores of companies on hiring
college graduates. ``What's happened in the past few years is we've
gone from being employer-centric to being employee-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   At Northeastern University this year, there were 440 job
recruiters, up from 400 the year before. At the University of
Michigan, 170 employers made presentations selling themselves to
students, up from 120 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many employers chasing too few students,''
said Patricia Rose, director of career services at the University

<P>
   Frustrated that there are not enough qualified college
graduates, many high-technology companies have pressed President
Clinton to nearly double, to 200,000, the number of annual visas
for skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say the high demand for skilled workers has
created improper dealings. Some companies, eager to catch their
prey, have made what are called ``exploding offers'' _ students are
told they have 24 hours to accept a job offer or the offer
disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Pressured by such offers, students accept and, after continuing
to look or after stumbling upon something more attractive, a few
renege on those offers and take other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some downsides to this wonderful market,'' said
Robert Thirsk, director of career development services at Stanford.
``Exploding offers put students in a very precarious position. We
tell these companies, `You put the student in a difficult situation
of having to make a decision like that. What do you think they're
going to do?' When students renege on offers, it's usually because
they haven't been given enough time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has told employers that, beginning this fall, companies
that recruit on campus must give students at least three weeks to
respond to job offers.
</P>
<P>
   The giddy job situation at colleges is giddier yet at business
schools. There, $25,000 signing bonuses are common, and some
companies fly not just prospective employees, but their spouses,
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Cochrane, director of career services at the Tuck School of
Business at Dartmouth, said the average base salary for this year's
MBA graduates was $90,000, up from $80,000 last year. She said
overall median first-year compensation was actually $135,000, after
adding in signing bonuses, a guaranteed first-year bonus and
employers' paying a student's second-year business school tuition.

EXOTIC DISEASES LOOM LARGE, TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM COMMON
HEALTH THREATS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif., Md.)  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seems summer is finally here, and with it the fear
of flying insects. It puzzles public health officials, this
obsession with mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Although few of them carry the West Nile virus that killed seven
people and sickened 62 others in the metropolitan region last year,
New Yorkers can be singularly obsessed with the insects. The Health
Department gets frantic calls when they fly into homes. Some New
Yorkers have been known to call their local emergency room when
stung. Suburbanites have vowed to spend the entire summer under
netting.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, if you will, the tick. Ticks carry Lyme disease; more
residents of New York state get Lyme disease than those of any
other state. Ticks also carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a
disease not associated with the five boroughs that nonetheless
sickens a handful of city dwellers each year. Yet that media buzz
in your ears is from the mosquito, not the tick.
</P>
<P>
   And don't even get health care workers started on the lack of
interest in the vaccine that staves off a wholly preventable
seasonal illness that kills roughly 3,000 New Yorkers a year: the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the West Nile virus, which can cause encephalitis and was
unknown in the Western Hemisphere before last year, exemplifies the
increasing challenges to public health departments in large cities
like New York.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, health care workers have to be ever alert for
diseases new to the region and have to find ways to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we are seeing more exotic diseases,'' said Dr.
Marcelle C. Layton, the assistant commissioner for communicable
diseases of the New York City Health Department. ``West Nile is an
awakening that although these things are uncommon, they do happen
and we need to keep our eyes on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, those same workers must turn the public's
attention to the seemingly eradicated or more mundane diseases that
emerge each year. New York's population, which grows more diverse
each year, has its share of both.
</P>
<P>
   And so an interesting paradox has emerged: while the technology
used to identify and treat diseases has become increasingly
sophisticated, public health has needed to extend down to the grass
roots, penetrating even the most insular communities, one disease
at a time. ``We could create the best and most advanced
surveillance system in the world,'' said Dr. Stephen M. Ostroff, an
epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
in Atlanta. ``And despite that, I see no scenario where we can
replace the front-line public health people.''
</P>
<P>
   Take malaria. It has grown at a rapid clip in the last decade.
In 1997, there were 308 cases in New York City, up 227 percent from
1988. It is not easy to transmit. Unlike West Nile, it is carried
by a mosquito that is uncommon in this region. And it needs weeks
of hot, dry air to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in malaria can be almost single-handedly attributed
to people who go back to their home countries and find out the hard
way that they are no longer immune, Layton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the message out to people who came from areas
where the diseases are endemic but who have been here awhile that
their immunity to the illness is lost after a certain number of
years,'' she said, citing African and Indian immigrants as the most
common carriers. ``Children are particularly susceptible, because
they were never immune.'' Earlier this year, the CDC reported three
cases in New York City of meningococcal disease among Muslims
returning from the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of features that are contributing to the
emergence of these pathogens,'' said W. Ian Lipkin, a scientist at
the University of California at Irvine who identified the West Nile
virus in New York last year. Those include a change in the
distribution of disease-carrying insects and animals, global
warming, the movement of certain populations into new areas and an
increase in global trade and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate that we will see more of these diseases,'' Lipkin
said. ``And we need to have ways that we can rapidly recognize and
treat them. HIV came out of jungles and rapidly spread. Hepatitis C
had a similar pattern.''

</P>
<P>
   To find people who may be cut off from the increasingly
fragmented health care system, health care workers have begun to
work more closely with community groups, religious leaders and tiny
advocacy organizations that speak the same language and understand
the cultural issues, like distrust of doctors, that prevent people
from getting care. This effort, known as Turning Point, was started
in 1998 in large part to find groups on the margins of the health
care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really trying to build alliances with organizations who
perform a very important function in a very multicultural
community,'' said Sandra Mullin, a City Health Department
spokeswoman. ``It is in some ways going back to very basic public
health.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, groups are extremely hard to identify. For
example, a rise in tuberculosis cases in the 1980s led health care
workers to focus intensely on the disease, and the number of cases
in New York City fell 33 percent between 1988 and 1998. But this
spring, the disease control centers said it had identified an
outbreak in New York City and Baltimore among young, gay, black,
transgender men who attend balls thrown for their various social
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Finding men who acknowledge being among that group is hard
enough, health care workers said. ``As we move toward TB
elimination, the last cases will be the most difficult,'' said Dr.
Peter McElroy, an epidemiologist at the CDC
</P>
<P>
   In the case of these young men, it was hard for health care
workers to insinuate themselves into that world, said Rosalyne
Blumenstein, the director of the gender identity project at the
Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in Manhattan. It was not
enough for workers to seek out gay men in bars, which worked for a
hepatitis outbreak in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, the public is often much more agitated
about diseases it can do little about, like West Nile, than about
preventing those it can. The flu, for instance, which can be fatal
to the elderly, can usually be avoided with a shot. But each year
flu cases flood the city's emergency rooms, and doctors lament the
number of people who forgo the shot. New York state lags behind the
rest of the nation in pneumococcal immunizations; in New York City,
only 30 percent of the city's residents over 65 get it, according
to data from Ipro, a nonprofit group that studies the quality of
health care.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to immunize children results in avoidable outbreaks of
other illnesses in the region. Last year, in the upstate county of
Chautauqua, a whooping cough epidemic involved more than 250 cases.
Back to why health officials say the tick should get more attention
than the mosquito. ``There may be a public perception that you are
more at risk for a mosquito than a tick,'' said Kristine Smith, a
spokeswoman for the New York State Health Department. But the Culex
pipiens, the type of mosquito that government agencies are devoted
to wiping out, is far less of a menace than ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks carry Lyme disease, which sickened 4,265 New Yorkers last
year, and that does not include the city. They also carry
ehrlichiosis, a bacterial disease that is fairly new to the United
States. The disease sickened over 70 people in the state last year
and can be far more dangerous to elderly patients than West Nile.
``No one really talked about that,'' Smith said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A slow area of low pressure passing through very moist air
across western Arkansas will promote abundant rainfall. Some
locations will receive over 2 inches of rain, with flash flooding
likely, especially in poor drainage locations. Farther to the east,
showers and thunderstorms will bring temporary relief to dry
conditions in the Southeast. Showers and storms will also develop
in the Carolinas along a stationary front, with heavy rain in some
places.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure in the north central Plains will direct showers
into the Great Lakes states. To the east, a front will cross
northern New England, accompanied by clouds and a stray shower,
especially in the mountains. The northeast coast will stay dry as
high pressure pushes offshore. Meanwhile, the Southwestern deserts
will remain hot, with readings over 110 degrees in spots.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ENORMOUS HAIL
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening the town of Oakdale, Wis., was bombarded by
softball-sized hail. Much of the hail measured 4.5 inches in
diameter and most buildings in the town reported roof and window
damage because of the extraordinary fall of hail. Such large hail
requires thunderstorm updrafts of nearly 90 mph to keep the stones
airborne. These fierce upward motions alone would tear the wings
off most planes, to say nothing of what the hail could do to the
body of an aircraft. While aircraft can steer clear of storms,
Oakdale had no place to hide.

5 MONTHS ON JOB, RED CROSS LEADER STEPS UP TO EVOLVING CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ While most international officials of his rank are out
on this city's thriving cocktail party circuit, Jakob Kellenberger,
a courtly but determined former Swiss diplomat, heads home from the
International Committee of the Red Cross early most evenings, since
he customarily starts his days at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kellenberger, 56, has taken the helm of the 137-year-old
International Red Cross at a time when global humanitarian agencies
are facing more challenges than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for ever-dwindling funds is tough; the post-Cold
War world has spawned numerous and increasingly nasty wars; and,
alarmingly, combatants are more suspicious, even contemptuous, of
efforts to ease the hardships of civilians caught in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In just five months on the job, Kellenberger has faced the
challenge of getting his organization back into war-torn Chechnya,
and defusing a potentially devastating dispute over whether an
Israeli contingent can join the International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Returning Red Cross teams to Chechnya was complicated not just
by Russian politics and the chaos inherent in a war zone,
Kellenberger said, but also by the lingering trauma that resulted
from the death by shooting of six Red Cross workers there in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on skills honed from a lifetime in diplomacy, including
six years negotiating Swiss accords with the European Union,
Kellenberger sought guarantees that the Red Cross could return to
Chechnya, where lawlessness had forced it and other relief agencies
to operate mainly in neighboring Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside the offers of meetings with low-level Russian
officials who could not guarantee the Red Cross unfettered access,
Kellenberger said he insisted on meeting Russian President Vladimir
Putin. Finally, Kellenberger said, he hammered out an agreement
allowing Red Cross workers access to prisoners in all detention
centers, where human rights groups say many abuses of detainees
occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one source of satisfaction,'' said the soft-spoken
Kellenberger, interviewed in his office days after visits to the
detainees began.
</P>
<P>
   Kellenberger, chosen for the four-year Red Cross appointment by
a committee of 20 Swiss citizens, prepared for his job with his
customary determination: he said he spent three months visiting
some of the most troubled areas where the Red Cross' 11,000 workers
are posted, including Afghanistan, Colombia, Rwanda and Uganda.
Those travels drove home for him the perils Red Cross workers face
daily in the field, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armed conflicts are increasing again and becoming more
complex,'' Kellenberger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that the degree of cruelty to the civilian
population is increasing. And it's worrying that international
humanitarian organizations have become conscious targets for
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   For an organization that is often the first into conflict zones
and the last out, frayed lines of authority can be dangerous.
Nevertheless, Kellenberger rejects using armed escorts because
their presence means ``we risk not being perceived as really
independent and neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   And maintaining the Red Cross' strict neutrality, and ensuring
others perceive the organization's neutrality, said Kellenberger,
``is essential, at the heart of our mandate.''.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, refraining from publicly taking sides, said
Kellenberger, ``does not mean that we are not talking plain
language to the Russians or the Chechen groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 shootings of the six Red Cross workers in Chechnya
illustrated the challenge the organization continues to face, and
helped provide urgency to the idea for a new emblem, Kellenberger
said, because the Red Cross symbol was challenged by Muslims there
who believed it had religious overtones. The Red Cross emblem is
the Swiss flag with the colors reversed, in use since the 1983
founding of the Red Cross by Switzerland's Henri Dunant.)
</P>
<P>
   Discussion about a new emblem, an idea bandied about for years,
brought Kellenberger to his second thorny problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the new president of the American Red Cross, Dr.
Bernardine Healy, precipitated further urgency to the issue when
she publicly demanded immediate admission of Magen David Adom,
Israel's relief group, which uses a red Star of David as its
emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Although not stated publicly, implications that the Israeli
society's exclusion was rooted in anti-Semitism hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   The International Red Cross, a three-time Nobel Prize winner
known globally for its probity, had already been buffeted by
charges, which surfaced in the 1990s, that it kept quiet about the
Holocaust even though its field workers had documented mass
deportations and executions of Jews in Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans began to withhold contributions from the
International Red Cross and its sister International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which work on disaster
relief, the public debate broke open and threatened to splinter the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, a new process was agreed upon that will probably lead
to approval of a new emblem, most likely a red diamond, by the end
of the year, although Israel has rejected the proposal for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   A new emblem would give Israel and Kazakhstan, which uses
another barred symbol, an alternative emblem and allow them to
join.
</P>
<P>
   Kellenberger said it was ``high time'' that the Israeli society
and others be recognized, and noted that the Israeli group should
also be admitted to the federation, where 60 percent of the 176
member nations must approve any new participant.
</P>
<P>
   While Kellenberger said he does not expect many national
societies to adopt a new emblem, he added, ``In certain contexts,
the International red Cross could be in a situation to use the
diamond.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the future, Kellenberger, the father of two
daughters, said he would like to see the International Red Cross
work more to protect and assist women and girls, adjusting budget
priorities and perhaps recruiting more women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something close to my heart,'' Kellenberg said.

COLUMN: ISLANDS IN THE STREAM OF TRAFFIC PROVIDE AN ESCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not long ago, the two concrete traffic islands in
midtown Manhattan, near Macy's, were symbols of a blighted New
York. Grandly named Herald Square and Greeley Square, they were
cracked slabs set in the midst of cacophonous traffic. There were
scraggly bushes along the edges and some benches, where homeless
people dozed and drug dealers rested between sales.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the little triangles _ shaped like a bow tie, between
32nd and 34th streets at Broadway and Sixth Avenue, one of the
city's most congested intersections _ are another world. At lunch
time on Friday, hundreds of people gathered to sit in the sun or in
the shade of the honeylocust trees, reading, talking, drinking and
eating. They set out their lunches on the small tables and had the
unusual urban luxury of arranging the light wooden chairs however
they wanted _ alone, in big groups, or in twos for intimate
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Though people on all sides are smoking, eating and drinking,
there is no litter at all. The statues _ Horace Greeley and the
goddess Minerva, a clock and bell ringers _ are polished. In a week
or two, there will be two newsstands and cafe kiosks. In a couple
of months, two rare and precious urban commodities are going to be
added, one in each park _ public bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic barrels by, like a waterfall. But the black iron
fences and gates and the greenery along the perimeter _ bushes,
flowers and slender trees _ create a buffer from the honking,
sirens and exhaust fumes. Sounds and smells still penetrate, of
course, but though the islands are right in the middle of the
intersections, they feel like places apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice, to sit on a chair, be a little human,'' said John Marto,
from Jersey City, N.J., who was taking a break from cleaning
garbage chutes. ``You can eat at a table, you don't have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The make-over of Greeley, 13,715 square feet, and Herald, 9,830
square feet, cost $2.25 million. The cost of maintenance _ of
gardening, cleaning and security _ is another $250,000 a year.
Their renovation was planned and carried out, and is being paid
for, by the 34th Street Partnership, a business improvement
district. After years of negotiations between the district and the
city, the two sides came to an agreement in 1996 that allows the
district to manage the parks. The president of the 34th Street
Partnership, Daniel A. Biederman, oversaw a similar renovation of
Bryant Park, which was also rundown and crime-ridden and is now a
thriving gathering spot.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation for the cleanup at Herald and Greeley is obvious.
When traffic is at its peak, 11,000 people walk past 34th Street
and Broadway every hour. To the numerous neighborhood merchants
selling things as varied as Nathan's hot dogs, Kmart jeans and
Macy's mink stoles, all are potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Long a successful shopping hub, the area declined during the
'70s and '80s. In the '90s, the neighborhood's fortunes turned,
with Macy's investment in a $100 million face lift and the opening
of the Manhattan Mall, with more than 100 shops and boutiques.
Greeley and Herald, pleasant and safe, give shoppers a place to
rest before plunging back into the retail crowds, and employees a
shady, breezy spot for lunch breaks. They also contribute to the
new and more expensive images that merchants are cultivating.
</P>
<P>
   Biederman said he applied the lessons of Bryant Park to Herald
and Greeley. The movable chairs are crucial, he said. They allow
people to choose where they want to sit. So far, none has been
stolen, he added. The uniformed security guards are important, too.
Without guards and the feeling of safety they bring, women would
tend to avoid the parks, he said. Studies show that parks that
women avoid quickly become messy and chaotic and are more likely to
have crime.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Seldinger, a security guard, explained the rules: ``No
sitting on the wall. No radios, no music. No feet on chairs or the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   There did not seem to be any rebels among the many visitors to
on Friday. People seemed grateful for the order and serenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be drugs and homeless people,'' said Bob
Nalbone, a manager for a health maintenance organization. ``But
now, with these plantings and chairs, it's very inviting. People
are taking care of it. It's a place you want to come.''

 &HT;    An accomplished, if rigid, maestro, lofty legacy of
accomplishments
 &HT;    By Susan Elliott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been quite a ride. The highs, onstage, could be
exhilarating; the lows, mostly backstage, were demoralizing. And in
between, plenty of controversy. Classical music boring and staid?
Not in Atlanta. Not lately anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 12 seasons, Yoel Levi is stepping down as music
director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. His final musical
statement as the boss begins Friday when he launches a two-week
Beethoven extravaganza that covers all the symphonies and
concertos.
</P>
<P>
   Levi will return in years hence, starting in 2001-02, Robert
Spano's first official season as his successor. Spano, music
director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic and a protege of the Boston
Symphony's Seiji Ozawa, comes to the orchestra with the same kind
of rising-star image that Levi did in 1988. In his tenure, Levi's
biggest gift to the orchestra has been to make it a tighter and
more flexible band than predecessor Robert Shaw's was, hiring some
of the top instrumental talent in the country. But his time also
has been characterized by a certain rigidity, both in his
performances and in his dealings with the musicians. Following in
the footsteps of such a magnanimous humanitarian as Shaw has not
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, the excitement of playing well together
technically just wasn't enough,'' says principal cellist
Christopher Rex, who's been with the orchestra for 21 years. ``A
conductor needs to inspire artistry in the musicians, not merely
control them. Mr. Levi doesn't always seem to be comfortable
dealing with human beings. Unfortunately, the orchestra is made up
of human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the orchestra has been on a decided upswing since late
last year, largely by signing an unprecedented four-year musicians'
contract and by giving Levi the going-away present of a lofty title
_ music director emeritus _ and a very generous salary to go with
it (reportedly $1 million over a five-year period). Both helped end
the turmoil that has surrounded Levi's reign since the mid-1990s.
Spano's appointment also adds to the buoyant spirits at Symphony
Hall. His partnership with the ASO shows every sign of being a
winner, even in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Spano arrives at the ASO at the same age _ 38 _ and the same
caliber of pedigree as his predecessor. Levi had all the right
credentials when he got here, especially his six years of training
with the esteemed Cleveland Orchestra, the last four of which had
been as resident conductor under music director Lorin Maazel. Among
the most highly regarded maestros in the business, Maazel just
celebrated 40 years of collaboration with the self-governed Vienna
Philharmonic, a notoriously picky ensemble when it comes to
conductors. He is a brilliant technician, a consummate orchestra
builder. Levi learned well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that Atlanta had gotten itself a really
hot conductor,'' recalls associate concertmaster Jun-Ching Lin, who
was hired by Levi during his first season. ``When I first got here,
the orchestra sound was very lush and warm and a little over the
top. Yoel was able to tighten that up immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Woods, president of Telarc, the ASO's main record label,
remembers that the consensus on the search committee that chose
Levi was that he would help build the orchestra _ school it in
discipline that would probably be beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   The ASO was relatively young when Levi arrived (founded in 1945,
compared with 1911 for the San Francisco Symphony and 1842 for the
New York Philharmonic). To a large degree, it was still on the
steep learning curve that Shaw began in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw established the ASO's reputation by using the 200-voice ASO
Chorus as its calling card; Levi is largely responsible for
maintaining its profile, mostly by honing the orchestra's ensemble
sound minus the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Shaw's orchestra we were sort of the choral
accompaniment,'' says Dan Dowdakin, who retires this season after
45 years with the ASO. ``We felt that all of the love he was
pouring out was going over our heads to that wonderful chorus
behind us. That made us feel very `accompanimentary.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Levi turned the orchestra around in two ways: by demanding a
more consistent and cleaner sound from his players and by hiring
top-flight talent. Of its 95 players, Levi hired 33. Eighteen of
those are titled positions, such as principal flute or associate
principal clarinet. Says concertmaster Cecilia Arzewski, who left
her job as associate concertmaster in Cleveland to join Levi,
``When I came here in 1990, I felt that this was the most exciting
place for a musician to be.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TOAST OF EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   Levi's skills as an orchestra builder were proven during the
ASO's 1991 European tour. Playing in some of the continent's most
sublime venues _ Vienna's Musikverein, Paris' Salle Pleyel _ the
orchestra largely wowed European audiences and critics. The
Dusseldorf Post equated the ASO with the Big 5 U.S. orchestras
(Chicago, New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Cleveland), while
London's Guardian remarked upon its ``brilliance, bite and
precision of ensemble.''
</P>
<P>
   Today many musicians cite that tour as the high point of Levi's
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, things continued to go well for the Levi-ASO
partnership back home. Some of the CDs were getting good reviews
(Levi's ASO has made 30 recordings for Telarc) and selling
relatively well, especially the 1995 recording of the Mahler Fifth
Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Levi has been willing to try just about any repertoire, other
than the Baroque and the contemporary, and insists on using what is
presumably a photographic memory, memorizing everything he conducts
_ a tiresome gimmick to some, an impressive bit of showmanship to
others. He is at his best when he gets out of the way and lets the
composer speak for himself, as he did with Shostakovich's
gut-wrenching ``Babi Yar'' in March.
</P>
<P>
   And while it would be unfair to compare him to his predecessor,
Levi's primary failing has been a lack of soul or inspiration in
his interpretations. Many miss a certain humanity, passion or sense
of personal submission to the power of the art form at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always hoped that his musical interpretations would grow
and deepen to the level of his technical abilities,'' says Lin.
``But it never seemed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This rigidity began to sour Levi's relationship with his
players. As the 1996 Olympics approached, some felt increasingly
that his demand for precision had become a demand for total control
_ perhaps another reason why his performances missed a sense of
elasticity, of the players ``breathing'' together as a natural
unit. Levi's competency level has never faltered, but too many
performances became unexciting to audiences and predictable for the
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   A TIME OF CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   The mid-'90s were also about the time that Levi's
guest-conducting stints began to drop off, particularly in the
United States. He had by that time conducted at most of the major
orchestras, but was rarely invited to return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the orchestra's debt mounted. In February 1996, the
ASO board announced that six nontenured players would not be
rehired. And while their salaries were subsequently rescued by an
anonymous angel, the damage to morale had been done. An ugly
10-week strike began in the fall of '96, ending just in time for an
East Coast tour in February 1997. The reviews paled compared with
those of the European tour six years earlier. ``Mr. Levi seemed
content to skate over the top,'' The New York Times said in a
largely negative review of the Mahler Sixth.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, Levi announced that he would not
renew his contract beyond the 1999-2000 season. The time was ripe;
the musicians were eager for a change in artistic leadership. Even
if that hadn't been the case, 12 years is a long time for a music
director to stay with an orchestra, at least in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's followers responded loudly. Amid cries of anti-Semitism
and other such accusations, a small but vociferous ``support Levi''
group mobilized to protest his departure, using pickets outside
Symphony Hall and large billboards to canonize him. Within the next
year, Levi suggested he might unresign, causing the board and
musicians to pass separate resolutions to continue the search for a
new conductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Levi support group did Mr. Levi any
favors,'' Rex says in retrospect, ``and I don't think it did the
orchestra any favors. By protesting his leaving, it only begged the
question of whether something was missing. They stirred up a
controversy as though there were some sinister motive, and there
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   That is behind the orchestra now. And though it cast a shadow
over Levi's years, and potentially his future, it by no means
diminishes his contribution. He built an orchestra of which
Atlantans can and should be proud, one that can adapt to virtually
any style from epic Mahler in Symphony Hall to singing strings at
Chastain Park Amphitheatre. He leaves behind an ensemble of winning
players just waiting to become a winning team. Robert Spano is a
lucky man, and Levi is largely responsible for that good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A LEVI TIMELINE

Orchestra. His first concert is broadcast live on Atlanta
television.

and ASO Chorus in national broadcast; ASO and ASO Chorus perform in
Opening Ceremonies of 1996 Olympics; Levi conducts ASO in four

EWING HAS BECOME A CONVENIENT ALIBI FOR THE KNICKS' TROUBLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: D.C., Fla.)  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing was alone, as usual. While his
teammates shook hands with a group of Indiana Pacers players
fluttering around the floor like paper dolls, Ewing disappeared
into the tunnel by himself Friday night. While the rest of the New
York Knicks gathered their things and left Madison Square Garden
after their elimination, he leaned back in his locker as if
retreating into an isolation booth.
</P>
<P>
   He just stared ahead, lost in thought. Then a timer went off. He
snapped to attention, peeled the ice bags off his joints and tossed
one after another into a pile until it resembled a sandbag wall
built to stop a flood. Just another barrier in the locker room,
another visual to his solitary existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Patrick, he doesn't say much to us,'' Marcus Camby
has said on a number of occasions this season. ``He doesn't talk to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But plenty was said about him this past week, some of it by the
very players who, like so many outside the team, have little
sympathy for an aging and aloof superstar on the decline. In the
aftermath of the Knicks' Game 6 loss that gave the Pacers the
Eastern Conference title, 4-2, the players offered up only
transparent appreciation for Ewing. All the buzz phrases flowed:
He's a warrior, he's gutsy, he's not to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair for people to criticize him, but that's life,''
Allan Houston ventured. ``Not everyone is going to praise you.
You'll have some critics. You do the best you can, and that's what
Patrick does.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last week, through innuendo and whispers, several
players said the team was slowed down, held back and stylistically
cramped with Ewing on the floor against the Pacers. Even Latrell
Sprewell let the repetition of the popular stat _ the Knicks were
5-1 over two playoff runs against the Pacers without Ewing _ seep
into his logic. ``Numbers don't lie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if the numbers are misleading or if their
theories are flawed. While it is the players' fault if they stand
around in Ewing's presence _ sticking him with bail-out jumpers on
the shot-clock, loitering in the background while he rebounds,
failing to drive the lane when he is on the floor _ the perception
has become reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has become a mental albatross. If the team believes he
weighs it down, then he does. If he has become the convenient alibi
for the team's failure, maybe the excuse has to be removed. The
team has grown weary of the reclusive Ewing. And at times, Ewing
has been fed up with the organization's thin show of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the general manager, Scott Layden, had a brief
conversation with the Washington Wizards about trading Ewing back
to a city that would embrace him for the Georgetown hero he was and
the Hall of Fame player he is sure to be. Now, with one year left
on Ewing's $68 million deal, one Eastern Conference official said
the team will explore that option again. Ewing has a right of
refusal in his contract. But there are likely two teams he would
agree to play for: Miami and Washington. The Wizards make the most
sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards will be searching for salary cap space for the
summer of 2001, and Ewing's $16 million salary next season would
fall off their payroll. Until the team has money to spend on free
agents, Michael Jordan's cache means nothing. In return, the Knicks
would have to take Juwan Howard or Rod Strickland, plus some dead
weight from the Wizards. There are luxury tax issues that would
come with Howard, but the Knicks might find a creative way to lower
their burden. If not this deal, then some move will be made by the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long summer,'' said Chris Childs, who is
eternally on the trading block. ``Management will do what they do
and make decisions. Whatever decisions they make, they'll make. We
had an opportunity this year, and we didn't cash in on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival late last summer, Layden kept a low profile,
remained a barely audible and hardly visible executive, and did
nothing to improve the Knicks before the trade deadline. With a
season that did not live up to expectations _ as extreme as they
were _ decisions have to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Do they trade the fragile Camby or trust him as their starting
center if Ewing is hurt or in another team's jersey? Do they
re-sign the temperamental Kurt Thomas or let him go? Do they make a
bid for John Starks or look for another 3-point threat in reserve
clothing? Do they address the structural flaw they have with
Sprewell at small forward or leave him as a compliment to Houston?
Do they believe in Charlie Ward the playoff hero or fear he will
revert to his regular-season inconsistency?
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the Knicks have to find more value from their
roster. Coach Jeff Van Gundy's seven-man rotation in the playoffs
eventually created conditions that were ripe for injuries.
Throughout the playoffs, the Knicks' roster looked like a storage
area for outdated parts. On the end of the bench, there were
uplifting chemistry guys, but how much could David Wingate and
Andrew Lang help in the end? Once the young but unused John Wallace
did dust himself off to play in Game 4 against Indiana, he was not
able to function on command.
</P>
<P>
   In an ill-fated, Van Gundy-supported signing that did not work,
Wallace was the only notable move the Knicks made last summer. This
summer, it is up to Layden to upgrade the team. He is reputed to be
a draft guru able to pluck talent ready for action instead of a
project player like the Knicks' lost Frenchman, Frederick Weis. As
last year's 15th pick overall, Weis may never see Madison Square
Garden without a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   As Utah's architect, Layden did not have to take many
free-agency risks with Karl Malone and John Stockton working their
illusive bob-and-weave, pick-and-roll to the delight of Jazz fans.
Layden could bide his time without pressure. In New York, patience
snuffs out careers. Coach Pat Riley could unearth his Holy Grail by
nabbing a great shooting guard, Philadelphia might only get better,
Toronto may discover peace amid its dysfunction and Orlando coach
Doc Rivers could lure Tim Duncan from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks cannot afford to stay put with a roster dotted with
deteriorating veterans, like Ewing, Larry Johnson and Chris Childs,
and filled with likable but inconsistent stars, like Camby, Houston
and Sprewell. After last year's run to the finals, the Knicks
trusted the expiration date on the magic potion they thrived on
last season would last through the third week of June this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the potion curdled Friday night, just before 10 p.m. At that
moment, Ewing slipped away from the Pacers-infused commotion on his
home court. As a punctuation to his inglorious departure, he was
heckled upon his exit. Who will they berate if he is gone? Who will
his teammates have to blame?  &QL;

FIRING OF RIVER GROUPS' LEADERS IGNITES A FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT WORTH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Pataki administration ordered the chairmen of the
state's two Hudson River Greenway organizations last week to fire
their executive directors and several board members, an action that
has angered environmentalists and prompted a backlash by state
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the two groups' boards said the administration's
effort to oust the two directors had introduced politics into a
program whose success had depended on its bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Saturday Night Massacre,'' said Harriet Cornell,
a Democratic member of the Rockland County Legislature who is one
of the board members being singled out for dismissal. ``Here is a
successful program that has managed to keep politics out, that has
managed to work with conservationists, hunters, all kinds of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly members Richard Brodsky and Susan John, both Democrats,
announced on Thursday that they intended to hold hearings on the
matter to determine who ordered the firings and on what grounds,
and whether further measures were necessary to ensure the
Greenway's freedom from political interference.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups, known jointly as the Hudson River Valley
Greenway, were created in 1991 to coordinate environmental
planning, foster tourism and assist communities through grants in
13 counties bordering the Hudson, from Waterford in Saratoga County
to Battery Park in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maurice Hinchey of Saugerties, who wrote the Greenway
legislation as a state assemblyman, said it was deliberately
written to avoid partisan politics. ``It's going to be very
detrimental to the Hudson Valley over the next several years if
this goes through as it's been laid out,'' he said. ``To very
precipitously and unceremoniously remove these people without
presenting any rationale undermines confidence in the program and
jeopardizes its fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   The two directors had consistently received positive reviews
from their boards and have not been given a reason for their
dismissal. Both have served in their positions since the Greenway's
inception. David Sampson, director of the Hudson River Valley
Greenway Communities Council, is a Democrat, and Maggie
Vinciguerra, director of the Greenway Conservancy for the Hudson
River Valley, is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson cited what he considered one possible reason for their
removal. He and Vinciguerra attended a presentation on Hudson
Valley programs earlier this year by Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of
housing and urban development and a potential political rival to
Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The directorships each pay $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the chairmen of the two groups were directed by Pataki
administration officials either to fire their executive directors
or to have their boards do so at their next joint meeting, on June
7.
</P>
<P>
   A Pataki spokesman, Michael McKeon, said, ``We believe new
leadership will bring new energy and vitality to the greenway and
make it even better than it is today.'' He added that Pataki had
been a co-sponsor of the Greenway's founding legislation in 1991
and had consistently supported its mission.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said the administration had told the boards of the two
groups of its intentions some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew Bender IV, chairman of the Greenway Conservancy,
said he was astonished by the instructions when he was called in to
speak to the governor's appointments officials on May 24. He said
he told them that he saw no reason to fire his executive director,
Vinciguerra, and that he would have to speak to the conservancy
board about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bender was himself dismissed from his post by Pataki
administration officials, a move that provoked further anger from
legislators and local environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Kevin Plunkett, a lawyer and a member of
the Westchester County chapter of the League of Conservation
Voters, said McKeon. Plunkett is the brother of William Plunkett, a
partner at Pataki's former law firm, Plunkett &AMP; Jaffe, of White
Plains.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a coup d'etat,'' said Andrew Mele, executive director
of Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, an environmental watchdog group.
``Greenway is being transformed from a legitimate regional
organization to just a political tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pataki's proposed successor to Sampson, Barbara
Murphy, has been criticized as inappropriate because of her links
to a development project. Murphy is one of three principal
investors in Riverbanks, a multimillion-dollar condominium project
in Cold Spring that has drawn opposition from local residents. The
Greenway Council has played a role in negotiating the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   If Murphy becomes the council's director, she will be in charge
of the group that is negotiating the dispute over her own project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a flagrant conflict of interest,'' said Mele.
</P>
<P>
   No successor to Vinciguerra has been named.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan to replace the directors appears likely to
succeed, with a majority of votes on the boards of both Greenway
groups nearly certain, said Barnabas McHenry, the chairman of the
Greenway Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council and the conservancy have a combined operating budget
of about $1.1 million a year. They jointly manage the programs of
the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, designated by
Congress in 1996.

TURKISH STUDY FINDS TORTURE OF PRISONERS IS WIDESPREAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to add note to editors; no other changes)   (This story, originally slugged TURKEY-RIGHTS, was sent and held
May 31. It is now restored.)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ When a harsh report asserting that torture is
widespread in Turkey was released last week, the surprise was not
just the amount of damning evidence it contained, but also the
source.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being prepared by a private advocacy group, the
report was the work of the parliamentary committee on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Turkish leaders have sought to play down accusations
that torture is widely practiced here. That will be harder after
what the parliamentary committee found.
</P>
<P>
   Its report contains transcripts of interviews with many
prisoners who said they had been abused. It also includes photos of
torture equipment and floor plans that show where torture cells are
supposedly located in various police stations. No report by a
government human rights body has ever been nearly this extensive or
graphic.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members and investigators interviewed more than 8,500
prisoners over two years. They also conducted unannounced visits to
50 prisons and two dozen police stations, said the vice chairman,
Sebgetullah Seydaoglu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee has existed for seven years but it hasn't been
functioning properly,'' said Seydaoglu, who represents the
southeastern city of Diyarbakir, where the mostly Kurdish
population has long complained of bad treatment by police. ``In the
last year we've become very decisive about our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, members of the committee presented a copy of their
report to the minister of justice, Hikmet Sami Turk. Afterward he
said the report would ``hold up a light for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Torture is a crime against humanity,'' Turk said. ``Turkey
will resolve this issue. No country can justify torture on the
grounds that other countries practice it. Claims of torture will be
followed up with resolve. Torture has never been and never will be
state policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says that when inmates of Istanbul's main women's
prison were interviewed, ``all recounted details of the torture and
abuse they suffered.'' Most prisoners interviewed at jails in the
eastern cities of Sanliurfa, Erzurum and Erzincan told similar
stories.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders have repeatedly told their Turkish counterparts
that Turkey must improve its human rights record if it hopes to
join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department said in its latest human rights report
that during 1999 ``torture, beatings and other abuses by security
forces remained widespread, at times resulting in deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates are unhappy with the government's record.
The bluntness of the new parliamentary report suggests that
impatience for change is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report says what we have been saying for years, that
torture is extensive and systematic in Turkey,'' said Nazmi Gur,
chairman of the Human Rights Association, which has often been at
odds with the government. ``This could be the beginning of progress
toward meeting European legal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have expressed fear of what might happen if the
Turkish police are forced to abandon their traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are happy with the performance of the police,'' the
deputy interior minister, Sami Sonmez, asserted at a parliamentary
hearing last year. ``The police are capable of extracting
confessions from the culprits. What's the use of creating a lot of
fuss as long as public opinion endorses what the police do?''

SMALL PARTIES ISSUE ENDORSEMENTS, ALONG PARTY LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With as much relief as enthusiasm, New York's
Conservative and Liberal parties reverted to type Saturday,
endorsing Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton, respectively, for
the Senate, after both parties had endured a queasy several months
that left their nominations in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   At the Intercontinental Hotel in Manhattan, the Liberal Party
went some distance toward mending its frayed relationship with its
traditional ally, the Democratic Party, by throwing its support
behind Clinton for the Senate. And Conservative Party delegates met
here, where they were to nominate Lazio, the Republican candidate,
cementing their longtime alliance with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Liberal Party leader Raymond B. Harding repeatedly
noted that Lazio was more conservative than the man he replaced as
the Republican candidate, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Their
remarks continued the struggle by the two candidates to claim the
political middle ground, and to paint each other as extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways my views are closer to those of the mayor than
those of my opponent,'' Clinton said. ``He is out of step with the
mainstream,'' she said of Lazio. ``My views are centrist views,
positive views,'' she added at a brief press conference at which
she referred to herself as a centrist no fewer than four times.
</P>
<P>
   Harding cited a long list of popular Democrats his party has
supported, like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Hugh Carey and Robert F.
Kennedy, and noted that when it has supported Republicans for
statewide office, they have been widely revered centrists like
Fiorello La Guardia and Jacob Javits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to put Lazio at the end of that litany and it jars the
ear,'' he said. ``Put Hillary there and it fits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party's backing could be both an aid and a
burden to Lazio. Unlike the Liberals, the Conservatives still hew
to an ideology in keeping with their name, taking strong stands
against abortion, gay rights, affirmative action and big
government. And the party's ready embrace of Lazio as a real
conservative stands in contrast to its rejection of Giuliani as too
moderate, and could undermine Lazio's claim to being the centrist
in this race.
</P>
<P>
   Both minor parties are small _ the Conservative Party has fewer
than 2 percent of the state's registered voters, and the Liberal
Party fewer than 1 percent _ but they wield an influence beyond
their size. The major parties must play to them, because each of
the smaller parties presents a choice between closing ranks and
facing a challenger who can provide an outlet for protest votes. In
recent statewide elections, Republican candidates have pulled as
many as 300,000 votes on the Conservative line, while Democrats
often get well over 100,000 on the Liberal line.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As long as Giuliani was the presumptive Republican nominee, the
race had both minor parties in turmoil. The Liberals, whose
longstanding support of the mayor had alienated many Democrats,
faced a pitched internal battle over which side to take. Though
some Conservative Party leaders favored Giuliani, the party
chairman, Michael Long, had vowed that it would not support the
mayor because he was not far enough to the right, especially on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials acknowledged that nominating their own candidate
would undermine the mayor and damage their relationship with the
Republicans, and that they were having some trouble finding a
viable candidate of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But when Giuliani dropped out of the race last month, and the
Republicans nominated Lazio instead, the battle lines became clear
and the Liberals and Conservatives fell into their comfortable old
roles. Lazio supports legal abortion, but unlike Clinton _ and
Giuliani _ he opposes government funding for it, and he backs a ban
on what anti-abortion groups call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   One important question about the November ballot remains
unanswered: Who will be the nominee of the Independence Party, now
the state's largest minor party, with a shade more registered
voters than the Conservatives?
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party, the New York arm of the Reform Party
founded by Ross Perot, has been roiled by a seesaw battle for
control between two factions. One is aligned with the party's
founder, B. Thomas Golisano, the two-time candidate for governor;
the other is aligned with this year's oddest political pairing, Pat
Buchanan, the conservative commentator and likely Reform candidate
for president, and Lenora Fulani, known for her far-left politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said she will not share a ticket with Buchanan, and
Saturday, she chastised Lazio for saying he would attend the
Independence Party's nominating convention, to be held Monday just
outside Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Party officials have seemed to be leaning toward
Giuliani, but they are unsure what to think of Lazio. They have
said they may hold a primary between Clinton and Lazio, nominate
one of them outright, or choose their own challenger.

AFTER 13 YEARS, BIRD IS BACK IN THE FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His face red, his adrenaline still going, Larry Bird overflowed
with nostalgia and satisfaction. ``An unbelievable feeling,'' he
said on Friday night after his Indiana Pacers made franchise
history and dispatched the Knicks in Game 6 of the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long, I forgot what it's like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bird, it was like old times. His team was going to the
finals, possibly to Los Angeles, to play against Magic Johnson's
old team. ``Don't matter what the odds are,'' he used to say during
his playing days. ``You get to the finals, it's one big roll of the
dice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, listenin' to Magic coach that team out there for a
while, we may have a shot at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed for a few seconds before he caught himself, as if
realizing he was the only one who thought he was funny. Every one
around him broke up the room.
</P>
<P>
   Bird sat in the back of the training-room area, adjacent to the
visitor's locker room at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. He
had slung off his coat, unfastened his tie, unbuttoned the top
button of his cream-colored dress shirt and began to enjoy the
solitude of a beer and another trip to the finals _ his first since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching is completely different than playing,'' he said.
``Playing is the ultimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Havin' that ball in your hands, makin' plays, goin' on the
road for a big playoff game. Winnin'. That's the ultimate. I'm just
so happy for a lot of our older players, they finally get to play
for a world championship.
</P>
<P>
   His Midwestern drawl still makes world championship sound like
``wurld champeen-ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, no? Over the past 20 years, The Hick from French Lick
became Larry Legend, just as Larry Legend eventually morphed into
Coach Bird. A little of each persona still remains. The broken
English from a Southern Indiana farm. The competitive drive of a
Hall of Fame Celtic. And that helpless feeling that no matter how
much you want it, if your desire does not transfer to your players,
the season is lost.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the job in 1997, Bird said: ``There's somethin'
about this team I like. I can't quite put my finger on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, the Pacers were an extension of Bird. There was
Reggie Miller's swagger and 3-point dagger. Mark Jackson's sleight
of hand. Chris Mullin's craftiness, the way the veteran understood
angles and trajectories like only someone who had spent his life
shooting alone in a dead-quiet gymnasium could. Dale Davis'
tenacity. Jalen Rose's fearlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Slow of foot, blessed with skill, they were all pieces of Bird.
So much of him was in them.
</P>
<P>
   Everything except his will. Because in the crucible moments _ in
Game 6 against the Knicks last season and Game 7 against Chicago in
1998 _ they did not want to go to the finals as much as Larry Bird
did.
</P>
<P>
   He had watched the Pacers implode in the playoffs enough to
build up a mounting frustration, a feeling that they were never
going to summon the same resolve he had had as a player. After
their 0-2 Memorial Day weekend in New York, Bird spoke of his
players with almost a rueful detachment, saying things like,
``That's the one thing that really kills me about 'em, that lack of
a killer instinct'' or ``When I went into a playoff game, I never
thought I was goin' to lose. I just thought I'd win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that they were going down, internal strife circling, he
was challenging them like he once challenged his beleaguered Boston
teammates after a playoff loss. ``We need 12 heart transplants in
this locker room,'' Bird once said.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as if the legend wanted to remain above the fray
in case the coach failed, that, damn it, Larry Bird was not going
to let this soft bunch of players toy with his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment he watched them almost throw their season away
again _ watched the rejuvenated Knicks open a 37-19 bulge on the
Pacers before a fed-up, jeering crowd at Conseco Fieldhouse in Game
5 _ his perception about his team changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back from that 18-point deficit in Game 5, I seen
a different team,'' Bird said. ``I really did, the best I seen
since I been here. They fought, they scrapped. They finally
believed in what we was trying to do here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see. God, I been so happy for 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   They parlayed that Game 5 comeback into a clinching Game 6
victory at the Garden, a victory that left Miller in the arms of
Rose, pumping his bony but lethal wrist, a victory that left Bird
beaming. The Pacers now had his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thing is, in the first half we were moving the basketball so
well,'' he said. ``It was unbelievable. All you can ask for is good
looks at the basket. And we had `em.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought about that for a moment and smiled. ``This poor
franchise has been there five times or somethin' _ couldn't get
through,'' Bird said. ``I'm so happy for 'em. I'm so happy for
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   When yer from the country, change comes awfully slow. Sometimes
it takes a while for the corn to sprout and grow. But on Friday
night at the Garden, in big, ol' New York City, Larry Bird's team
won and again is goin' to play for a wurld champeen-ship. Who
knows, they might just end up in L.A., where he and Magic last spun
the world on their fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it,'' he said, shaking his head. ``They did it. It's
goin' to be great going back to the finals. It's been ... 13
years.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: D . A . 'S IMAGE SUFFERS AS HER SPOUSE GOES ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ ``Al!'' Jeanine Pirro scolded her naughty
husband. ``Al!''
</P>
<P>
   There he went again, stepping just a wee bit over the line.
Defying instructions not to talk about his tax fraud trial, he was
entertaining reporters with sarcastic analysis of federal charges
that he had neglected to report a wee bit over $1 million in
personal income. ``Al!'' she scolded, with a smile. ``Zip it.''
</P>
<P>
   But on went Al, with Jeanine scolding and smiling at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirros are well practiced as Westchester County's leading
song-and-dance team. Even with the Clintons-come-lately in
Chappaqua, the Pirros own the stage here. Albert J. Pirro Jr., a
leading real estate lawyer and Republican lobbyist, has long been
the man to see in Westchester. And Jeanine F. Pirro, a judge and
now district attorney, has long been the woman to avoid. He could
make you. She could break you.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro openly promoted his wife's political career, but they
worked to maintain an appearance of parallel lines of power: He had
his business, she had hers. But those lines are converging in
Pirro's tax-fraud trial in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Pirro is not on trial. Albert Pirro and his brother,
Anthony, an accountant, are accused of charging $1.2 million of
Albert Pirro's personal expenses to his various businesses and
illegally deducting them as business expenses. But in the
prosecutors' dramatization, Jeanine Pirro is the leading lady, and
hardly Caesar's wife at that.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro's companies allegedly paid some of Jeanine Pirro's
political consultants. A private aide testified that Jeanine Pirro
had her send some personal bills to Albert Pirro's office, which
paid (and allegedly deducted) them through his businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One of Albert Pirro's companies owned the Mercedes-Benz his wife
drove, and claimed deductions for it, despite a circuitous paper
trail that made it appear she had paid for it, prosecutors say. An
investigator in Jeanine Pirro's office, who moonlights as a
security consultant, was hired on the side by Albert Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution says Albert Pirro essentially deducted life as a
business expense. And what a life it was _ fancy cars, a vacation
home, big dinners, small planes, cigars, even a dalliance that
produced a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a crime to have expensive tastes,'' a prosecutor,
Cathy Seibel, assured the jury in opening arguments. But it makes
good testimony in a dry tax case. The government casts Jeanine
Pirro, Westchester's chief law-enforcement officer, as procurer in
chief of items her husband improperly deducted.
</P>
<P>
   Her name came up in testimony by a man who had made an $1,800
wrought-iron pen for the Pirros' Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs. A
gallery employee said Mrs. Pirro had commissioned a $4,450 portrait
of her children, wanted it in time for a dinner party and sent him
faxes with district attorney's office cover-sheets. A house painter
testified that Jeanine Pirro had deducted $50 from his bill because
he had gotten paint on a carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. told the jury to ignore the
spotted carpet testimony and reminded prosecutors out of the jury's
earshot, ``She's not a defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is a prosecutor and a politician being splattered while
sitting loyally in the front row of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro has been investigated before and never charged, and
he could beat these charges. His premier legal team portrays him as
a busy man whose finances were handled by other people, including
his brother, and who willingly paid $1 million in back taxes once
told of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Pirro accuses prosecutors of a ``desperate attempt'' to
tie her to the case ``whenever they can.'' Albert Pirro calls the
charges ``character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   He's facing prison if convicted, but his wife's public character
is at risk. Albert Pirro's protection of his wife's image as a
hard-working, straight-arrow, telegenic politician is a theme in
his case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Albert Pirro concocted the Mercedes-Benz
transactions so Jeanine Pirro could ``state, if asked, that she
purchased'' the car, if it became an issue in her race for district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the ``Zoe Baird problem.'' Like President
Clinton's first choice for attorney general, the Pirros apparently
had tax problems with their household help. A political consultant
(paid by one of Albert Pirro's companies) advised Jeanine Pirro to
come clean on her cable television program. The program's expenses
also were paid by a Pirro company.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant said Jeanine Pirro had dealt successfully with
her Zoe Baird problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Al Pirro problem is another matter.

POLITICAL MEMO: IN NEW JERSEY, WINNER MUST LOOK THE PART 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ The state's newspapers are falling in behind Jim
Florio. The party establishment is squarely backing Jon Corzine.
The airwaves are full of nasty commercials about each of the Senate
candidates. So what is a Democratic voter to do?
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey primary season, which culminates in Tuesday's
election, has been the most competitive in a generation. The
retirement of Frank Lautenberg left a Senate seat open for the
first time in decades. And though the Republican primary drew four
reasonably experienced but little-known contenders, the Democratic
contest between Florio, the former governor, and Corzine, who spent
tens of millions to gain name recognition, gave rise to a rarity in
state politics: a match between two genuine household names.
</P>
<P>
   Because the race has been so hard fought and so well publicized,
it has also confronted voters with an unusual number of important
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., arose
as the answer to a search by Democratic officials for an
anyone-but-Florio candidate. Even though Florio remains popular
with many rank-and-file Democrats, he was considered by party
leaders to be unelectable in November because of the memory of a
$2.8 billion tax increase he pushed through the Legislature as
governor in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's appeal to voters, not surprisingly, has been framed as
a choice between an unhappy memory, embodied by Florio, and his own
idealized vision for the future, with strict gun controls and
ambitious new universal programs for health care, education and
long-term care for the elderly and disabled. But to judge from the
attack commercials Corzine has been running for more than a month,
it remains, at its root, a not-Florio campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, too, has naturally cast the race in terms that suit him.
For months, he described the primary as a choice between his 30
years of experience in Congress and state government and Corzine's
naivete.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Florio has seized upon Corzine's campaign
spending, asking voters whether they cared to let Corzine buy the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Voters can seize on only a few issues on which the men hold
opposing views. Corzine opposes the death penalty, and Florio
favors it, for example. And Corzine supports a limited investment
of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market, to extend
the fund's solvency, a position Florio has vilified in the starkest
terms. But the sharp line between the men on this subject was
blurred when it was reported that Florio's and Corzine's positions
were identical as recently as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are more subtle questions, too. A vote for Corzine's
platform, for example _ with its hard-line support for abortion
rights, gay rights, affirmative action, gun control and big
government programs _ would seem to represent an embrace of the
kind of liberalism that has been out of fashion for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, meanwhile, has in many ways made his own campaign a
referendum on the nation's economic boom, warning voters that the
fantastic wealth created by the new economy has momentarily
obscured looming problems on issues like Social Security and
pension financing. Florio has hammered away at Corzine on trade
policy, corporate mergers and government borrowing. In doing so, he
has employed the kind of class-based attacks Democrats frequently
aim at Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one watchword in the primary, however, it is
electability. On the Republican side, voters must pick a contender
for November from a field of four relatively unknown candidates:
William L. Gormley, a veteran state senator from the south; Robert
D. Franks, a four-term congressman from New Jersey's prosperous
midsection; James W. Treffinger, a county executive in
predominantly Democratic Essex County; and Murray Sabrin, a former
Libertarian candidate for governor. In this race, where turnout is
expected to be light, party endorsements are likely to play a heavy
role.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, every attack that Florio and Corzine
employ can be reduced to the idea that only one of them has a
reasonable chance to prevail in November. To Florio, his opponent
is too left-wing, too soft. In Corzine's eyes, Florio is too
combative to win over even the most moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic voters have to ask themselves whether they're
selecting a candidate, be it Florio or Corzine, who can win,'' said
Gerald M. Pomper, a political science professor at Rutgers.
``Primaries are about such practical calculations. After all,
you're selecting somebody to carry the party's banner, not just
somebody you like.''

EXHIBIT WITH NO END IN SIGHT: PICKETING AT MUSEUM OF MODERN ART 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A strike by workers at the Museum of Modern Art has
entered its sixth week with no sign of a settlement in sight. The
two sides have not held face-to-face negotiations since before the
walkout began.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say the strikers are holding strong even though
the museum says 117 of the 250 workers in the bargaining unit have
returned to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are holding up well,'' said Maida Rosenstein,
president of Local 2110 of the United Automobile Workers, which
represents the museum's assistant curators, bookshop workers,
librarians and other administrative workers. ``I think people's
resolve has hardened.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day since the strike began, between 10 and 30 strikers have
stood outside the museum, holding signs and urging tourists not to
visit. But museum officials say the strike has had little effect on
attendance or internal operations.
</P>
<P>
   A mediator with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
checks in periodically with the two sides to see whether they are
prepared to show new flexibility that would make it worthwhile to
bring negotiators together.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are divided over numerous issues, including health
coverage, wages, job security and the union's demand that all new
museum employees be required to join the union or, should they
decide not to join, pay the equivalent of union dues.
</P>
<P>
   That would create what is known as an agency shop, as opposed to
the current open shop, in which workers do not have to join the
union or pay dues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rosenstein said the demand to require museum employees to join
the union or pay dues was needed to strengthen the union and give
it more leverage against management. But museum officials said they
were reluctant to grant that demand because it would give more
power to a union that they say has irresponsible leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not shown itself to be a union whose strength the
museum wants to increase,'' said Robert Batterman, the museum's
chief negotiator. ``This has shown itself to be a union that's
destructive and not to be trusted. The museum is not looking to
increase its strength and its sway over the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the union's leadership has been dishonest in presenting
management's bargaining offers to the rank and file _ a charge that
Rosenstein vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>
   Batterman predicted that if the union dropped its demand for an
agency shop, the two sides would soon be able to settle their other
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstein said the museum had rejected the union's demand for
an agency shop because the museum wanted to prolong the strike to
weaken the union. She argued that the museum was being inconsistent
in not granting that demand when the six other unions at the
museum, including those representing guards, janitors and
engineers, had contracts requiring workers to join the union or pay
dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of simple fairness,'' Rosenstein said. ``If
people are hired into union jobs, they ought to be part of the
union. They get all the benefits of the contract. We have to
negotiate for them and represent them.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that when those workers who did not belong to the
union filed a grievance, the union had to represent them, a
sometimes expensive process that could involve hiring lawyers to
handle arbitrations.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials said the high percentage of workers who had
returned to their jobs showed that the strike was not going well
for the union. But Rosenstein said it was to be expected that many
employees would return to work because they were not required to
join the union. In most strikes, unions can penalize members who
cross the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had agency shop in the beginning, we certainly wouldn't
have had to go on strike for this long,'' said Eden Schulz, a
worker in the museum's permissions department. ``They would have
known that 250 members of the bargaining unit would walk out.''
</P>
<P>
   Batterman said that since the bargaining unit, known as the
Professional and Administrative Staff Association, was formed 30
years ago, the workers had not been required to join the union. He
said there was no need to change that system, saying it had worked
well.
</P>
<P>
   Batterman said that most employees did not join the union,
except in the months just before contract negotiations. ``Half the
staff doesn't want to be forced to join at any given time, and
that's not going to change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstein said the museum was being anti-union for rejecting
the agency shop demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Batterman said, ``The museum is the furthest thing from an
anti-union employer. This is a matter of history and tradition.
This staff insisted on an open shop when it unionized. It's become
part of tradition, and the museum is not going to require people to
support the union.''
</P>
<P>
   One assistant curator, who crossed the picket line and harshly
criticizes the union's leadership, said that management was being
shortsighted in rejecting the agency shop demand.
</P>
<P>
   This curator, who insisted on anonymity, said that if all
workers had to join the union, then many moderating voices at odds
with the union's leadership would then belong to the union, causing
the union to be more moderate in negotiations and reducing the
likelihood and length of a strike.

COMPROMISE BILL IS SOUGHT OVER FIRE-SAFE CIGARETTES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Legislative leaders and Gov. George Pataki are in
intensive talks on a bill to require less flammable cigarettes _ a
compromise to replace a bill that Pataki vetoed late last month _
while the Assembly seriously considers a vote to override that
veto.
</P>
<P>
   With just two weeks left until the Legislature is scheduled to
adjourn for the year, the Senate and the Assembly are trying to
accommodate concerns raised by Pataki, whose May 24 veto caught
both houses by surprise. The sticking point has been the governor's
insistence that along with the bill on fire safety, the Legislature
approve his separate measure to combat cigarette bootlegging and
Internet sales of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Assembly's Democratic majority _ and, less
vocally, some Republican legislators _ have accused the governor, a
Republican, of inventing reasons to veto the bill and protect
tobacco industry interests. They say that he ignored or opposed
previous bills that dealt with bootlegging and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get something done, but the governor's hypocrisy on
this issue is making it hard,'' said Assemblyman Alexander Grannis,
D-Manhattan, the bill's chief sponsor in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Grannis is pushing for the Assembly to vote Monday on a motion
to override the veto, and aides to the Assembly speaker, Sheldon
Silver, say he is inclined to agree. The Assembly Democrats will
meet on Monday to decide how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   An override vote would be no more than a symbolic step _ a very
public, and relatively rare, slap at the governor _ because the
Republican-controlled Senate would not go along. And Republicans in
the Senate and in the governor's office warn that it could be
counterproductive, making a compromise less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to getting a bill this session that the
governor can sign,'' said Michael McKeon, the governor's
communications director. ``Instead of posturing, let's move forward
with good, comprehensive legislation that ensures that we have
fire-safe cigarettes and cracks down on bootlegging.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Assembly and the Senate passed a bill that would
have made New York the first state to set fire-safety standards for
cigarettes. The bill would have required that by 2002, all
cigarettes sold in the state stop burning when they are not being
puffed on. Advocates said the measure would have saved dozens of
lives and prevented hundreds of fires each year, and would have put
pressure on Congress to adopt national fire-safety standards for
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Over a month later, in the last two days he had to act on the
bill, the governor raised several objections and linked the measure
to his bill on bootlegging and Internet sales. In the end, he and
legislative leaders could not resolve all their differences, and he
vetoed the fire-safety bill.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies opposed the bill, saying that state-by-state
standards would be a burden for them. Anti-tobacco groups say the
industry's real concern is that if cigarettes do not burn
continuously, smokers might use fewer of them, cutting down on
sales. The less flammable cigarettes do not cost more to make.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are working on a compromise bill, and officials in
all three camps say they are likely to reach agreement soon. At the
governor's request, the bill would give cigarette companies six
months, rather than 30 days, to comply with fire-safety standards
once they are published, and would provide for fines for retailers
who sell noncomplying cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In another bow to Pataki, the compromise bill would also require
the state to make a finding that the new cigarettes posed no more
of a health risk to smokers than the old kind. ``The information we
have indicates that that is not really an issue, but we'll address
it anyway,'' said Sen. Frank Padavan of Queens, the chief Senate
sponsor of the bill. ``We want to come up with a bill that he
cannot veto.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of the bill on bootlegging and Internet sales
remains murky. Senate leaders have signaled that they will pass the
governor's bill, while Assembly Democrats and aides to Silver say
they are not sure what the Assembly will do.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pataki's bill would prohibit mail-order sellers, like those on
the Internet, from shipping cigarettes directly to individuals.
Such sales methods evade payment of the state's $1.11-per-pack
cigarette tax, the nation's highest, and can be used by minors to
buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the governor would require that the seller ship the
cigarettes to a licensed retailer, like a corner liquor store.
There, the buyer, after showing proof of age and paying the tax,
could pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   Bootlegging, the shipping of cigarettes into New York without
payment of state taxes, has become a bigger problem since the state
doubled its tax in March. Pataki has contended that smokers may not
like fire-safe cigarettes, encouraging still more bootlegging.
Backers of the bill dispute that, pointing to tobacco industry
studies that show that smokers cannot tell the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But legislators in both parties say that the governor showed no
interest in a variety of anti-bootlegging bills proposed in recent
years, and that he quietly opposed some.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Assemblyman Jeff Klein of the Bronx introduced a bill
to ban Internet sales of cigarettes, for the same reasons the
governor gave for his bill this year. The administration sent him a
letter in opposition to his bill, calling it illegal, but giving no
indication that the governor shared any of the concerns about
Internet sales. The bill passed, 148-2, but died in the Senate.

CHINESE-AMERICANS WHO SERVED IN U.S. MILITARY HAILED
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Mass.) By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About 900 marchers came from as far as San Francisco
on Saturday to honor Chinese-Americans who served in the U.S.
military.
</P>
<P>
   The parade commemorated the 50th anniversary of the start of the
Korean War, with veterans of that war marching near the front. It
also commemorated the 55th anniversary of the founding of
Chinatown's American Legion Post.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, following dancing dragons, started at Columbus
Park on Mulberry Street in Chinatown in the ``We Serve With Pride
Parade,'' which was organized by the Lt. B.R. Kimlau Chinese
Memorial Post 1291 of the American Legion.
</P>
<P>
   They marched up Mulberry Street to Canal Street, then past a
reviewing stand near the Chinese-American Veterans' War Memorial,
in Chatham Square, where a statue built by Post 1291 was to be
rededicated and new officers were to be installed. A banquet was to
follow, with a private screening of a movie called ``We Served With
Pride.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimlau Post, which claims to be the largest Chinese-American
post of the American Legion, was named after a World War II
bombardier who was killed near New Guinea. It has about 600 members
from the New York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   There were not large numbers of Chinese-Americans in the
nation's wars, said Fang Wong, Post 1291's leader, who served in
Vietnam. ``You'd see them scattered,'' he said. ``There was not one
field where they were more highly visible than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Yuu, 76, was marching with a group of Chinese-American
veterans from Boston. ``I'm very very happy to come,'' he said.
``We're in good health so we come.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Chu, a member of Post 1291 who lives in New Hyde Park
and who fought on Okinawa in World War II, said he marched to show
his patriotism.

 &HT;    Morris Engelberg: Still saying so for Joe
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ A tall man, 6-foot-4, drives a white van with
the license plate, ``DIMAG 5.'' He parks in front of a sign that
says, ``Reserved for the Yankee Clipper, Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg gets out. He is a 60-year-old lawyer in a
jogging suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Joe's,'' he explains, gesturing toward the van. ``I
just had it out to get it serviced.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to him is a parking space reserved for Morris Engelberg. It
is empty.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg is the sole trustee of DiMaggio's will, but few
attorneys identify so closely with their clients. For that matter,
the average attorney does not name his office plaza ``Yankee
Clipper Center,'' spend $8,500 on a marble plaque memorializing his
most famous client outside the front door, or drop another $2,300
to create museum-like rooms inside, with scores of DiMaggio
photographs and other memorabilia. When DiMaggio died last year at
his Hollywood home at age 84, no one had more control over his life
than Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed,'' Engelberg said. ``I admit it. He was like a
father to me. My own father died three months before I was born. As
a child in New York, I used to tell people Joe DiMaggio was my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they never met until DiMaggio reached the final two
decades of his life, but the attorney came to assume a powerful
role in the slugger's final years. That role would put him at odds
with political leaders in San Francisco, members of the Hollywood
(Fla.) Chamber of Commerce and DiMaggio's own brother Dom, who has
a home in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those people wondered if the line that separates Morris
Engelberg from Joe DiMaggio, like the line between their parking
spaces, has been rubbed out in Engelberg's mind somewhere along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg hired attorneys to file a lawsuit last week in federal
court in Miami to stop San Francisco from using DiMaggio's name at
a playground where he and his brothers used to play as children,
calling the playground unfit to bear DiMaggio's legendary name.
It's the most serious escalation yet in a war of words that has
gone on for months.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Supervisor Gavin Newsom said the North Beach
playground is anything but a dump _ the city has committed $4
million in improvements around a park that includes a pool and
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really an outrage and an insult to the people of San
Francisco,'' Newsom said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom sees a troubling contradiction in the way Engelberg has
moved to block the naming of the playground and other gestures to
honor DiMaggio _ on the grounds it would cheapen the Yankee great's
name _ yet has allowed the auctioning of DiMaggio's personal
effects, including his driver license and passport, and now says he
is seeking up to $2 million for a book about DiMaggio's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is doing a disservice to Joe's legacy,'' Newsom
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio, one of three brothers to play in the big leagues
at the same time, supports the naming of the San Francisco
playground. Dom has homes in Ocean Ridge and Marion, Mass. He was
hurt and angered by Engelberg's claims that Dom was out socializing
last year while his brother was dying in his attorney's arms 40
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a completely false and venomous statement,'' Dom
DiMaggio said. ``That's all I want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said he did not tell Dom and other family members
about the true extent of Joe's illness because that was the way Joe
wanted it. Only a handful of people, including Engelberg and
DiMaggio's doctors, were allowed to know, he said.
</P>
<P>
   From his hospital bed, DiMaggio entrusted Engelberg with the
responsibility to look after his legacy, according to the attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grabbed my tie _ I remember it was a blue one _ and said,
'You better protect my name,' '' Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his book, Engelberg said he thinks Joe would approve _
even though while still alive, DiMaggio once vetoed a book deal
Engelberg had arranged with Simon &AMP; Schuster. Reason: He didn't
want to go on talk shows and be asked about former wife Marilyn
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg hints his book will delve into Monroe, among other
topics, but adds 25 percent of the proceeds will go to the Joe
DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood. By the time agents' fees
and taxes are taken out, Engelberg figures he will get about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney-author has hired International Management Group to
represent him. Asked if IMG really expects the book to grab a $1
million or $2 million advance, Mark Reiter, vice president in IMG's
literary division in New York, answered, ``I sure hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   IMG does not expect the book to appear on shelves for at least a
year. Engelberg said he has written a draft, though IMG expects a
ghostwriter to be brought in at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all be so lucky to have somebody protect us so
fiercely,'' Reiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Loy Anderson, president of Palm Beach National Bank, counts
himself a friend of Engelberg's and says nobody fights harder to
protect a client _ particularly a client who happens to be a
personal hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I think Morris always put Joe first, even ahead of
his own family,'' Anderson said. ``If you're looking for a trustee,
that's all you could ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   At his office, pictures of Engelberg's wife and daughter are
blended with those of DiMaggio. Here is Joltin' Joe at the
daughter's wedding. There is one with the wife.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the DiMaggio case is not the first in which
Engelberg has clashed with a client's blood relations. When
world-famous dollmaker Madame Bee Alexander died in 1990, Engelberg
challenged a version of her will that left most of her $12 million
estate to her daughter, Mildred Birnbaum of Boca Raton. He
supported an earlier version that named him executor, with a
reported $240,000 fee. It cut out the daughter entirely, and left
the bulk to Alexander's friends, former employees and charities.
Engelberg's firm claimed Alexander, who was 95 when she died, was
incompetent and brainwashed by her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Birnbaum reportedly received most of the money in a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who was Alexander's banker, said the dollmaker did
experience a loss of her mental faculties late in life, so a
challenge to a rewritten will was not unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   One executive with no complaints against Engelberg is Frank
Sacco, chief executive officer of Memorial Healthcare System.
That's the company that runs Memorial Regional Hospital in
Hollywood, where Joe DiMaggio's Children's Hospital is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morris did nothing but to work with us in a very cooperative
fashion,'' Sacco said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital decided to approach DiMaggio eight years ago with
an idea to care for sick children regardless of their families'
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned the way to approach him was through Morris
Engelberg,'' Sacco said. ``We met in Morris' office. Joe asked what
we wanted and I told him. He wanted to see the place.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio eventually agreed to lend his name to what would become
his best-known charitable project. Later, in his illness, DiMaggio
would spend many of his final days at Memorial Regional.
</P>
<P>
   There was little question in Sacco's mind that Engelberg became
the gatekeeper for DiMaggio's life because it was what Joe wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally met with Joe,'' Sacco said, referring to a
meeting he remembered from late 1998. ``At that meeting, DiMaggio
said he was giving power of attorney to Engelberg. Morris was the
custodian. He had power of attorney. Our legal people said
everything is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg donated pictures of Joe that still decorate the lobby
in the children's hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It was other memorabilia, though, that raised eyebrows at a
Christie's auction in April in New York. DiMaggio's 1986 Florida
driver license was sold for $11,750, and his passport was offered
as well. The items were described as being owned by Engelberg and
others who worked for or knew DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Many items did not sell, including a golf cart Engelberg gave
DiMaggio, and a 1951 jersey worn in DiMaggio's final game. The
jersey was offered for a minimum bid of $120,000 by a woman who
worked in DiMaggio's home. She said she found it in a shopping bag
under DiMaggio's bed after his death. DiMaggio had given it to a
New York detective and the officer's family returned it to DiMaggio
after the officer's death, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's will makes Engelberg the trustee. Engelberg got a
court order last year that seals as ``confidential'' records that
describe the contents of the estate. As a result, the man in
control of sorting out what belonged to DiMaggio and his heirs, as
opposed to what was given as gifts to friends including Engelberg,
is Engelberg himself.
</P>
<P>
   The memorabilia designated as part of DiMaggio's estate was sold
last year to collector Ralph Perullo for a price the buyer said was
``in the millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dom was cut out of the will entirely and son Joe DiMaggio Jr.
received just $20,000. More generous amounts went to DiMaggio's two
granddaughters and to nephew Joe DiMaggio, who lives in Boynton
Beach and is the son of Joe's brother Mike. Engelberg, who said he
never gave DiMaggio a legal bill when he was alive, will receive a
fee whose amount is not disclosed in the will.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Jr. was the only son of DiMaggio and actress Dorothy Arnold,
who were married in 1939 and divorced five years later. He
struggled with substance abuse problems and homelessness and was
sometimes described as ``estranged'' from his father. In the
mid-1970s, he had a blood clot removed from his brain after an auto
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Engelberg said it was untrue he or his father shut the son
out. The attorney arranged a condo for Joe Jr. in Hollywood. The
son was a pallbearer at his father's funeral, only to die himself,
apparently from natural causes at age 57, in a California hospital
in August.
</P>
<P>
   At Mama Mia's restaurant, at the circle on Hollywood Boulevard
and U.S. 1, DiMaggio had his own table, in the lounge near the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Autograph seekers, young and old, frequently closed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He preferred kids to adults,'' manager Cathy Iezza said. ``He
thought adults were trying to take advantage of him.''
</P>
<P>
   That blend of shyness and suspicion may say something about why
DiMaggio allowed Morris Engelberg to play the role he did.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood attorney David Singer puzzled over that role last
year. He was part of a Chamber of Commerce group that wanted to
rename that city's Presidential Circle for DiMaggio. He was
surprised to be rebuffed with letters from Engelberg's firm
threatening legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals were purely civic-minded,'' Singer said. ``It sounded
like a no-lose situation. It was met not even with 'no, thanks,'
but threats and insinuations. There was no need for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer said it was unsettling to watch the way DiMaggio left the
world, increasingly separated from family and longtime friends as
Engelberg's influence over him seemed to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ended up with almost no family attachments, no friends,
everything was controlled by this one guy,'' Singer said. ``That's
a strange ending for a man who's an important part of the 20th
century.''

 &HT;    Waves of discord wash over beach issue
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When a hurricane crashes ashore, it washes the beach
away.
</P>
<P>
   This season _ when hurricane watchers predict 11 named storms
will form, including three with wind speeds of at least 115 mph _
coastal cities from Miami Beach to Long Island will spend $50
million to $85 million in federal funds on beach protection and
restoration. Congress continues debate on the final amount, which
has been as high as $100 million in years past.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the U.S. population lives in coastal areas.
Florida reports more than 12 million coastal residents, Virginia 4
million, Louisiana 2 million and South Carolina nearly 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Every day more people move to the shore to experience sand
between their toes and sunrises over the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal growth continues despite the forecast of a 60 percent
chance that a hurricane will hit somewhere on the U.S. coast this
season. The average probability of U.S. landfall, according to
researchers at Colorado State University, is 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A point of consternation _ not in Congress but in the local
communities where this is an issue _ is whether people should be
living on barrier islands,'' said Howard Marlowe, president of the
pro-beach American Coastal Coalition lobby based in Washington,
D.C. ``The fact is folks are living there. . . . People are not
going to leave, so we have to do something responsible to protect
our coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Beach towns are more than quaint villages. They're money makers.
</P>
<P>
   Beach economies in coastal congressional districts from
Louisiana to Virginia account for more than $48.6 billion in
tourism expenditures _ more than a quarter of the $185 billion
generated by the nation's seaside cities, according to the coastal
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, tourists spend about $30 billion a year. Georgia
beach visitors spend more than $1 billion a year. On Tybee Island,
a seasonal population of 3,000 swells to 10 times that from now
through August.
</P>
<P>
   That's why communities make their beaches wider by dumping sand,
a process known as renourishment.
</P>
<P>
   While it adds a theoretical buffer against the daily grind of
waves that move the beach back to the sea, fresh sand also puts
more distance between homes and destructive hurricane waters.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane storm surge, the wall of wind-whipped water built on
top of the tide, wipes away hotdog stands, cottages, boardwalks _
and sand.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of shoreline protection programs, however, claim the
projects are futile attempts to keep Mother Nature from destroying
private beachfront developments and tax-supported amenities like
roads, parks and sewers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) of Savannah, who serves
the Georgia coast, has helped secure federal money in the past for
Tybee Island beach nourishment. Officials want it to keep their
industry afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm alarmed that what we're doing is buying time from Mother
Nature,'' Kingston said. ``Beaches come and beaches go. But when a
tourist comes, he doesn't want to know, `Is there going to be sand
or not this year?' I'm admitting it is a prop up (of the local
economy). . . . But it's a worthwhile investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Legislature has started allocating $30 million a
year for beach protection. Last summer, Panama City completed a $21
million restoration project that pumped 8.5 million cubic yards of
sand _ almost 800,000 dump-truck loads _ along 17 miles of beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying beach restoration is the panacea of all
erosion projects,'' said Payden Woodruff, environmental
administrator of the Florida office of Beaches and Coastal Systems.
``But if tourism and recreation are the basis of your economy,
you're going to protect it. Some people say, `Let the buildings
fall in.' Well, what's the political reality of that?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, the hurricane tag team of Dennis and
Floyd severely eroded North Carolina's coast from Ocean Isle north
to the Outer Banks. The state's most dramatic damage occurred
inland when rivers overflowed and turned streets into canals.
</P>
<P>
   But the sea claimed its share of beach houses. On Oak Island,
Hurricane Floyd washed away 50 cottages over a 3-mile stretch,
causing more than $25 million in private property losses. Some
homes had been in families for three generations.
</P>
<P>
   Those homeowners, though, got what was coming to them by
building on the beach, said renowned shoreline development critic
Orrin Pilkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke University geologist complains the federal program is a
waste of money in an erosion battle nature is destined to win. On
the East Coast of the United States, beachfront lots receive annual
federal shore protections worth an average of $4,000 to $18,000 a
year, Pilkey says.
</P>
<P>
   Pilkey's studies show nourished beaches actually erode up to 12
times faster than non-nourished ones because the natural flow of
sand is altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The erosion exists because people build right next to the
beach,'' said Pilkey, who's raised the ire of coastal managers
throughout the Southeast. ``If people didn't build there, there
wouldn't be a problem. Why should I in Durham or someone in Omaha
pay for someone who's dumb enough to live next to the beach and
then be his savior?''
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the National Wildlife Federation suggest the federal
government should cut in half its funding of beach replenishment.
In a March report on what it called wasteful water projects, the
environmental group complained beach nourishment ``encourages risky
development on congested shorelines. Alternatives such as voluntary
property buyouts, relocations and land swaps for less risky areas
should be explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a beachfront is saturated with development, flexibility in
shoreline management disappears, Pilkey argues. Officials will
build sea walls to protect high rises, all of which will wipe out a
beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're increasing the value of their property and giving them
protection,'' Pilkey said. ``That makes beachfront owners the
luckiest people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On the North Carolina coast, Oak Island Mayor Joan Altman wishes
she had had some of that luck last September when Hurricane Floyd
washed out homes, water lines, roads and cable. The storm washed
out about $12 million of the town's tax base at the beach, its
primary source of revenue. A town gymnasium has been put on hold
because of the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss from Floyd means we've had to tighten our belts in
some places,'' Altman said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the houses lost in the storm can't be rebuilt on the
beach because the water's too close to the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real losers are the public and the town. We can't insure
our tax base,'' Altman said. ``It's a loss to the town forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The widest spots of the beach, where sand from nearby dredging
is regularly dumped, suffered no loss of private property. Beyond
that, Altman advocates more scientific renourishment that involves
years of study and construction by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. She helped form the North Carolina Shore and Beach
Preservation Association, a group that lobbies for federal
renourishment funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, North Carolina has ranked seventh in the
nation in the amount of sand-pumping funds received from Congress,
with $16 million in federal renourishment funds. Neighbors Virginia
and South Carolina each got more than $40 million during that
period. New Jersey topped the list at $115 million followed by New
York at $105 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe that perhaps $1 million of sand at Oak Island
would have saved $25 million in property damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic benefits outweigh the cost of nourishment,''
Altman said.

   Hurricanes: Can we escape?
</P>
<P>
   By Chris Burritt and Alan Judd
</P>
<P>
   HOBOKEN, Ga. _ Bumper to bumper, stretching for 25 miles, tens
of thousands of motorists fleeing Hurricane Floyd crept through
this southeast Georgia town.
</P>
<P>
   Directing traffic at Hoboken's lone blinking traffic light was
Hoboken's lone policeman, Darren Crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a free-for-all,'' Crews said, recalling last Sept. 14,
when weary, panicky drivers from as far away as Miami ignored his
signals to stop. Some nearly ran over the 300-pound lawman.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles hauling campers and boats overheated and conked out in
Hoboken, 40 miles west of Brunswick. The scorching pavement
blistered Crews' feet.
</P>
<P>
   As much as he'd liked to have ticketed violators, he was too
busy dodging them. Working with a Brantley County sheriff's deputy,
Crews answered questions from motorists hanging out windows, all
the time wondering, amid the exhaust and horn blowing, when the
stop-and-go caravan would end.
</P>
<P>
   It ended late that night, after 200,000 vehicles had passed
through. ``It was total chaos, mayhem,'' Crews said.
</P>
<P>
   With hurricane season officially beginning last week, Crews, 29,
is bracing for a replay of Floyd, despite months of planning and
pledges of better cooperation and communication among Southeastern
emergency planners.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the nation's largest evacuation _ 3.5 million
people from Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas fled Floyd _ state
and federal officials say they're better prepared for the next
hurricane threat.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd claimed 51 lives in North Carolina, which is still
recovering from its worst natural disaster ever. Here in Hoboken,
by contrast, Floyd ``hardly blew down any limbs,'' Crews recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But two days of evacuations demonstrated how Georgia faltered in
moving and sheltering evacuees in advance of Floyd's eventual
landfall at Cape Fear, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuees consisted of 350,000 coastal Georgians and a large
portion of the 2.3 million people who fled from Florida and some of
the 750,000 who left South Carolina, according to Georgia's
evacuation and shelter task force.
</P>
<P>
   The average evacuation time was seven hours from the Savannah
area and 6.4 hours from the Brunswick area, according to a recent
survey by Florida State University geography professor Earl J.
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ran like they never ran before,'' said Bill Massey, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency's hurricane program manager in
Atlanta. ``They knew this thing had the potential to come in and
smack them.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA is working with Southeastern state agencies to improve
computer monitoring of evacuations. It hopes eventually to develop
a Web-based program so people can log onto personal computers and
see for themselves which evacuation routes are least congested.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Massey said FEMA is encouraging states to work
together on more conventional evacuation strategies, with help from
federal emergency planners.
</P>
<P>
   One such effort is set for Tuesday. Emergency management
officials from southeast Georgia and northeast Florida will meet in
Kingsland to work on evacuation efforts via staggered traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to coordinate it so that Florida people can be
moved out before Georgia people start evacuating,'' said Ed Abel,
the emergency management director for Georgia's Glynn County.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn could relieve traffic tie-ups in crossroads towns
such as Hoboken (population 440), which found itself smack in the
middle of a traffic jam stretching along U.S. 82 from Nahunta to
Waycross.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Crews is skeptical. ``If we had to evacuate tomorrow, it
would be the same thing as during Floyd,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia officials plan to erect hundreds of signs
designating evacuation routes and signaling directions to emergency
shelters. Plans also call for increasing the number of shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to improve communications with the public, Georgia
agencies will use Peach State Public Radio to broadcast travel
advisories, evacuation routes and shelter locations statewide.
</P>
<P>
   To speed the departure of coastal dwellers during an evacuation,
Georgia officials decided to extend by about 40 miles the stretch
of I-16 that could be made one-way heading west from Savannah. Four
lanes of traffic would flow west until U.S. 441 at Vienna, where
the I-16 median is being paved to help motorists return to the
normal westbound lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not mean we will not have traffic problems and
congestion,'' said Chuck Gregg, hurricane specialist for the
Georgia Emergency Management Agency. ``But it does mean we can stay
one step ahead of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans in South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana also call for
traffic to flow inland one-way during evacuations. They include
I-26 between Charleston and Columbia and U.S. 501 from Myrtle Beach
in South Carolina, seven major roadways in Florida and I-10 from
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, where highway officials and state troopers
tested the lane-reversal plan last month, Gov. Jim Hodges took the
blame for delays in reversing eastbound traffic on I-26 before
Floyd. That stranded tens of thousands of motorists, including some
who took 18 hours or longer to travel what is typically a 90-minute
trip from Charleston to Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only hope that (Hodges) learned a very important lesson
from that one,'' said Jan Maguire, 46, who evacuated from
Charleston with her 11-year-old daughter, Rachel, Pumpkin the cat
and Tigger the lizard.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling for 21 hours, while ``moving 2 feet then
stopping for 15 to 20 minutes,'' they arrived in Lexington, a
Columbia suburb. Maguire said it would be a ``tough call'' deciding
whether to evacuate again.
</P>
<P>
   Although emergency planners worry that coastal dwellers might
balk at evacuation, the Florida State survey of 7,000 people found
that fewer than 20 percent would not evacuate again under similar
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people who evacuated (from Floyd) will
evacuate in the future, too,'' said Baker, the professor who
conducted the survey for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also found that evacuees unnecessarily worsened highway
congestion in advance of Floyd. In Florida, for instance, officials
ordered 1.3 million people to evacuate, but an estimated 2 million
left their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, those extra people left noncoastal counties adjacent
to counties under evacuation orders, Baker said. In such counties
in Georgia, about 30 percent of the residents evacuated, even
though there was no reason for them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many evacuees tended to go farther than they
needed to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the word to those people somehow,'' Baker
said. ``If the area you're driving through is not being told to
leave, you'd be safe, too, if you stopped there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hoboken, Officer Crews can only hope that evacuees go
elsewhere during the next hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever seen a city in shock,'' he said, ``it was us
when that traffic came through.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for alternatives to clogged I-95, I-75 and I-16,
motorists from southeastern Georgia and Florida veered on to U.S.
82 and Ga. 121, which intersect at the blinking light in Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   During normal times, the intersection is so congested by logging
and wood chip trucks that Crews has requested, unsuccessfully, that
state highway officials install a stoplight.
</P>
<P>
   Crews now believes that, judging by Floyd's evacuation, the
officers directing traffic are imperiled. ``Drivers will pay more
attention to a light changing colors than you waving your arms,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hoboken intersection didn't make the Georgia Department
of Transportation's list of 37 intersections considered critical
during an evacuation. The two nearest to Hoboken are at U.S. 82 and
U.S. 301 in Nahunta and U.S. 82 and U.S. 1 in Waycross.
</P>
<P>
   State highway planners don't doubt that Hoboken had problems
during Floyd's evacuation, said assistant maintenance engineer
Bryant Poole, but so did dozens of other places _ and planners have
focused on improving the intersections best suited for evacuating
large numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got millions of people evacuating,'' Poole said,
``you've got problems everywhere.''

 &HT;    Town ready to regain use of bridge
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cindy Deaton never figured she'd miss a chunk of
concrete as badly as she does the bridge over Quankey Creek in
Halifax, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The two-lane bridge has been out of commission for nearly nine
months, ever since Hurricane Floyd turned the swampy creek into a
raging torrent that dug a crater 200 feet wide, cutting off the
bridge where motorists once crossed.
</P>
<P>
   People living in the southern end of Halifax County face a
detour of 20 minutes or more whenever they go to the courthouse in
Halifax to pay taxes or go to court.
</P>
<P>
   A popular spot less than a mile from the U.S. 301 bridge, Elias'
Supermarket and Grill has lost about half of its business, owner
Artie Elias said.
</P>
<P>
   He figures he lost his Halifax customers to Piggly Wiggly and
other Roanoke Rapids groceries, which became more convenient,
although farther away. Many of Elias' customers are forced to
detour 12 miles to get to his store.
</P>
<P>
   Quankey Creek separates Deaton from her home in Roanoke Rapids
and her job as an office assistant at the state prison in Tillery.
The detour lengthens her trip by about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The minutes seem to add up especially fast in the afternoons
when Deaton darts from work to pick up her 2 1/2-year-old daughter,
Samantha, from day care in Roanoke Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   So it's with a sense of personal urgency that she and others
await the opening of the new Quankey Creek bridge, one of three in
Halifax County and one of 17 across North Carolina damaged so
severely by Floyd that they have to be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Floyd's flooding damaged 283 North Carolina bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minute counts when you are on the way,'' Deaton said.
``We are ready for our bridge to get back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   A new, $1 million bridge over Quankey Creek is scheduled to be
opened June 27, said John Emerson, assistant state bridge engineer.

   DIMAGGIO-ATTORNEY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ 04 (56 inches,
developing): Morris Engelberg is the sole trustee of Joe DiMaggio's
will, but few attorneys identify so closely with their clients. For
that matter, the average attorney does not name his office plaza
``Yankee Clipper Center,'' spend $8,500 on a marble plaque
memorializing his most famous client outside the front door, or
drop another $2,300 to create museum-like rooms inside, with scores
of DiMaggio photographs and other memorabilia. When DiMaggio died
last year at his Hollywood, Fla., home at age 84, no one had more
control over his life than Engelberg. ``I'm obsessed,'' Engelberg
said. ``I admit it. He was like a father to me. My own father died
three months before I was born. As a child in New York, I used to
tell people Joe DiMaggio was my father.'' In fact, they never met
until DiMaggio reached the final two decades of his life, but the
attorney came to assume a powerful role in the slugger's final
years. That role would put him at odds with political leaders in
San Francisco, members of the Hollywood (Fla.) Chamber of Commerce
and DiMaggio's own brother Dom. (Elmore, Palm Beach Post). 56.

SVYATOSLAV FYODOROV, 72, EYE-SURGERY PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a pioneering eye surgeon who was
one of the Soviet Union's first practicing capitalists and a
politician who ran for president of Russia in 1996, died on Friday
in a helicopter crash outside Moscow. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov was returning from a ceremony marking the 10th
anniversary of one of his eye-microsurgery clinics in Tambov, 250
miles southeast of Moscow. Television footage filmed there showed
him climbing into one of the helicopter's pilot seats.
</P>
<P>
   The NTV television channel reported that helicopter piloting,
along with motorcycle racing, was one of the latest hobbies of a
man who never allowed physical challenges _ as a youth, he lost a
foot in an accident at aviation school _ to hinder his pursuit of
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Three others died in the crash, all reportedly crew members.
There was no explosion, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The stocky, spike-haired Fyodorov, who enrolled in medical
school after the aviation school accident, was a man of many skills
with one overriding passion: eye surgery. After the Soviet
president Mikhail Gorbachev undertook economic and political
reforms in the 1980s, Fyodorov's deftness as a surgeon and talent
as a businessman made him a national and international symbol of
those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ukraine in 1927, he graduated from a medical institute
in the south Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and worked in hospitals
around Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 he implanted the first artificial crystalline lens. In
1973, already in Moscow, he developed the first operation in the
world for early treatment of glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's best-known technique was an operation for myopia that
involved precise incisions near the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind the procedure was that eyesight normalizes,
sometimes fully, as the incisions heal and the curvature of the
cornea alters.
</P>
<P>
   Although greeted with much skepticism, the operation was also
wildly popular. Fyodorov's high-tech assembly-line operating rooms,
filled with the latest equipment custom-made by Siemens in Germany,
made it possible to operate on hundreds of patients a day at his
Research Institute of Eye and Microsurgery in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov spoke of automating other surgical procedures, even
coronary bypass, in the same fashion. In the myopia surgery,
patients on operating tables rotated from one doctor to another,
each of whom was responsible for part of the procedure, which was
completed in about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television reported that he had clinics in Italy, Poland
and Yemen, and a clinic on board a ship cruising the Mediterranean.
His business interests expanded to other spheres as well, such as
farming.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Fyodorov called for repeal of
the one-party system while still a member of the Communist Party,
before the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, Fyodorov turned down an offer from Boris Yeltsin,
Russia's president, to become premier. By 1992 he was co-chairman
of the Party of Economic Freedom, an early incarnation of the many
liberal parties that have failed so far to make a large impact on
Russia's political scene. Eventually, Fyodorov entered Parliament,
in 1995, as head of his own small party.
</P>
<P>
   However, when he ran for president in 1996, Fyodorov received
barely 1 percent of the national vote..
</P>
<P>
   For all of his business acumen, Fyodorov was far from the
stereotype of a ruthless capitalist, and from the brashness
displayed by many businessmen in what has come to be known as the
``new Russia.'' And, for all of his stated disappointment in the
rocky course of economic reform, he was not nostalgic for communist
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   In his last recorded statement, his speech to the staff of the
Tambov clinic, he set forth a vision that he embodied _ of a Russia
proud, capable and caring toward its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one goal,'' Fyodorov said. ``To make it so that people
live well, so that they see well. So that they live well in this
clinic, in Tambov, in other places in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that we today with our practice are proving the
potential of the Russian people, the potential of its talents, the
potential of self-organization, the potential of enterprises being
self-sufficient, the potential of regions being self-sufficient,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov is survived by his wife and four daughters.

DONALD W. DAVIES, WHO DEVISED INTERNET PROCESS, DIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: England) By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald W. Davies, who proposed a method for transmitting data
that made the Internet possible, died May 28 at a hospice in Esher,
England. He was 75 and had been suffering from cancer, a spokesman
for the National Physical Laboratory in Britain said.
</P>
<P>
   Davies was a computer security expert and team leader of a group
that created one of the first computer programs to translate
Russian scientific papers to English, but the work for which he was
most noted grew out of concerns that conventional telephone
networks were poorly suited for carrying huge amounts of data in
short bursts, the ideal for computers.
</P>
<P>
   Davies suggested in 1965 that Britain develop a network that
would allow data to follow a variety of pathways. To make the
network efficient, the data would be broken into small packets,
each carrying a code indicating where it came from and where it was
supposed to end up so that a complete document could be compiled at
the receiving computer.
</P>
<P>
   Packets would wend their way through the network on the fastest
available route. If any packets were lost because of breaks in the
network, only those packets would have to be sent again. He called
the concept packet switching.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was similar to an approach advocated by Paul Baran
of the RAND Corp., a research concern in Santa Monica, Calif.
Baran's goal was to devise a system for the U.S. government that
would be less vulnerable to a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Baran's concepts went nowhere until Roger Scantlebury, a
member of Davies' development team, described the British packet
switching in a talk in 1967 in Gatlinburg, Tenn., to U.S. computer
experts. Davies' ideas caught the attention of Lawrence Roberts,
program director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Roberts
had been looking for a way to improve communications among the many
laboratories and universities working on research financed by the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Davies was able to build a demonstration packet-switching
network within the National Physical Laboratory by 1969, but the
power of his ideas was more fully displayed in the United States,
where Roberts melded them with work by Baran and others to create
Arpanet, the forerunner of today's Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Watts Davies was born June 7, 1924, in Treorchy, Wales,
just months before the death of his father, John, a coal mine
clerk. His mother, Hilda, returned to her native Portsmouth,
England, to work in the post office and raise her son and his twin
sister. As a teen-ager, he experimented with radios and read
technical books on telephony.
</P>
<P>
   Davies was an honors student in physics and mathematics, gaining
Bachelor of Science degrees in both subjects from Imperial College
in London by 1947. His academic years included a break to work for
Imperial Chemical Industries and as an atomic energy researcher at
Birmingham University.
</P>
<P>
   His career path was set, though, shortly before graduation when
he attended a lecture about the National Physical Laboratory's
effort to develop a British computer. Entranced by the new
technology, he joined the small development team headed by Alan
Turing, the cryptography expert who had become a computing pioneer
while breaking German codes during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The device the team created, the Pilot ACE, ran its first
program in 1950. Davies went on to become interested in a wide
variety of applications, including traffic simulators and language
translation programs. Displaying a rare combination of management
skills and equanimity as well as technical expertise, he rose
through a series of positions at the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart was with the technical side, but he was very
skillful at dealing with people,'' said David Yates, a longtime
colleague at the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Davies quit his administrative work in 1979 to concentrate on
data security research. The group he built ended up consulting on
encryption and related issues for the largest British banks and
other major computer users. He continued his consulting work after
retiring from the laboratory in 1984. He became a visiting
professor at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Davies is survived by his wife of 45 years, the former Diane
Burton of Sunbury-on-Thames; two sons, Paul, of Godalming, and
Michael, of Bridgeport, and a daughter, Sarah, of
Kingston-on-Thames.

 &HT;    At late hour, Holyfield trains toward goal
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Midnight approaches. Do you know where your three-time
undisputed heavyweight champion is?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not cruising and clubbing, the nocturnal pastime of
choice for too many fighters. But neither is Evander Holyfield
between the sheets on this late Sunday night in mid-May, dreaming
whatever a rich-as-creme-brulee, woman-magnet, body-by-Blanks
celebrity dreams about.
</P>
<P>
   No, he's in the gym, training for the next fight.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh, now he's done it. Took one too many blows in the ring,
just as we feared, and got his body clock all out of sorts. Doesn't
know morning from night anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't boxers supposed to rise with the rooster's wake-up call,
wind down their work day by happy hour and have the rest of the day
to track down trouble?
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, that was Holyfield's routine, although his
relatively tame evening hours typically were spent at the movies or
a ballgame. ``I was always taught the early bird gets the worm,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lennox Lewis II, though, he turned his routine
inside-out, which brings us to a nearly unmarked upstairs room at
the rear of a bail-bond business in downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Main Street Boxing Gym is not, nor has it recently been, on
Main Street but rather in an area where you can park for a buck a
day. Holyfield is jumping rope, stretching and sparring in the
presence of his rainbow-coalition support group of trainer, fitness
adviser, manager, personal assistant; gym regulars; and five
Latinos who work in the bail-bond office. Gospel music, some with a
hip-hoppish back beat, blares through speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot better than the early-morning workouts,'' he says.
``My body gets accustomed to being up late. Previously, when I
fought in the evening and trained in the daytime, I'd wonder why I
was so sleepy (on fight night). I'd feel good in the locker room,
then get sleepy around 11 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Holyfield is wide-eyed after sparring three
rounds with Sedrick Fields. All across the city, clocks are
striking twelve.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he's too old,'' Fields pants. ``Pshaw. He's got
that fast combination, and he's got heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all accomplished athletes in the twilight of their careers,
Holyfield makes adjustments to compensate for an inevitable erosion
of ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older you get, it becomes more of a mental game,'' he
says. ``You work more on strategy. When I was younger, I didn't
work on no strategy. I worked on the idea I was going to beat the
daylights out of (the opponent). Now, I work on outthinking the
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The next guy is John Ruiz. They had set a date in Las Vegas for
Saturday at Caesars Palace, but a pulled muscle below Holyfield's
rib cage pushed the bout back to August. Aside from aerobic
activity, Holyfield will ease off the accelerator for a month, then
resume training.
</P>
<P>
   The carrot for this fight is a World Boxing Association title.
Lennox Lewis beat Holyfield twice last year _ once officially, once
not _ but had to unbuckle his WBA belt and hand it over for
refusing to fight the designated challenger, Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   The double whammo from Lewis and the anonymity of Ruiz has
gotten Holyfield demoted from the pay-per-view ranks to cable
television, Showtime. His projected pay is an unspecified few
million dollars _ a lottery-like windfall to the rest of us but
change spilled in the clothes dryer to Holyfield, who once
collected $35 million against Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when things don't go your way,'' he says, ``you take
two steps backward and then come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Ruiz is some palooka, ready to fall over at
the first stiff wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Critics) might call this guy a tomato can, . . . but he can't
wait to run into somebody and make his name,'' Holyfield says.
``I've got to tell him he bit off more than he can chew.''
</P>
<P>
   Although those words might apply more to Tyson, who once munched
on Holyfield's ears, the greater point is that he wants to treat
the three major belts as collectibles. If he corrals them all,
Holyfield would stand alone as a four-time, across-the-board
champion, at which time he would embark on some overseas farewell
tour to thank the global village for its support.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the Lennox Maul, a decisive win for Lewis in their
sequel last November, Holyfield might be waving arrivederci in
Rome, au revoir in Paris or adios in Buenos Aires. Instead, even
the best-case scenario seemingly calls for three more bouts. The
line forming to fight Lewis, the WBC and IBF designee, already
includes Francois Botha and David Tua.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ask to be in this situation,'' Holyfield says. ``I
should be the undisputed champion of the world now, going on my
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the prideful one, he is convinced that the judges rendered
a wrongful verdict in Holyfield-Lewis II.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I watch the tape, there's no doubt about it. I whipped
him'' in the rematch, Holyfield says. ``When you compare it to the
first fight, you see a big difference with me. The reason he's
better is, I put the pressure on and made him fight _ and I still
got the best of him. I made the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, remember, I still had two belts. I was very aggressive,
so how could anything close go the (challenger)?''
</P>
<P>
   With Holyfield stretching his interests outside the ring, the
legendary trait of keeping his eye on the prize will be tested. His
Atlanta restaurant, Holyfield's New South Grill, recently toasted
its one-year anniversary. He contributes his name, money and
philosophy to a family-oriented cable TV network, MBC, for those
who ``want to watch shows with your kids and don't want to put your
hands over their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a music label, Real Deal Records, with a dozen artists.
His moribund clothing line, Holyfield Warrior, will resurface soon.
The Holyfield Foundation dabbles in local charities. Among his
endorsment connections is Coca-Cola, whom he steadfastly supports
in the backlash of discrimination charges by black employees.
</P>
<P>
   One distraction he happily unloaded was the dragged-out divorce
case with Janice Holyfield. Their split became official March 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your wife and you are having discord, that can allow you to
be weaker,'' he says. ``It's better to be single than to be in
disarray. It's a liability. Going into this fight, I don't have
that on my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so glad when we settled, I said, `Thank the Lord.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They are forgiving enough that Janice has remained on his
sprawling estate while her house outside of Atlanta is being
readied. ``We talk, see each other,'' he says. ``You don't trash
everything you know about the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, before his weekly return flight to Houston, he
had escorted her to a gate at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are (wondering), `I thought y'all were divorced?''' he
says, laughing.' '' ``We get along. Matter of fact, I get along
with all the mothers of my kids.'' That's six and nine,
respectively, for those counting.
</P>
<P>
   An imaginary conversation with one of his children partly keeps
Holyfield flailing away at age 37 in a sport that punishes
hangers-on far more than any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I lost and said I quit? What is my son going to say
when I push him to do better? He'll say, `Daddy, you quit. You
didn't go back (in the ring) because those guys were bigger than
you, younger than you.' I'm back to prove to him you've got to give
your all in life. To learn from your mistakes and correct them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: He loves this game. ``Nobody has to call me to say,
`Wake up, Evander, and come to the gym.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Given his late-show training schedule, let's hope not.

REAL ESTATE: OUT-OF-TOWNERS FIND A HOME IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In these days of scarce rentals and high prices, it
is natural to assume that young and charming naifs from out of town
will get trampled by New York's Darwinian real estate system.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget that assumption. Jeremy Harger and Tyra Hillsten,
both now 26, met as high school students in Albany, Ore., and went
on to Westmont College together, in Santa Barbara, Calif. They
married at the end of their junior year and, after graduation,
moved to Portland, Ore., and took jobs _ he in graphic design and
she in marketing. Neither had lived anywhere but the West Coast.
Neither had ever been to New York, not even once.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow, without the assistance of relatives or friends, or
of powerful mentors with rent-stabilized apartments to dangle, they
found a very large and sunny one-bedroom apartment on the Upper
West Side with a view of the Hudson River, in a pleasant doorman
building on West End Avenue near 98th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The rent is $2,270 a month, which in this market makes it almost
a bargain. Like the church they are now attending, and like the
large wire cage that is home to their two rabbits, they found it
through an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, the obligatory miserable experiences and
frustrating detours along the way. When Harger and Hillsten moved
here last year Harger's employer, Cole &AMP; Haan, a division of Nike,
set them up with a real estate broker who was supposed to get them
settled.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't impressed. The broker would show them places they
liked, and then admit that the rent was way over their budget. ``He
wasn't very helpful,'' Harger said. And they were mystified by his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he showed us apartments, he would just leave us,''
Harger said. They would be on a street corner, not knowing where
they were, surprised that the broker had just darted off without
returning them to their temporary home in Gramercy Park, supplied
by Cole &AMP; Haan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the broker found them a ``little dive'' on the Upper
East Side, Harger said, for $2,200 a month. But they were
desperate, and were considering it, even though, Hillsten said,
``it was the grossest thing I had ever seen _ the guy hadn't
cleaned his apartment since he moved in in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   When they went home that night, ``we were both feeling sick,''
Harger said. In a final try, surfing the Web, they found a site for
the Landings, an apartment complex across the Hudson from
Manhattan, in West New York, N.J., where they could have a large
one-bedroom apartment for $1,800 a month, along with a fitness
center and no buildup of dirt from years of previous tenants. Many
of the development's residents take the nearby ferry for the
commute to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And so they signed a seven-month lease. ``It was a great
apartment complex,'' Hillsten said. ``And it was very romantic in
the fall,'' riding the ferry from New Jersey to New York. But the
charm faded over time, as the water grew colder and they were less
entranced by the process of rushing to buses and subways in
Manhattan to meet the ferry schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't really experiencing the city,'' Harger said. ``We
were going home exhausted every night.'' Living there, Hillsten
said, was a big barrier to friendships with people they were
meeting in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hillsten found a job _ she now works as an assistant
account executive for the Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners
advertising agency _ they knew that they could afford more, and
that it was time to try Manhattan once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like, no brokers,'' Hillsten said.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at newspaper ads, and noticed one for an apartment
being rented by Rent-Direct.com. They logged onto the company's
site and found that for a fee of $169, users get access to the
company's listings until they find an apartment. The company says
it provides listings from more than 325 landlords in Manhattan. It
also e-mails customers with newly arriving apartments that meet
their needs, and shows plans and photos that make it easy to look
without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, the couple had found the place at 777 West End
Ave. In March, they moved into the apartment, with its long, roomy
kitchen, very big dining area, large living room with that river
view, and large bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the living room is Harger's small sculpture of
a sumo wrestler; on the walls are some copies he made of works by
van Gogh, his favorite painter. Although there is a striking red
rug and a big green couch, the rabbits _ Lily and Sydney _
seductively soft and floppy, become the stars. They lounge about on
the rug, like dogs, using a litter box when necessary; on good
days, they are treated to cocoa pebbles.
</P>
<P>
   Or they use their large cage that sits against a living room
wall. ``We spent an extra $100 to give them a three-level condo,''
Hillsten said. But they needn't have bothered with the top floor.
``It turns out they have a fear of heights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the couple moved to New York, the rabbits had their own
bedroom, one of the three in the suburban Portland house that
Harger and Hillsten built two years after they were married.
</P>
<P>
   Hillsten was not eager to leave. She loved working in the yard
of her 1,600-square-foot house, with its mortgage payments of
$1,200 a month. ``I'd go out with scissors and cut herbs,'' she
said. Just as her husband was offered the new position in New York,
she was promoted to sales rep at her company.
</P>
<P>
   As her husband was having discussions about the job, ``I was
dragging my feet most of the way,'' she said. ``For me, Portland
was perfect. You have Mount Hood, and the beautiful river.''
</P>
<P>
   But living in Manhattan, she said, has changed her feelings. She
likes being close to all the stores she needs. ``I've always lived
in a city or a suburb where you drive 10 minutes for everything,''
Hillsten said. She likes Central Park, where she runs; he likes the
architecture, and the pizza.
</P>
<P>
   They sold their car a few weeks ago; it was too expensive, they
said, and they didn't need it. They've been trying Indian food,
``all those new flavors I had never experienced before,'' Harger
said. And like all newcomers to the Upper West Side who like to
cook, the discovery of the Fairway market was an important moment.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are living the fantasy that Harger had in Oregon, when
his image of New York came from scenes in ``You've Got Mail,''
which on their DVD version also gives maps and photos of Upper West
Side institutions like Riverside Park and H &AMP; H Bagel.
</P>
<P>
   New York life is more expensive, though, and they have been
forced to go back to a budget, as in their early married days.
``Jeremy says I should think of it as graduate school,'' Hillsten
said. And like all good graduate students, she has a few herbs on
her window sill, a reminder of a past garden, or a harbinger of a
future one.

 &HT;    Europeans Toast Clinton Foreign Policy
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   AACHEN, Germany Twelve centuries ago Charlemagne fashioned order
out of a continent of rival kingdoms and ruled most of what is
today's Europe from this ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   And so it seemed historically fitting that President Clinton
came here Friday to bask in the sunny glow of his own foreign
policy achievements that includes the expansion of a united and
prosperous Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a week-long journey that ends Monday in the Ukraine, Clinton
has reveled in his role as the senior statesman of his age, bowing
for repeated accolades, even adulation, from a host of European
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, with your immense personal commitment, you have
brought the hope of a stabler world closer to reality,'' city mayor
Jurgen Linden gushed in a ceremony presenting Clinton with the
prestigious Charlemagne Prize for international statesmanship.
``You are not only a distinguished American president, but also a
great cosmopolitan.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Clinton's status is the natural result of outlasting
his rivals. After seven and a half years in office, Clinton has
simply been around longer than any other leaders of major
democratic countries. Indeed, he's been around longer than leaders
of any of the permanent eight members of the United Nations
Security Council, with the notable exception of China's President,
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   More than just longevity, though, Clinton is regarded, at times
revered, by his colleagues among the Group of Eight, or G-8,
nations for his conduct of a foreign policy that reflects his
country's rise as the world's last remaining superpower.
</P>
<P>
   For an outgoing president hoping to numb the sting of domestic
scandal with the balm of big picture accomplishments in foreign
affairs, Clinton's visit to Aachen provided a singularly shining
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days before, in Lisbon, Clinton also won high praise
from the president of the European Union Commission, Romano Prodi,
who declared Clinton no less than an honorary European, owing to
his efforts to strengthen U.S.-European security and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the reason why our transatlantic ties are so good now
and so strong,'' Prodi said, looking at Clinton during a joint
press conference. ``You belong to our family, really.''
</P>
<P>
   That was never an objective presented in Clinton's 1992 campaign
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Arkansas governor promised to ``focus like a laser
beam,'' on the domestic economy, a formula he employed to defeat
President Bush, an incumbent who had won the Cold War and the Gulf
War and was, in his own time, the undisputed senior statesman of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Once in office, though, Clinton learned, at times the hard way,
that foreign policy not only presented him with challenges that
couldn't be ignored, but also with opportunities to leave the kind
of legacy-making markers that a Republican-led Congress
consistently denied him on the domestic front.
</P>
<P>
   Where Congress has thwarted Clinton's plans for overhauling the
nation's health care system, for example, strengthening federal gun
controls or imposing a national energy tax, his Republican foes
have largely stood by and watched as he's pursued what has been, by
any reckoning, an aggressive and far-reaching agenda overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton led his NATO allies in ending Europe's bloodiest
conflict since World War II, in Bosnia, and in combating
institutional repression against ethnic Albanians in neighboring
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He has brokered a framework for peace in Northern Ireland, even
as he has worked, with negotiations as recently as this week, to
mediate an end to half a century of war and enmity in the fractious
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He put more than $40 billion of U.S. money at risk in bailout
programs for Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, and
economists generally agree that the money was a wise and needed
investment in the economic security of a world of nations
increasingly bound by cross border commerce.
</P>
<P>
   He's crafted a new relationship between the United States and
China, ushering the world's most populous nation into the
130-country club of global trading nations playing by a single set
of rules.
</P>
<P>
   He's tied down North Korea's nuclear weapons program even as
he's helped nurture a thaw in Pyongyang's relations with Seoul, as
evidenced by the historic summit the two countries have planned for
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   And this weekend Clinton is in Moscow for a summit with Russian
President Vladimir Putin, pursuing talks that could shift the
course of a generation of arms controls between the world's two
largest possessors of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear that the world, regardless of how it's
changed since the end of the Cold War, still looks to the United
States for leadership,'' said White House spokesman David
Stockwell, ``and that President Clinton, although he has a strong
domestic focus, has clearly become the world's elder statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics contend that not all of his foreign policy
initiatives have advanced American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though some of Clinton's senior aides have taken to
referring to him as ``planet ruler'' in private, American influence
has its limits, as, critics say, does Clinton's skill as a
statesman.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of 20,000 U.S. troops, for example, Clinton was
able to force out a coup leader in Haiti and restore democratic
rule, but he's been unable to quell continuing domestic strife and
abject poverty in a country that remains the most tragic basket
case in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Balkans policy has ended the fighting without
supplanting it with anything like a genuine peace.
</P>
<P>
   He's made little apparent headway in persuading China to end its
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   He was humiliated last fall when Senate Republicans refused to
ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty prohibiting tests of
nuclear weapons, an accord Clinton had placed near the center of
his arms control agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And he was unable to stop even his close partner, former Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, from prosecuting a war in Chechnya that
destroyed much of the region, left a quarter of a million people
homeless and was characterized by some of the worst atrocities on
Russian soil since the time of Joseph Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most frustrating of all, despite seven years of trying,
Clinton's been unable to bring Israelis and Palestinians together
for a Camp David style peace conference, though he still harbors
hopes for convening such a summit as early as July.
</P>
<P>
   History will be a long time in rendering a fully fleshed verdict
on Clinton's foreign policy. Skeptics will wonder for decades, no
doubt, whether at base Clinton maximized his country's
opportunities, or squandered them, at a time of breathtaking
American prosperity amid
</P>
<P>
   stunning global change.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, and for the fleeting months remaining
before he leaves the White House in January, Clinton is walking
tall across the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering his acceptance speech Friday in Aachen,
Clinton, the Charlemagne medal dangling from his neck on a bright
yellow ribbon, Clinton returned to his seat on the sun-washed dais
in front of a 9th Century cathedral, surrounded by Czech President
Vaclev Havel, former European Commission president Jacques Delors
and several other architects of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the Aachen Symphony Orchestra reprised classics from
West Side Story, Clinton smiled broadly, tapped his hand against
his knee and sang.

 &HT;    CLINTON AND PUTIN BEGIN TALKS
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW President Clinton and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir
Putin, laid out opposing positions on the thorny subjects of
missile defense and nuclear arms reductions during a Saturday night
dinner, setting the stage for intensive talks Sunday on the high
stakes issues.
</P>
<P>
   A full afternoon of discussions is planned, to be followed by a
joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
   In the two leaders' first meeting since Putin took office last
month, the men and a handful of aides and interpreters dined on
cabbage soup, goose and spiced wild boar, then repaired to listen
to a set of jazz in the ornate 18th Century residency within the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   There was little time spent on pleasantries, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said, before the men got down to the
security and economic issues at the core of U.S.-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither leader spoke with reporters, however, after meeting for
nearly three hours, and Lockhart suggested that the men went little
beyond stating their views during a cordial yet business like
exchange, speaking mostly through interpreters, with Putin dropping
in an occasional English phrase.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their introductory meeting, Putin gave Clinton a tour
of some of his private enclaves, including a well-stocked library,
a small chapel and the presidential gym where Putin, an avid Judo
practitioner, lifts weights and gets massaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight is a chance, I think, to get comfortable and discuss a
wide range of issues,'' Lockhart told reporters traveling with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues included a proposed U.S. national missile defense
system Putin opposes, as well as prospects for nuclear arms
reductions and Russia's brutal war against seccessionst rebels in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined in the talks by Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbot, the administration's long term point man on Russia.
Putin was accompanied by his top foreign affairs adviser, Sergey
Prihodkho.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official who participated in the talks told
reporters afterwards that the two leaders ``got very much down to
business,'' yet were both cordial and engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very easygoing nature to the conversation,'' said
the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.
``It was quite clear that they knew each other, that they knew a
lot about each other's positions, and they were very interested in
hearing directly from each other about each other's positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Clinton are not strangers. They met twice last fall
once in New Zealand and later in Norway when Putin was serving as
Russia's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Putin became acting president last December, upon Boris
Yeltsin's abrupt resignation, was elected in March and inaugurated
in May.
</P>
<P>
   After a day spent in Berlin conferring with other world leaders
on the subject of 21st Century governance, Clinton flew here aboard
Air Force One and proceeded directly to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   There he was greeted by Putin, a former KGB official.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's talks promise to be dominated by discussions of a
proposed U.S. missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to decide this fall whether to deploy the
system, designed to defend the United States against limited
attacks from a rogue state such as North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is opposed to the system, which he fears could upset the
strategic balance of power between the United States and Russia,
which together possess more than 80 percent of the world's nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin will also take up the issue of nuclear arms
reductions. The men are in the opening stages of talks aimed at
attaining a third Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty, building on
START I and START II.

 -COX &HT;    MEXICO'S RULING PARTY ON THE DEFENSIVE TO BEAT BACK OPPONENT
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY With less than a month to go before the tightest
presidential election in modern Mexican history, the ruling party
here has unleashed a barrage of American-style attack ads to beat
back a leading challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign workers for ruling party candidate Francisco Labastida
Ochoa have created a series of caustic television ads that portray
their chief opponent, Vicente Fox Quesada, of the coalition
Alliance for Change as a bumbler and unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the Fox campaign has prepared its own arsenal
of ads that ridicule Labastida and his party which has ruled Mexico
for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is war,'' said Francisco Ortiz, Fox's campaign publicity
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   A charismatic campaigner and a former opposition governor of
Guanajuato state, Fox is running neck-in-neck with Labastida in
polls. A second opposition challenger, left-of-center Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas is running a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   While the race is close, these polls also show Fox is doing well
in Mexico's urban areas, a critical battleground for ads as the
campaign enters its final stages. About 70 percent of Mexico's
voters live in cities where they have easier access to television.
</P>
<P>
   To counter Fox's advance in the campaign, Labastida's campaign
has consulted on occasion with James Carville, President Bill
Clinton's former campaign strategist. The fierce Carville style may
have influenced some of these American-style television spots.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, Fox is speaking in English during an interview with
an American television show in March. He is describing his idea for
expanding trade agreements so that more Mexican workers can obtain
visas to work legally in the United States rather than having to
cross as undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   An expansion of work visas is an idea the PRI has considered as
well, but the ad exploits Fox's awkward phrasing in English and
portrays him as a sell-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge need for gardeners in the United States,'' Fox
says in accented English that is sub-titled. ``Today we're training
in Guanajuato for that kind of speciality . . .''
</P>
<P>
   A voice in the background accuses Fox of wanting to send workers
abroad. Fox's words are contrasted with claims that Labastida will
create jobs at home.
</P>
<P>
   The ad cites his work as former agriculture secretary to open
the U.S. market to Mexican avocados.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most effective ad of all,'' Labastida campaign
manager Esteban Moctezuma said. ``It wounds the pride of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad asks viewers, ``Can you imagine this man as
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Clips of Fox campaigning follow. In one he jokingly bends a
finger of a giant foam hand - his victory sign -- into an obscene
gesture. Another clip shows Fox stubbornly repeating ``today,
today'' while arguing with Cardenas over when to hold a debate.
</P>
<P>
   During a popular evening soap opera, the ad was followed by a
spot where a presidential-looking Labastida sits at a desk and -
over a crescendo of trumpets - promises, ``I'm going to be a
president everyone can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said he'd release a spot this week challenging the
``gardener ad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The response is thanks to the PRI and its failed policies, we
now have 18 million Mexicans living in the United States,'' Ortiz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz produced ads with two famous soap opera stars urging
Mexicans to vote for Fox. But their television network wouldn't air
the ads, arguing that they violated the stars' exclusive contracts.
The ads were turned into radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the campaign Ortiz fashioned an ad from a debate with
Fox, during which Labastida tried to embarrass Fox by repeating
insulting names Fox had reportedly called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's called me shorty, he's called me a pansy,'' Labastida
said. Fox replies, ``I can stop being rude, but you (and your
party) will never stop being corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want a president who tells the truth?'' a voice asks.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida workers are also attacking a key opposition argument:
If Mexico is to have a real democracy, the ruling party must lose
it's 71-year grip on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that the opposition parties have been
fomenting and promoting in their trips abroad,'' said Sandra
Fuentes, director of international relations for Labastida,
candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with members of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, Fuentes said opposition politicians are promoting the
democracy argument in American newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very dangerous argument,'' she said, because it could
jeopardize the credibility of the election. After a decade of
electoral reforms the balloting is supposed to be the fairest and
cleanest in Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   About 51 percent of Mexicans now live in areas with municipal
governments that are non-PRI, Fuentes also noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico lives with democracy,'' she said. ``The Mexican voters
will decide on July 2 if they want an alternation in power (at the
presidential level). But it's not a requirement. It's an option.''
</P>
<P>
   However, leading opposition challenger Vicente Fox is urging
Mexicans of all political stripes to consider him their first
chance in seven decades to oust the PRI from this country's
powerful presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is urgent, it is unavoidable that Mexico have an
alternation in power,'' Fox told the same group of American
newspaper editors last week. ``Government has corrupted . . . The
government of the PRI does not have any more to offer Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited two examples of how recent changes in state governments
revealed corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, which is now governed by a leftist party, the
former PRI mayor is suspected of diverting tens of millions of
dollars in public funds to the PRI. In Nuevo Leon, which is now
governed by a conservative party, former PRI officials are
suspected of diverting another $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``An alternation in power is one big step towards cleaning
government,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is the candidate of a coalition that includes Mexico's
conservative National Action Party, or PAN, and the Green Party, an
environmentalist party that is more leftist.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opposition politicians are complaining that the
ruling party is using pork-barrel tactics and that some government
workers have tried to pressure social-welfare recipients in remote
areas to vote for the ruling party. Measuring the seriousness of
these claims or resolving them will be difficult
</P>
<P>
   before the July 2 election.

JOHN COOLIDGE, GUARDIAN OF PRESIDENT'S LEGACY, DIES AT 93
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.H., Vt., Mass., Conn.)  By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Coolidge, the son of President Calvin Coolidge and the
oldest living offspring of an American president, died on Wednesday
in Lebanon, N.H. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge was a man of few words, like his father, and spent
most of his working life in private industry, including
establishing and running a factory to make cheese using
19th-century methods at Plymouth Notch, Vt. The cheese operation
was part of an effort he led to preserve the town where his father
was born and sworn in as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bought property time and again when the state didn't have
money, and it became part of the site,'' said John Dumville, chief
of the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, which runs the
historic site.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about a memorial for Calvin Coolidge, the president's
father, Col. John Coolidge always said that the town should be
preserved. The effort started in 1956, when John Coolidge and his
mother, Grace, gave the family homestead to the state.
</P>
<P>
   After Grace Coolidge died in 1957, John and his wife, Florence,
continued donating. The site now has 25 buildings on 551 acres,
maintained as they were when Calvin Coolidge was president from
1923 to 1929.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, John Coolidge lived in a house in
Plymouth Notch; the local residents, who number around 400, refused
to identify it to outsiders to protect his privacy. Previously, he
visited Plymouth Notch in the summer and lived in Connecticut the
rest of the year. He would often turn up at the historic site to
answer questions about the Coolidges, never mentioning that he was
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Coolidge was very much like his father,'' said Howard
Coffin, a historian in Montpelier, Vt. ``He was a man of few words
but what came out was well chosen. He would, however, when speaking
of his father and particularly of his childhood days at Plymouth
Notch, go on at surprising length.''
</P>
<P>
   One of John Coolidge's favorite stories was of the administering
of the oath of office to his father at 2:47 a.m. on Aug. 3, 1923,
after word was received that President Warren Harding had died the
day before. It was done by the light of a kerosene lamp because
Col. Coolidge did not approve of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge, who was attending a military camp in
Massachusetts, was told the news as he waited in line for
breakfast. ``Your father is president of the United States,'' the
captain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised, but nothing changed,'' John Coolidge
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge was born on Sept. 7, 1906, in his parents' home in
Northampton, Mass. He was named for his grandfather. His father had
originally been John Calvin Coolidge, but dropped his first name to
avoid confusion and later legally changed it.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Calvin Coolidge recorded his impressions
of the birth of his first son: ``The fragrance of the clematis
which covered the bay window filled the room like a benediction
where the mother lay with her baby. It was all very wonderful to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge had a younger brother, Calvin Jr., who was born
two years later. Robert A. Woods, a friend of the president's,
wrote in a book called ``The Preparation of Calvin Coolidge'' that
John was a mechanical boy who built ``a recognizable automobile,''
while his brother stuck to playing his mandolin. Both did chores
like mowing lawns and cleaning out furnaces for neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy struck the family in 1924. Calvin Jr. died at 16 after a
blister from playing tennis led to a staphylococcus infection.
Shocked Americans mourned the death, and even the famously taciturn
president broke down.
</P>
<P>
   As John Coolidge told Life magazine in 1992: ``Though father was
tenderhearted, he rarely showed his feelings. But when they were
taking my brother's casket from the White House after the services,
my father broke down and wept momentarily. Calvin was my father's
favorite. It hurt him terribly. It hurt us all.''
</P>
<P>
   President Coolidge could be a tough taskmaster. He once wrote
John at Amherst, where John was attending college, that he expected
his son to work hard rather than dallying in nearby Northampton,
home of Smith College, for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to keep in mind that you have been sent to college
to work,'' the president wrote. ``Nothing else will do you any
good. Nobody in my class who spent their time in other ways ever
amounted to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Once when John was visiting at the White House, he mentioned at
breakfast that he would not be dressing formally for dinner because
he would be going to a tea dance that evening. His father was
silent for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will remember that you are dining at the table of the
president of the United States,'' he finally replied, ``and you
will present yourself at the appointed hour properly clothed.''
</P>
<P>
   More often, however, John Coolidge remembered his father, who
died in 1933 at 60, as considerably folksier and wittier than many
perceived him. In 1959, at a White House reception for presidential
offspring, he told the story of passing a bank with his brother and
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys, listen here for a minute and maybe you can hear your
money working for you,'' Calvin Coolidge said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, John Coolidge met Florence Trumbull, daughter of the
governor of Connecticut, on a train bound for Washington and his
father's inaugural after being elected president the previous
November. They married in 1929 and named their first child Cynthia,
so that the president's initials, C.C., would be perpetuated.
Cynthia died in 1989. They had another daughter, Lydia Coolidge
Sayles, who survives, along with three grandchildren and two
great-grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge worked for the New York, New Haven &AMP; Hartford
Railroad for 13 years, then started a business, Manifold Forms Co.,
which made business forms, in Elmwood, Conn. Two years after
retiring in 1958, he reopened the Plymouth Cheese Corp. His
grandfather had been one of the original incorporators. John
Coolidge sold the cheese factory to the state of Vermont in 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, he held low-level party positions and made
speeches and wrote letters to newspapers attacking the New Deal. He
was a director of the Harvard Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But he preferred a low profile. A 1949 article in The New York
Times tells of the gangster Meyer Lansky's opulent suite on the
steamship Italia, which he was taking to visit Lucky Luciano in
Italy. The story noted that John Coolidge and his family were on
the same ship and sailed cabin class.
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge always attended the annual commemoration of his
father's birth in Plymouth Notch on July 4, 1872. He kept the
ceremonies simple: a quiet procession, a few graveside words and a
wreath-laying. Last summer, for the first time, he could not manage
the stone steps to the hillside grave. But he watched from the
family car nearby.

IRVING RUDD, 82, PRESS AGENT IN BASEBALL, RACING, BOXING
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irving Rudd, a Runyonesque character who used wit and gimmickry
to promote the Brooklyn Dodgers, Yonkers Raceway, Nathan's Famous
and boxers like Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard, died on Friday.
He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, a short, fast-talking raconteur, wore a tie clasp that was
a 1953 Dodgers money clip, sported a 1955 Dodgers World Series ring
and placed a sign that said ``Ulcer Dept.'' atop his desk. He
introduced himself as I. Rudd, while others called him Unswerving
Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd made sure you called him a press agent, not a
public-relations man, whose ranks he called ``posturing phonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Press agentry was an honorable and sporting game to Rudd, who
was born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and graduated from
Thomas Jefferson High School. In later years he joked that he
hadn't graduated; he was ``acquitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd learned to deal with reporters in the days before
television in much the same way that he dealt with the worthiness
of a boxer, a Dodger or a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's job was to generate the ink that created the buzz that
put fans in seats. He started drumming up attention for fights for
$18 a week at a Harlem boxing hall called the Rockland Palace and
later worked in small fight clubs like the Ridgewood Grove and
Eastern Parkway Arena.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Dodgers in 1949 and subsequently devised bat day,
camera day, batboy for a day and music unappreciation night.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd once demanded to know if Gen. Douglas MacArthur, having
been recalled by President Harry S. Truman from Korea in 1951,
``had an allergy to Brooklyn,'' because he attended baseball games
at Yankee Stadium and Giants games at the Polo Grounds, but no
Dodger games at Ebbets Field. Eventually, MacArthur attended one
game in Brooklyn, which yielded a promotional bonanza. He attended
12 more, all Dodger losses. That happened to be the season the
Dodgers blew a 13{-game lead to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles in 1957, Rudd went to
work for Yonkers Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   He staged his most famous stunt when the raceway reopened in
1958 after being rebuilt. Rudd told painters to misspell it
``Racewya'' on a sign next to the track, which made phone callers
inquire, ``Don't you idiots know how to spell raceway?'' Naturally,
photographers and television cameramen came to record the faux pas,
which generated clippings around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On a sweltering July day in 1979, he recalled to a reporter from
The New York Times that during summer days at Yonkers, ``We used to
go around to the barns and get a picture of a horse nuzzling one of
those great big cakes of ice.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We got a lot of ink that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He went a step further one day, placing newspaper ads that said:
``Urgently wanted: Pool for champion Australian horse who needs to
swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd was quick-witted enough to correct a man claiming to be the
sportscaster Howard Cosell's worst enemy by saying, ``Not while I'm
alive.'' And he was flexible enough to work for the feuding boxing
promoters, Don King and, then, Bob Arum, Rudd's boss until his
retirement in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In later years Rudd was the rare press agent in a sea of P.R.
men. But he retained his touch. When Marvelous Marvin Hagler fought
Thomas Hearns on April 15, 1985, he persuaded the Internal Revenue
Service to underwrite a television ad that had the fighters
advising the audience to file their tax returns early.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gertrude, of Bayside, Queens; two
daughters, Susan Rudd-Cohen, of Manhattan, and Nancy Marmer, of
Henderson, Nev.; four grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.

POLITICAL MEMO: IS BUSH OVERPLAYING HIS IGNORANCE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Refines lede, reworks 20th graf, now reading ``He
exhibits...,'' changes word in 23rd graf, ``On Wednesday...'') 
 By FRANK BRUN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the annals of political hucksterism, it will
undoubtedly go down as one of the strangest pitches ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Selling Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to the voters at a rally in
Albuquerque, N.M., this past week, Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico
recounted a conversation that he and Bush had once had about the
speakers at a conference of state leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``George turns to me,'' Johnson recalled, ``and says, `What are
they talking about?' I said, `I don't know.' He said, `You don't
know a thing, do you?' And I said, `Not one thing.' He said,
`Neither do I.' And we kind of high-fived.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a populist tribute to Bush as the antithesis of an
egghead, or at least it was supposed to be. But the way it came
across raised a serious strategic question: are Bush and his allies
overplaying his disdain for intellectualism, to the point where
they are sometimes making him out to be a self-satisfied boob?
</P>
<P>
   In February, Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., talked Bush up in
South Carolina by reassuring audience members that a president does
not have to be clever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy clever,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly four months since then, Bush has repeatedly curled
his lip at the thought or mention of Ivy League types who tote
mental suitcases jammed with facts and figures, and he has
deflected questions about gaps in his experience with a sunny,
ready pledge to assemble and rely on the keenest, most scrupulous
advisers he can find.
</P>
<P>
   He did it again on Friday, when he addressed the participants at
a celebration of the 20th anniversary of CNN. In response to a
question from a Saudi Arabian journalist about international
affairs, Bush did not claim to be well read on the subject or well
along the road to erudition (although, in fact, Bush has slogged
through thick tomes on Russia and the Balkans in recent months).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush suggested that raw knowledge had been overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can expect any president to know all things
about all subjects,'' he said, adding that one of the roles of a
leader was ``to surround himself with excellent folks'' and ``to be
able to listen and to be able to delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   That perspective may not be revolutionary or reckless. But
Bush's sustained promotion of it _ along with his tendency on the
campaign trail to throw stones at ivory towers and challenge any
suggestion that book learning could trump horse sense _ is
unusually aggressive, something akin to a defiant reverse snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   And some political analysts see it as risky. They say this
strategy may bet too heavily on the belief that Americans hanker
for a folksy, ordinary guy in the White House and that it may pay
too little heed to their desire for someone who exudes confidence
about solving complex problems without summoning a supplementary
brain trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't want a know-it-all,'' said Stephen J. Wayne, a
political scientist at Georgetown University whose specialty is the
American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they do want a president with some intellectual ability,''
Wayne said. ``What Bush has to watch is that he doesn't reinforce
stereotypes that there is not much there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides are attuned to that. Aboard his campaign plane on
Friday afternoon, one of them looked vaguely panic-stricken and did
a quick survey, presumably looking for cameras, when the Texas
governor appeared among a few members of the press corps cradling a
book titled ``Spanish for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was not Bush's, and he was merely using it to tease a
reporter. But the alarmed aide seemed to understand that a
photograph of the moment would not convey such distinctions and
would yield to less flattering interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   It would also, ultimately, bother Bush, whose frequently sharp
wit suggests that he is plenty bright and who really wants to have
it all ways.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to distinguish and separate himself from Ivy League
intellectuals and any arrogance associated with their educational
milieu.
</P>
<P>
   But he repeatedly invokes Yale, from which he got his bachelor's
degree, and Harvard, from which he got a master's in business
administration, as proof that people who question his smarts are
foolish to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He exhibits a disinclination to store or brandish certain
details and information, but exudes a defensiveness about
intimations that he does not know all that much.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, he presented a television network producer
who had graduated from Harvard with an advertisement for audio
tapes, torn from a magazine, that promised ``a Harvard graduate's
vocabulary in just 15 minutes a day!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just ordered several,'' Bush scribbled across the page.
``What do you think? Do I have a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he fumed at the memory of one of the many times in
the presidential campaign when he felt his level of intellectual
engagement was being underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Bantering with Chris Matthews, the host of the television news
program ``Hardball,'' during a commercial break in a taping of the
show, Bush remembered that he had once publicly told Matthews that
his favorite author was Winston Churchill, and that a pundit
subsequently suggested that Bush's comment had been a scripted
effort to please Matthews, a known Churchill devotee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think I'd take time out of my life to research what the
hell you like?'' Bush asked Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read a hell of a lot more books than you give me credit
for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is undoubtedly so, but it is sometimes Bush and his allies
who are denying the Texas governor the credit.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was not Bush's thoughtfulness or eagerness to be
informed that Johnson saw fit to praise during his remarks on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Johnson saluted Bush as the rare ``somebody who
will rather admit _ or rather talk about _ the things they don't
know and make that really evident.''

SMALL PARTIES ISSUE ENDORSEMENTS, ALONG PARTY LINES
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Updates throughout with events.)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With as much relief as enthusiasm, New York's
Conservative and Liberal parties reverted to type Saturday,
endorsing Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton, respectively, for
the Senate, after both parties had endured a queasy several months
that left their nominations in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks into his campaign, Lazio, a congressman
little known beyond his Long Island district, has been working to
establish himself in voters' minds as a centrist, but Saturday his
campaign veered to the right. Addressing the Conservative Party's
nominating convention at a hotel a few blocks from the state
Capitol, he promised ``a crusade,'' offering up a list of favorite
conservative causes like tax cuts, the death penalty, longer prison
terms and greater military spending.
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke of the issue most identified with the
Conservatives in recent years, opposition to what opponents call
partial-birth abortion. ``There is no place in our society for the
gruesome procedure partial-birth abortion,'' he said, to
enthusiastic applause from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier at the Intercontinental Hotel in Manhattan,
where Clinton accepted the Liberal Party endorsement, she and the
party's leader, Raymond B. Harding, noted that Lazio was more
conservative than the man he replaced as the Republican candidate,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways my views are closer to those of the mayor than
those of my opponent,'' Clinton said. ``He is out of step with the
mainstream,'' she said of Lazio. ``My views are centrist views,
positive views,'' she added at a brief press conference at which
she referred to herself as a centrist no fewer than four times.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events highlighted to Lazio that the Conservative
Party's backing can be both an aid and a burden, as each candidate
tries to claim the political middle ground. Unlike the Liberals,
the Conservatives still hew to an ideology in keeping with their
name, taking strong stands against abortion, gay rights,
affirmative action and big government. And the party's ready
embrace of Lazio as a real conservative contrasts sharply with its
rejection of Giuliani as too moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said nothing to distance himself from the Conservative
Party, even as he obliquely acknowledged that the affiliation could
be used against him. ``The other side is going to try to demonize
me,'' he said. ``They're going to try to demonize you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He also peppered his speech with attacks on Clinton, who barely
mentioned him Saturday. ``You won't catch us trying to nationalize
one-seventh of our economy,'' Lazio said, a reference to her failed
plan to restructure the nation's health care system. He reminded
his audience several times that Clinton was new to New York,
saying, ``I was able to jump into this race without a listening
tour because I've been listening to new York all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Clinton, he said, ``She comes to New York with the support of
every left-wing special-interest group from Washington insiders to
the Hollywood elite.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As long as Giuliani was the presumptive Republican nominee, the
race had both the Liberal and Conservative parties in turmoil. The
Liberals, whose longstanding support of the mayor had alienated
many Democrats, faced a pitched internal battle over which side to
take.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party chairman Michael L. Long vowed that his party
would not support the mayor because he was not conservative enough,
especially on abortion. Party leaders said they would nominate
someone to Giuliani's right, even if undermining him meant helping
Clinton and damaging the Conservatives' relationship with the
Republican Party. But the Conservatives were having some trouble
finding a viable candidate of their own.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani dropped out of the race last month, and the
Republicans nominated Lazio instead, the battle lines became clear
and the Liberals and Conservatives fell into their comfortable old
roles as contentious allies of the major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative delegates said Saturday that they were relieved to
be able to unite with the Republicans, and one after another, said
abortion was the key issue. ``Abortion is the big difference
between Lazio and Giuliani,'' said Viola Hunter of Syracuse, vice
chairwoman of the party. ``We're not a one-issue party, but it is a
very vital, important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio supports legal abortion, but unlike Clinton _ and Giuliani
_ he opposes government funding for it, and supports a
partial-birth abortion ban.
</P>
<P>
   In nominating Clinton, the Liberal Party went some distance
toward mending its frayed relationship with its traditional ally,
the Democratic Party. The Liberals had alienated many Democrats by
backing the mayor, and by refusing to support the Democratic
nominee for governor in 1998, Peter F. Vallone, and instead
nominating Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Harding cited a long list of popular Democrats his
party has supported, like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Hugh Carey and
Robert F. Kennedy, and noted that when it has supported Republicans
for statewide office, they have been widely revered centrists like
Fiorello La Guardia and Jacob Javits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to put Lazio at the end of that litany and it jars the
ear,'' he said. ``Put Hillary there and it fits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has fewer than 2 percent of the state's
registered voters, and the Liberal Party fewer than 1 percent, but
they wield an influence beyond their size. The major parties must
play to them, because each of the smaller parties presents a choice
between closing ranks and facing a challenger who can provide an
outlet for protest votes. In recent statewide elections, Republican
candidates have pulled as many as 300,000 votes on the Conservative
line, while Democrats often get well over 100,000 on the Liberal
line.

REAL ESTATE: DOWNTOWN L.A. REVITALIZATION TO INCLUDE MARKET-VALUE
APARTMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Colo., Md.)   By MORRIS NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An upscale rental project that will eventually
fill three city blocks and have 658 apartments is rising at the
edge of the central business district here, where no market-rate
housing has been built for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million development, known as the Medici, is one of a
number of recent projects in downtown Los Angeles that have brought
_ or will bring _ a new sports arena, a new museum, a new concert
hall, a new cathedral and new housing to a business district that
formerly had little but high-rise office buildings and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of 92 apartments is expected to be completed in
July, and all have been leased, except two penthouses, said Geoff
Palmer, the Medici's developer and the president of G.H. Palmer
Associates of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As an entirely private development with no public subsidies, the
Medici is an anomaly in an area where nearly all housing in recent
years has been subsidized, low-income apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major turning point to have a private developer take
the initiative to build housing downtown on his own,'' said Donald
R. Spivack, the deputy administrator of the Los Angeles Community
Redevelopment Agency, the leading builder of low-income housing
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said, ``I'm ahead of the curve,'' but he added that his
project was a response to a demonstrable demand. Downtown has a
vacancy rate of only 2 percent, he said, and rents are rising
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The Medici project is now under construction immediately west of
the Harbor Freeway, an elevated 10-lane road that serves as the
unofficial western boundary of the central business district.
</P>
<P>
   The project's only neighbors are office buildings and busy
streets, although two or three restaurants are within 100 yards of
the project, and the Staples Center sports arena is within easy
walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said his rents would be about 15 percent higher than
those of other market-rate apartments downtown. In the first phase,
rents will range from $1,280 for a 641-square-foot one-bedroom to
$2,608 for a 1,208-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. A
small number of penthouses will also be available; $8,200 a month
will rent the largest, with 2,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who developed an apartment building in downtown Los
Angeles in the 1980s but has spent much of his career putting up
rental apartments in the suburbs, said that downtown living had
found a new cachet in Los Angeles, and that, along with a growing
frustration over traffic congestion, helped him sell his project.
</P>
<P>
   Location was the overriding concern of Loren Stassart, one of
first tenants to reserve an apartment at the Medici.

   ``I figured I was driving 19 hours a week,'' said Stassart, who
owns a produce company and drives 65 miles from Riverside County to
his company on the southern edge of downtown. ``I had to buy a new
truck every two years just to go back and forth to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Stassart said he was looking for ``a nice, clean place that was
well secured.'' He is pleased with the view from his fourth-floor
apartment and is looking forward to moving in. ``There are city
lights at night,'' he said. ``It's almost like coming home to a
resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing for the Medici makes note of the Italian marble
vanities in the bathrooms, the black granite counter tops and maple
cabinets in the kitchens, the solid oak front doors, the 9-foot
ceilings and the double-paned windows. The complex also has an
outdoor pool with a 24-foot waterfall and a rubberized running
track and a golf driving range, both in a one-acre private park.
About 17,000 square feet will be devoted to retail space, with a
coffee bar, a juice bar and a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   The Medici's second phase, with 133 apartments, including some
studios, is scheduled to open in August, and the third and final
phase is to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   The new apartments are part of a larger change in the
development patterns downtown. In the 1970s and '80s, the city's
redevelopment agency aggressively promoted office development, in
the attempt to make downtown into a traditional city center. That
created a forest of high-rise office buildings on Bunker Hill and
in the financial district a few blocks west of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contended that the enormous public investment in
downtown was inappropriate for a nontraditional city like Los
Angeles, which has many business centers. By one estimate, the city
and state governments have spent $2 billion on downtown in the last
two decades, $1 billion of that from the redevelopment agency
alone. Office development boomed during the economically confident
early and mid-1980s, and between 1979 and 1992, developers built
nearly 20 million square feet of office space downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The recession of the early 1990s halted the construction of
speculative office space, and vacancy rates remained in the 20
percent range for much of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, developers have concentrated on entertainment
and cultural projects, not office buildings. Two recent projects _
the Medici and a set of six motion-picture sound stages completed
last year _ were both built on sites originally zoned for high-rise
office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese-American History Museum in the Little Tokyo
District on the east end of downtown has expanded. Last month, the
Southern California Institute of Architecture, a private
professional school, announced that it would relocate from Santa
Monica to a building on the east end of downtown. And the
long-delayed Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by Frank O. Gehry,
resumed construction in December after a five-year fund drive.
</P>
<P>
   The new Roman Catholic Cathedral of Los Angeles is rising at the
north end of downtown, between the Los Angeles Music Center and the
Hollywood Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The east end of downtown has a growing number of artists' lofts
in aging warehouses. Loft conversions are continuing on Fourth
Street in the historic district just east of City Hall; the Bank
District development, by Gilmore Associates of Los Angeles, will
have 250 rental lofts.
</P>
<P>
   But the venture that will possibly have the biggest impact on
downtown is the $350 million Staples Center, a basketball and
hockey arena that doubles as a concert hall. It was completed last
October.

</P>
<P>
   Spivack, the redevelopment official, credited the popularity of
Staples Center with reviving interest in downtown itself. ``Staples
is bringing people into downtown on evenings and weekends who
otherwise might not have come,'' he said. ``A lot of people are
pleasantly surprised when they come down here that downtown is a
fairly attractive place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, the Medici developer, said that the construction of the
sports arena was ``an added consideration'' in his own decision to
build upscale housing nearby. ``I knew that with Staples Center
coming, there would be an exodus back to the city,'' he said. ``I
knew it would generate a lot of activity, just as the stadiums in
Denver and Baltimore did.''
</P>
<P>
   The further revival of downtown will depend on building a base
of full-time middle-class residents, Palmer said. So far the area
has only a few thousand residents, although about 375,000 people
commute into downtown daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get downtown moving again just with low-income
housing,'' Palmer said. ``You need to bring in middle-class,
working people, and that is what we are doing. A lot of
professional people work downtown in beautiful buildings with glass
and marble, and they are used to a certain level of quality. I
could not see them coming home to Formica and linoleum.''

LAZIO SAYS CONGRESSIONAL RECORD PROVES `MAINSTREAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his eight years in Congress, Rep. Rick Lazio has
regularly broken Republican Party ranks and supported President
Clinton on matters like gun control, affirmative action and changes
in campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   But on the big tax and spending questions that have followed
along party lines and have often been decided by the narrowest of
margins, he has been a reliable ally of the conservative Republican
leaders of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio voted to impeach Clinton on two of the four articles
recommended by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of abortion, which Hillary Rodham Clinton, his
Democratic opponent in the race for the New York Senate seat, wants
to make a central issue, Lazio has taken middle ground, siding
neither with those who want to outlaw abortion entirely, nor with
those who oppose all restrictions on access to abortion procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Among his legislative accomplishments has been sponsorship of a
bill, enacted in 1998, to overhaul the system of federal housing
assistance. This year, he was instrumental in brokering a
compromise to increase the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has not been particularly involved in foreign policy, but
he has been among the House Republicans most supportive of the
president on international issues. For example, he supported the
president's intervention in Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio announced his candidacy for the Senate last month, he
said: ``I have a record that I am proud of. It is a mainstream
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign responded with the charge that far from being
moderate, the congressman was a loyal soldier in House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's conservative revolution.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Lazio's record found ample support for both
arguments. In his first two years in Congress, when Democrats were
in control, Lazio voted in favor of the Clinton administration's
legislation more often than almost any other Republican. For
instance, a study by the Congressional Quarterly found that in
1994, Lazio supported the president on 72 percent of the votes on
which Clinton expressed a position, a higher percentage than all
but two other Republicans in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But after Republicans won control of the House in the 1994
elections, Lazio advocated most of the Republicans' Contract with
America. Since then, he has been much less supportive of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the issues on which Lazio has broken with the
leaders of his party and voted the way Clinton might have voted:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gun control: Lazio voted for the Brady law, which requires a
five-day waiting period for handgun purchases, and for a ban on the
sale of assault weapons. Last year, he supported a measure to
require criminal background checks of people who make purchases at
gun shows. After that was defeated, he supported a bill endorsed by
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   _ Affirmative action: Lazio voted against a bill that would have
prohibited colleges and universities from using racial preferences
in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family leave: He supported legislation that requires many
companies to give their workers unpaid leave to spend time with a
newborn child or a sick family member.
</P>
<P>
   _ Environment: He voted against Republican bills to relax clean
water regulations, strip the Environmental Protection Agency of
enforcement power and help developers get zoning changes over the
objection of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arts: He was one of only 15 Republicans who bucked Republican
leadership and voted for full funding for the National Endowment
for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food stamps: He voted to restore food stamps to legal
immigrants, a benefit that had been denied by the 1996 welfare
bill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Campaign finance: He has voted for legislation that would ban
donations of largely unregulated soft money to political parties
and restrict the ability of parties to run issue advertisements on
behalf of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Labor: He voted to prohibit employers from hiring permanent
replacements for striking workers.
</P>
<P>
   But when it has come to budget issues, the main focus of the
contention between Clinton and the Republican Congress during the
last six years, Lazio has supported the party line.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Budget Committee in 1995 that produced
the measure with almost $200 billion in tax cuts over five years,
the abolition of the Department of Education and sharp reductions
in anticipated government spending for Medicare and many other
programs. Ultimately, the fight with Clinton over this budget led
to the shutdown of the government in the winter of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   When his committee adopted the Republican budget in May 1995,
Lazio issued a press release proclaiming that it would ``move us
from the path of increasing debt and inefficient, big, centralized
government toward a government that is smaller, more decentralized
and efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Lazio voted for a constitutional amendment to
require a balanced budget, billions more than Clinton sought in
military spending and sweeping tax cuts.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's record on other issues seems conventionally Republican.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gay rights: Lazio voted to codify the ban on homosexuals in
the military.
</P>
<P>
   _ Term limits: He supported a constitutional amendment that
would have placed a 12-year limit on the terms of senators and
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Death penalty: He voted to limit the ability of death-row
inmates to challenge their sentence in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   _ Education: He supported vouchers to help parents pay their
children's private school tuition, and he voted to allow states to
deny public education to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Litigation: He voted to limit punitive damages in product
liability cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health care: He opposed a bipartisan bill last year that would
place restrictions on health insurers and allow patients to sue
their managed-care plans, and instead supported Republican
proposals that would not allow such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assisted suicide: He voted to overturn Oregon's
assisted-suicide law.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Lazio voted to impeach Clinton on two of the
four charges brought by the Judiciary Committee: for committing
perjury before a grand jury and for obstructing justice in the
civil suit brought by Paula Corbin Jones. He voted against
impeachment for perjury in the civil suit and for lying to Congress
in written answers to questions posed by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bear no animus for Bill Clinton; I have no grudge against
him,'' Lazio said in a speech to the House during the impeachment
debate, adding that he planned to vote for impeachment, he said,
``to hammer home as best I can that we must continue to insist that
no one is above the law and that the truth must be told. We simply
cannot tolerate dishonesty in the heart of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans made Lazio a deputy whip and one of two
assistant majority leaders. One of his assignments is liaison
between the Republican leadership and the ``Lunch Bunch,'' a group
of moderate Republicans, mostly from the Northeast, who meet weekly
for lunch to discuss politics and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders appointed Lazio to the Commerce Committee, one of
the most influential committees in Congress, and, waiving a party
rule, allowed him to keep his chairmanship of the Banking
Committee's Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity.
Normally, members of the Commerce Committee are required to
relinquish their seats on other committees.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Lazio has consistently opposed the efforts of many
of his fellow Republicans to make abortion illegal. He also broke
with his party to support federal criminal penalties for people who
use force to block access to abortion clinics, and to allow
organizations that use their own money to provide abortions in
developing countries to be eligible for international
family-planning funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio has also opposed using federal Medicaid money to pay
for abortions for low-income women, and he has consistently voted
to outlaw the late-term procedure that anti-abortion forces call
partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio's campaign was asked this week about the
congressman's legislative accomplishments, staff members provided a
list of measures he had backed: cracking down on Medicare and
Medicaid fraud, a screening program for breast and cervical cancer
in low- and moderate-income women, a bill Lazio sponsored to order
a Justice Department investigation of mistreatment of
Italian-Americans during World War II .
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign staff did not include Lazio's sponsorship of
the the 1998 law that overhauls federal housing assistance program.
</P>
<P>
   Among many other aspects, the law is supposed to increase the
proportion of those receiving federal housing assistance who work
and require many of them to perform community service. It also
encourages public housing authorities to reduce the concentration
of very poor tenants in buildings, a situation Lazio believes
contributes to crime.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio worked closely on the legislation with Andrew M. Cuomo,
secretary of housing and urban development, and the bill eventually
passed the House by an almost unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   On the minimum wage, Lazio tried to find legislation both
parties could support. Democrats favor increasing the minimum wage
to $6.15 an hour from the current $5.15 over two years. Most
Republicans oppose raising the minimum wage but favor tax cuts for
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio offered a compromise to raise the figure to $6.15 over
three years and to join it with a $30 billion tax cut for
businesses over five years. In March, the House passed a bill
similar to Lazio's proposal that would raise the minimum to $6.15
over two years and cut taxes by $46 billion over five years. That
measure is now pending before the Senate.

71 PREPARE FOR TRANS-ATLANTIC SOLO SAILING 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Prada Challenge of Italy advanced to last spring's
America's Cup finals, the team's helmsman and leader, Francesco de
Angelis, found himself at the center of a news media on-slaught.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the Prada crew had become national heroes, but when
asked how he handled the burden of his new celebrity, de Angelis
shrugged and invoked the name of his country's most famous sailor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more popular in Italy now,'' he said. ``But I'm no
Giovanni Soldini.''
</P>
<P>
   De Angelis was correct. Soldini _ a single-handed offshore
virtuoso whose training regimen includes beer, cigarettes and pool
halls _ is definitely one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the bearded, diminutive, 34-year-old Soldini will be
one of the favorites when the 10th running of the quadrennial
single-handed trans-Atlantic race begins off Plymouth, England,
bound for Newport, R.I. This year's event, which fields 71 boats
and is sponsored by the Europe 1 radio group and New Man
sportswear, is notable for its fleet of 19 Open 60s, the largest
collection of those beamy, skittish downwind flyers ever assembled
for a single race.
</P>
<P>
   Soldini's Fila is expected to be at or near the front of the
pack. Is Soldini daunted by the prospect of facing French
superstars like Yves Parlier, Marc Thiercelin and Catherine
Chabaud, or the young English prodigy, Ellen MacArthur?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said in a telephone interview last week. ``I will do
like always. I will sail my race.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Soldini's long-distance adventures have run the
spectrum from joyous to tragic. In the last Around Alone race,
Soldini shook off a disastrous opening leg to claim a stirring,
come-from-behind victory. Along the way he captured the world's
attention by performing a stunning rescue of his fellow competitor,
Isabelle Autissier, who had capsized in the desolate reaches of the
Southern Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But in the prelude to that race, Soldini's best friend, the
yacht designer Andrea Romanelli, was swept from Fila's decks in a
North Atlantic storm, and lost at sea. After winning Around Alone,
Soldini's first thoughts were of Romanelli. ``I wish he were
here,'' he said. ``This boat was his life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldini won Around Alone by sailing fast and intelligently,
pushing hard when conditions were favorable, but easing back when
the weather turned inclement. That old adage about solo marathon
racing _ you must finish to win _ topped his list of priorities.
But Soldini was lucky, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the midway point of the Around Alone race, Soldini was not
the leader. That distinction belonged to the rugged English
yachtsman, Mike Golding, aboard Team Group 4. Golding is also
competing in this year's single-handed trans-Atlantic race. And had
it not been for a simple, awful mistake, the roles could have been
reversed. Had it not been for an easily avoided sandbar, Golding,
not Soldini, might be the reigning Around Alone champ.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the first leg of the race, Golding was just 200
miles from duplicating the feat on second leg when, on a crystal
clear summer afternoon, he made a grave navigational error and
furrowed into the shallows off New Zealand's Cape Reinga at the top
of North Island, nearly ripping off his boat's deep canting keel in
the process. Golding survived the grounding, but was devastated
when he realized he would be forced to withdraw. ``It's so sad,''
he had lamented. ``It's a shattered dream.''
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time, however, the starch has returned to
Golding's upper lip. ``It was unfortunate and even slightly
unlucky,'' he said last week. ``Another day, if I'd been 100 yards
to the right, it wouldn't have happened. But someone up there
predetermined that I wasn't going to finish that race and so it
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every sailor hits bottom at some point, and for me it was
highly public,'' he said, finding the humor in his plight.
</P>
<P>
   Like Soldini and most of the other Open 60 sailors, Golding is
using this event as a tune-up and qualifier for this fall's
grueling Vendee Globe nonstop solo race around the world. And
Golding also knows the trans-Atlantic race will be no laughing
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential for an extremely close, extremely good
race,'' Golding said. ``I'm looking forward to getting stuck into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So too are Americans Bruce Burgess aboard Hawaiian Express, the
only United States Open 60 in the field, and Martin van Breems of
Norwalk, Conn., sailing a J/44 called Monhegan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get out there and go sailing,'' said van
Breems, one of five American entrants in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for the opening days of the 2,800-mile dash,
depending on the route chosen, calls for moderate southwesterlies.
The roster of competitors who Golding believes are dangerous holds
few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Giovanni,'' Golding said. ``He's very fast and very
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   But when told that Golding and most everyone else was gunning
for him, Soldini would not take the bait. ``There are many, many,
many tough boats that could do well,'' he said. ``They are all very
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldini would not name his rivals, but he would venture a guess
on his arrival in Newport. ``Maybe in 14 days,'' he said. ``And 18
for the others. That would be nice, no?''  &QL;

 &HT;    Courthouse talk: Lewis case weak
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The issue started as courthouse whispers a week ago
and is now being openly discussed: The murder case against NFL star
Ray Lewis could be dismissed in a directed verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Monday or Tuesday, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard
is expected to announce that the state has finished presenting its
murder case against Lewis and two co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, lawyers for the three defendants will rise
and tell Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner they have a motion.
The jury will be excused, and the defense lawyers will ask Bonner
for directed verdicts. That means they contend there is not enough
evidence for the case to go any further and the charges should be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge accepts the motion, the case won't reach the
jurors. Instead, she will decide for them.
</P>
<P>
   Although directed verdict requests are routine, they are rarely
granted. But lawyers and legal experts following the Buckhead
stabbings murder trial say Bonner may have a tough decision on her
hands. They cite a lack of evidence, particularly against Lewis and
one of his co-defendants, Joseph Sweeting, and the irony that many
of the prosecution's witnesses have seemed to help the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very close call,'' said Atlanta defense lawyer
Alan Baverman, who is commenting on the trial for national media
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 25, and friends Sweeting, 34, of Miami, and Reginald
Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, are charged with the Jan. 31 stabbing
deaths of Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, both of
Decatur, Ga., in a Buckhead altercation following post-Super Bowl
partying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to this case,'' said one of Lewis' lawyers,
Don Samuel, who is expected to argue the directed verdict motion.
``There's hardly a single witness they have called that we would
not have called. . . . I think we've got a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, directed verdicts can be granted if a judge
decides that no reasonable jury can find a defendant guilty, even
if it weighs all the evidence in the light most favorable to the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   As court adjourned Friday, Howard hadn't finished making his
case. And just because it's been rough sledding so far, he could
still end with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Howard is seeking to recall witness Duane Fassett, who is
resisting a return appearance. Fassett, the driver of Lewis' rented
limousine on the night of the slayings, was the embodiment of
pathos during his testimony, failing to deliver key prosecution
contentions _ based on his statements to police _ that Lewis
punched one of the victims and that, as the limo sped from the
scene, Oakley and Sweeting admitted to the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   Howard wants to put Fassett on the stand again to ask him about
the prior statements. If Fassett denies making them, Howard can
bring them into evidence by calling as a witness one of the police
officers to whom Fassett made the statements. If Fassett returns,
the question of a directed verdict likely will be moot.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's attorney, Bruce Harvey, said Howard stretched out his
case last week to buy time while he tried to get Fassett to return.
</P>
<P>
   Howard is also considering whether to call limo passengers
Carlos Stafford, Gino Hutcherson and Claudus Thompson. The three
would likely will seek immunity from prosecution in exchange for
their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Among highlights of the evidence so far:
</P>
<P>
   Only one witness, convicted con-man Chester Anderson, has
testified he saw Lewis attack a victim, and a man who was with him
gave a statement to police contradicting Anderson's testimony.
Among other witnesses, Jeff Gwen, one of the victims' friends, said
he saw Lewis ``tussling'' with a victim. Fassett said he merely saw
Lewis cock his hand back while Sweeting struggled with an
unidentified man.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have introduced evidence that Lewis lied to police
and allegedly orchestrated a cover-up that included ordering limo
passengers to keep quiet about the fight and having evidence
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, Sweeting bought the knives police say
were used in the killings. He dropped the empty knife packages on
the street as he left the limo, testified Fassett, who said he
picked them up. Fassett also testified that he saw Sweeting
throwing punches at a man who lay on the street near where the
bodies were found. But Fassett was unable to say whether Sweeting
was, in fact, striking either Baker or Lollar. And none of the
witnesses has testified that he saw a knife in Sweeting's hand
during the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The most solid evidence placing one of the defendants in a fight
with the victims is against Oakley. Two of the victims' friends
said Oakley started arguing with, and challenging, them. Moments
later, Baker smashed a bottle over Oakley's head. That's one of the
few facts uncontradicted in the case. Fassett said he saw Oakley
chase and slam Baker to the street, striking him while he was down.
Christopher Shinholster, one of the victims' friends, said he saw
Oakley standing over Baker.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding directed verdicts, a judge must determine if there
is any evidence at all to support the state's theory as to how the
crime occurred. Such motions are rarely granted because the judge
must assume that the state's witnesses are telling the truth.
Whether there is evidence or testimony that impeaches those
witnesses is a question for jurors to decide.

<P>
   A problem with the state's case against Lewis is how the
prosecution indicted him, said Baverman, the Atlanta defense
lawyer, who won a directed verdict in a 1994 armed robbery case.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is charged with murder, felony murder and aggravated
assault. The latter charge accuses him of knifing one of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution sort of limited itself,'' Baverman said. ``If
they had charged aggravated assault with his feet and hands, it'd
be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they have charged him with aggravated assault and felony
murder with the knife,'' Baverman said. ``Is there a reasonable
inference that he held somebody down so somebody else could stab
him or hurt somebody to the extent that it allowed somebody else to
stab him? So far, I haven't seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Clayton County prosecutor Brandon Hornsby, who has been
watching the trial, said a directed verdict is ``definitely a
possibility on Lewis'' but probably not against the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a bare circumstantial case against Lewis,'' he said.
``There is a circumstantial case against Sweeting. And there is
direct evidence against Oakley.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hornsby said, it's not over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to wait and see,'' he said. ``Paul Howard may
present compelling evidence that will eliminate the issue of a
directed verdict from the case.''

PUTIN HINTS AT COLLABORATION WITH U.S. ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his final visit to Moscow as president, Bill Clinton
arrived here Saturday and dined tonight with Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin, at the Kremlin palace, where the two
leaders made a ``very serious and focused beginning'' on full range
of issues, including the search for a compromise on anti-missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   During a nearly three-hour working dinner, the two men also
discussed the American-Russian nuclear relationship, ongoing
conflicts in the Balkans and the Caucasus, international trade and
the state of the Russian economy, said a senior administration
official who sat in on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The official described the talks as ``businesslike,''
``congenial'' and ``easygoing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesslike is good; businesslike is good,'' the official
said, putting a positive cast on the talks, but declining to
discuss them except in the vaguest terms. ``Remember that the two
presidents do know each other, and that was quite apparent from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met Putin twice last year when he was prime minister,
once at a tribute in Oslo to the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
and a second time at the annual economic summit of Pacific Rim
countries, but the talks that started Saturday and will continue
through Sunday represent their first face-to-face encounter since
Putin was elected president in March.
</P>
<P>
   During their talks, Putin spoke some English and both leaders
showed an enthusiasm to hear out the other's position on items of
dispute, the administration official said. But he acknowledged that
the initial exchanges lacked the first-name familiarity that
characterized the relationship between Clinton and former President
Boris Yeltsin, where it was always Boris and Bill.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner of cold boiled boar, baked ham and cabbage and
goose with berry sauce, Putin led Clinton on a tour of the
residence, showing him a personal study, a small chapel, a gym and
a massage room. The leaders settled down in stuffed arm chairs in
an intimate wood-paneled theater for a jazz concert tribute to
Louis Armstrong, conducted by one of Russia's best known band
leader, Oleg Lundsrem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has arrived to find Putin absorbed with domestic
politics, a wrenching set of economic reforms just getting under
way and an unresolved war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton has come to a Russia that is
relatively stable, poised for economic recovery and more
politically united _ though disputes abound _ than at any time
since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. This is a sharp
contrast with Clinton's most recent visits here _ in 1996 when
former Yeltsin was fighting for his political life against an
entrenched Communist opposition, and in 1998 when the Russian ruble
and much of the country's economy had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Like a younger Bill Clinton (Clinton was 46 when he became
president eight years ago; Putin is 47), Putin has taken command of
the Kremlin with an apparent determination to focus on his
country's economic problems and other pressing domestic issues
while keeping things quiet on the foreign policy front. There,
America still looms as an enormous force in Russia's calculations
on everything from financial assistance and debt restructuring to
NATO expansion and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking agreement to modify a 1972 treaty and thus go
ahead with a national anti-missile defense; Russia has so far
refused.
</P>
<P>
   Right after his inauguration last month, Putin, a former KGB
officer, stirred liberal fears about his commitment to democracy
when heavily armed police raided the offices of a top news media
organization. On Sunday, Clinton will sit for a radio interview _
with live questions from the audience over the Internet _ on the
popular Ekho Moskvy station run by the media group in what is
intended as a gesture of support for the freedom of the press in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton will address the Russian Duma, or lower house
of parliament, which has formed a strong pro-reform, and pro-Putin
majority, since elections last December, though many battles over
land ownership, regional autonomy and national investment lie
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The economic reality that Russia faces was highlighted most
glaringly by Putin himself after he was named acting president on
New Year's Eve when Yeltsin resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reach the production level of Portugal and Spain, two
countries that are not known as leaders of the world economy,''
Putin said, ``it will take Russia approximately 15 years'' even
under optimistic growth assumptions of 8 percent a year. Only twice
in this century, he said, had Russia been so weak, ``after the
October Revolution in 1917, and in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, as a political unknown whose disposition to the Western
eye is somewhat dour, seems unlikely to achieve with Clinton the
easy-going ``Boris and Bill'' chemistry that dominated Yeltsin's
two terms. Putin seemed a little uncomfortable when the Japanese
prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, announced during an April summit
meeting in St. Petersburg that the two leaders would call each
other by their diminutive names, Yoshi and Volodya.
</P>
<P>
   Under Putin, still very much the man in the gray suit, a more
pragmatic and businesslike style prevails these days in the
Kremlin, though he has bonded in an openly friendly manner with
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin has betrayed a certain admiration for Clinton. When
the two leaders met last fall in New Zealand at a meeting of
Asian-Pacific leaders, Putin was still a novice prime minister,
whose popularity among Russians was soaring due to his resolute
prosecution of the war in Chechnya. Putin admitted to a group of
interviewers from the newspaper Kommersant that he was charmed by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that first meeting, he paid special attention to me,''
Putin said, referring to Clinton. ``He made a point of coming up to
me. We had been seated at different tables. We talked about
something for a while, and then he said, `Well, shall we go?' All
the heads of state lined up. And he and I walked together along
that corridor. We exited the hall to the sound of applause. I
appreciated this sign of special regard,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin will meet three more times this year, in July
in Okinawa at a meeting of the world's wealthiest nations, in New
York in September at the United Nations and in Brunei in November,
where the Asian Pacific leaders will gather once again.
</P>
<P>
   While clearly Putin has strong views, especially on NATO
expansion and on the restoration of Russian power and national
dignity in international affairs, he has shown great pragmatism in
avoiding confrontation with the West, where he says he sees
Russia's future as a European nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton adopted that theme on Friday, when he used a speech
accepting a prestigious European award to appeal to western
Europeans to admit Russia, eventually, to both NATO and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult problems facing Clinton in the
relationship is that both leaders know that history has assigned
them different time slots in different decades. Clinton is almost
at the end of his term, and Putin is just embarking on his. And
this difference may do more to define the psychology at this summit
meeting than any other factor. Clinton has come here seeking to
make progress on his proposal to build a system of national missile
defense that requires an agreement to amend the treaty banning such
nationwide systems signed by Moscow and Washington more than 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If accepted by Russia, the American proposal represents a
profound turning point from offensive to defensive strategies by
the world's two largest nuclear powers, one with the potential to
reignite an arms race and alienate China, whose small nuclear
arsenal would loose its deterrent credibility. Putin sent his
foreign minister to the United Nations last month to warn that
America's missile defense plans could destabilize three decades of
arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an interview with ``The NBC Nightly News'' just
before Clinton's arrival, Putin hinted that the United States and
Russia might collaborate on new ways to shoot down enemy missiles
soon after they were launched, and thus address the problems posed
by nuclear weapons being acquired by so-called rogue states.
Clinton says the United States seeks an anti-missile defense only
to address that threat, although the Russians and Chinese are
skeptical that this is the true purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin will certainly engage Clinton's arguments, the
Russian leader knows that he also has the luxury of waiting for the
next American president. That gives him an advantage over Clinton,
who is in a hurry to improve the final cornice work of his
presidency.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, Putin has opened his term with a strategy
to strengthen federal power over Russia's vast region in
preparation for slogging economic reforms. He has also chastened or
bullied some of the country's most powerful oligarchs and launched
cogent tax reform proposals in hopes of establishing a level of
fiscal health in Russia that can outlive the current economic
boomlet that derives from high oil prices and a recovery among
export industries who profited from the massive devaluation of the
ruble in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has proposed legislation to gut and remake the upper house
of parliament, bolster the independence of the judiciary and weaken
the power of Russia's 89 governors. His proposals appear so
sweeping that his critics have attacked him for trying to recreate
the vertical power structure of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader's personal views on the subject have only
deepened those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, Russia was created as a
supercentralized state,'' he told interviewers this spring.
``That's practically laid down in its genetic code, its traditions
and the mentality of its people.''

have been demolishing traditional courtyard-style homes to make way
for high-rises and wider roads. In most cases, officials have
helped displaced residents find new homes at the edge of town and
given them a cash incentive to leave without protest. But in
extreme cases, like that of Zhao and her family, regulations are

   DIMAGGIO-ATTORNEY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ 04 (56 inches,
developing): Morris Engelberg is the sole trustee of Joe DiMaggio's
will, but few attorneys identify so closely with their clients. For
that matter, the average attorney does not name his office plaza
``Yankee Clipper Center,'' spend $8,500 on a marble plaque
memorializing his most famous client outside the front door, or
drop another $2,300 to create museum-like rooms inside, with scores
of DiMaggio photographs and other memorabilia. When DiMaggio died
last year at his Hollywood, Fla., home at age 84, no one had more
control over his life than Engelberg. ``I'm obsessed,'' Engelberg
said. ``I admit it. He was like a father to me. My own father died
three months before I was born. As a child in New York, I used to
tell people Joe DiMaggio was my father.'' In fact, they never met
until DiMaggio reached the final two decades of his life, but the
attorney came to assume a powerful role in the slugger's final
years. That role would put him at odds with political leaders in
San Francisco, members of the Hollywood (Fla.) Chamber of Commerce
and DiMaggio's own brother Dom. (Elmore, Palm Beach Post). 56.

AL UNSER JR. TRYING TO GET INDY-CAR CAREER BACK ON TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ He is carrying more baggage to the racetrack
these days, most of it unrelated to the art of manhandling an
Indy-car.
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr. never has had a problem with that, because sliding
his backside into a single-seat, open-wheel rocketship always has
been viewed as his family's birthright.
</P>
<P>
   But everyday life slowly and surely has been beating up on
Little Al, the son of four-time Indianapolis 500 champion Al Unser
and nephew of three-time Indy winner Bobby Unser. At 38, Unser Jr.
is recently divorced, the father of a daughter with a rare spinal
disease and a driver whose skills are rumored to be in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Along with clean underwear, these are the items Unser Jr. will
unpack for the first time this week at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I am at peace with myself _ as much as I can be.
Definitely,'' said Unser Jr., the marquee attraction of the Indy
Racing League's Casino Magic 500 on Saturday night. ``How can I say
it? You never know about somebody until they're really down and out
_ where their character lies and where their morals are and what
makes them what they are and who they are. I guess that's what
happened with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser Jr. racked up 31 career victories in the Championship Auto
Racing Teams FedEx Series between 1983 and 1994, the year in which
he won four poles, eight of 16 CART starts, his second series
championship and second Indy 500. At the height of their celebrity,
Little Al and Marlboro Team Penske ruled open-wheel, seemingly from
flag-to-flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Unser Jr. will race you whether it's an IRL car, CART car,
IROC car or a lawnmower,'' said Eddie Gossage, executive vice
president and general manager of Texas Motor Speedway. ``He's a
true racer. He's probably the only driver in the last 20 years
who's been able to jump from open-wheel to \RNASCAR\S stock cars
and be successful. I've heard Dale Earnhardt talk about how he
feels racing against Al Unser Jr., and it's the ultimate form of
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a purist's standpoint, you have to love him.''
 &LR; subheds:HITTING A WALL  &LR; body:Unser admitted that his success in
almost anything he raced came awfully fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe, for sure, I didn't know exactly what it was and
what it meant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time team owner Roger Penske opted not to renew Unser
Jr.'s CART contract last August, he was in the midst of a series
winless streak that would cover five seasons and 71 consecutive
races.
</P>
<P>
   On the track, Unser Jr. bottomed-out when he and Penske teammate
Emerson Fittipaldi failed to qualify for the 1995 Indy 500. Unser
Jr., as close to royalty as there ever has been at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway, became the first reigning champion not to make the
33-car starting field. He packed up and headed home to Albuquerque,
N.M., with a crushed ego.
</P>
<P>
   Off the track, Unser Jr. was flattened early in 1999, when he
and wife Shelley began divorce proceedings after 18 years of a
stormy marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hell,'' Unser Jr. said. ``... The big thing right
now is getting to see my children as much as I possibly can, and
going on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Al and Shelley are the parents of son Alfred, 17; daughters
Cody, 13 and Shannon, 11, and son Joseph, 3. During the divorce
proceedings the Unsers learned that Cody, then 12, had contracted a
rare spinal disease known as transverse myelitis (TM), paralyzing
her from the chest down. Cody now gets around with the help of a
custom-made wheelchair. Her condition, Unser Jr. said, has
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Al personally. So I'm still looking at him from
the outside,'' Gossage said. ``Divorce is something you can get
through. But I can't put myself in his place because of the illness
to his daughter. To be an individual who's used to making things
happen _ and he can't do a darn thing about Cody _ that changes
your whole outlook and makes you mature beyond your years. It has
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping the start of the 1999 CART season would offer some
respite, Unser instead suffered a broken ankle in a crash at
Homestead, Fla., forcing him to miss three events. As Penske
flip-flopped between the Penske and Lola chassis in '99, Little Al
racked up only four top-10 finishes, including a season-high fifth
at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission humbled, Unser was ready for a do-over.
Intrigued by the promise of a return to the Indy 500, Unser
accepted an offer to drive from longtime friend and former team
owner Rick Galles in the all-oval IRL. Unser Jr. and Galles, with
whom Little Al had launched his full-time Indy-car career in 1983,
clicked in their third start in the renamed Indy Racing Northern
Light Series in late April. Running second to Scott Goodyear with
20 laps remaining at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Unser Jr. inherited
the lead when the engine in Goodyear's car blew.
</P>
<P>
   ``That win in Las Vegas was critical,'' said Unser Jr., driver
of the No. 3 Galles ECR Tickets.com G Force/Aurora. ``I mean, it
closed a chapter in my life that was a very trying time with my
divorce ... with Cody getting ill ... me breaking my leg for a
second time ... battling a car that didn't have the right engine or
tires ... just so many things that were out of my control that were
being put in front of me as challenges that I had to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the win in Vegas closed that chapter, and at the same time,
it opened a new one. We're back and winning races again. There's
some people that probably aren't convinced right now, that still
see me in a `decline' in my career. And so, let it be. I don't feel
that way. I mean, I never doubted myself, that I was over the hill
or anything. I just had bad luck. And the wrong equipment. Now I'm
a winner at it, and I'm going to continue to keep doing what I'm
doing.''  &LR; subheds:NEW START  &LR; body:That is exactly the attitude
Galles was anticipating when he signed Unser to a five-year
contract _ unusually lengthy by motorsports standards _ in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a driver, I think Al's matured a lot,'' said Galles,
president and chief executive of Galles Motor Co. in Albuquerque.
``He's had some difficulties in his life which he's had to cope
with _ which we all do _ which matures people. But by and large, Al
and I, we're pretty much the same. We share the same philosophies
of racing and we're just a little more mature. And it's been a lot
of fun getting back with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Galles, whose family-owned business has posted annual sales of
$200 million and employs more than 400, launched his racing career
with Unser Jr. in 1981. They won the Super Vee championship, a
developmental open-wheel series, that season. In 1982, Galles and
Unser Jr. moved to and clinched the Can-Am Championship for exotic
sports cars. They graduated to CART in 1983. After moving to
another team from 1984-87, Unser rejoined Galles. They won the 1990
championship and the 1992 Indy 500 in their own Galmer chassis.
</P>
<P>
   Penske lured Unser over for the 1994 season, but he and Galles
never lost contact.
</P>
<P>
   Unser had especially hoped to make a splash in his ballyhooed
return to Indy last month. But after qualifying 18th on Pole Day,
he made more headlines with his mouth than with his car. In what
served as the last hot story of race week, Unser warned Indy 500
rookie Juan Montoya, the No. 2 qualifier and reigning CART
champion, that the Speedway's concrete walls were unforgiving and
tended to ``bite'' the overzealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carry people out of here on stretchers,'' said Unser Jr.,
drawing upon the experiences of his previous 12 Indy 500 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Unser's words were not well-received by the brash Montoya, who
had clashed with Unser during their year together in CART. But when
Montoya won the race in a rout, leading a rookie record 167 of 200
laps, Unser was quick to join in the choir of praise for the
24-year-old Colombian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a brilliant job. Brilliant job,'' said Unser Jr., who
finished a career-worst 29th after debris from the first crash of
pole sitter Greg Ray of Plano punctured his car's radiator after 66
laps. Unser Jr. returned for 24 more laps, but decided to park a
car he felt was not competitive and therefore a possible danger to
the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Like his old CART buddy, Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan respected it \Rthe Speedway\S, and that's what I wanted
out of him. Exactly,'' Unser Jr. said. ``He respected the place and
he respected the other drivers out on the racetrack, too. He showed
great maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I mean he lapped me _ he came off the corner and that
car's wiggling _ and we're 60 laps, 70 laps into the race. He's
driving that car like it was the last lap, and he did it ``every''
lap. To see that kind of talent with no mistakes ... it was
great.''  &LR; subheds:FAMILY ROAD TRIP  &LR; body:Big Al, Unser's father,
also made headlines at the Speedway as tutor to another Indy
rookie, 19-year-old Sarah Fisher. Fisher, who made her IRL debut at
TMS in October, became only the third woman to start the race in
its 84-year history. She finished 31st after being swept up in a
crash started, ironically, by Lyn St. James, only the second woman
to make the race.
</P>
<P>
   Selfishly, Little Al is hoping no woman wins the Indy 500 _
until his youngest daughter, Shannon, is ready to take her best
shot at the Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah. I believe she's interested in it,'' Unser Jr. said.
``Shelley doesn't give me time yet with my children, and we're
fighting that right now. They haven't come up with a parenting plan
yet. So, as soon as I get my children with me, then I'm going to
offer it to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Because it's a great life. Racing teaches sportsmanship,
it teaches competitiveness ... it teaches that if you work hard

POWER AND PERSUASION ARE PERKS FOR SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOL COACHES
IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Hughes was told he would have to share.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, you don't tell the winningest public school
basketball coach in the country that he has to share. So, in the
fall of 1997, when Hughes' Dunbar Wildcats discovered they were
expected to share the gymnasium with a physical education class
during their athletic period, Hughes wasn't about to sit still.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes announced his retirement. Sort of. Actually, he announced
that he would retire unless ``some things'' changed. They did. By
midseason, he had the gym to himself, and talk of retirement faded.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, a high school coach is far more than just someone who
draws Xs and Os and delivers fiery pregame speeches. In towns big
and small, high school coaches serve as surrogate parents, school
administrators, community political leaders and fund-raisers. They
are often paid more than any teacher in the district and at times
are feared for the power they wield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is known nationally for its coaches having an inordinate
amount of influence,'' said Tim Flannery, director of the National
Federation of State High School Associations' coaching program and
a longtime prep athletic director in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   While the emphasis on sports might be greater in Texas,
Hurst-Euless-Bedford district superintendent Gene Buinger said it
isn't unique to this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a superintendent for 20 years in four states, and in
every community, the coach is a very important position,'' Buinger
said. ``People think that this is only a Texas phenomenon, but I've
seen the same thing in Georgia, Oklahoma and Kansas. In Indiana it
may be a basketball coach. In some states, maybe a wrestling
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of a coach as icon might be on the verge of
extinction in the professional and college ranks, it's not about to
die out in Texas high schools. Fueled by the popularity of
scholastic sports and salaries that are usually much higher than
their teaching peers, coaches _ particularly football coaches _
routinely rise to the top of the local power structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we designed this system,'' Buinger said. ``We
didn't. This is a reflection of all that goes on around us. You can
look at it and say it shouldn't be that way, but all you have to do
is pick up the newspaper and see there's a whole section devoted to
sports. Not academics. Not music.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, which ranks No. 1 in the nation in high school sports
participation according to a 1999 survey conducted by the National
Federation of State High School Associations, prep sports is
big-time. For coaches, that means perks like money and prestige,
but also added pressure to win. At the highest-profile schools,
such as Duncanville and Odessa Permian, the facilities, money and
fan interest resembles a small-college program. And, while some
states might generate a similar atmosphere, Texas sports _
especially football _ can seem like another universe to those
looking in from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most states, schools keep athletics \Rmore\S in
perspective,'' Flannery said. ``In most states, athletics is a part
of the total program and has its place. It's not as important as it
is in Texas.''  &LR; subheds:COMMANDING TOP DOLLARS  &LR; body:Art Briles won
four Class 4A state football championships at Stephenville. School
administrators kept rewarding him financially for his success.
Despite a salary approaching $100,000, however, he left for a
position as an assistant coach with Texas Tech last winter.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been no nationwide study ranking high school
coaches' salaries, Flannery said he believes Texas high school
coaches are at or near the top nationally. In contrast, U.S.
Department of Education statistics show Texas is 38th nationally in
teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Prairie High drama teacher Susan Crocker, a board member
of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, doesn't totally agree
with the importance sometimes given athletics, but said she
understands why coaches get paid so well in communities where there
is rabid fan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supply and demand and it's what people want,'' Crocker
said. ``People have placed a great deal of emphasis on winning in
sports \Rhere\S, and it's not surprising that school districts have
responded to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line, the measure of a district became
more related to athletics than academics. What we perceive as a
good district is often as tied to success in athletics as it is to
test scores and graduation rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches, who often serve as district athletic directors
or campus athletic coordinators, are usually among the highest-paid
employees in a school district, not far behind superintendents in
many cases.
</P>
<P>
   Highland Park's Randy Allen makes $112,500. Duncanville's Bob
Alpert is at $92,400. Several other coaches, including Peach,
Odessa Permian's T.J. Mills, Grand Prairie's Jerry Bomar, Converse
Judson's D.W. Rutledge and Midland Lee's John Parchman, are paid
$80,000 or more. Trinity girls basketball coach Sue Cannon earns
$75,950.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are far higher than the salaries of classroom
teachers in the same school districts. Alpert, for example, makes
21/2 times the average Duncanville teacher salary of $37,014, and
almost twice the average salary for teachers with more than 20
years experience ($47,765). And Alpert, like most coaches who serve
as athletic directors or coordinators, does not teach classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in other states, athletics isn't that important,'' said
Ron Caloss, who resigned as H-E-B superintendent last year to go
into private business. ``In Texas, sports, especially football, is
very important. The community dictates that.''
</P>
<P>
   With a mandate to win and support in the form of booster clubs,
it can be difficult for school district administrators to say no
when coaches say something, whether it be facilities, equipment or
additional personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the teachers come to you and say they need five more
kindergarten teachers, for example, that's a different situation,''
Caloss said. ``Kindergarten students don't have a booster club.
Coaches have a built-in group of supporters behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of their power, coaches can often dictate everything
from the assistants and sub-varsity coaches who surround them to
the funding of their program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I gave the superintendent a list of things I
needed to be successful,'' Duncanville's Alpert said. ``We had no
weights at the junior high, for instance. Now we have them. If we
need it, we get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpert not only gets what he needs, he gets who he wants. Like
many high school coaches, he has complete control over personnel in
his feeder program, from seventh grade up through junior varsity.
As the Duncanville school system's athletic director, he also has
the power to hire and fire coaches.
</P>
<P>
   He fired girls basketball coach Margaret Thomas this spring
after two playoff seasons, touching off complaints from some
Duncanville teachers. Alpert acknowledged that firing Thomas
created fear among other coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them were concerned,'' Alpert said, ``but after I
talked to them they were very supportive. If a coach doesn't do his
job, we'll get rid of him.''  &LR; subheds:POWER TO INFLUENCE
 &LR; body:Hughes, 71, has long claimed Fort Worth school administrators
would love to get rid of him but he was nevertheless able to get
his gym back by threatening to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert is a big asset to Fort Worth and to basketball,'' Fort
Worth school district athletic director Paul Galvan said. ``I'm
sure if he left under circumstances like that, there would be some
people in the community who would react. I don't know that they
would necessarily speak for the whole community, but I'm sure it
would be disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' commanding presence and no-nonsense style extends to his
players, who understand they are not to play another sport if they
want get playing time in basketball. Galvan said he has never heard
Hughes forbid his players from participating in anything else _
they just never do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He eats, sleeps and dreams basketball,'' Galvan said, ``and he
makes his kids feel the same way. He doesn't tell the kids they
can't play football. But he's so demanding that if you're going to
play for him, you have to eat, sleep and dream basketball, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The players do it because many of them grow up dreaming of
playing for Hughes _ and because they know not to cross him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have to adjust to me,'' Hughes said. ``A coach
once told me, `You don't know how intimidating you can be.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a coach doesn't have to be feared to be powerful.
Football coach Ronnie Gage is one of Lewisville's most popular
figures, known for gestures such as delivering a cake to the
volleyball team after it made the 1997 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be part of the team here,'' Gage explained, ``and
not the part that people are jealous of or afraid of. There's a lot
of give and take in this business, but if you do things the right
way, people are going to want to work with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gage is close to his players, as Ken Ozee is to his players.
Ozee, who resigned from his position at Sam Houston High last week,
is among the area's most respected football coaches, not because of
his won-loss record of 59-56-4 at Sam Houston, but because of his
record in helping his players get college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the coach is to help the kids past the adolescent
years,'' Ozee said.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime coach and current Arlington district athletic director
I.C. Little said, ``Coaches have always felt a responsibility to
help the kids. Now that there are more one-parent families than
ever, it increases that responsibility. Sometimes coaches become
almost like a father. They're everything in the world to that
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches like Ozee attempt to fill a parental role at times by
helping a player with everything from giving them a spare dollar to
supplying a couch to bunk on if needed, as well as making contacts
for scholarship aid.
</P>
<P>
   With so much power to influence young people, there is also the
danger that coaches misuse their influence. In attempting to teach
discipline and get results, a coach can tear down an athlete's
self-esteem as easily as build it up.
</P>
<P>
   What might seem like excessive discipline to some is simply
standard coaching procedure for others. Martin baseball coach Terry
King is admittedly old school, one who teaches discipline without
sugarcoating how a player performs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today always want positive reinforcement,'' King said,
``but you can learn from negative reinforcement. Kids grow up today
with everybody telling them how good they are. And when they mess
up, they're told it's not their fault, it's someone else's fault.
Kids need to be told when they screw up. We don't pamper them. Some
people can handle that, some people can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Far bigger concerns than style develop when coaches abuse a
community's trust.
</P>
<P>
   At Trinity, football coach Ed Hickman's alleged misdeeds,
ranging from multiple instances of sexual harrassment of female
coaches to rifling through the office of a fellow coach, resulted
in a negotiated settlement this year that cost the H-E-B school
district more than $100,000 and cost Hickman his job. In 1999,
Corpus Christi Carroll football assistant Jason Murphy pleaded
guilty to 28 counts of sexual assault of a 16-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   Such accusations would create outrage regardless of who was
involved, but when it's a coach a community can feel betrayed,
according to Euless mayor Mary Lib Saleh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any coach is looked up to by our children,'' said Saleh, who
would not comment on Hickman's case. ``As parents, we expect any
coach or teacher to have the good morals to help bring up our
children in the right way. What a disappointment it is when we find
out our children have spent so much time with someone who hasn't
lived up to that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more often, though, a community rallies around a coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Celina football coach G.A. Moore asked for help financing
and building an indoor practice facility, local businesses and fans
rushed to help with money, material and muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can get things done in this town that other people
couldn't,'' Celina assistant superintendent Don O'Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Celina Mayor Olen Long agreed, saying Moore, who has won six
state championships, is the most popular figure in town. And what
if he ran for mayor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd lose,'' Long said.

TEFLON, NOT SHINING ARMOR, SUITS KNIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there were any question that Bobby Knight hasn't changed one
iota, it was resolved last week by his appearance on ESPN with Roy
Firestone and Digger Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   Knight came across as just what he is: a cold, manipulative,
truth-bending dictator who will continue in the future to do the
same things he has done for the past 29 years at Indiana. Some
good, some bad.
</P>
<P>
   That's my opinion. But I don't know Knight personally. When Greg
Elkin, who knows him well, watched Knight's hourlong TV interview,
he saw something else entirely, proving that truth is often in the
eye of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   Elkin, the Mavericks' director of media relations, spent eight
years working closely with Knight in the sports information
director's office at Indiana. He knows the animal in question
better than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really bothers me is that people came out with
things that happened 10 and 12 years ago,'' Elkin said of the
Knight controversy. ``If these things were such traumatic
experiences for these people, why didn't they say something then?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Knight never threw a vase at Elkin, but Greg did have
dealings with the same athletic department secretary who had the
audacity to ask Knight ``What's it regarding?'' when the coach
phoned to speak to the athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Knight blew a fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, who has a reputation as a great interviewer, lost all
credibility when he admitted that he hadn't seen the videotape of
Knight choking former player Neil Reed. What, Firestone couldn't do
a little research before conducting such an important interview?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really interesting to me to see one group of
reporters say, `What great questions,' and another group say, `What
a joke,''' Elkin said of the ESPN interviews. ``I thought
\RKnight\S handled himself very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, my opinion's biased, but what other sports figure in
the country would ESPN have blown off their top-rated show to give
a complete hour to? That's the aura of Bobby Knight and underlines
what a compelling figure he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Compelling, yes. We can agree on that. But sympathetic? Not even
close. SCOOPED BY COWBOYS.COM There was a reason why the Cowboys'
PR department was scooped by the team's own Web site on the release
of Deion Sanders the other night _ publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' Web site _ dallascowboys.com _ posted the news that
Sanders had been released by the team just after midnight Thursday
night, about 11 hours before the PR department made it official
with the team's beat reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Why? In the hope that radio and TV stations and other news
outlets would make the announcement and credit the team's Web site
with the ``breaking'' news.
</P>
<P>
   Just another way to get 15 seconds of fame. THE DEION FILE Was
that wistfulness I heard in Deion's voice the other day when he
said the only baseball team he really wanted to play for was the
Rangers? Sounds like it broke his heart when the Rangers didn't try
to acquire him from the Reds, even after Rusty Greer and Gabe
Kapler were hurt. ...
</P>
<P>
   Why would Jerry Jones even consider bringing Sanders back under
a restructured deal? Because Deion is a sickness Jerry doesn't
really want to shake and, cutting to the chase, the Cowboys remain
very, very concerned about their cornerback situation, even after
drafting 42 of them in April. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has been working with New Orleans speed coach Tom Shaw
all right, but in Dallas, not the Big Easy. Since speed has never
been Deion's problem, it's obvious this is another way of trying to
convince potential bidders that he's serious about getting
physically ready for next season. TAX COLLECTOR One reason why the
Rangers don't like the current interleague setup is there are too
many trips to California. California has a state income tax and if
a visiting player or coach's own state doesn't have a reciprocal
state income tax, then he has to ante up a percentage for each day
worked there.
</P>
<P>
   California is not alone in hitting up visiting pro athletes.
There are city taxes to pay in Kansas City, Philadelphia, Detroit
and Cleveland and more state taxes in Missouri, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, New York, Illinois and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates said he had to file 13 forms on his
taxes last year just to cover them all.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, the Rangers will have to hire a traveling
CPA, just to keep up with the various tax laws. HURT FEELINGS If
Juan Gonzalez has one grievance with the Rangers it's that they
didn't try to sit down with him personally and get something done
long-term before trading him to Detroit in November.
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzalez had known he might be traded, he might have softened
his stance and been willing to sign for less than the Rangers
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never talked to me,'' Gonzalez said, remembering how Ivan
Rodriguez avoided being traded with a one-on-one with club
president Tom Schieffer.
</P>
<P>
   But general manager Doug Melvin says his hands were tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't call up a player and say, `I'm thinking about trading
you.' We had to get something done quickly,'' Melvin explains, ``or
we would have been in a situation where the agent says you better
not trade him because he's not going to sign with anybody
long-term, like Scott Boras did with Alex Rodriguez.'' GAMBLE ON
HISTORY This Cowboys' coaches junket to Las Vegas last week is a
return to the pre-Chan Gailey years. The tradition began when Jimmy
Johnson used to take his coaches down to the Bahamas to gamble and
frolic for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   It continued with occasional trips to Vegas with owner Jerry
Jones and coach Barry Switzer after Johnson left, but basically
came to a standstill when Gailey arrived with strong religious
convictions. TWO WEDDINGS AND... On the same weekend that Emmitt
Smith was married a few weeks ago, Cowboys coach Dave Campo
attended not one, but two weddings.
</P>
<P>
   First came Smith's, with many, many Cowboys players and coaches
in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when longtime locker-room attendant Al Walker was
married in south Dallas, Campo was one of just three Cowboys'
employees in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just as excited to go to Al's wedding,'' Campo says,
``as I was to Emmitt's.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's who Dave Campo is. GO EAST, YOUNG MAN Here's a vote
against the Players Association's plan for realignment. While it
would unite the Rangers and Astros in the same division, it leaves
the Rangers in the American League West. That won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has told the Rangers they will be able to finally
escape the West after all these years of bad travel and
late-starting games. It's a promise that needs to be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Rangers need a good rival like the Astros, but in a
newly revamped Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Either league will do just fine. \Ntagtop:Jim Reeves, (817)

 &HT;    Gore has stake in Russia's future
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is in Moscow this weekend for
what may be the last summit of his presidency with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first, with President Boris Yeltsin in 1993, produced
a bilateral commission that met twice a year to tackle everything
from nuclear disarmament to American investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The commission hasn't met since 1998, and its future under the
new regime in Russia is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   But the work of the commission remains important for another
reason. It is Vice President Al Gore's most visible foreign policy
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1998, Gore held 10 top-level meetings with Russian
officials, serving as Clinton's designee to the commission and the
point man at the White House on U.S.-Russian policy. The two- and
three-day marathons, held alternately in Russia and the United
States, produced some 200 cooperative agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used the commission to deepen his knowledge of Russia and
burnish his image as an experienced leader in foreign affairs,
credentials he now touts in his bid for the White House. But the
commission's record is mixed, according to experts in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   HITS AND MISSES
</P>
<P>
   The commission became an important tool for Defense Department
officials in the disarmament of Russia's nuclear arsenal under the
various arms reduction treaties, serving as a forum for the
American side to demand action on problems that lower levels of the
Russian bureaucracy weren't responding to.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also agreed to a plan to shutter three nuclear
reactors, and the United States has begun a program to purchase 500
megatons of weapons grade uranium that the Russians are converting
to low-grade fuel. One of the commission's least publicized but
perhaps most important accomplishments was the creation of two
institutes that have channeled Russia's leading weapons scientists
into private sector employment, much of it in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts also see the commission as a missed
opportunity. It produced few big breakthroughs and failed to
generate the kind of business investments that many in Russia
expected it would. Some agreements, such as Russian cooperation in
the international space station, proved hollow: The Russians are
two years late on a crew module for the station that was supposed
to have been launched next month.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that Gore's close relationship with Victor
Chernomyrdin, Russia's controversial former prime minister and
Russia's designee to the commission, also blinded him to mounting
evidence of Chernomyrdin's possible involvement in Russian
corruption and the country's sudden economic collapse in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long period of time, (Gore) was the administration's
point man on Russia policy,'' said Lee Hamilton, director of the
Woodrow Wilson International Center and a former Democratic
congressman from Indiana. ``He, I think, deserves some of the
credit for the achievements of the policy, but likewise deserves
some of the criticism for the failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Chernomyrdin held their first meeting in Moscow in
1993. At the time, U.S. officials were anxiously seeking a way to
rid nuclear weapons from the newly independent nation of Ukraine,
which held the world's third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot, Gore suggested that then-Defense Secretary William
Perry, who was on the trip, fly to Ukraine with Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott to negotiate with the Ukrainians. Chernomyrdin
volunteered to send his deputy foreign minister, and the team left
for Kiev in Perry's plane.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators stayed up late into the night with the
Ukrainians. The next month, the United States and Ukraine issued
the so-called trilateral agreement which de-nuclearized the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big deal,'' said Ashton Carter, a Harvard
University professor who was then an assistant secretary of defense
to Perry and the defense staffer assigned to the commission.
``Getting the Ukrainians to go along with us did not by any means
look like a sure thing, and Al Gore was very involved in that. That
was his baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also said the commission became extremely helpful to the
Defense Department in trying to implement the Nunn-Lugar Act, named
for former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn and Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.),
which has appropriated more than $1.2 billion toward dismantling
Russian nuclear stockpiles and ensuring the safety of nuclear
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important that we be able to bring to the very, very
top some of the problems that developed,'' Carter said. ``You could
always tell your Russian counterpart, listen, if we don't get off
the stick on this issue, we'll take it to Gore-Chernomyrdin.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter participated in eight of the commission's 10 summits. He
described Gore as businesslike and well-read on the nuances of
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extraordinarily well briefed and a devourer of
knowledge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL VULNERABILITY?
</P>
<P>
   In the meetings, Gore and Chernomyrdin would sit opposite from
one another and move through agenda items prepared in giant
briefing books. When the two couldn't agree, Carter said, they
would often disappear in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have private dinners and they were quite
productive,'' he said. ``The vice president would come back and
report that he had managed to get through to Chernomyrdin the
importance of an issue, or that somebody on the Russian side was
holding up progress. For us who were trying to make security
programs work, this was a terrific mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's close relationship with Chernomyrdin caused him to
turn a blind eye to reports of the former prime minister's
involvement in Russian corruption, critics say. Gore ignored a CIA
warning about Chernomyrdin, said Keith Bush, Russian and Eurasian
program director at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area where I think Gore is vulnerable,'' said Bush.
``The U.S. side didn't want to see the corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic collapse has also led to finger-pointing in
Russia over the commission's lack of effectiveness in promoting
U.S. investment in Russia. Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of the
Institute of USA and Canada at the Russian Academy of Sciences,
said economic issues took a back seat to disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that it was regarded more as a ritual thing
than . . . a good tool to advance the economic relations,'' said
Kremenyuk. ``Unfortunately, almost 10 years have been simply spent
or wasted without any growth in the economic relationship. The vice
president has simply either misunderstood the importance of this
job, or he simply did not manage it.''

 &HT;    Elliott wrecks No. 2 start
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ A blown right-front tire has blown Bill Elliott's
position on the front row for today's MBNA Platinum 400.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who was to start next to pole-sitter Rusty Wallace,
crashed during Saturday morning's Winston Cup practice session at
Dover Downs International Speedway. The extensive damage to the
rear of the No. 94 Ford caused the team to roll out its backup
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the switch of cars, Elliott will still be officially
credited with his second outside pole of the year. However, at the
completion of the three warmup laps before the start of today's
event, he will have to retreat to the back of the 43-car field.
It's NASCAR's rule whenever a team goes to a backup car after
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't worried,'' Elliott said. ``I just hate starting in the
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 94 crew put new tires on the Taurus before the early
practice. Elliott ran 65 laps, and then motored into the pits for a
quick check of all parts, including the tires. He returned to the
track for about 25 more laps before disaster struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming out of (the second turn) and I could feel (the
car) starting to shake,'' Elliott said. ``I thought I was going to
be OK, but the tire went going into three. I might have run over
something or whatever, but it's kind of an unfortunate thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second tough break in as many race weekends for
Elliott. At last Sunday's Coca-Cola 600, Elliott started at the No.
3 position but finished last after blowing an engine.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Elliott was not injured in Saturday's wreck, which
banged up his primary car. The crew quickly pulled out the backup
ride, nicknamed ``Awesome.'' It is the same car that debuted
earlier this year at Texas, where Elliott was caught up in a wreck
and landed on the top of Jeff Gordon's hood.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott had the chance to drive ``Awesome'' around the one-mile
oval before the early practice ended. He got more time in ``Happy
Hour'' practice after the Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good car,'' Elliott said. ``We ran it just as good as
we ran in practice earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mishap, Elliott did not seem to be very upset. He
and his team members managed to find positive things to say about
starting last today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think will affect us at all because it's a long
race,'' co-crew chief Kevin Cram said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastest cars always find their way to the front. And
you've got to have luck on your side like any other race. This
(mishap) just got us a little behind, but not a whole lot.''

CLINTON, PUTIN UNLIKELY TO REACH ARMS CONTROL DEAL AT MEETING  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY SCOTT CANON, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, Mo. _ To grasp how desperately Russia
wants to haggle for ever lower limits on nuclear weapons, it helps
to think of the B-2 stealth bomber.
</P>
<P>
   A single jet runs $2 billion a copy. The U.S. Air Force has 17
parked here with four more in the shop for upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of just three such bombers _ forget about spending
millions more to keep them flying _ would wipe out an entire year
of Russian defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the land-based missiles that anchor Russia's nuclear
capabilities are fast corroding in their silos, most of their
submarines are moored in port, and the country has commissioned but
one new heavy bomber in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that with its economy in ruin and largely
unable to crank up a rebuilt nuclear war machine, Russia wants a
treaty that significantly lowers each side's atomic warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past the U.S. and Soviet Union were talking as
equals,'' said Igor Khripunov, a former Soviet arms control
negotiator. ``Now it's like a heavyweight taking on a
lightweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet most analysts who study the complex, high-stakes world of
nuclear arms see little chance of President Clinton and new Russian
President Vladimir Putin crafting an arms control bargain when they
meet in Moscow today and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the post-Cold War world order, nuclear arms pacts pose
vexing problems that have grown only more knotty.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START II, was ratified
only months ago by the Russian Legislature and limits each side to
3,000 to 3,500 nuclear warheads. The last of the Minuteman II
missiles at Whiteman Air Force Base, near Knob Noster, were removed
by the end of 1995 as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Terms agreed to by Clinton and former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin in 1997 for the next phase, START III, would bring those
numbers down to 2,000 to 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Cost-conscious Russia has since said it wants to drop that to
1,500 warheads each. Further, the Russians suggest that if they do
not win that argument, they will be forced to keep some of their
multiple-warhead land-based missiles active _ a violation of START
II.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, meantime, has said that it cannot go below 2,000
warheads and still justify the expense of keeping its submarine-,
silo-, and bomber-launched nuclear weapon systems going.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Americans are at odds with themselves over a
missile defense. Clinton and likely Democratic presidential nominee
Al Gore have lined up tentatively behind a limited missile defense,
assuming it can be proved to work.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Texas governor headed toward the Republican
presidential nomination, has spoken of adopting a more robust
national defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Both approaches would mean a break from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty that bans deployment. And both alarm the Russians,
and others, because they would depart from an edgy balance that has
existed since almost the dawn of the atomic age _ the knowledge
that an attack by one country would leave both destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we would wind up with a shield and a sword,'' said Martin
Goldstein, a one-time foreign affairs specialist with the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency. ``They would end up with only a
sword.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some talk in arms control circles of a remote chance at
a bargain. Washington could agree to fewer nuclear warheads if the
Russians would permit an American missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon could be appeased with accounting tricks that cloak
the real numbers of warheads in the American arsenal. Under START
I, for instance, a bomber was counted as a single warhead even
though it carried more. Under START II, planes like the B-2 are
accurately counted for the 16 nuclear weapons they carry. A
revision to START III might go back to the old accounting system.
The Russians, eager to save money, could let their nuclear cache
shrink and still save face.
</P>
<P>
   For Putin, that sort of bargain would mean badly needed savings
on defense spending and send a message to the world that his regime
will be reasonable and Russia worthy of foreign investment. But it
could sour relations with his military, 85 percent of which voted
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young reformers in his government don't worry much about
ABM,'' said David Johnson, a senior analyst and publisher of a
newsletter on Russia for the Center for Defense Information. ``The
military would be much more upset.''
</P>
<P>
   And Putin already unsettled his generals by recently announcing
a bruising 25 percent cut in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might not be in any better position. His time in office
is now measured in mere months. The Republican majority in Congress
is not likely to go along. Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, said any such suggestion would arrive
at Capitol Hill ``dead on arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   Any prospect of a missile defense is not, however, just a
two-way deal with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have already made clear their worries about the
upper hand America could gain through a missile defense, and
experts say sharing the technology with their Russian neighbor only
figures to crank up anxiety in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the strategic response for a country like China would
be to work toward building so many intercontinental ballistic
missiles that it could overwhelm such a shield. That, in turn,
could scare India down the same path, which could tempt the
Pakistanis to pick up their pace in the arms race. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a deal were to be cut, it would have ramifications for the
global effort on nuclear arms control,'' said Todd Perry, a senior
analyst on arms control for the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller things are expected from the conference. The
presidents will probably sign an already drafted agreement on
improvements in early warning systems _ each country promising to
tell the other when it thinks a nuclear missile has been fired.
There is also a tentative deal on Americans helping Russians
dispose of weapons-grade plutonium, a measure designed to choke the
black market for nuclear bomb parts.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger picture, most arms control analysts agree, does
not offer much chance of a significant deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could create a political problem for Gore by making a
controversial pact in Moscow. Putin could undercut his tenuous
coalition in Russia by further angering the Russian military. The
easiest route for both men, said nuclear arms scholar Valerie
Hudson, is to do very little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's a lame duck, and Putin doesn't know that the
Americans would follow through on any deal made by Clinton,'' said
the Brigham Young University professor. ``Putin also has an
interest in looking tough.''

CUSTOMERS CAN EXPECT MUCH HIGHER HEATING BILLS NEXT WINTER

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Gasoline prices reached another record last
week, upsetting motorists once again.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly overlooked, however, was the soaring price of natural
gas, which could cause similar outcries when people see their
heating bills in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Most noticeably, unleaded gasoline jumped a dime last week, to
$1.59 a gallon at many area pumps. Prices for natural gas and
propane have also been on the rise, doubling from a year ago. And
if they stay up, the average household's heating bills could be
$200 to $300 higher in the course of a normal winter.
</P>
<P>
   The worst could still be avoided if prices dropped by the
heating season. Utilities and propane companies, however, have had
to start building up inventories for winter now with the
higher-priced fuel. Since higher gas costs are passed on to
customers without needing regulatory approval, utilities have begun
warning consumers to expect higher heating bills this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gas Service last week alerted regulators to its deepening
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to express Kansas Gas Service's concerns about
the very real possibility that natural gas prices this winter will
reach all-time highs,'' Eugene Dubay, the utility's president, said
to members of the Kansas Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are widespread. Paul Snider, a spokesman for
Missouri Gas Energy, called higher heating bills a sure bet. And
across the country there are worries that three years of relatively
mild gas prices have set up consumers for a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a scary winter,'' said Jack Zekoll, a
deputy director at the New York State Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on larger customers could be particularly chilling.
Bob Courtney, energy manager for the Olathe, Kan., School District,
said the district had budgeted about $380,000 for natural gas
during the next school year. Now those costs could reach $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even electric utilities could get dented, because they are using
increasing amounts of natural gas to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the spike in natural gas prices was unexpected.
Early this year wholesale gas could be had for $2.20 per thousand
cubic feet. Last week it was about $4.40 before settling down to
around $4.15 by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? Like gasoline, supplies for natural gas are
tighter than normal. That in turn has caused jitters in the futures
market, where contracts for future delivery are bought and sold,
and which reacts swiftly to any news, good or bad.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Costello, an economist for the federal Energy Information
Administration, said demand for natural gas had been higher than
expected in large part because of the amount of natural gas being
used by the electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for a hot summer have helped to drive natural gas
prices higher because of gas-generated electricity needed to power
air conditioners. And this all comes as gas utilities have to buy
gas to store for use in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Costello said that supplies were catching up to demand, but that
it could be too late for much relief this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the higher gas prices are already having some
effect. Snider said Missouri Gas Energy utility usually stockpiled
a third of the gas it needed for the winter and was now buying the
fuel _ and paying the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Johnson, a spokesman for Kansas Gas Service, said his
utility also was buying gas to put into storage. The utility is
asking regulators for some changes to pay for its ``hedging''
program, which provides some protection against price spikes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the hedging programs used by Missouri Gas Energy and
Kansas Gas Service will be in for a test this winter. A hedge
allows the utility to cap the cost of gas that is passed on to
customers. Last year the cap was just above $3 per thousand cubic
feet.
</P>
<P>
   With gas costs now above $4, any hedge would probably provide
protection only above $5 _ unless gas prices fall before the hedge
is purchased.
</P>
<P>
   So, the utilities and their customers could see higher prices
than they saw during the price spikes of the winter of 1996-1997,
which spurred regulators to approve the hedging programs.
</P>
<P>
   The propane industry, which primarily serves small towns and
rural areas, is also raising concerns.
</P>
<P>
   George Koloroutis, a vice president for Ferrell North America in
Houston, a subsidiary of FerrellGas in Liberty, said there was
still hope for some relief in time for the heating season. But
propane prices have now topped 58 cents a gallon; a year ago they
were about 26 cents. That sort of price in June is unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe propane prices will be higher this winter than
last,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Platte-Clay Electric Cooperative, which also sells propane, a
customer with an energy-efficient home uses about 800 gallons of
propane, while more inefficient dwellings can nearly double that
amount. That means even a 25 cent per gallon increase can amount to
hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have an impact on our customers,'' said Bill Estes,
the cooperative's manager of customer service.

HEALTH INSURERS FRUSTRATE DOCTORS, PATIENTS  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY PAUL WENSKE and JULIUS A. KARASH, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Terry and Lori Geise don't hide their
frustration with the nation's health-care insurance system.
</P>
<P>
   The Shawnee, Kan., couple's youngest son, Austin, was born two
years ago, and the anesthesiologist's bill was not paid by their
insurer until last fall. Other doctor bills more than a year old
still have not been paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I get a statement, I have to call the doctor to
verify the service, then call the insurer to see why the bill
wasn't paid,'' said Terry Geise. ``I really think the system is
designed to put more of the costs on the backs of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geises, who have three other sons, say they spend hours
translating medical statements and tracking claims. ``We don't have
time for this Mickey Mouse stuff. I'll bet many people don't even
question these bills. They just go ahead and pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers increasingly are voicing pent-up anger with an
unwieldy health insurance system that frustrates them with unpaid
bills, exasperating delays and liability for claims they do not
owe.
</P>
<P>
   Many are joining with doctors who accuse insurers of
deliberately delaying paying health claims so they can profit off
the interest on money withheld. Doctors say slow-paying insurers
are forcing them to take out loans to pay their own bills.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers deny they intentionally delay payments. They say most
delays are caused by medical providers filing incorrect or faulty
claims. They also point out that the complexities, in part, result
from providing the array of health-care choices consumers demand.
</P>
<P>
   Few experts, however, defend the nation's system of health
payments. Most agree the system is sluggish, clogged and
inconsistent. In 15 years health-care costs have nearly quadrupled.
And experts say added administrative expenses account for 30
percent of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may enjoy top-notch health care, but in terms of
processing its bills ``no country is as backward as the United
States,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University health
economist and former member of the Physician Payment Review
Commission, which advises Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers may be getting the worst of it. Patients tested
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ordeal of Kevin Carril.
</P>
<P>
   In July he went to Medical Plaza Consultants to have stitches
removed from a foot wound he suffered when he stepped on broken
glass. The bill came to $50. Carril paid a $12 co-pay, and Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City was billed for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Months went by, and the bill was not paid. In December, Blue
Cross asked him to indicate whether he had other coverage. He did
not. And the specified reply form was not in the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Medical Plaza billed him for $38. Kathy Vance, office
administrator for the Medical Plaza, said: ``In January, after
trying for five months to bill Blue Cross, we closed the bill, so
that it was no longer pending in our system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just nothing else we can do but pull the patient in at
that time and say, `Your insurer isn't paying.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials declined to be interviewed. Instead they
sent a release explaining conversion to a $35 million computer
system to speed the processing of claims.
</P>
<P>
   Carril said that in the third week of May, he called the insurer
and said he was going to tell The Kansas City Star about his
problem. On June 1, Carril received notice from Blue Cross the
claim was paid.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's office is often the consumer's introduction to the
health-care gantlet.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first place a glitch can happen. Wrong insurance
information can be typed into a computer. A patient may have
forgotten or lost his or her insurance card. A diagnosis code may
be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Coding errors are among the most common problems that hold up
claims, said Kathy Turnell, a medical-claims analyst for Concentra
Preferred Systems. For that reason medical groups now train
technicians to track insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning at Midwest Ear, Nose and Throat in Olathe,
Kan., Pam Miles was on hold for 12 minutes before reaching a claims
clerk at HealthNet. (HealthNet declined to be interviewed). But
that wasn't bad. She has been simmering on hold for as long as 40
minutes with some insurers.
</P>
<P>
   A big irritation is being told by the insurer the claim was not
received, said Debbie Winters, office billing supervisor for the
Olathe specialists. ``It's just the claim game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Walker, chief financial officer for St. Luke's-Shawnee
Mission Medical Group, said you cannot always blame the insurer. He
said that some practices lacked sophisticated systems and that
technicians needed to handle intricate claims.
</P>
<P>
   His 75-doctor practice bought a $175,000 software program to
analyze and edit claims. The claims are examined at a
clearninghouse before being zapped to insurers, including
HealthNet. Walker said the program had significantly reduced errors
and cut the time it took to hear back.
</P>
<P>
   Other providers, however, say that even when claims are sent
electronically, glitches happen and insurers say they did not get
them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one practice coded a patient's claim to show
treatment for a heart ailment. By the time it reached the insurer,
it showed the patient was treated for obesity. Since the patient
was not covered for obesity, the claim was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Gaughan, one of the physicians in the Olathe office,
said that it could take some insurers six months to a year to pay
claims and that other claims were reported lost.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Jantsch, a physician and past president of the
Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater Kansas City, said the
system suffered a lack of standardization.
</P>
<P>
   If doctors and insurance companies have trouble tracking claims,
consider how hard it is for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   After Kristin McDaniel's husband was diagnosed with cancer, she
began trying to keep track of the claims. But as the bills grew to
more than $150,000, she couldn't keep up. ``I became exasperated.''
Ultimately her bills were paid, but she said the process was
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to become an astute participant, as a consumer of
health goods,'' said Rob Mahoney, an employee benefit consultant
with Haake Benefits Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should at least make sure whether their health plan
doctors can bill them when the insurer will not pay. Most HMO plans
ban this kind of billing. Some other plans allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Who is responsible for those complexities is part of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 15 years of heightened managed health care, the
cost of health care has grown from around $350 billion to more than
$1.2 trillion. And as baby boomers age, the cost is going up.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt, the Princeton health economist, says that the health
insurance industry has never had an incentive to make coverage
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at a lot of them, they make more money on the
float,'' said Reinhardt, referring to the time from when the
insurer receives a claim to payment. During that time, he said, the
insurance company can invest the money.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry officials strongly rebut that allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't play the float,'' said Tom Bartlett, a vice
president at Concentra Preferred Systems, of Napier, Ill., which
resolves disputes between insurers and providers.
</P>
<P>
   He said most insurers made 3 percent to 5 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone complains about the system.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Holland, vice president of compensation and benefits at
Sprint Corp., said his company helped ensure swift payment of
claims by motivating insurers with whom it did business.
</P>
<P>
   If insurers pay on time or before, they are paid more money by
Sprint. If they lag, Sprint docks them money.

OWNERS VS. PLAYERS: RUINOUS RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Interleague play has run its course, creating
maybe a tenth of the excitement it did when it was introduced four
years ago. It was the brainstorm of short-sighted folks who fail to
understand good teams, not manufactured rivalries, sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're trying to figure out a way to manipulate it so fans
will again be interested. And next month the brainiacs who run
baseball will vote on realignment. Again, ticket sales and
generating revenue are the only reasons it's being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   But if the owners, the commissioner's office, the players
association, the agents and anyone else who thinks the game needs
changing to increase popularity really want to do something to help
the fans, maybe they should listen to the game's top attraction and
ticket seller.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year there's been quiet talk throughout the
industry of a work stoppage after the 2001 season. The
aforementioned parties should get in a room and hammer out an
agreement that will ensure there won't be a strike, or a lockout or
whatever other term they can use that translates into screwing over
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Because if baseball does stop, if the leather and ash are traded
in for arbitrators and bargaining positions, this generation could
get cheated of seeing the most coveted individual record chased.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Mark McGwire entered Saturday 212 homers shy of Hank
Aaron's record of 755. If his work stops after the 2001 season
because baseball becomes too greedy once again, he's vowed it won't
continue whenever, if ever, the sides agree on a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a lockout or strike after next year, you won't see
me in uniform as a player ever again,'' McGwire said. ``I don't
care what they try to do. I will walk away. I don't care to go
through that again. What we did to the game in 1994 was absolutely
horrendous. To do that to the game again, I would be embarrassed. I
would think the other players think that way. I hope the owners
think the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   By past experience, it's debatable if there's much thinking
going on by anyone regarding this issue.
</P>
<P>
   You remember 1994?
</P>
<P>
   The small-market Expos, with current Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone the GM in Montreal, on their way to a possible
showdown with the Yankees in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   They played games one day as summer was running late, then
didn't play again until spring. They canceled the World Series.
That's like canceling Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball has come back nicely. Cities, for the most part,
are building new ballparks. And cities like Cleveland are being
rejuvenated by incorporating baseball into revitalization projects.
</P>
<P>
   Players are fairly paid, most would surmise. Owners are making
money, unless they let emotion rule over business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it,'' McGwire said. ``There is nothing going wrong with
the game of baseball. The owners are making money. The players are
making money. Listen, this is the greatest game of all time. Look
at the new stadiums. Look at the attendance. The bottom line is,
it's common sense. Life is common sense. But do a lot of people use
common sense? No. That's where the game has been embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is too good for two parties to ruin it.''
</P>
<P>
   Time has proven that. Any other enterprise that treats its
customers the way baseball has for the past two decades would have
been out of business for at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   However, baseball continues strongly because fans spent a
childhood playing it, and the rest of their life wishing they were
a hint better at it so they could play it more. And that has
nothing to do with money.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be a breaking point. Fans won't stop coming all
together, but they'll scale back. When Toronto was winning
championships in the early '90s, it was selling out SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Those who played in Toronto after the 1994 ``work stoppage''
said the fans haven't recovered from it, and thus the Blue Jays
draw dismally. Another work stoppage would be brutal for everyone,
especially the fans.
</P>
<P>
   So baseball should do the right thing. Worry about interleague
and realignment later. Get any labor strife settled now before it
becomes an issue.

LOPES HOPES BREWERS CAN FIX ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took former Los Angeles Dodger Davey Lopes a
while to land a big-league managing job, and would still argue
whether he's done so. One thing he's finding out is just how
difficult it is managing a mediocre, also-ran like the Milwaukee
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee is 22-32, has the fourth-worst winning percentage
(.407) in the National League, and the only thing keeping the
Brewers out of last place in the Central Division is the Chicago
Cubs and Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change the mindset of the players and how they
approach the game,'' Lopes said. ``How they go about their
business, their expectations. You have to get them to take the
field every night expecting to win. It starts there. You have to
get them to believe in their talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep reiterating it, because there's been a losing
environment here for the last six or seven years. Not only just
here, but throughout the minor leagues, too. I kind of anticipated
what needed to be done, but you don't really see how engrossed you
need to be until you're in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to change the attitude, the Brewers have changed
personnel and, despite being a small-market team, have gobbled up
salary to get rid of players they don't feel will help.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the Brewers released pitcher Jamie Navarro, even
though they had to eat most of his $5-million salary this season.
Lopes also sent opening-day starter Steve Woodard to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lopes) has been great,'' Brewers outfielder Geoff Jenkins
said. ``He's been around the game forever. He knows the game, and
he treats us like professionals. It's been awesome having him.''
</P>
<P>
   Snake-bit Diamondbacks: Arizona survived the start of the season
with closer Matt Mantei and third baseman Matt Williams on the
disabled list. Now, the Diamondbacks will try to hold on to their
West Division lead with first baseman Erubiel Durazo and
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre had trouble with his right forearm, and Durazo has
torn cartilage in his right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago when I got an MRI, I came out with two tears in my
shoulder,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I went in thinking worst-case
scenario. So if going on the DL is ever good news, this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   The losses are huge, though. Stottlemyre was 8-3 with a 4.38
ERA. Durazo was hitting .287 with six homers and 24 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Helton: Is it too early to talk about hitting .400? Well,
maybe, but already opposing teams are showing extra caution
pitching to Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, a former University of Tennessee quarterback who is
hitting .420 with 17 homers and 54 RBI, will have his patience
tested because he might not see too many strikes. When Houston
faced the Rockies last week, Astros manager Larry Dierker gave
explicit instructions not to throw Helton a strike - even in the
eighth inning with the bases loaded in a tie game. It was his third
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mind walking him,'' Dierker said. ``I minded the
pitch he got (a double) on and the pitch he got the sacrifice fly
on. I'd rather have walked him all five times. I didn't want to
walk him with the bases loaded, but one run is less than we
would've done if we threw him one down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Randy Johnson had 10 strikeouts Wednesday,
putting him past Cy Young and into 14th place all-time with 2,824.
... The losing in Chicago continues, and the Cubs are trying
everything to put an end to it. With two roster moves in midweek,
the Cubs have used 39 players through 55 games. ... Mets lefty Mike
Hampton was 2-3 with a 6.99 ERA in April and was 4-0 with a 1.72
ERA in May.

SCIOSCIA: KEY GAMES IN DIVISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Interleague play is upon us again, and as
usual, many of the participants are whining about it. To them, it's
a nuisance, something they want to get over with so they can get on
with the season with games in their own league, in their own
division.
</P>
<P>
   However, as long as Bud Selig is commissioner, interleague games
are here to stay. The fans say so as well, as attendance is up
overall during interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia longs for the days when he played,
when a team played 18 games vs. its division foes, and 12 vs. the
teams in the other division in the same league. Expansion has
wreaked havoc on a symmetrical schedule, but it isn't all bad,
Scioscia says. In fact, he likes playing the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it, it makes sense when you have natural rivalries
based on geography,'' he said. ``It's something the fans can enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't like what I'm hearing about flip-flopping
divisions as far as who you play, like the AL West playing the NL
Central. That defeats the whole purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   What Scioscia would like to see is playing more games within the
division. The Angels will be making their second trip to Tampa Bay
and Baltimore in the next week, but they still haven't been to
Oakland or Texas in their own division. They won't play at Texas
until after the All-Star break, July 24-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``That for me is an absolute,'' Scioscia said of more
inter-division games. ``When I was playing, the entire final month
of the season was against your own division. If you went into
September six games out, you knew you still had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   You ain't seen nothing yet: In the span of two weeks, the
Indians put five pitchers on the disabled list - Charles Nagy,
Ricardo Rincon, Paul Shuey, Jaret Wright and Paul Rigdon. Earlier
in the season, Bartolo Colon made a trip to the DL.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley is one Indians pitcher who has been able to avoid
injury problems, but he is no stranger to such things, having spent
14 seasons with the Angels when he watched the team get destroyed
by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to think it was me,'' Finley joked. ``This is
like a baby ward compared to over there. We had guys having heart
transplants. Not only were guys out, they were out for four or five
months, with something broken or something that needed to be
reattached. It was happening every other week over there.''
</P>
<P>
   E-4: Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch can't seem to get
over his mental problem when it comes to making the easiest throw
in baseball - from the second-base position to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Knoblauch's throws have been incredibly bad, as he has
thrown the ball into the ground. Steve Sax had the same problem
years ago with the Dodgers and got over it. Knoblauch, though,
doesn't know whether he'll be able to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a breaking point,'' Knoblauch said, adding he is
``pretty close'' to his.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch declined to see a sports psychologist about the
problem last winter but said recently he'll try anything now.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have reportedly expressed interest in Twins second
baseman Todd Walker, who is playing in Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: New Angels shortstop Kevin Stocker didn't make a
good impression in his Angels debut. In the first inning of
Stocker's first game, the first batter of the game - Dodgers
leadoff hitter Todd Hollandsworth - hit a pop fly to shallow left
that Stocker dropped for an error. The reason the Angels signed
Stocker? Defense. ... Again, it's the media's fault. Even though
Orioles starter Mike Mussina has rebounded from a poor start, he
hasn't changed his personal policy of not speaking to reporters.
With Albert Belle also playing for the Orioles, it must be an
awfully quiet clubhouse. ... Speaking of the Orioles, they again
are the biggest disappointment in baseball when you factor payroll.
Their 2000 payroll is $83.1 million, third in baseball behind only
the Yankees ($92.9 million) and Dodgers ($90.7 million). Their
winning percentage (through Friday) ranked No. 24 of 30 teams. The
best team in baseball related to payroll is the White Sox. Their
2000 payroll of $31.1 million ranks No. 26, but their winning
percentage (through Friday) ranked No. 3.

BRAVES BEAT YANKEES, 11-7 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Maddux against Roger Clemens was supposed to be
landmark. It turned out to be landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens and Maddux couldn't get anybody out on Saturday, the
Yankees couldn't catch the ball, John Rocker couldn't throw
strikes, and after watching the Yankees blow three separate leads
and lose by 11-7, Manager Joe Torre couldn't take it any more,
blistering the shoddy performance in a team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Torre's hat was cocked to the side of his head,
his expression vacant. He had just watched 3 hours 57 minutes of
atrocious baseball on a hot and muggy afternoon. He was tired and
angry.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked Torre if he thought Shane Spencer's long fly ball
with two outs in the ninth was going to carry over the wall for a
game-tying grand slam. ``I don't know,'' Torre said. ``I saw so
much today, I don't know what I was looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre's postgame tirades are rare, and he was not specifically
upset with the fact that the Yankees made four errors _ ``They're
part of the game,'' he said _ or that Bernie Williams failed to
catch a fly ball, or that the Yankees failed to score more runs and
bury Maddux when they had the chance. Torre was mad because the
Yankees had lost a game they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly,'' he said. ``I don't know any other way to
describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had a small sense of relief because injuries that
forced two important players out of the game did not appear to be
serious. Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, sustained a bruised
right knee after Maddux fouled a ball off the joint in the second
inning; Posada's knee guard was split in two, and he could not
immediately put any weight on his right leg. But X-rays indicated
Posada had no fractures, and he may be able to play within the next
couple of days, Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill strained the right side of his right calf running
the bases in the first inning, but did not expect to miss much
time.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player will be in the lineup Sunday against the Braves
left-hander Terry Mulholland, when the Yankees (29-22) play the
final game of their three-game series against Atlanta (36-18).
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill singled in the first inning against Maddux, the third of
four consecutive hits _ the first time in Maddux's career that he
allowed four hits to begin a game. The Yankees had two runs in,
runners at second and third and nobody out against Maddux. Clemens
was coming off his 13-strikeout outing against Pedro Martinez. It
looked as if the Yankees might have a chance to sweep the team with
the best record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees failed to add to their lead in that inning,
Clemens allowed a single to the first batter he faced and the whole
thing turned into a mess. Clemens again had great speed, throwing
97 miles an hour, but ineffectively; he allowed six hits, four
walks, six runs _ four earned _ in five innings and remains a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't very good,'' Torre said. ``I don't know the reason
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens and Maddux have 479 victories and nine Cy Young Awards
between them, but they labored to compile exactly one scoreless
half-inning each. The Yankees scored at least one run in their
first four innings, the Braves scored in each of the first three
innings, and the lead changed hands repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens retired the Braves in order in the fourth, he
raised his arms in mock jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Clemens, you look at Maddux, you think 2-1, 3-2,''
said Pat Corrales, the Braves coach who managed the team for the
day while Bobby Cox attended the high school graduation of his
youngest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter had 4 hits among the Yankees' 13 against Maddux, the
second most Maddux has allowed in his career. But the offense,
which ran aggressively to take advantage of Maddux's slow delivery,
couldn't keep up with the rate at which the Yankees' defense was
giving away runs. Clemens threw wildly toward first on a pick-off
attempt in the first inning, eventually costing himself a run.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch committed another anxiety
throwing error in the second, his ninth error of the season. Jeter
fumbled what should have been a double-play grounder in third, and
when Brian Jordan launched a three-run homer, Jeter flung a piece
of dirt disgustedly, feeling responsible for two of the runs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, the Yankees held a 6-5 lead in the bottom of
the fifth. With two outs and a runner at first, Javy Lopez drove a
ball to deep center, where Bernie Williams sprinted to reach the
ball _ and then missed it, pulling in his glove, perhaps wary of
running into the fence. ``I've got to catch that ball,'' he said
later.
</P>
<P>
   Doggedly, the Yankees regained a 7-6 advantage in the sixth,
Chris Turner slapping a run-scoring single against Maddux; Turner,
who had homered and walked earlier after replacing Posada, was the
last batter Maddux faced.
</P>
<P>
   But with two outs and no one on base in the bottom of the
seventh, Tino Martinez flubbed a throw to Jason Grimsley, allowing
Jordan to reach base. Grimsley (1-1) hit the next batter with a
pitch, and both runners scored when Lopez lined a double into the
gap in left-center field. Shoddy infield defense has plagued the
Yankees all year, with the shortstops committing 7 errors, the
second basemen making 11, the third basemen 13. The Yankees have
surrendered 30 unearned runs, only 7 fewer than they did during the
entire 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by four runs in the ninth, the Yankees had one last
chance when Rocker sprinted out of the bullpen to pitch the final
inning. With the Turner Field fans roaring, Rocker's on-field
control abandoned him, the way it abandoned Mark Wohlers two years
ago. Rocker walked Scott Brosius. He hit Jim Leyritz with the count
no balls and two strikes. He walked Jeter, loading the bases. He
fell behind Spencer. Leo Mazzone, the Atlanta pitching coach, threw
the bullpen phone in disgust. After almost four hours, the
situation was absurd. So was the game.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer swung at a high fastball, and the ball soared toward
left field, through a slight wind, to where Gerald Williams backed
against the fence, reached up and made the catch.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Braves' first home victory against the Yankees since
Game 2 of the 1958 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was at that game, a teenager rooting for his older brother
Frank, who was the first baseman for the Milwaukee Braves. But he
wasn't thinking about that as he trudged into the clubhouse
Saturday evening. He had some things to say. &QL;

A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until I figure out how to digitally morph a harmless photograph
into something capable of compromising the integrity of a new
employer, this will be my final NBA column.
</P>
<P>
   Save your wild applause until the finish.
</P>
<P>
   With only one big swing left to take at the David Stern Planet,
using it to knock the cover off of the league's little sins would
be too predictable. OK, we'll take a cut at one disturbing item:
Where did they find the stunt double who impersonated Shaq so
unconvincingly in Game 6?
</P>
<P>
   Now on to the maudlin stuff.
</P>
<P>
   (Those of you allergic to Memory Lane should choose to jump off
here.)
</P>
<P>
   At this time, the columnist would like to thank Elgin Baylor and
Jerry West for allowing pro hoops to flourish in Southern
California. The columnist also would like the reader to save any
Clipper-woe-related spit-takes for the reactionary stage of talk
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Without Baylor and West offering up the Lakers as America's Team
in the hearts and ears of most Americans who reside west of Boston,
Chick Hearn might have been forced to build his fortune on
``Bowling For Dollars.'' But the Lakers did have Baylor and West,
providing a stellar launch for the type of history that can propel
a franchise for a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, nobody chants ``Beat Port-land!''
</P>
<P>
   As a general manager, West has blended this archival success,
the largesse of a rather generous owner and his own knack for
shrewd observation into a personal genius predicament.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Lakers lose Game 7 today, Phil Jackson's ability to
slalom past public self-actualization will turn an angry mob's
attentions on the roster. And the no-power-forward blame will be
passed to West, whose boss while very accommodating is not the
luxury-tax-snubbing Paul Allen. Missing will be culpability for
Jackson, the first king of geometry to believe you can have a
triangle without points.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has suffered the dings and errors of uncanny misfortune
(an injury roll call for Derek Smith, Danny Manning, Norm Nixon,
Marques Johnson, Ron Harper and the knee-tummy tribulations of
Stanley Roberts), while weaving them into a history that's
hamstrung by the odious allowance limitations imposed by Donald T.
Sterling. He also has permitted his knowledge of the game to be
diluted by the personal whining of Clipper head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   West had an owner who paid to liberate Shaquille O'Neal from
central Florida, a bold move made possible by the preamble of
acquiring young Kobe Bryant. Baylor and the Clippers worked out
Bryant before the 1996 draft, adored him, but were employing a
coach Bill Fitch whose interest in winning a few games NOW left him
in furious opposition to drafting a high school guard with the
seventh overall pick. Because Fitch campaigned for the 1995
draft-night trade that brought center Brian Williams, Rodney Rogers
and Brent Barry for Antonio McDyess, a big forward with star
potential, he still required the services of a large player after
deciding his sensibilities could stomach no more than one season of
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch's man in the 1996 NBA Draft was the mighty Lorenzen
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers thanks to their history and willingness to spend also
had enough talent to absorb Bryant's early growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, West has made many great decisions while the Clippers were
inspiring bouts of head-scratching. But even West as he freely
admits - has had a few misses. For example, the 1998 draft yielded
three Lakers rookies Tyronn Lue (acquired from Denver in the Nick
Van Exel trade) at 23, Sam Jacobson at 26 and Ruben Patterson at
31.
</P>
<P>
   The 32nd pick was 6-foot-10 high school star Rashard Lewis, who
will become very wealthy if he chooses to leave Seattle this
summer. Lewis can't handle Rasheed Wallace down low, but would have
provided enough juice to help Shaq and Kobe put Portland away by
now.
</P>
<P>
   And with him, the Lakers' future would be ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   But without Baylor and West to help the NBA reach the days of
Abdul-Jabbar, the TV grip of Magic and Bird and global stranglehold
of Jordan, L.A. might have been forced to become a town that gave
track stars more love.
</P>
<P>
   I've freed my mind enough to like track, but still can't dig
it. &QL; 
Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing trade rumor involving Dikembe Mutombo has the
Hawks center going to Toronto for three clubhouse foes of Raptors
coach Butch Carter Doug Christie, Charles Oakley and Antonio Davis.
Their combined salaries will just about equal Mutombo's $14.2
million for next season, but a Hawks source says the team would
prefer clearing cap space for future free-agent raids. Christie's
current contract won't expire for four seasons; Davis is locked up
for three; Oakley is a two-year investment. ... Lakers pre-draft
workout dates have included high school guard DeShawn Stevenson
(Fresno) and junior college post man Ernest Brown (Indian Hills,
Iowa). Brown, at 6-foot-10, 230 pounds, has been defined by one
scout as the post-millennial edition of Houston Rocket Carlos
Rogers. Brown, like Stevenson, also worked out for the Clippers,
who were impressed with his potential, which is far from immediate.
Stevenson, based on testimonials from several personnel smarties,
will be drafted in the middle of round one, if not sooner. ...
</P>
<P>
   According to one former NBA star and longtime coach, Jason
Kapono (UCLA, Artesia High) would be a top five pick with two more
seasons of college ball behind him. But if the early buzz for the
good ol' year 2000 is to be believed, the expert young marksman
will be off the board for the Lakers at 29 and Clippers at 30. ...
The ``wow'' quotient is being floated by witnesses to the exploits
of combo guard Jamal Crawford, a 6-4 freshman from Michigan who
worked out for the Clippers three days ago. The easily mocked
Internet draft experts have excluded the Seattle product from their
first-round grids, but real NBA snoops believe the skinny Crawford
(he goes about 185) will be in the hunt for a lottery spot. One
scout likens the kid to Penny Hardaway; another dropped his name in
the same sentence with that of Eddie Jones. Disparate comparisons,
but possible evidence of Crawford's versatility. ... The agent for
21-year Iakovos Tsakalidis, the lottery suspect who has a long-term
contract with AEK Athens in the Greek League, refers to his client
as ``a freaking monster.'' Most monsters, even those at 7-2, 220,
figure to average more than nine points and seven assists in
Greece. But the shortage of card-carrying centers figures to make
the player formerly known as Tsakalov (in Soviet Georgia) a lottery
lock. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' traveling party for this week's Chicago pre-draft
camp is scheduled to include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who will become a
former assistant coach if and when that decision is made by the new
head coach. But the Clips will pay for Kareem's expenses while he
and every other coach with job questions ``networks'' in the Windy
City. Well, Kareem doesn't really network; he's more like
not-so-public access. ... Voting by writers and broadcasters has
placed Jason Kidd on the first team among NBA All-Stars, a list
that excludes Grant Hill, Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson. That's a
foolish result, but a great marketing opportunity for Nike, which
employs the white-capped Kidd: ``Just Do Or Dye It.'' ... Doc
Rivers and the Orlando Magic may not land San Antonio free-agent
prize Tim Duncan, but they have hired Spurs assistant coach Paul
Pressey. According to a league source, Orlando's shopping list also
may include (sit down for this one) Spurs video coordinator Joe
Prunty. Magic execs must be hoping Prunty can rewind that 1999
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the Clips: Draft Stromile Swift, hypnotize Sterling,
borrow his checkbook, make an offer Rashard Lewis can't refuse,
point Lamar Odom in the direction of the weight room and then make
other teams worry about matching up with all of them (except
Sterling). Two more things: Sign Jacque Vaughn (another team can't
rip out your hearts until you have at least one) and hire Dennis
Johnson because he's seen defense in person and really wants the
job.

FRANCO: METS' MAN IN A PINCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Matt Franco walked into the clubhouse, a
teammate shouted across the room, asking if Franco wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Playing time is something Franco constantly seeks as a reserve
with the New York Mets and he does almost anything to get it. He
has a work ethic that makes him one of the first out to the field
and he can start at almost any position - he even pitched twice
last year - but his ability as a pinch hitter is what gets the
Westlake High graduate into most games.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as one of the game's most effective pinch hitters
keeps the Mets going to him even though he was batting just .182
entering this weekend's series against Tampa Bay. His five career
pinch-hit home runs rank fourth on the club all-time list. He is in
the top three in Mets career pinch hits and he drew a
major-league-record 20 walks as a pinch hitter in 1999. He tied for
fourth in the majors last year with 14 pinch hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of huge hits in the past off the best
pitchers,'' Mets hitting coach Tom Robson said. ``He's done it
before. You throw someone out there that's never done it before,
it's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him. He's the one that comes up late in the game. He
always has to face the closer or the setup guy and he has to do
something when he comes up. It's definitely not an easy job.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow start doesn't worry Franco, who said he traditionally
does better after the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started off slow every year pinch hitting,'' he said.
``I'm not really sure why. It's a long year, we'll see where I am
at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Low batting averages can be deceptive and not indicative of a
pinch hitter's value. They are not unusual, according to Robson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start off slow, you usually start pressing more,''
Robson said. ``You go through the whole cycle. It comes back to `I
don't don't care anymore' and then it starts coming together. Guys
that are in the lineup every day can get out of that sooner; guys
like Matt, they might have to wait a week for their next at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately he's been better. He's getting more hits and he sees
the ball better now, but he's had some bad luck. He's hit the ball
hard but right at 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, 30, played in a career-high 112 games in 1997 but has
never had more than 163 at-bats in a season.
</P>
<P>
   First and third base are Franco's primary positions, but this
year alone he has played three infield positions and in the
outfield. If he's not already in the game, Franco begins to stir
late in the game as he senses an opportunity, coaches said. By the
ninth inning of close games, getting him to sit still on the bench
can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Franco said. ``Obviously I wish I could play
more. I'm sure every bench player would say the same thing, but
that's what I get paid to do. It's my job and I've just gotta make
the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always envisioned being an everyday player, but I'm sure
there's a lot of guys who wouldn't mind being a bench player in the
major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   His upbeat but determined attitude are as encouraging to
Franco's coaches as the left-handed hitter's ability to hit to all
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player, especially him, wants to play every day,''
Robson said. ``That's where the money is and that's where you get
your timing better. He does it once every three days and has to be
ready. He doesn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want that job. You're usually the goat. If you get
three or four hits out of 10 - which is really good - you still
fail seven times. ... It's not an easy job.''

IRVIN GETS A BROTHERLY SUGGESTION: WALK AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Irvin, whose retirement after a dozen seasons with the
Cowboys looms more and more apparent each day, should count his
blessings and walk away from the game while he still can.
</P>
<P>
   That's the advice of his older brother, Willie ``Buck'' Dudley,
a 50-year-old high school principal in Irvin's hometown of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see Michael consider his health first, and I
believe Michael will do that,'' said Dudley, a second-year
principal at Boyd Anderson High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to speak for Michael,'' Dudley emphasized. ``I'm
his older brother, but I'm certainly not speaking for him. But if
Michael can't go out there and be Michael, I don't think he will go
out there again. There's too much pride inside of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always an unpredictability about Michael. But from
what I know, and he was here just last week, I think he's leaning
toward giving it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin returned to Fort Lauderdale purely as a favor to Dudley,
who asked the Cowboys' all-time leading receiver to be the keynote
speaker at the school's May 24 all-sports awards banquet, held at a
hotel and attended by about 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving a small, glass plaque _ a token of the students'
appreciation _ Irvin seemed to cherish the gift as he left the
hotel that night, Dudley noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do feel that Michael knows he can walk away from the
game with his head held sky-high,'' Dudley said. ``He can look back
and reflect on all that he has accomplished, especially coming from
where he came. We grew up on 27th Avenue \Rin Fort Lauderdale\S. We
didn't have much. He truly has been blessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I say he should be able to say `thank you' to the
Good Lord and be happy with that, then go on to the next chapter in
his life. That would be the advice I'd give him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley and Irvin, especially close despite their 16-year
difference in age, didn't have this conversation when they were
together recently because Dudley knows this is Irvin's decision,
even to the point of ``when'' it will be made. The Cowboys have
moved ahead as if Irvin will retire.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old receiver last played on Oct. 10, when he
suffered a spinal contusion and more than 30 minutes of paralysis
after making a routine catch at Philadelphia. The injury occurred
when Irvin landed head-first on the artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching it on TV,'' Dudley recalled. ``Football is
immaterial and highly irrelevant at that point. I felt so helpless.
I thought Michael was paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley began noticing a change in his younger brother in March
when Irvin came to South Florida for his induction into the
University of Miami Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed Michael talking about family more than I ever heard
him before,'' said Dudley, referring to Irvin's wife, Sandi, and
their four children. ``I think Michael can make the transition
because he sees himself as a father now. I see a certain level of
maturity with him that wasn't always there before.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, whose work ethic as a player was legendary, hasn't been
working out, although Dudley described him as ``looking very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley cautioned that Irvin's transition from football won't be
easy, especially when the training camp opens next month and he
won't be in a Cowboys uniform for the first time in 13 summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave the camaraderie of the guys and the limelight
and all that ..,'' Dudley said, stopping himself. ``Michael loved
playing the game. He was a throwback. A lot of people don't
understand that. Michael would've played the game for a nickel. He
loved it that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's father, Walter, has been deceased since Michael's senior
year in high school. But the 69-year-old mother of both men, Pearl,
is still the matriarch of a strong family unit that includes 17
children and nearly 50 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very supportive of Michael,'' Dudley said. ``But I think
Michael will be fine, I really do. He's thrilled to have his health
after all he's been through, and he wants to raise those children
and be a father for those two boys \Rboth under 3 years old\S.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley said he is aware that ESPN has expressed an interest in
bringing Irvin aboard as a studio analyst for NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's something that would make Mike happy,'' Dudley
said. ``As everyone knows, he has a gift for gab.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin overcame controversy and scandal during his Cowboys
career, including serving a five-game suspension for violation of
the NFL's substance-abuse policy in 1996. He also helped win three
Super Bowls. He has had a potential Hall of Fame career with a
franchise-record 750 catches for 11,904 yards, ranking him 10th and
ninth in NFL history, respectively], among NFL receivers of
all-time].
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has learned a lot from his problems and has picked
himself up each time,'' Dudley said. ``Even now, he can walk away
from the game with all his faculties. When you think about it,
there's no reason to be unhappy.''

NYYC ENLISTS CONNER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's Cup fans doubtless would agree that the best story
line of any of the last 30 Cups, sailed over 149 years, came in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   That's the year Dennis Conner, the first sailor in history to
lose the Cup for the New York Yacht Club, charged down to
Fremantle, Australia, to win it back.
</P>
<P>
   And win it he did, in the huge style that had come to mark the
Conner circus. Lose it big. Win it back bigger. However, he did not
win it for New York but for San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   So what would be more fitting than Conner, on the 20th
anniversary (sort of) of losing the Cup in that excruciating
light-air Race 7 against Australia II in 1983, winning the
America's Cup back for the New York Yacht Club and sending us all
back to Newport?
</P>
<P>
   A deal agreed to Thursday night in New York could bring that
scenario to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Team Dennis Conner, which left Auckland in February, spinnaker
billowing with credibility after a terrific one-boat challenge
against the big-money boys, is finally back in the NYYC house.
</P>
<P>
   A deal that was talked about in 1985, and again before the last
Cup, has finally come to pass. According to NYYC officials, Conner
will head its syndicate and bring with him much of the sailing team
that came in third among 11 challengers who began racing last
October for the most recent Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important member is Tom Whidden, president of
North Sails, who has been with Conner from the start and uses his
vast experience to be a player/coach on the water. Though he
started late with Stars &AMP; Stripes in the last campaign, Whidden was
largely credited with the tremendous surge that put the boat in the
quarterfinal round and made it a real threat in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   The other high-profile member is Ken Read, Conner's talented
helmsman who did much of the bush-beating in the last few weeks
trying to promote the deal with New York.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to a vote of the NYYC Board of Trustees, the
betting was all over the place. One club member assured me last
weekend, ``There's no way New York is going to get into it again.
They got too badly burned.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate hashed over all the negatives: the huge money,
effort, hassle, exposure, and risk required to put on a Cup
campaign, especially among the lineup of international billionaires
these days. Another consideration was that a Cup campaign may draw
resources away from other waterfront activities.
</P>
<P>
   But one speaker apparently touched a vein of sentiment when she
argued that the America's Cup was the pinnacle of a sport in which
the continuum begins with kids' dinghy programs. ``I think we ought
to go sailing,'' she told the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just delighted with the direction we have taken,'' said
trustee Charles Dana. ``It is a courageous position for each
member, and the decision was nearly unanimous.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many questions at this point. Though the two boats of
Young America _ considered by many the fastest challenger boats
developed for the 2000 race _ were bought by Prada's Patrizio
Bertelli, the intellectual property is still owned by Young
America.
</P>
<P>
   The name of Young America CEO John Marshall has not been floated
by New York, but no possibility is off the table, according to
Dana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we still have a lot of questions in front of us,'' he
said. ``We certainly don't go into this with all the answers. The
only thing that was clear to all of us to a member is that time is
of the essence. We either had to sit it out or we had to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always a lot of reasons not to get in, but we knew
if we were going to get into it, another four weeks would be too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the last two weeks, New Zealand has been making
itself an ever-more attractive target for challengers. The
juggernaut that looked invincible for at least another couple of
Cups began to unravel when big money came a-knocking in Auckland
and proved that even the pristine Kiwis are human.
</P>
<P>
   Skipper Russell Coutts, who vowed that money would never break
up Team New Zealand, was one of the first to fall. A reported $4
million-$5 million offer by a Swiss pharmaceutical company cleared
out Coutts and veteran tactician Brad Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
   Then chief designer Laurie Davidson bolted for the North
American syndicate taking shape in Seattle, headed by Craig McCaw.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, who headed the design team that produced the last two
America's Cup winners, apparently was miffed at receiving equal
billing as ``principal designer'' with Clay Oliver, an American
from Annapolis, Md., who worked on the design team.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson was never quite assuaged after the 1995 New Zealand
victory when American designer Doug Peterson got equal billing and
seemingly more publicity than Davidson, who is in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   So between discord in camp and billionaire dollars stalking the
world's sailing markets looking for talent, it's a fair guess that
Team New Zealand will have lost a bit of its air of invincibility
heading into the fall of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very fluid time for everyone,'' said another New
Zealand player. ``Right now the deals are being made. There's going
to be a lot more of this going on before another month goes past.''

SADLY, THERE'S NO QUIT IN CHAVEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They never know when to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Never.
</P>
<P>
   If the rumors are true, not even Rocky Marciano really knew when
to quit, because some will tell you he was planning a comeback
after retiring at 49-0 but died in a plane crash before he could
get back into the ring and embarrass himself the way his idol, Joe
Louis, had against him not so many years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That being the nature of boxing, it came as no surprise last
week that perhaps Mexico's greatest champion was all but on his
knees begging for the opportunity to get a beating one last time.
</P>
<P>
   That is the state Julio Cesar Chavez found himself in Thursday
in Phoenix as he pleaded with members of the Arizona Boxing
Commission to OK a July 29 ritual assassination by World Boxing
Council junior welterweight champion Kostya Tszyu.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez will turn 38 the night of that fight, and a beating is
not normally what you'd be looking for on such a day, but Chavez
needs the money despite having made millions in his career. So he's
ready to accept what he has to know is coming from the division's
hardest puncher, in exchange for $1.2 million. Gross, by the way,
not net.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Chavez took a beating at the hands of Willy Wise,
a journeyman who would have had a hard day's work as Chavez's
sparring partner _ let alone his opponent _ when Chavez was Chavez.
But Chavez is a shadow of that fighter, one who went before
commission members in Arizona after hearing the Nevada State
Athletic Commission rule him unfit to be competitive against Tszyu.
For a man who fought so many big fights in Las Vegas, that had to
be a terrible indignity, but a time comes in the life of too many
fighters that allows them to accept anything just to battle on for
one more paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Cesar Chavez is now in just such a dangerous place.
</P>
<P>
   The Chavez-Tszyu fight originally was scheduled for July 15 at
the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, but everyone involved understood Chavez
would not be having ``a Grand day'' there. So the fight's promoter,
Don Majeski, bowed to the Nevada Commission's refusal and the MGM
Grand's desire to make the whole thing go away, and he shifted the
mismatch to Phoenix, where Chavez went and embarrassed himself last
week by asking the commissioners, ``Let me go out with dignity and
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chavez's definition of that is going out on his shield, he
could have quit after Oscar De La Hoya gave him two harsh beatings.
But Chavez continued on because he needed the adrenaline rush of a
big fight as much as he needed the money. Or nearly as much. So he
fought on, although not well or often.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a record of 103-4-2, he wants to face the killer
puncher of the 140-pound division, and the WBC made it possible by
awarding him one of the phoniest No. 1 rankings ever. The WBC
officials didn't even try to justify it based on Chavez's recent
performances. They just sort of called it a lifetime achievement
award.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain is a friend of the sport and he opposed
the fight coming to Arizona and told the governor so, but in the
end no one listened. McCain created and then pushed through
Congress the Muhammad Ali Reform Act because he hated to see what
was happening to fighters all too often. How much his bill actually
will do to reform boxing is subject to debate, but if he had done
no more than stop this debacle in the desert, he would have done
more for the sport's image (and Chavez's bridgework) than is done
by most people who spend a lot more of their lives around boxing.
</P>
<P>
   But not even McCain could stop the inevitable. The fight was
approved Friday by the commissioners because Arizona doesn't have
many big fights and they mistakenly believe that this is one
because a name like Chavez is part of it. Problem is, that's all
he's got left now. His name.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't really matter what they did in Arizona, because
Chavez was hell-bent on fighting and eventually he would have found
some place to make his final stand. Officials in some other state
would have approved the fight because they, too, wouldn't know any
better or they would have a memory of a different Chavez or they
simply would be willing to ignore the fact that he weighed 166
pounds a month and a half before he's supposed to fight at 140.
</P>
<P>
   They would have ignored what Nevada could not: The simple fact
that this guy may still be called Julio Cesar Chavez but he's
somebody else now. He's a guy who's going to get a beating on his
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   All that will prove is that Sonny Liston was right when he once
described how it ends for a fighter. It ends with a blues song,
Sonny said, not the national anthem.
</P>
<P>

   Evander Holyfield, whose fight with John Ruiz was postponed
until late August or September because of a rib injury, is another
aging champion probably headed for a bad night before it's over. A
week ago, Holyfield claimed that if he'd beaten Lennox Lewis and
become unified champion, he would have retired; but here he is, so
what does that tell you? ``It has eluded me every time I have come
close to it,'' Holyfield said of being unified champion. ``As long
as that's my goal, there's no reason for me to quit. I am not
quitting until I obtain that goal.'' But few who know him believe
that Holyfield would just walk away after accomplishing that.
Holyfield, like Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns, Ray Robinson, Louis,
and nearly all the great fighters before them, has the delusion and
he has it bad. He has the delusion that winning championships now
is about destiny, not youth and skill and bravery. He still has the
bravery and enough of the skill to beat most heavyweights and go
the distance twice with Lewis, who truly is the undisputed champion
whether he controls the World Boxing Association belt or not. What
he lacks is the youth and the perspective to see that everyone's
time comes and then it goes. In boxing, either you go with it or
you go out trying. Sadly, it sounds as though Holyfield is making
that bargain with the devil of destruction who rules the boxing
ring. ``If I become undisputed heavyweight champion of the world,
then it would be time to retire,'' he said. ``If the decision would
have gone my way in the second Lewis fight, that would have been it
because I would have obtained my goal. I would have written to the
boxing federations to see if they would have allowed me to travel
around the world as the undisputed heavyweight champion of the
world and put on exhibitions. Having boxed for 30 years, I know if
I'm not working hard enough and not willing to make the sacrifices.
I would know that before I get into the ring. It's not about the
payday. It's about the goals I have set. When you set goals,
everything comes together. I have a plan and I'm in charge of that
plan.'' Sure he is . . . Holyfield had this to say about
International Boxing Federation No. 1 contender David Tua, who is
stalking Lewis: ``Tua is a version of (Mike) Tyson. Tyson has very
quick hands for a big man. Tua also has quick hands but is not as
quick. Tua possesses the same impact and power as Tyson and goes to
the body a lot. Tua fights guys going backward better than I do.
Tua has the right style for me. I will fight anybody that will help
me to reach my goal. I always put myself in a neutral position. If
Tua wins the heavyweight belts, I would love to fight him. If he
doesn't win the belts, I would not like to see him.'' . . .
Holyfield also had an interesting perspective on his stablemate,
Michael Grant, who was destroyed in less than two rounds by Lewis
on April 29. ``I truly believe Michael Grant would beat all of the
young heavyweights,'' Holyfield said. ``It does not mean he's a
zero because he lost to Lewis. It just means he's not better than
the heavyweight champion of the world.'' . . . WBA bantamweight
champion Paulie Ayala was hoping to get a shot at a $600,000 payday
vs. World Boxing Organization featherweight champion Prince Naseem
Hamed, but Hamed's brothers, who manage and promote him, must have
seen Ayala fight. Now he's out, even though the deal was nearly
done and Ayala had agreed to all the terms. A new list of three
more likely victims for a summer fight on HBO has been formed, with
Angel Vasquez, who just fought on ESPN's ``Friday Night Fights,''
among the leading contenders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Maskaev (20-2) put himself back on the periphery of the
heavyweight picture when he coldcocked Derrick Jefferson (22-2),
while Hasim Rahman (33-2) kept his fading title hopes alive by
coming back from an early knockdown to stop World Boxing Union (who
cares?) champion Corrie Sanders with what witnesses describe as
nearly 40 unanswered punches. What was Rahman hitting Sanders with?
Pillows? Turned out Jefferson broke his ankle in his loss to
Maskaev. Give him an A for effort, but more and more it is evident
that Maskaev may be the best of the B division heavyweights . . .
Why do you think Andrew Golota fights Orlin Norris June 16 in Las
Vegas and Frans Botha gets another shot at the heavyweight title
vs. Lewis July 15 in London? Can you spell ``pigmentation''? . . .
As much as the world loves the heavyweights, junior middleweights,
and welterweights at the moment, boxing's most competitive division
could well be the junior lightweight (130-pound) class, with newly
crowned WBA champion Joel Casamayor, WBC champ Floyd Mayweather
Jr., and IBF titleholder Diego Corrales as well as former champion
Roberto Garcia and top challengers like Acelino Freitas and Jesus
Chavez. Casamayor is in line to make his first title defense
against Garcia for one reason: promoter America Presents has
contracts with both men. That means no arguing with anyone else and
a safe conclusion for the promoter no matter the outcome. Garcia's
only loss, by the way, came against Corrales.

BELICHICK SERIOUS ABOUT DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Football players are funny but they're not stupid. They get it,
as one old coach around here used to say, although they don't
always like it and often try to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells took the Patriots from the NFL's cellar to the
Super Bowl in four years but by the end of his reign he was being
called ``too critical,'' ``too tough to get along with,'' ``too
likely to treat grown men like little boys.'' At least that's what
the boys said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll took the Patriots from the Super Bowl to the toilet
bowl, out of the playoffs in three years despite coming into the
job with a reputation for being ``a players' coach,'' whatever that
is. By the end of his reign he was being called ``too soft,'' ``too
nice a guy,'' ``too likely to treat little boys like grown men.''
At least that's what the grown men said.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Bill Belichick, who has already fired one player for
acting like a jerk, cut some high-priced veterans who were past
their prime, and threatened a handful of others for not adhering to
his way of thinking. He is, frankly, more Parcells than Pete,
although perhaps a little more balanced than Parcells (with
emphasis on ``little'').
</P>
<P>
   Yet the same kind of Parcellsian outlook that the Patriots' boys
found so off-putting four years ago they now appear to welcome.
When it was announced that often-wayward defensive back J'Juan
Cherry had been fired after becoming involved in an incident at a
financial district bar _ allegedly throwing a nutty, as well as a
bottle _ not one of his teammates uttered a word of protest. When
Belichick threatened, in understated tones, veteran defensive
tackle Henry Thomas for not reporting for two days of ``voluntary''
workouts, only Thomas pointed out that he thought the word
voluntary meant to Belichick what it meant to Noah Webster, which
is ``done of one's own accord.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Thomas's teammates had further comment. Under Carroll,
they made more further comments than they made further progress
through the playoffs. Three years of not only having your backfield
in motion but also your whole team in reverse has a way of focusing
the mind, and so the hard ways of Bill II are not viewed as harsh
but merely firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have a serious outlook a whole lot earlier than we did
last year,'' said veteran special teams captain Larry Whigham.
``The message we're getting is it's his way or the highway. By this
time, if you're not doing it his way, you're on the plane leaving
for somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in and of itself, does not guarantee the Patriots any
victories, but it does guarantee their fans one thing _ maximum
focus on winning.
</P>
<P>
   Football can be a difficult and painful undertaking in the best
of circumstances. Often the pain that must be endured is mental,
not physical. It is the mental pain of staying home or staying late
at practice to watch tape of your opponents or to study your own
duties over and over again. It is the mental pain of denying
yourself nights on the town when you would be better served
studying what will be asked of you on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie McGinest stood up last year and blasted some of his
teammates for their apparent zealous search for every party in
town, he was right. The parties come after the victories, not
before them, if you want to party hearty. Or if you want to party
for long in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that a Parcells-coached team or a
Belichick-coached one should resemble a room full of monks. No one
in history went out more than Lawrence Taylor _ often to places
visited only by drug addicts or law enforcement officials _ but
Taylor was a special player, one blessed with skill and courage and
physical abilities that allowed him to abuse his body while also
abusing his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, there are very few players who could get away with
that. Most must work harder at what they do and take better care of
themselves to last for long. The same is true of talented teams,
which the Patriots have been for a while despite a record to the
contrary. The Patriots needed to work harder under Carroll but,
frankly, did not. They had no choice under Parcells because he
would make them miserable if they didn't. And so, in 1996, a team
not as talented as several of its peers but a bit luckier and a lot
more focused went to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With a more liberal approach to discipline and responsibility,
and a string of personnel errors after the departure of Parcells
and Charley Armey, the Patriots went home earlier and earlier each
year despite having arguably a better team in 1997 and one that was
playing against more watered-down competition by 1999. By the end
of last season, that left them with a lame duck head coach who
admitted he was happy just to win his final game so he didn't have
a losing season.
</P>
<P>
   Happy, in other words, to be 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick will not be happy to be 8-8. Nor will he be bending
over backward to understand the motivations and angst of his
players. He will treat them like men, as he did Cherry. Like real
men, meaning just what Whigham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm payin' the cost to be The Boss,'' has replaced ``Come
along and sing our song and join our family, M-I-C-K-E-Y-
M-O-U-S-E'' as the club's theme song.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new day dawning in Foxborough. Cherry found that out
too late. A few more fellows, like the portly Ed Ellis, may be on
the way to learning the same hard lesson.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually the grown men of the Patriots will understand
that Bill I was right most of the time, and Bill II will be, too.
Pro football is a hard-hearted game. It is not won very often by
boys wanting to be treated like men but rather by men willing to
pay the price for glory.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, that price can be high. At times it means a loss of
some dignity, enduring a personal slight for a larger purpose.
Sometimes it even means accepting that Noah Webster's dictionary
and Bill Belichick's don't always agree on the meaning of the word
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it means you are treated the way the game demands.
Pro football is a harsh game with a clear bottom line. Hence the
coaches who win invariably act that way.
</P>
<P>
   If you want understanding, go to a psychiatrist every week. If
you want to win in the NFL, go to work every day. It is clear
already that Belichick will not ask for that _ he will demand it.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets it, maybe this edition of the Patriots will get what
they've wanted all along. Maybe they'll win as often as they think
they should.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, it will be because they've become like a popular
singing group: Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slade to move forward
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see linebacker Chris Slade used far more often as a
pass rusher under Belichick's system than he was under Carroll's.
Belichick believes Slade's talents were misused by the previous
administration, which often had him dropping off into pass
coverages that were not his strong suit . . . Tampa Bay executive
Rich McKay was among the group of NFL coaches and front office
personnel that devised the new code of conduct banning certain
celebrations. One was the controversial throat-slashing gesture.
McKay found the most damning evidence of the influence of such acts
on young people on a presentation video that showed many of the
more outrageous celebrations by NFL players. ``We don't want to go
back to being the No Fun League, but at the end of the tape was a
high school tape in which we saw direct copies of our acts,'' McKay
said. ``It showed me that as a league we've got to be concerned
about these acts.'' Added Vikings coach Dennis Green, who also was
on the committee, ``What we don't like is any act demeaning an
opponent.'' . . . Although no substantive work has been done on
renegotiating the contract of Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe,
agent Leigh Steinberg said recently, ``It's a situation where we
feel Bob Kraft has always taken care of Drew Bledsoe since he's
been there, so we're not concerned about that. Drew wants to do
what's best for the team. He understands this is a team sport. The
whole thing is not in his hands. His cap number is so high, it
makes sense.'' With upcoming cap numbers of $8.6 million and $9.3
million, Steinberg is right and Kraft knows it. It is unclear when
the sides will do something about it, but judging by the uncertain
nature of the offensive line in front of Bledsoe, it might be wise
to do something before he gets whacked around a few more times. But
Steinberg insisted, ``Drew likes Boston, and the nature of his
personality is such that he wants to spend his whole career in New
England. No one has a more vested interest in having a better cast
around than Drew does.'' . . . Armey finally signed the five-year
contract he was long ago offered to become the Rams' general
manager. Armey will not be directly involved in working out salary
cap problems _ that will fall to club president Jay Zygmunt _ but
that's no problem, because, as Armey pointed out, ``We have a good
triangle with Jay, myself, and (coach) Mike (Martz). It's a good
working group. We try to make everything we do in personnel a
three-way deal.'' Armey remains a strong believer in the draft even
in this day of free agency because, as we will see in the next few
days, yesterday's free agency bargain is today's released failure.
``If you draft well, you close the free agency hole,'' Armey said.
``The only way you can shrink it is to draft well and with a plan
for your team.'' A case in point was the Rams' decision to let
offensive tackle Fred Miller sign a big contract with the Titans
rather than destroy their salary cap position. They believe young
Ryan Tucker can step in with no dropoff. So when Tucker signed an
offer sheet as a restricted free agent, the Rams matched it at far
less than it would have cost to retain Miller. ``Tucker and Miller
are so close to being the same player we felt with the salary cap
difference we had no decision to make,'' Armey said. ``The key with
the salary cap is not spending the money. Anybody can do that. It's
managing the money, and Jay does that very well.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Status quo in St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   Some may wonder why the Rams chose not to trade high-priced
quarterback Trent Green after the emergence of Kurt Warner last
season. With Warner leading the Rams to a Super Bowl victory, he is
in line for a huge raise despite being an exclusive-rights free
agent (meaning, in essence, that he's free to go nowhere but St.
Louis). Yet Armey and Zygmunt agreed that the Rams needed to keep
Green at least through the 2000 season. ``This is a horse we put a
lot of bets on,'' Armey said. ``If we jump the horse now, we
accelerate a lot of those bets. Our best avenue is to keep Trent in
place behind Kurt for now and deal with it next year when there's
less of a salary cap implication.'' . . . Pushing the free agency
period back from Feb. 15 to March 1 next year comes as welcome news
to most teams. Belichick said, ``It's always helpful to have the
most time possible before you have to make these kind of decisions.
This has become such a rushed situation. The season is barely over
and you're right into free agency and the (college scouting)
combine and then right into preparing for the draft. There really
isn't much time for reflection about your team.'' Tennessee general
manager Floyd Reese agreed. ``It's a little extra time to review
what you're going to do,'' Reese said. ``It will keep us from
having to make a decision in the middle of February that we might
regret later. Days are helpful at that time of year, let alone two
weeks. It was particularly difficult if you went deep into the
playoffs.'' . . . Remember this name: Quentin Spotwood. He is an
undrafted free agent who has become the talk of the Dolphins'
minicamps. That doesn't mean he'll do it when the hitting starts,
but so far head coach Dave Wannstedt has been impressed . . . Pity
poor Carolina quarterback Steve Beuerlein. The 35-year-old
Beuerlein had his first Pro Bowl season last year but has paid a
price for it. He has had five operations since January, including a
recent one for a torn abductor tendon. That's on top of hernia
surgery, two scopes (knee and ankle), and a shoulder operation to
shave a bone spur.

RICE STRICTLY A SIDE DISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was supposed to be the third component. The
Lakers had two-thirds of the millennium's new Big Three in
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. The sweet-shooting Glen Rice was
a natural for the other spot.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to the Lakers last season, it was considered a fait
accompli. Rice would be the ideal complement to O'Neal's inside
game and Bryant's slashing to the basket. There may be no better
spot-up shooter in the game.
</P>
<P>
   As Portland coach Mike Dunleavy noted, ``You have to admit that
every time Glen Rice is open, I don't care what he has shot or done
before, your heart goes to your throat. Or your stomach. Or
someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Or someplace.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 33, hasn't made many coaches swallow hard since arriving
here for the now-steep price of Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell. He
didn't find his niche in Kurt Rambis's system and he certainly
hasn't found it in Phil Jackson's triangle offense. In other words,
it hasn't quite worked out the way it was planned.
</P>
<P>
   Rice tends to get lost in the offense and ends up as Just
Another Player on the floor, along with Robert Horry and Rick Fox.
He had the worst scoring season since his rookie year, shot a
career-worst 43 percent from the field, and has had even lower
numbers in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the drama, he will be a free agent this summer. As
they say, timing is everything, and Rice's timing, on and off the
court, is way off. Where once his ubiquitous agent and henchman,
David Falk, was heralding Rice as an obvious ``maximum guy'' (read:
$14 million per year and up), it now looks more and more that Rice
won't get nearly that much and could even end up going elsewhere
for a more Jackson-friendly player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen has been used to playing basketball a certain way and at
a certain level for a number of years,'' Jackson said. ``It's an
old dog/new trick kind of thing. I've encouraged him to find a way
to play in our system.''
</P>
<P>
   That, perhaps, is the most bizarre part of this square peg/round
hole story. Who better than Rice for this system of constant motion
and open shooting? Who better to be Mr. Outside to Shaq's Mr.
Inside?
</P>
<P>
   Rice has kept his cool and his poise, whether it's after a
disappearing act (as in Game 5 of the Portland series) or after a
rare scoring outburst (Game 4).
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that I'm not really doing the type of things I'm
normally doing,'' he said, ``but at the same time, we're winning,
so that's an all-time high right now. But under the circumstances,
when you look at the makeup of this team, the role I have to play
is not to go out and score 30 or 40 points. I have to be there when
I'm needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he wonder why he doesn't get more touches?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a loaded question,'' he said. ``If I answer that, it
could get me in trouble. The thing I have to do is go out there and
be ready when the ball's kicked out. Whatever comes along down the
road, comes along. We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect of Jackson's triangle offense, the venerable Tex
Winter, sees it mainly as an inability of Rice to get to where he's
supposed to be. That comes, Winter says, from a career-long custom
of not moving the way the triangle wants you to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggle with this all the time as a coaching staff,''
Winter said. ``We feel we're doing things that should make him a
very effective basketball player. We just haven't gotten the
results. I think he knows where to go. Can he be a weapon? Good
Lord, yes. People know who he is. But it's his inability to play
without the basketball. He hasn't done a lot of that in his career.
Basically, he's a stand-alone, spot-up shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice once was also a stand-alone, spot-up, automatic 20-point
scorer. His career average is 20.2. He entered the season as the
third-most prolific 3-point scorer in NBA history, a one-time
All-NBA second-team selection, and the MVP of the 1997 All-Star
Game. Dunleavy was right about that Glen Rice: A coach swallowed
something when he spotted up on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Rice averaged only 15.9 points a game. He
attempted 404 fewer shots in just two fewer games than in his last
full season in Charlotte. He did score 20 or more points in more
than one-third of the Lakers' games, and LA was 24-4 in those
games.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 16 games of the playoffs, Rice is averaging
only 12.8 points and shooting 41.1 percent. He had one memorable
game, a 21-pointer in Game 4 of the Portland series. He followed
that up with a 1-for-8, 4-point submission in 33 lost minutes in
Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's future could well be tied to the Lakers' performance.
Would they be inclined to break up the team if it won an NBA title?
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable speculation that Los Angeles would embrace
a sign-and-trade deal that might bring them someone like Toni Kukoc
or Charles Oakley. That would entail giving Rice no more than a
modest 15 percent raise over his current $7 million contract. That
would be far less than what he might once have envisioned, but
still enough to keep his family (three children) with food on the
table and a roof over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought his market value had been irreparably
damaged, Rice shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about that,'' he insisted. ``People around the
league know what I can do, so I'm not worried about that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Good shooters tend to find good work in the NBA. It may be that
this is simply an uneven fit, or it may be a case of a player on
the downside of a once-prolific career.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a championship ring would go a long way toward
making up for the least productive season of Rice's 11-year career.
That should be plenty for most players. Only time will tell whether
it will be so for Rice.

SOX RUB SALT INTO VALENTIN'S WOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been here before. A top Red Sox player suffers a
devastating, season-ending injury, and is faced with surgery that
is likely to have a drastic impact on his future.
</P>
<P>
   As if that is not enough, he also is faced with censure from the
ball club, which is unhappy at the choices he made about his
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   On the day John Valentin had surgery to repair a ruptured tendon
in his left knee _ an injury that left the 33-year-old third
baseman wondering whether his career was over _ a team spokesman
said the club had not authorized him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, we were back to last summer and the ugliness that
surrounded Tom Gordon's case, when general manager Dan Duquette and
Gordon's agent battled over the pitcher's diagnosis and the choice
of doctor who would perform surgery on his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, according to club spokesman Kevin Shea, was not
willing to discuss Valentin's case. But apparently he was disturbed
at the sequence of events that led to Valentin's decision to have
Dr. David Altchek perform the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin rejected an offer from team medical director Arthur
Pappas to have the Sox staff perform the surgery. According to
Valentin's agent, Dick Moss, three surgeons were considered:
Altchek, the Mets' orthopedist who performed Valentin's earlier
knee surgery and also reconstructed Bret Saberhagen's shoulder;
James Andrews, the Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist who has operated
on dozens of high-profile athletes; and Richard Steadman, the US
Olympic ski doctor who performed Butch Henry's knee surgery and
also operated on Picabo Street.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin decided to have Altchek do the surgery. Moss said he
informed Pappas of the decision, and according to Moss, the doctors
had a conversation shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' position? It was not as combative as it was in Gordon's
case, when they rejected Andrews in a messy exchange in which
Duquette questioned Andrews's integrity by raising
conflict-of-interest issues (Andrews is Tampa Bay's medical
director) and the players' union and commissioner's office had to
be brought in to broker an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The team apparently had no objection to Altchek. But,
apparently, Duquette felt that Valentin and Moss should have sought
the club's permission before making their decision.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking baseball official said these disputes seem to
arise only with the Red Sox. Last year, to cite another example,
Brian Rose was not reimbursed when he went to see Andrews for a
second opinion on his troublesome elbow.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem a dangerous signal for the Sox to send out,
especially in such a highly charged setting, that players at their
most vulnerable must be wary of clashing with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're doing,'' said Moss, who had not
heard from Duquette or any other Sox official expressing any
concern about an unauthorized action.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette called Valentin on Friday, shortly after the player was
discharged from the New York hospital in which Altchek repaired the
tendon. Moss railed at the idea that the Sox could dictate who
would perform Valentin's procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to the patient, when the doctor is someone listed on
the second-opinion list,'' he said. ``What an outrageous
proposition to suggest otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gauging their position
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who have the 22d pick in Monday's draft of high
school and college players, would love to take Rocco Baldelli, the
outfielder from Bishop Hendricken in Warwick, R.I. But Baldelli,
who was the state's indoor sprint champion and a terrific
volleyball player good enough to be considered for the junior
national team, may not be around when it's the Sox' turn. There are
rumblings that Baldelli, ranked the top high school athlete
available by Baseball America, could go as early as the fourth
pick, which is held by the Royals. The Sox, who love to go local,
also like West Roxbury High pitcher Manny Delcarmen, a righthander
who has registered 94 miles per hour on scouts' radar guns, but
they may have to weigh whether Delcarmen can still be had on the
second round . . . So, you liked what you saw of Johnny Damon, the
swift Royals outfielder who helped lead Kansas City to a series win
over the Sox last week? So do the Yankees. Superscout Gene Michael
was in town last week tracking Damon, who fits the Bombers' need
for another lefthanded bat. Royals GM Herk Robinson says there have
been some inquiries regarding Damon, and the Royals probably would
be willing to part with him, since he wants a five-year deal and
they'll need to free up money to sign slugging right fielder
Jermaine Dye and eventually splendid center fielder Carlos Beltran.
Robinson said there's nothing imminent . . . Drayton McLane, the
Astros owner who justifiably is taking some heat for blowing up
what had been a terrific team in salary-driven deals, acknowledged
in an interview last week that he may have erred. ``Hindsight is
always the best way to judge what you were thinking,'' he told a
Houston paper. ``It's like when you get your test paper back and
when you know the answer but put the wrong one down. There are some
decisions, sure, we would have done differently. Which ones, I'm
not sure.'' Carl Everett has homered in every home series the Sox
have played, but the Astros, of course, weren't the first team to
ship him out. The Yankees, Marlins, and Mets, in that order, also
let him go, the Yankees in the expansion draft. ``The kid was a
late bloomer,'' said one baseball man. ``Can you imagine George
(Steinbrenner) having the patience to wait for him to develop? I
don't think so.'' Everett, who grew up in Tampa, said he has met
Tampa resident Steinbrenner on a couple of occasions. ``I met him
once at a boxing match in Tampa,'' said Everett. ``My agent was
managing the fighter. He introduced us.'' . . . Tampa Bay GM Chuck
LeMar had to wince when he released shortstop Kevin Stocker, who
had made 11 errors in 40 games with the Devil Rays. Stocker came to
the Rays from Philadelphia in an expansion-draft day deal for Bobby
Abreu, who has blossomed into a star for the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Division revision
</P>
<P>
   The Players' Association is on the right track with its proposal
for realignment that would transfer the Astros from the NL Central
to the AL West, creating two 15-team leagues. But it isn't going to
happen. McLane has no intention of leaving the NL, and except for
the expansion owners (Arizona and Tampa Bay), clubs retain veto
power. The notion of having one league with 16 teams, the other
with 14, one with a wild card, one without, is ludicrous, which is
one reason commissioner Bud Selig has delayed a vote on the issue
until next month at the earliest . . . There's a difference between
being petty and being principled, and Major League Baseball's
decision to keep Pete Rose from attending the Reds' 25th
anniversary celebration of the 1975 team Saturday night in
Cincinnati was petty. Rose, such an immense part of the Big Red
Machine, would not have tarnished the event by his presence. He
belonged there as much as he did at last October's ceremony
honoring the All-Century team . . . A Chicago alderman, Edward
Burke, is drawing support for his proposal to limit beer sales at
pro sports events in town. Burke's plan would stipulate that the
Cubs, White Sox, Bulls, Blackhawks, and Bears could sell beer no
earlier than 30 minutes before a game. The baseball teams would be
required to stop pouring in the bottom of the fifth inning, the
others by the start of the third period. This is in response, of
course, to the ugliness in Wrigley Field, when fans brawled with
Dodgers players after a spectator grabbed the cap of Dodgers
catcher Chad Kreuter in the bullpen. The opposition to Burke's
proposal? Not surprisingly, the beer vendors' union has voiced
objections, calling the proposal an overreaction . . . Add the name
of Steve Trachsel, the Devil Rays righty who beat Pedro Martinez,
1-0, last month in Fenway Park, to the list of pitchers who could
be available before the July trading deadline. There isn't a player
on the Devil Rays who can't be had in a deal . . . At the same
time, subtract the name of Sterling Hitchcock, the Padres' lefty
that the Sox were hot after last winter. Hitchcock was due to
undergo Tommy John tendon-transfer surgery in his left elbow, which
will end his season . . . The next month should tell us more about
the Yankees. In the next 24 days, the Bombers play 17 games against
teams that began the weekend in first place: the Braves, Red Sox,
and White Sox . . . Ken Griffey, benched one game last week by Reds
skipper Jack McKeon, was in an 0-for-14 funk and had just 4 hits in
39 at-bats. Junior has only one three-hit game this season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Better Red
</P>
<P>
   Cuban defector Osvaldo Fernandez, who originally signed with the
Giants after a much-publicized lottery in which he was an entry
with Livan Hernandez, was on his way out of baseball after elbow
surgery kept him out of the big leagues since '97. But Gary Hughes,
who was one of Fernandez's first hosts when he came to the States
and rode in Marlins owner Wayne Huizenga's airplane, recommended on
the eve of training camp that the Reds sign him. GM Jim Bowden gave
him a shot, and Fernandez has been a godsend to the Reds' rotation.
The Reds had won all four of his starts since he replaced the
disabled Pete Harnisch, and in his last outing he held the Expos to
two hits in seven innings, retiring the last 19 batters he faced .
. . Damon Buford has 10 home runs _ four more than he hit all of
last season for the Red Sox _ and came into the weekend batting
.292 for the Cubs. But perhaps the biggest surprise: Buford, who
was strictly a platoon player in Jimy Williams's scheme, had played
in each of the Cubs' first 55 games . . . Who says you can't teach
an old Hit Dog new tricks? When Mo Vaughn hit 40 home runs for the
Sox in 1998, two-thirds of them went to either center or left
field. Now that he's no longer taking aim at the deep porches in
right field in Fenway Park, Vaughn has hit 17 of his first 18 home
runs between the right-field foul line and straightaway center.

VENUS COMING INTO VIEW AT FRENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Venus sightings have been infrequent this year. Maybe
too much cloud cover? Not even the Palomar Mountain telescope could
have picked her out vegetating in Florida while her tender,
tendinitis-ized wrists took their time in healing.
</P>
<P>
   Venus was under cover. Under wraps. Under daily icings. And
under a fluffy cloud of nothingness floated by her playful, foxy
papa, Richard Williams, who said she was through with tennis at the
tenderest age of 19. Retired as a teenager? With this world yet to
conquer?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the shining Venus of this planet is Venus Ebone Starr
Williams, who has unretired fast, and descended on Stade Roland
Garros perhaps to save American tennis from ignominy at the French
Open. Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   The guys have wimped out. With Andre Agassi as drum major,
they've paraded like lemmings off a cliff, making one of the worst
showings since Yanks first tested the crimson earth in 1926. That
year, one of two male entries, New Yorker Vinnie Richards, did OK,
a semifinalist to the homeboy champ, Henri Cochet.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's left to the US women to salvage something: Williams, an
easy winner Saturday, plus Monica Seles and Chanda Rubin. With the
preliminaries over, they're in with a spiky crowd. It includes the
favorite, Martina Hingis, who would give several of her Swiss bank
accounts to add the only major jewel missing from her tiara;
three-time champ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario; Mighty Mary Pierce; the
sinewy native heroine, Amelie Mauresmo; ever-troublesome Conchita
Martinez; and the Paraguayan paragon, Rossana De Los Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me?
</P>
<P>
   Has anybody ever seen a female Paraguayan tennis player?
Especially one with a 3-year-old daughter? Not I. Not until
Saturday when 24-year-old Rossana, the only mother on the tour,
cramping in the last set, gamely survived an established gamer,
ninth seed Amanda Coetzer, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, in 2 hours 39
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is the most remarkable story in years. The junior champ
here in 1992, she lost interest and quit for five years, then
``awoke one day last year wanting to play again.'' This was her big
league debut, for which she won enough computer points in the
minors to reach No. 151, and enter the qualifying tournament.
Rossana, ``the sole support'' of her husband, Gustavo Neffa, an
unemployed pro soccer player, and their redheaded child, Anna
Paola, was ``given heart'' by their cheering her from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible dream,'' she said in Spanish. ``I am the
only good woman player ever from Paraguay. I was coached as a
junior by (countryman) Victor Pecci'' _ finalist in the French 21
years ago, loser to Bjorn Borg.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Paris, she felt her chances were as distant as Earth
from the other Venus. Williams has trucked along an easy-street
boulevard to the fourth round, where the female tournament really
commences. And ``that's good,'' said Williams, ``not to be pushed
too much'' (yielding 11 games to three foils). ``I need to just get
out there and find my rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still missing. But with France's Emilie Loit across the
net, a wild card ranked No. 156, and an obvious lover of home
cooking, who needed rhythm to win, 6-2, 6-2? ``I'll need it next''
_ against 11th-seeded Anke Huber _ ``and I think I'll raise the
level of my game. When I have to fight, against the better players
I do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind this was only Williams's seventh start since losing
in the semis of the season-closing Chase Championships to Hingis.
After a superb 1999 (six titles, 61-13, finishing No. 3), she was
sidelined six months. Hibernating, she watched TV, attended classes
at the Art Institute in Fort Lauderdale (``fashion illustration,
math, psychology''), tended her wrists, and left the playing to
little sister Serena, the US Open champ. Serena, obviously
unprepared after her grand Flushing Meadow success, and
experiencing a nothing season, has gone underground herself.
</P>
<P>
   Where is she? ``Home,'' says Venus. Why? ``Injured.'' What's the
injury. ``I don't know. I don't ask her. We don't talk about that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the obfuscating but winsome Williamses. They delight in
keeping us all off-balance, milking ink from whatever they do or
don't do.
</P>
<P>
   Williams concedes, ``I don't have the muscle mass I did. I lost
a little bit. I will get stronger eventually. Give me a couple of
months.''
</P>
<P>
   She has only a couple of days at the moment, but Williams is
such a terrific athlete and so competitive that she may steal a lot
of vital points with her speed, and rediscover the shotmaking
rhythm that Martina Navratilova predicts ``should bring her a major
title before long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe my daddy thought I should retire,'' she said with a
laugh. ``He told me to stay home six more weeks, to make sure of
the wrists. But he also wants Serena and me to make our own
decisions.'' Really? ``And I had to get out here and start playing.
So here I am. I know a lot of people don't believe us when we say
we can't play _ but they can write whatever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   What she wants for them to write most next weekend is that big
sister has caught up with little sister and stashed another major
championship in the family vault.

SIMMONS OUT TO FIND HIS OPENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ We know Terry Glenn is No. 1. We know Troy Brown
will be the main inside receiver and third-down guy. And right now
it looks as though Tony Simmons is the heir apparent to Shawn
Jefferson as the Patriots' outside speed receiver, barring the
signing of a receiver before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Will this be enough weaponry for Drew Bledsoe and the new
spread-out offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a few pieces left to the puzzle,'' said Glenn.
``But I think everyone's clicking so well with Drew right now that
I think it's going to be very productive once we get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, they say, used to run routes like Richard Simmons, but
now he has a clue. What the Patriots don't want their outside
receiver to do is run to spots where Bledsoe isn't expecting him to
be.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Simmons is now on the same page. With his speed and
two years of NFL experience, it's time for him to show it. If he
doesn't, the loss of Jefferson to the Falcons in free agency will
be felt deeply. After all, the thinking in letting Jefferson go was
that Simmons could at least act as a decoy downfield, but he knows
he needs to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm really playing the role of Shawn, but I have
to prove I can play his role or a backup role or whatever role they
see me at right now,'' said Simmons. ``I have two years under my
belt now, so it's about time that I should be a factor in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what the Patriots are thinking. Last year,
Simmons seemed to be buried on the depth chart behind Glenn,
Jefferson, Brown, and Vincent Brisby. He rarely saw the field in
the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation where they used me as needed,'' said
Simmons. ``I wouldn't call it a wasted year because I learned a
lot. Shawn taught me an awful lot about the game and he also taught
me about things off the field as well. I'll miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is Jefferson's departure that could put Simmons in a
starting role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that losing Shawn helped me,'' said Simmons.
``It's too bad that has to be the way it is, but now it's up to me
to take advantage of the situation. I have a great chance in a
great offense to show I can be a major factor. It's all up to me,
and I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he constantly works on his speed with coach Mike
Morris, who used to compete against Wisconsin track coach Richard
Hackett. Morris and Hackett have conferred on methods to keep
improving Simmons's running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still do all of my track stuff,'' said Simmons, a former
sprinter at Wisconsin who won the Big 10 100-meter title over
Falcons receiver Tim Dwight. ``Speed is my game and I can never
lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons doesn't know whether he's faster now than he was then,
but he knows he's made strides in his route running and feels he
has decent enough hands to make the tough catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The route running is something I have to constantly work on,''
he said. ``I didn't come from a passing offense at Wisconsin, so
that's been the toughest part for me. I still don't run the
crispest routes, but I think I've improved and I'll keep
improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, too, has noticed an improvement in Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can make an impact because he's so fast,'' said Glenn.
``It's all a matter of confidence. A young receiver has to develop
that by catching the ball. It would be nice to have a game-breaker
on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be good for Glenn, who will draw the majority of
attention from defenses. For the Patriots' sake, they'd better have
Simmons, Brown, or Brisby getting open when Glenn is in double
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to beat my man,'' said Simmons. ``I have to use my
speed the right way on the field. That's what I'm constantly trying
to do and that's what I have to show the coaches I can do.''

BLAZERS SPENT AFTER CLOSING THE DEFICIT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Their task is still a daunting one. The Portland
Trail Blazers have improbably taken the Western Conference finals
to a seventh game Sunday night. The odds, however, still are
stacked against them.
</P>
<P>
   Given up for dead a week ago _ Lakers coach Phil Jackson said
the Blazers were at ``death's door'' after falling behind, 3-1 _
Portland is very much back in the picture. But the Blazers have to
do what only two teams in NBA history ever have done: win a seventh
game on the road after trailing, 3-1. Their historical inspirations
are the 1968 Celtics (against Philadelphia) and the 1995 Rockets
(against the Suns). Six teams overall have come back from a 3-1
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting,'' said Blazers guard Steve
Smith. ``Once we get there, anything can go. It's not about record
or home-court losses. It's about one game and seeing what we're
made of.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Blazers looked as though they were made of
straw. But two stirring wins have forced Sunday's winner-take-all
affair at Staples Center, where the Blazers already have inflicted
two losses on the Lakers in this series. They're also responsible
for three of the last four LA losses in the building.
</P>
<P>
   But getting there is only half the story. The Lakers, while a
bit wounded, have history on their side. New and old. They have not
lost three straight games all season and they are 9-1 in seventh
games at home, winning their last seven. The only loss came in 1969
to Bill Russell's Celtics. By contrast, Portland has appeared in
just one seventh game in its 23-year playoff history, a home game
in 1990 against the Spurs (Portland won in overtime).
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, ever the mind-game man, started the posturing after
Portland's 103-93 win Friday night by deciding he would have his
team practice Saturday at Staples Center. The Lakers never practice
there; they have their own facility in El Segundo. By taking over
Staples Center, Jackson forced the Trail Blazers to push their
practice time back to late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, any edge apparently is worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shocked it has come to this,'' Jackson said, although
he would have been stunned a week ago if told it would go the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the rough stuff. Shaquille O'Neal was called for a
flagrant foul on Scottie Pippen in Game 6, although Jackson didn't
agree with the call. Pippen said the Lakers are trying to distract
the Blazers with gratuitous cheap shots and physical play. Rick
Fox, for goodness sakes, has even taken on the role of provocateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are hitting me after the whistle and things of that
nature,'' Pippen said, ``but I know what it is about when you get
this far in the playoffs. I'm sure they're going to try everything,
but it can't work on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about O'Neal's foul, Pippen said, ``He hit me hard. It was
obvious what he was trying to do. He never made any attempt to go
after the ball. So I'm going to see if that's going to cost him
$10,000.'' Pippen was fined $10,000 for an elbow in Game 4. The
Lakers thought he should have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will need a breakout game from Shaq, who was hounded
and harassed in Game 6. He finished with 17 points, his lowest
total ever against Portland in a playoff game. He normally abuses
Arvydas Sabonis, but the Lithuanian leviathan stayed out of foul
trouble Friday night, playing 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because they weren't calling anything,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Lakers' other breadwinner, Kobe Bryant, is
playing on a sore foot. He did score 33 Friday, but 12 came in the
fourth when the Lakers were hoisting treys everywhere. A third
option (Glen Rice, perhaps?) would be nice for LA.
</P>
<P>
   The odds, the venue, and hoop history are all in the Lakers'
favor. Portland has the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we all got what we came for, a Game 7 between two
great teams,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``It all comes
down to that.''

BIRD GAVE PACERS A WILL AND A WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It really happened.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Walsh is happy to verify the story. ``Basically,'' says
the Indiana Pacers president, ``he told me that if I hired him, he
could get us to the Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He,'' of course, is Larry Bird, and he, of course, has kept
his word. There was an agonizing near-miss in 1998 and there was a
disappointing ending in 1999, but now there is naught but joy and
happiness in a land where basketball runs an extremely close 1-2
with Godliness. Larry Bird is taking his Indiana Pacers to the 2000
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He has done it his way. Two assistants, and two assistants only.
How about that? ``I don't think you need more than that,'' he said
at the time. ``I'd rather have two assistants and pay them better.
If it turns out I need a third one, I'll get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Two assistants. Dick Harter handles the defense. Rick Carlisle
handles the offense. Harter is old enough to be Bird's father and
then some, and Bird is 43. Carlisle could be a younger brother.
Bird didn't know Harter beyond a handshake and a howdoyado before
hiring him. Harter is the wise old head who has coached at every
level and who knew how to manage a game. Carlisle is the rising
star whippersnapper coach who someday will have his own team to
run. They provide the perfect balance for Bird in every way.
</P>
<P>
   Two assistants! Everybody else has at least three, and Don
Nelson has _ what is it? _ 29? The players loved it from the
beginning, because it told them that Bird could see through all the
b.s. Why do you need all these guys walking around with clipboards?
Two assistants. One for the defense and one for the offense. Two
assistants. What a novel thought.
</P>
<P>
   But Bird always has been about eliminating the clutter. You
should see his house. You leave a glass on a table, and _ bang! _
it's heading for the sink. You leave a newspaper or magazine on the
couch and _ bang! _ it's heading for the trash. Bird is about one
heartbeat shy of being labeled a neat freak.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the Pacers and saw a team that had the necessary
components to win. ``A playoff team that didn't make the playoffs''
was the assessment of someone at the time, and it was true. There
were injuries in the 1996-97 season, and there was friction between
many of the players and Larry Brown. The players quit on him and he
even admitted that he had grown weary of coaching them. It was
clearly time for a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   But the core was OK. This was a team that had gone to the
Eastern Conference finals in 1994 and 1995, losing seventh games to
New York and Orlando. There was a lot of experience and there was
Reggie Miller, a legitimate marquee player. Oh, there were flaws,
too, and there still are. This team is no threat to the memory of
the '83 76ers, '86 Celtics, '87 Lakers, or '97 Bulls. But the
positives far outweighed the negatives, then and now.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been a smooth ride. In the beginning the
players listened to him because he was Larry Bird. But it doesn't
take long for Larry Legend to become Larry the (expletive) Coach
when things get a bit rocky, and the Pacers aren't exactly the most
stable team from the eyebrows up. As recently as last Wednesday
morning there was trouble in Indiana's paradise, as players went
public with their displeasure over Bird's (and Harter's) chosen
defensive methods.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any moaning now. The Pacers stuck with Bird's
program and won both Games 5 and 6. They will be going to the
Finals and they will be in the hands of a good coach, or coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two games ago, players were questioning what I was doing and
all I told them was, `You've got to believe and you've got to get
up and play harder, and if you lay it on the line, it will work,'
'' Bird says. ``If you are soft, they will take advantage of you.
They stuck with it and believed in it, and when they were down 18
points at Conseco Field House, it worked for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of being down 18 points in the first quarter of Game 5
in your own building, is it possible that said dire circumstance,
or the reaction to it, turned out to be the making of a
championship team? Bird thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back from 18 down the other night, we became a
different team,'' Bird maintains. ``This is the best I've seen us
since I've been here. We're tougher. We fought. We scrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Toughness and scrappiness have not been words one would attach
to the Pacers, who have been regarded as the quintessentially soft
finesse team, Miller excepted. Rik Smits is hopeless. He is 33 and
isn't going to change. Jalen Rose is a work in progress. Mark
Jackson is limited and nowhere near as good as he thinks he is. But
in the last seven periods of play, the entity known as the Indiana
Pacers has acquired a new collective persona.
</P>
<P>
   It may be as simple as this: They finally have come to
understand, without the shred of a doubt, that their coach knows
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really excited when he was hired,'' recalls Travis Best,
the little point guard out of Springfield, Mass., who was
magnificent in the last two games. ``We needed a change, and I knew
what kind of a warrior he was. It was not about X's and O's. He
doesn't even have to say anything. You just want to play for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry has done a lot for the game, whether playing, coaching,
whatever the case may be. We have respect for him. When he says
something, we go out there and try to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't necessarily saying that last Wednesday morning, but
now they have further reason to believe in the leadership of Larry
Bird. They plugged into his thought process and his will and now
they are going to the NBA Finals. It took three full regular
seasons, two failed playoff tries, and now three playoff series in
the year 2000, but it has come to pass: The Indiana Pacers finally
have become a reflection of their coach. They always had the
talent. Now they have the will.

SHARK LOSING COMPETITIVE BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being Greg Norman is a huge undertaking. He's designing golf
courses in all corners of the world. He's making his own wine. He's
got his own turf. He's involved in the clothing business. A
personal Web site (www.shark.com), naturally, and all the toys _
yacht, helicopter, jet _ need constant attention, too. All the
while, of course, he's attempting to keep tabs with his powerful
political friends on both sides of party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Whew. No wonder there's no time for golf. At least, not a
full-time, full-conscience effort.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, Norman cut short his commitment to the
Memorial Tournament to keep a scheduled meeting with Florida Gov.
Jeb Bush. He withdrew instead of taking part in Monday's final
round of the rain-plagued event, which is certainly his
prerogative. It's a free world, and he needs more money like you
and I need car problems. Not a huge deal, perhaps, but it was
inconsiderate and smacks of elitism that the Tour does not need.
</P>
<P>
   He's 45 and the competitive fires are no longer there _ the ones
that need to burn inside the ropes, that is. Business endeavors?
He's got plenty of passion for those, and good luck to him. He's
fabulously rich, and unlike his on-course experience, which has
included his share of hard luck, everything he touches in the
business world turns to gold.
</P>
<P>
   During a pre-Memorial press conference, he said that golf
remains his No. 1 priority besides his family, but you would have a
hard time finding people who believe that. Then, when he walks away
rather than finish a tournament he had committed to, it looks
lousy.
</P>
<P>
   Norman has done this before, at the Tour Championship in 1996
when that prestigious event was extended until Monday. Everyone
else in the field stuck around to play, even those 15 shots behind,
but Norman couldn't be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour is one of the most grueling ways to make a living,
a way of life that is far different from what the public perceives
it to be. The travel is tough, the hours are long, the mental
strain enormous. You have a couple dozen guys who truly stand out _
Tiger Woods, Davis Love, Phil Mickelson, Colin Montgomerie, David
Duval _ and could hop out of bed at 2 a.m. and place top 10
anywhere. But the majority of players grind away week in and week
out, always trying to make a cut, constantly concerned about exempt
status. To these players, berths in tournaments are like gold, and
most of them are genuinely grateful for the chance to be on the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes Norman's action even more disturbing. When
you enter a tournament, you should do so with a serious commitment.
There is a serious financial stake, and the fans deserve nothing
but a total effort by the players.
</P>
<P>
   If it rains, you get wet. If it is cold, you freeze. If the
course is tough, you shoot a high number. If someone burns it up,
you don't win. Low 70 and ties get into weekend play, so you know
there's a chance you'll go home empty-handed. If serious weather
kicks in, you know Monday finishes are part of the landscape, if
that's what it means to get in 72 holes.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Doug Ford at the Masters, shooting 89 and going on
his merry way. Ford's lifetime exemption _ a reward for having won
the Masters _ does not get passed on to someone else if he chooses
not to play.
</P>
<P>
   Not so at the Memorial. The people who run that event are set on
a field of 105, so if Norman were to turn down his spot (which
comes via his status as a former champion), it would go to someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to play, wonderful. He has earned the right and
there are plenty of people who still want to see him beneath that
shark hat. But if he can't respectfully commit 100 percent to the
event, please step aside, and let someone else into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Monday and Tuesday, at 12 sites, hundreds of golfers ranging in
stature from unheralded amateur to former Masters champion (Craig
Stadler) will agonize over shots for 36 holes in an effort to
secure a spot in the US Open at Pebble Beach. Each of them has
committed to this experience knowing the weather could turn nasty,
the rough will be tough, the greens rock-hard, the challenge
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and they know that if there's a tie at the end of 72 holes,
the playoff is Monday. Norman, who has a free pass via a generous
exemption from the USGA, may want to factor that into his business
plans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping good company
</P>
<P>
   Olin Browne is one of those Tour guys who takes his job
seriously, and he'll be grinding away Monday in hopes of making it
into the US Open. Browne will be at Woodmont CC in Rockville, Md.,
which could be considered a PGA Tour stop with the caliber of
players involved: Robert Allenby, Billy Andrade, Woody Austin, Rich
Beem, Jay Don Blake, Greg Chalmers, Brandel Chamblee, Stewart Cink,
John Cook, Glen Day, Chris DiMarco, Brad Faxon, Harrison Frazar,
David Frost, Bill Glasson, Scott Gump, Jay Haas, Gabriel Hjerstedt,
Scott Hoch, Mike Hulbert, Jonathan Kaye, Shigeki Maruyama, Scott
McCarron, Joey Sindelar, Kirk Triplett, Scott Verplank, and Kevin
Wentworth. Browne, 40, is a two-time PGA Tour winner and one of the
most forthright players you'll meet out there. He spent a year at
The Country Club and learned a lot of the game's finer points from
former head pro Don Callahan. And Browne has quietly turned into a
solid player _ 100th on the money list in 1996, but 94th, 47th, and
51st since. Currently, he is 97th with $237,658 . . . James
Driscoll, the University of Virginia senior from Chestnut Hill, was
unable to defend his title at this weekend's Hornblower Memorial at
Plymouth CC, competing instead in the NCAA Championship at Auburn
University in Alabama. Driscoll also will be at Woodmont, trying to
earn a ticket to Pebble Beach, where he fared so well in the US
Amateur last summer. Jason Caron, the PGA Tour rookie from South
Yarmouth, heads a list of New Englanders trying to get past the
sectional. Others include: Billy Downes of Hampden; Michael Flynn,
the Rochester, N.H., native who went to Texas Christian University;
P.H. Horgan of Newport; Ron Philo Jr. from the CC of Vermont; Brett
Quigley of Barrington, R.I.; BUY.com Tour regulars Kevin Johnson of
Pembroke, Geoff Sisk of Marshfield, and Fran Quinn of Northborough;
Andy Morse of Needham and Peter Morgan of Harwich, those ultimate
road-travelers; and Mark Brown, the Milton native and former
assistant pro at Presidents GC in Quincy who now works at Tam
O'Shanter on Long Island . . . Proving that there is a strong
appeal to a US Open at Pebble Beach, here are some blasts from the
past who are going into competition at sectional qualifying: Ben
Crenshaw, Mark McCumber, Mac O'Grady, Mike Nicolette, Jack Renner,
Gary Hallberg, D.A. Weibring, Andy Bean, Bob Gilder, Wayne Grady,
Richard Zokol, Fuzzy Zoeller, Peter Jacobsen, and Mike Donald, who
would be working on the last ride in a 10-year exemption had he not
fallen down at Medinah and lost to Hale Irwin in 1990 . . . Stadler
and son Kevin are in the same qualifier in Cincinnati; Weibring and
son Matt are at different locales; and Johnny Miller will be in the
gallery (or perhaps caddying) for son Andy, who will tee it up at
Lake Merced in Daly City, Calif. Think Johnny would get up for his
NBC duties at Pebble Beach (his favorite course) if his son made it
in? . . . Per-Ulrik Johansson is taking time out from his European
Tour duties to try to qualify, while Chan Song Wongluekiet _ whose
13-year-old twin sisters Aree and Naree have gotten quite a bit of
publicity this year by playing in LPGA Tour events _ is trying to
make it in at age 17 . . . His father has an exemption, but Gary
Nicklaus will try to qualify at Bear Lakes in West Palm Beach,
where the field also includes David O'Kelly, the former head pro at
Willowbend . . . The Kuehne Brothers _ Hank (the pro) and Trip (the
amateur) are at the same site in Houston . . . And, yes, that is
former major league pitcher Shane Rawley entered at Settindown
Creek CC in Atlanta . . . As for New Zealand's Michael Campbell, he
avoided the qualifying nightmare by accepting a last-minute special
exemption from the USGA, joining Norman, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson,
Curtis Strange, and Aaron Baddeley on the VIP list.

   Reading the fine print

   Here are the names: Valerie Van Ryckeghem, Raquel Carriedo,
Sandrine Mendiburu, Sofia Gronberg, Samantha Head, Elisabeth
Esterl, Caroline Hall, Lora Fairclough, and Marina Arruti. Now, who
are they? They are currently in the top 15 in Solheim Cup points
standings, and if you have heard of any of them, then you are a
serious reader of golf agate in the weekly publications. These
women play strictly in Europe, where the women's pro tour is not
nearly as extensive as the LPGA Tour, and truth be told perhaps
just one or two of these women will make the team. Laura Davies and
Trish Johnson, both of whom are locks, are 1-2 in the standings,
and European captain Dale Reid is committed to taking just the
first seven. After that she gets five wild-card picks . . . Before
shooting 69 in the third round of last week's Corning Classic,
Grace Park had gone 17 rounds without breaking 70. This from the
1998 US Women's Amateur champ who was widely expected to have a
banner rookie season on the LPGA Tour. It still could happen,
despite her slow start. Park shot 66 to open this week's Kathy
Ireland Greens.com Classic in Murrells Inlet, S.C., and if that
signals a turnaround, it would be wonderful for the Tour. Park is a
brilliant talent who could pump life into the circuit . . . John
Daly continues to be a lightning rod for bad luck. He was 4 over
playing the 17th hole in the second round of the Memorial
Tournament when his approach hit playing partner Mark Brooks's ball
on the green. Brooks got to place his ball in its original spot,
while Daly had to play from where his ball stopped, which was about
50 feet from the pin. Had it not struck Brooks's ball, no doubt
Daly's shot would have drawn back and been within 15-20 feet. Daly
made par at 17, then double-bogeyed the 18th, apparently thinking
that 4 over was no good. Alas, 4 over just got in under the cut . .
. There was a pretty good breeze as Alisdair Watt stood off to the
18th green at Waverly Oaks GC in Plymouth, though truthfully he
didn't pay much attention. And why should he? He polished his game
at Royal Troon in his native Scotland, where it wasn't out of the
ordinary for him to go out for a match with Montgomerie. Watt, 33,
the assistant pro at Farm Neck on Martha's Vineyard, shared
medalist honors with a 69 in a Mass. Open qualifier at the course
in Plymouth, and revealed afterward that a certain golf enthusiast
from Washington, D.C., was a student of his on the Vineyard a
couple of summers ago. Did he improve President Clinton's game?
Such a silly question to ask a professional instructor. ``Of course
I did,'' said Watt, smiling.

AU REVOIR TO THE ROCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those of us too young to have seen Maurice Richard play
(virtually everyone born after, say, 1955), his greatness has been
documented and understood through word and photograph since his
retirement from the NHL in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost every picture of the inimitable Rocket, the stories
often focused on his haunting dark green eyes. He had steely
vision, tiny licks of flame perpetually dancing in his pupils,
spreading into a raging fire as he approached the net.
</P>
<P>
   He was, by all accounts, fierce and unyielding, a man who
internalized doubts others shared about his abilities early in his
career _ when he was thin of frame and often injured _ and
transformed that doubt into an obsessive rage to succeed. The
Rocket was laid to rest last week, carried from the Notre Dame
Basilica in Montreal with a blanket of yellow roses, a touch of
beauty and delicateness, spread over his mahogany casket. He died
of abdominal cancer at age 78, more than 40 years after scoring his
final goal for the glorified Canadiens, and after having spent most
of his life being a provincial deity.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins Hall of Famer Milt Schmidt was tending to flowers last
week, taking advantage of a gorgeous late-spring day to plant
geraniums and impatiens around his home in suburban Boston. In the
10-plus seasons they opposed each other, Schmidt recalled, he was
never exposed to what he called Richard's vicious side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was that one time he broke my nose,'' said the
82-year-old Schmidt. ``We were both racing for the puck, as I
recall, and he came up with his arms and elbows. Of course, I've
got a lot of nose to hit, and he caught me. When the doctor told me
it was broken, I said, `OK, fine, Doc, but not a word to anyone.' I
just didn't want (Richard) to have the satisfaction that he'd
broken it.''
</P>
<P>
   When they next met, Schmidt spotted Richard cutting cross-ice in
a switch and made certain he was crissing when the Rocket was
crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I got him,'' said Schmidt. ``I got him with a good,
legitimate knee and elbow _ if you could call that legitimate. He
turned right around on me and said, `Why you do that?' And I said,
`Well, Maurice, you were turning one way, and I turned that way,
and . . .' Then he said again, `Why you do that?' I think then I
said, `Look, forget it, let's just play.' And that was it. We got
along fine, really; I respected him and he respected me.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard's strength was in his legs and arms. He was a fast
skater, but the rink always has been flooded with the fleet.
Richard, though, made a habit of using that speed to gain a slight
positioning edge and then he would almost straight-arm past
opposing forwards or defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would ward you off with his arms,'' said Schmidt. ``Those
were his strengths, his legs and his arms. But if you're asking
what made him such a special talent, well, you had to have
something else to score all the goals (544) he did. He just had a
fantastic way of finding the opening in a net. He always had his
head up, which you're supposed to do, of course, when you've got
the puck, and he'd see exactly where he wanted to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture of Richard that may be best remembered, and perhaps
cursed, by Boston fans came in the moments after what many consider
his greatest goal. It was April 8, 1952, Game 7 of the Stanley Cup
semifinals against the Bruins, at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Knocked unconscious early in the action, the woozy Richard spent
most of the game in the dressing room before returning to the bench
in the third period, his vision still too impaired for him to read
the scoreboard. Stories of the day had him asking Elmer Lach, one
of his brothers on the fabled Punch Line with Toe Blake, what the
score was and how much time remained as he sat on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   With about four minutes to go, Richard hurdled the boards,
gained possession of the puck, charged in, and beat Bruins goalie
Sugar Jim Henry with the winner. The lasting picture is that of a
bloodied, seemingly dazed Richard exchanging a postgame handshake
with Henry, whose own eyes were blackened from a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``That beautiful bastard,'' wrote Elmer Ferguson of the Montreal
Herald, ``scored semi-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Help wanted
</P>
<P>
   Bruins assistant GM Mike O'Connell said that he and Peter
Laviolette, head coach in Providence (AHL) the last two years,
talked 7-10 days ago about Laviolette filling the assistant
coaching job left open in Boston by Ken Baumgartner. ``And we'll
talk again,'' said O'Connell. ``Peter's expressed an interest in
doing it, and I think he's talked to Pat Burns about it, too. We'll
see where it goes.'' O'Connell said the Bruins also might keep a
goaltending consultant on staff next year, a position not filled
since the early 1990s when ex-Harvard netminder Joe Bertagna helped
players such as Reggie Lemelin and Andy Moog stay in tune. ``Our
goalies are open to the idea,'' said O'Connell. ``It would be
someone to help them with the technical part of it, work with
videos, talk with them.'' Gerry Cheevers wouldn't be among the
candidates for the job, said O'Connell, because the club values his
efforts in the pro scouting department . . . Everyone expects that
Jacques Lemaire will be the Minnesota Wild's head coach, provided
he and GM Doug Risebrough can work out the money. Had Risebrough
remained in Edmonton, where he was Glen Sather's right-hand man, he
likely would be the Oiler GM now that Sather has signed on as the
Rangers' Mr. Fix-It (for a reported $15 million over five years) .
. . If Kevin Lowe decides to join Sather and be the Rangers' head
coach (John Muckler was canned in March), then ex-Bruin Craig
MacTavish undoubtedly would be promoted as the Oilers' new head
coach. It could happen anyway if Lowe stays put and assumes
Sather's GM duties . . . Sather said it was the Ray Bourque trade
in March that underscored to him that it was time to leave
Edmonton. When he saw Boston boss Harry Sinden talking trade during
the GM meetings prior to the deadline, it was frustrating for
Sather to realize there was no way his skimpy Oiler budget allowed
him to join the bidding _ ultimately won by the Avalanche, one of
the Oilers' top rivals. Sather: ``I knew the deal was coming down.
You're sitting there knowing something was going to happen, and
there was absolutely zero you could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plots thicken
</P>
<P>
   Not sure if Thomas Harris is a true hockey fan, but the author
of ``The Silence of the Lambs'' caught my attention in that story
when his central character, heinous murderer Hannibal Lecter, wore
a restraining mask that had to be stolen from a goalie's equipment
bag. And now, in the gripping sequel, ``Hannibal,'' Lecter flees
Europe by joining a tour group on a flight to Detroit. To make sure
that Lecter mixes into the group, Harris has him wearing warmups
that ``bear the insignia of the Toronto Maple Leafs.'' I wouldn't
want to be the guy who belted out ``Game On'' with the not-so-good
Dr. Lecter within earshot . . . The rumor mill has Tampa Bay
shipping both Vincent Lecavalier and netminder Dan Cloutier to
Ottawa for the rights to Alexei Yashin. ``Not going to happen,''
said Bolts GM Rick Dudley . . . Ex-Bruin Wayne Cashman, whose stint
as head coach in Philadelphia was mercifully short (61 games,
'97-98), last week requested permission from the Flyers to talk to
Tampa Bay about moving back there as an assistant coach. Cash held
that job for four seasons before spending a year with San Jose
prior to his arrival in Philly . . . The Islanders profited by the
luck of the draw and copped the No. 1 pick in the June draft,
rocketing up from the No. 5 spot in the lottery last week. ``We're
doing a jig,'' said ex-Bruins defenseman Mike Milbury. It could
make for some interesting orchestrations on draft day, because of
ex-BU netminder Rick DiPietro. The Islanders already have their
franchise netminder in Roberto Luongo. If someone with a lower pick
truly covets DiPietro _ such as, say, Chicago with picks No. 10 and
11 _ they could offer to swap picks and toss in a roster player for
the right to go first. The Islanders held only an 8 percent chance
of winning the lottery . . . Another ex-Bruin, Al Sims, is among
the candidates to fill the assistant coaching job left vacant in
Toronto with the departure of Alpo Suhonen to Chicago. Sims coached
the last two years in Milwaukee, the Nashville Predators' top
affiliate . . . Kirk Muller, once a Montreal captain, wore No. 9
once during an All-Star game. Richard, who wore that No. 9 to its
retirement in Montreal, made a point of quizzing Muller about why
he wore it. ``And he told me, `You're a Canadien, don't make a
habit of it,' '' said Muller. The Rocket wasn't kidding . . .
Woonsocket's Brian Boucher is in for some kind of pay raise after
blossoming into the Flyers' No. 1 backstop. He earned $450,000 last
season, while John Vanbiesbrouck, dumped from the top job, was on
the books at $3.75 million . . . Jean Beliveau, now battling cancer
himself, was among the Rocket's ex-Canadien pallbearers. The
others: Henri ``Pocket Rocket'' Richard, Dickie Moore, Butch
Bouchard, and Dollard St. Laurent.

   Cup is his baby
</P>
<P>
   ESPN once more has delivered a series of clever spots to promote
hockey, focusing this spring on where individual members of the
Stars took the Stanley Cup after winning it last spring. When
Schmidt last held the Cup, as Bruins general manager in 1972, the
league had not yet begun the practice of having the winners carry
it hither and yon. When Schmidt brought it home following the
victory banquet, he felt a degree of anxiety over being the
trophy's keeper. ``They didn't have guards carrying it around like
today,'' said Schmidt. ``As the manager, I was responsible.'' Once
home, Schmidt scouted around for a suitably safe resting spot,
ultimately deciding to tuck it into his daughter's bed, covering it
over with a blanket. ``Nancy was small then,'' said Schmidt, ``she
found somewhere else to sleep.'' Schmidt's name is engraved in the
Cup four times with the Bruins, twice as a player and twice as a
member of management. ``I'm proud of that,'' he said, ``to be
included with so many players past, present, and future. There are
so many great players who don't get their names on it _ like Ray
Bourque again this year. Same thing happened to Bill Gadsby _ such
a great, great defenseman, but it just never happened for him.'' .
. . The Leafs were denied a request for a special exemption for
Bryan Berard so that they would not have to protect him in the
expansion draft later this month. Berard is still recovering from
an eye injury and may not play again, which would have made the
exemption the right thing to do. The Flyers, likewise, don't know
whether Eric Lindros, after suffering multiple concussions, will be
able to play again. Shouldn't they, too, be able to claim that
L'Enfant Terrible is a special situation? Meanwhile, Flyers
chairman Ed Snider said last week that the club expects to offer
Lindros the qualifying $8.5 million it takes to retain his rights,
rather than simply allow him to depart as an unrestricted free
agent . . . Wayne Gretzky _ that's owner Wayne Gretzky _ has this
to look forward to in Phoenix. The troika of Keith Tkachuk, Jeremy
Roenick, and Teppo Numminen will see their collective salaries jump
from $7.25 million to $17.5 million. No. 99 will find out that it's
harder to score from the owner's box than it has ever been . . .
Bruins training camp is about 90 days away _ enough time for the
good folks in Wilmington to finish the steel cage that will house
tough guy Martin Grenier, who has amassed 983 penalty minutes over
the last three years in the Quebec League. Are you ready to
rummmmmbllllle?

LAKERS PRIME TIME BUT NOT ALL-TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do we make of the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   Well, after watching them for a week, it's easy to see why Phil
Jackson should have been Coach of the Year. They may be the best of
this NBA, but they also may be the worst 67-15 team in history.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles became the eighth team to win 67 or more games in a
season. Four of those teams accomplished the feat in the last 10
years, and of the previous seven, six won NBA championships, the
1972-73 Celtics being the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the six champions, only the 1991-92 Chicago Bulls had
as hard a time in the postseason as these Lakers are having.
Although they may have looked unbeatable in the regular season, the
Lakers appear to be anything but in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: They needed five games to put away the eighth-seeded
team in the West, the Sacramento Kings. None of the other post-1984
champions (when the playoffs were expanded to 16 teams) had such a
problem. In fact, all three Chicago teams (1991-92, 1995-96,
1996-97) as well as the 1985-86 Celtics swept their first-round
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The Lakers already have lost two in a row at home, and
we haven't even started the NBA Finals. The 1995-96 Bulls and the
1985-86 Celtics went undefeated at home in the postseason (10-0).
The 1996-97 Bulls lost once at home. Only the 1991-92 Bulls were
worse at home, losing thrice, once each in the second, third, and
final rounds.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening in a league that has never been more diluted.
In the 1980s, you needed three Hall of Famers to win a title. Now
you need two dominant players. The Lakers are getting it done with
two starters who should be retired (Ron Harper, A.C. Green) and
with a reserve who basically was retired (Brian Shaw). We won't
even get into John Salley. Yes, Rick Fox, Robert Horry, and Derek
Fisher were starters on a 61-win team, but that, too, speaks
volumes about the lack of depth in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are very good _ for their time. It's a 29-team league
with the players coming in at a younger age and the ESPN-ization of
the game getting stronger with each episode of ``SportsCenter.''
It's a league that can create a star (Vince Carter) simply because
he dunks spectacularly. Never mind that he has never won a playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson took the LA job knowing exactly what the situation was:
He had a team with the dominant talent in the game (Shaquille
O'Neal) who, like Michael Jordan a decade earlier, was frustrated
by an inability to win. He knew which buttons to push and he
succeeded. You look at his roster and you have to marvel at the job
he did.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't call him coach
</P>
<P>
   It has been months since Danny Ainge left the Phoenix Suns
coaching job, and he says he is still quite happy with his
decision. Ainge interviewed recently for the since-filled (Rod
Thorn) job of director of basketball operations for the Nets. But,
he said, it was more of a pro forma interview; figures were not
discussed, nor were the parameters of control. ``I was in New
York,'' said Ainge. ``I figured I couldn't lose anything by going
for the interview.'' As for coaching, he said, ``I've had phone
calls from three different teams asking me if I was interested in
coaching. I turned them all down. I have no interest in coaching,
none whatsoever. I can't stress that enough. It's the last thing I
want to do right now. I have turned down every inquiry and will
continue to do so.'' Ainge said he still has a standing offer from
Suns owner Jerry Colangelo to rejoin the franchise in some
capacity, but he is quite happy with his TNT gig and doesn't want
to become another scholarship guy with the Suns. They have a few .
. . Thorn, meanwhile, steps back into the team executive role for
the first time in more than 15 years. He is one of the league's
true good guys, so we know he won't take umbrage if we at least
note his drafting record as the Bulls' general manager. Yes, he did
select Jordan. That was a no-brainer; MJ fell into his lap. That
would be like giving Rick Pitino credit for drafting Paul Pierce.
But he also drafted ``San'' Quintin Dailey (after his assault
problems), Ronnie Lester (after he blew out his knee), and such
other luminaries as Mitch Wiggins, Sidney Green, and Ennis Whatley.
He also fired Jerry Sloan, one of the best coaches the Bulls ever
had. Thorn was toast once Jerry Reinsdorf purchased the team in
1985. But, as we noted, he's such a good guy that he won't care
and, clearly, neither do the Nets. And Jersey had some company over
the years. Thorn also turned down an overture from Charlotte to
become its rainmaker . . . One theory as to why Larry Bird doesn't
want to stay in Indiana: He wants to run the whole show. Although
he's been given that option, Bird may still feel that he wants to
be the sole decision-maker and that might not be the case as long
as Donnie Walsh is still there and the owners are actively
involved. Bird may simply go back to Naples, Fla., and wait to see
whether his investor group can persuade Paul Gaston to sell the
Celtics . . . Jerry Stackhouse went on ESPN Friday and said he
thought Grant Hill's chances of returning to Detroit were 70-30. At
the same time, Stackhouse said if Hill did bolt Motown, the Pistons
might be able to find two players who would make them better while
Stackhouse himself would become the man. ``It would be a great
opportunity for myself,'' he told Gary Miller on ``Up Close.''
``But we need more than one player, more than two players.'' When
Miller mentioned Glenn Robinson as a possibility, Stackhouse's eyes
lit up. ``I'd love to play with the Big Dog. Any time of the day,''
he said. When the Pistons were bounced from the playoffs,
Stackhouse said he thought the team needed a true center and a
point guard. Asked how incumbent point guard Lindsey Hunter might
have taken those remarks, Stackhouse did not back off. ``Lindsey's
more of a shooter who looks to score,'' Stackhouse said. ``We need
more of a distributor, someone to get us the ball.'' As for the
next Pistons coach, Stackhouse gave his blessing to George Irvine:
``We already have a rapport with him.'' . . . Speaking of coaches,
the Grizzlies settled on Sidney Lowe, who must have had a great
interview because his resume isn't exactly dazzling. In Lowe's
defense, he coached a bad (as in pre-Garnett) Timberwolves team (he
replaced the fired Jimmy Rodgers) and was 33-102 over 1 1/2 years.
He is a Timberwolf original, starting as a player for the late Bill
Musselman and then becoming a broadcaster and an assistant coach in
two separate stints, including last season under Flip Saunders. He
also was an assistant under Mike Fratello for five years in
Cleveland. But is he an improvement over the dismissed Lionel
Hollins, who at least had the support of many of the key Vancouver
players? Don't be surprised if Lowe lasts a couple years and
basketball boss Dick Versace moves into the coaching position
when/if the team improves. By that time, it also could be headed to
any number of new locales, none of them in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hornets stirring
</P>
<P>
   The clock is ticking in Charlotte and it's not at the pace that
the Hornets want. Ray Wooldridge, the executive trying to get a new
arena built, had hoped to have some idea of his chances by the end
of this month. But the people who make those decisions in Charlotte
told him he'd be lucky to get anything by the end of July, or one
month into free agency. With Eddie Jones considering a move, that
is not good news for the Hornets because it will be hard to
guarantee they won't be moving if the arena falls through. Teams
can start courting free agents as of July 1 . . . The Magic, who
have three lottery picks, reportedly have offered two of them (Nos.
5 and 10) to the Nets for the first pick. Maybe that's why Orlando
coach Doc Rivers and possible No. 1 pick Kenyon Martin were seen
together at an Orlando Miracle WNBA game this past week. But the
Nets may want to hold on to the pick if for no other reason than to
see what it will fetch. It's also a valuable chip for a team
looking to rebound with a new coach and management team . . .
Speaking of the Nets, you will hear Lenny Wilkens's name mentioned
there because of his longstanding relationship with Thorn. The two
go back more than 30 years and Thorn once was an assistant under
Wilkens in Seattle in the early 1970s. That happens also to be the
decade in which Wilkens last won a meaningful playoff series . . .
You have to wonder why the Celtics, as well as a lot of other
teams, are so ridiculously covert about whom they bring in for
predraft workouts. To divulge the identity of these lads might
actually give them some publicity at a time when they are off the
map. The idea that another team might ``find out'' whom they're
working out is ludicrous given that the first two questions a
player is asked are almost always, ``Where have you been?'' and
``Where are you going next?'' . . . Let me get this straight. John
MacLeod leaves the bench in Phoenix as an assistant to ``make
himself available'' as a head coach somewhere else? Seems to me he
could still have done that and stay where he was. More likely,
there probably was the realization on MacLeod's part that he
wouldn't be back as an assistant to Scott Skiles . . . Fox was the
subject of a Page 1 story this past week in the Wall Street
Journal. The piece focused on the extracurricular pursuits of the
Lakers, ranging from Fox's movie career to Shaq's forgettable
cinema history to Kobe Bryant's upcoming hip-hop CD. According to
the story, the current Laker roster has accumulated 17 film
credits, 50 television appearances, and four CDs. In addition,
Salley has hosted a show on the Fox Family Channel (that,
apparently, is not an oxymoron) and produced a film in which Jerry
Springer will appear . . . Just a name to think about as the NBA
draft approaches: Olumide Oyedji. He's a 6-foot-9-inch native of
Nigeria who played for Dirk Nowitzki's old team this past season in
Germany. He is an ath-a-lete. He was MVP of the German All-Star
Game and also won the slam dunk title. At 19, he's a work in
progress, but he has, as scouts love to say, a big upside . . .
Hubert Davis has opted out of his contract, which, given his
playing time in Dallas, might seem ill-advised. But coach-for-life
Don Nelson said he not only wants Davis back, but that he
encouraged him to opt out because he felt Davis was underpaid.
That, apparently, no longer is a problem with moneybags Mark Cuban
writing the checks.

DRAFT NOT PAYING OFF FOR POOR TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The purpose of the amateur draft is simple: to give bad teams a
chance to get better. The problem is, it simply doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of baseball's economics is that, as a general rule,
bad teams are bad because they don't have the money to spend on
talent. In other words, they are small-market teams.
</P>
<P>
   These days, that also means they don't have the money to spend
on huge signing bonuses for first-round draft picks. Consequently,
some clubs at the top of the First-Year Player Draft _ which begins
tomorrow _ don't take players according to talent; they take them
according to affordability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us up there at the top of the draft _ and we've been
up there too many years _ sometimes don't have the ability to pick
the guys we'd like to pick,'' Twins general manager Terry Ryan
said. ``Draft day ought to be an exciting day for the whole
organization. But when you have players you say you can't take
because of the money, I think that's bad for the industry. The bad
clubs ought to get the good players. And that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to happen that way. In 1987, the Mariners chose Ken
Griffey Jr. with the first pick, and signed him for a $160,000
bonus. But last year's top choice, Josh Hamilton, cost Tampa Bay
$3.96 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Major League Baseball summoned scouting directors two
weeks ago for what they called ``negotiating training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a meeting to remind people that signing bonuses have
been out of control for the last `x' number of years,'' Major
League Baseball executive vice president Sandy Alderson said.
``Given the system we have, there's really no reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The system seemingly gives the players little leverage. If they
don't sign, they can't re-enter the draft for another year.
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago, J.D. Drew became a rich man despite the
system. He was drafted by the Phillies with the second overall
selection, but didn't sign. After playing in an independent league
for a year he was back in the draft, and was taken fifth overall by
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Drew had no leverage, the Cardinals gave him a $8.5
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Those kind of stories have baseball officials contemplating a
change to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to a point where you'd like to see some kind of salary
scale for younger players, or some kind of restructuring of the
draft to give those lesser clubs or smaller-market clubs some
advantage,'' Rangers GM Doug Melvin said. ``But as the bonuses go
higher, they're all of a sudden losing the advantage the draft had
given them in previous years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even clubs that can afford big bonuses don't always get value
for their money. The Rangers gave 1995 first-round pick Jonathan
Johnson a $1.1 million signing bonus. Mike Lamb, their
seventh-round pick in '97, got $50,000. Johnson remains in the
minors, while Lamb is the starting third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, something's got to be done because there's just too
big of a gap between signing bonuses of players when there's not
that big of a gap between the player talents,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   One solution that has been discussed is an NBA-style salary cap.
But for the present, the small-market teams will have to draft
according to signability instead of talent.
Tim Johnson John Rocker leaves after walking the three batters he
faced in the in the ninth inning last weekend against Houston.
Rocker: from out of control to losing his control The Braves once
had a dominating closer with an outstanding fastball, a guy who
looked like he could rack up 30-save seasons for years to come. But
suddenly, Mark Wohlers couldn't throw strikes. Two years later,
he's attempting a comeback in the low minors with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   History could be repeating itself with John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Tuesday's game against the Cubs with a 5-2 lead in
the ninth, but couldn't finish it. He was pulled after walking two
and giving up a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, he faced the Yankees with an 11-7 lead in the ninth
and loaded the bases, hitting a batter and walking two, before
getting out of the inning, barely, when Shane Spencer flew out to
the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The walks yesterday were the 14th and 15th he has issued in his
past 91/3 innings. He has walked 25 in 171/3 innings this season;
he walked 37 in 721/3 innings last year.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Javy Lopez suggested that the pressure from fans, media
and players because of Rocker's controversial off-season remarks
and subsequent suspension is getting to him.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Leo Mazzone said part of Rocker's problem is
mechanical, and he plans to work with Rocker on keeping his head up
and watching the ball into the catcher's mitt.
</P>
<P>
   But Mazzone conceded the bigger problem is mental. Mazzone has
talked with Rocker about focusing solely on the catcher's mitt and
not allowing fans or opposing players to disturb his focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concentration is the word used in this case,'' Mazzone said.
``I want him to make sure the only thing he sees is the catcher's
target. Closers have a history of going through periods like this,
especially if you're a power guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the present, Rocker remains the closer. But if he continues
to have trouble throwing strikes, Mike Remlinger or Kerry
Ligtenberg could take over.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops
\Nsubheds:Voice of common sense Hard-headed, greedy owners and
union officials might accomplish something that pitchers seem
unable to do: stop Mark McGwire's pursuit of the career home-run
record. McGwire is threatening to retire if there is a work
stoppage after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a lockout or strike after next year, you won't see
me in uniform as a player ever again,'' McGwire said. ``I will walk
away. I don't care to go through that again. What we did to the
game in 1994 was absolutely horrendous. To do that to the game
again, I would be embarrassed. I would think the other players
think that way. I hope the owners think the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it. There is nothing going wrong with the game of
baseball. The owners are making money. The players are making
money. Listen. This is the greatest game of all time. Look at the
new stadiums. Look at the attendance. The bottom line is, it's
common sense. Life is common sense. But do a lot of people use
common sense? No. That's where the game has been embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is too good for two parties to ruin it.''
\Nsubheds:Weird stat of the week Four triple plays were turned in
the major leagues last year, three in the National League and one
in the American League. There have been four already this season,
including two last week.
</P>
<P>
   The latest came Wednesday, in a matchup between the best pitcher
and best slugger in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was up with the bases loaded and no one out against the
Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson. McGwire hit a fly to shallow center.
Steve Finley threw home to easily nail Placido Polanco. After
making the tag, catcher Damian Miller threw to third to get Edgar
Renteria, who was trying to move up on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of my head, standing on the mound, I was thinking
if I got McGwire to hit into a triple play, I'd be all right,''
Johnson said. ``That was the critical point of the game. I've only
seen those on highlight films.'' \Nsubheds:Something's rotten in
Montreal The only thing that seemingly could save baseball in
Montreal was a new ballpark, which was supposed to be ready for the
2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   However, problems between owner Jeffrey Loria and some of his
partners could spell doom for both the ballpark and the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary plans called for a open-air stadium that would cost
about $200 million. But now, Loria reportedly wants a covered, or
partially covered, stadium that would cost as much as $270 million.
</P>
<P>
   Loria wants his partners to pay the difference, and the partners
are balking.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the first-year owner contend his plan when he
purchased the team was to move it, and this is a way of forcing
that to happen. \Nsubheds:As good as advertised The Red Sox-Yankees
game in New York last Sunday had all the makings of a classic. Two
bitter rivals playing before 55,000 at Yankee Stadium, nationally
televised on ESPN, and with Cy Young Award winners Pedro Martinez
and Roger Clemens on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The game lived up to the hype. Both pitchers took shutouts into
the ninth inning before Boston's Trot Nixon broke up the duel with
a two-out, two-run homer off Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez finished with a four-hit shutout, one walk and nine
strikeouts. Clemens allowed five hits, walked none and struck out
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love baseball, you had to love that game _ both
sides,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ``I don't think it
gets any better, especially in this era of the home run. You see
two guys like that out there, full house, national TV ... pretty
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's game-winning homer came eight innings after Clemens
struck him out with a fastball on the outside corner. When Nixon
questioned the call briefly with home-plate umpire Ed Rapuano,
Clemens shouted at Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he wanted to go ahead and let me know it was a
strike,'' Nixon said. ``I guess you could call it a lack of respect
for me. I respect that guy as a pitcher, but that fired me up as
much as anything.''
\Nsubheds:Around the NL Everman High School graduate Ellis Burks
has homered in 35 ballparks after going deep in Pacific Bell Park
on Wednesday. Mark McGwire and Fred McGriff are tied for the
all-time lead with 36 each. Burks has a chance to tie them when the
Giants visit Enron Field in Houston on June 23-25. Reds first
baseman Sean Casey looked like a rising superstar when he hit .332
with 25 homers, 42 doubles and 99 runs batted in last year, his
first full season in the majors. But, entering last night, he's
batting only .230 with two homers and 11 RBI. ``I'm out there
battling, and I'm going to keep battling,'' Casey said. ``I'm going
to have a great season. That's the bottom line. That's the way I
feel. You go through little ruts like this.'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker wasn't happy when Rockies first baseman Todd Helton hit two
homers Monday, including the game-winner in the eighth inning.
``That was the whole idea, not throw him any strikes,'' Dierker
said. ``We couldn't be any more explicit. But we throw it right
down the middle. Twice. It would be one thing if Larry Walker was
hitting behind him. But they don't really have anybody behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Helton walked with the bases loaded in the eighth
inning, forcing in the winning run. ``I didn't want to walk him
with the bases loaded, but one run is less than we would've done if
we threw him one down the middle,'' Dierker said. The Phillies felt
good about their chances this season because they had three
pitchers in their starting rotation who were on the All-Star team
last season. But the trio of Curt Schilling, Andy Ashby and Paul
Byrd were a combined 4-14 with a 6.57 earned-run average going into
Schilling's start last night. Dodgers reliever Jeff Shaw, who has a
sore right shoulder, lost his role as closer after allowing three
runs without retiring a batter in a 10-5 loss to the Mets on
Tuesday. Shaw has 11 saves but has blown five chances. He is 2-3
with an ERA of 7.84 and an opponent's batting average of .316.
Manager Davey Johnson said he'll use a committee of Terry Adams,
Mike Fetters and Antonio Osuna until Shaw gets it together. The
Cubs' attempt to improve their existing nucleus by trading for
Ismael Valdes, Eric Young and Damon Buford and signing Ricky
Gutierrez in the off-season didn't work. Instead of a contender,
they have an aging team with a poor record. It's almost time to
blow it up and start over. ``Everybody wants to win, but eventually
this team might have to be restructured,'' manager Don Baylor said.
``We haven't gotten there yet, but you have to think about the
future of this club.'' After striking out 10 batters in 72/3
innings against the Cardinals on Wednesday, Diamondbacks ace Randy
Johnson is on pace to fan 382 batters. The major-league record is
383 by Nolan Ryan in 1973. The NL record is 382 by Sandy Koufax in
'65. Rockies third baseman Jeff Cirillo's average dropped from .371
to below .320 this week, and he blames the slump, in part, on
ongoing discussions about a four-year contract extension. ``It is a
distraction, and it is getting done,'' he said. Now that the Mets'
Mike Hampton is pitching well again, he has become the biggest
double threat in the game. He's batting .321 and hits well enough
that Diamondbacks scouts recently prepared a report on him. ``I
can't remember the last time we spent so much time talking about
how to pitch to the other pitcher,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter
said.
\Nsubheds:Around the AL Even though the White Sox took two out of
three from Cleveland last weekend to remain in first in the
Central, Indians manager Charlie Manuel was unimpressed. ``Are they
improved? Yeah,'' he said. ``But I think we're the stronger team on
the field.'' Cal Ripken hit his 10th home run of the season on
Tuesday night, the first time the Orioles third baseman has reached
10 homers in May since he had 12 before June 1 in 1991. That was
the year he won his second MVP award. The White Sox averaged 4.3
runs in May after averaging 7.2 runs per game in April. They batted
.304 as a team in April but only .236 in May. ``The league has made
some adjustments to us,'' manager Jerry Manuel said. ``People find
ways to pitch to you. As a young club, you can talk about
adjustments, but we have to make adjustments. We just have to
readjust.'' When Orioles reliever Buddy Groom surrendered a two-run
homer to Fred McGriff in the eighth inning of a 4-3 loss to Tampa
Bay on Wednesday _ the 14th blown save by the bullpen _ it
continued a season of frustration for Mike Mussina. Mussina dropped
his ERA to 3.92 by allowing only two runs in seven innings, but
remains 2-6. The Orioles haven't scored more than five runs in any
of his 12 starts and have scored three or fewer in six of them.
``I've probably pitched well enough to win seven games,'' he said.
``If you really take away my wins and losses, most of my numbers
are identical to last year. One year, I'm 7-2; the other, I'm
2-6.'' With John Valentin out for the season and perhaps his career
because of a catastrophic knee injury, Wilton Veras will get the
bulk of the playing time at third base for the Red Sox. Valentin
was a postseason hero last year, but the Sox have survived without
him in the regular season before. Entering last night, the Sox were
34-19 in the past 53 games started by Veras. Ten Indians have
suffered injuries since May 18, seven of which required trips to
the disabled list. ``That MRI might be a good stock to check out,''
Charlie Manuel said. Tigers reliever Doug Brocail allowed five runs
(four earned) while not retiring a batter in an 8-2 loss to the
Blue Jays last weekend. The next day he pitched 12/3 scoreless
innings and was the winning pitcher in a 4-3 victory. ``That's the
way it goes for those late-inning guys, either the outhouse or the
castle,` manager Phil Garner said. Replied Brocail: ``It's tough to
sleep in the outhouse. I prefer the castle.` David Cone is having a
horrible season. The erstwhile Yankees ace fell to 1-5 with a 6.24
ERA after giving up six earned runs in 31/3 innings against the A's
on Wednesday. Cone's velocity has declined the past few seasons,
but he got by with a good slider and with guile. Even that is
failing him now. ``David couldn't throw a strike,'' catcher Jorge
Posada said. ``He tried everything.'' White Sox starter James
Baldwin improved to 15-1 in domes when he beat the Mariners with
the Safeco Field roof closed Tuesday. ``I can't explain it,'' he
said. Randy Velarde's unassisted triple play against the Yankees on
Monday was only the 10th in a regular-season game in big-league
history, but the second of his career. The A's second baseman once
did it in spring training while playing for the Yankees.
\Nsubheds:The week ahead The first round of interleague play
includes two of the best matchups, with the Mets and Yankees and
Cubs and White Sox playing for bragging rights in their cities. The
Mets play in Yankee Stadium and the Cubs at Comiskey Park next
weekend.
\Nsubheds:The last word ``At first I thought it was one out, then
it was like, `Oh gosh.' That's just great, great. It's something to
be proud of.'' _ Yankees outfielder Shane Spencer after hitting
into an unassisted triple play

PALMDALE'S HARRINGTON HIGHLY PRIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ Sometime early Monday, the news will become
official and Matt Harrington will know for sure he's a soon-to-be
multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Most other 18-year-olds, you would figure, would be waiting by
the phone. Not him.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, of Palmdale High, is the No. 1 prospect in Monday's
major-league draft, according to Baseball Weekly, and No. 2 in
Baseball America. He has a 98 mph fastball and an assortment of
breaking pitches that zoom in at various unhittable angles.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes to plan, he'll get that phone call and sign for a
bonus perhaps as large as $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   And precisely because Harrington isn't like most kids, he'll be
in third-period civics class, maybe fourth-period geometry, when
the call comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking forward to this forever, but I have to be in
school,'' Harrington said. ``The truth is, I'm not nervous at all.
I'm excited, I'm anticipating what's going to happen, but I'm not
nervous because there's nothing to be nervous about - it's out of
my control.''
</P>
<P>
   That maturity comes from Harrington's parents, Bill and Sue, who
say all they've ever wanted was for Matt to have as much poise in
real life as he does on the pitching mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say Matt's a very mature person,'' Sue said. ``The
people closest to him mean everything to him. He's always gone out
of his way to be kind and loyal. I think it goes without saying
we're very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, a right-hander, was always a prospect based on his
fastball velocity and the fact he is 6-foot-4. However, injuries
interfered with his performances in 10th and 11th grades, and it
wasn't until this season that he proved utterly dominating.
</P>
<P>
   He led regional large-school pitchers in victories (11-0), ERA
(0.53) and strikeouts (125 in just 65 innings), carrying underdog
Palmdale to the Golden League championship and the second round of
the Division II playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a routine where Matt would pitch every Friday and I
always knew we were going to win the game,'' coach Lance Pierson
said. ``As a coach, that was a very comforting feeling having Matt
Harrington on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   There were instances, Pierson admits, when he genuinely felt
sorry for opposing hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been 15 times this season when guys went up
there against Matt and simply took three straight called strikes,''
Pierson said. ``They just shrugged and walked back to the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Highland, Palmdale's main rival, went 0-2 against Harrington,
averaging two runs against him and almost 10 runs against its other
25 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Harrington was a guaranteed win for them,'' Highland
coach Mike Van Cheri said. ``He just outclassed everybody. When
you've got the kind of stuff Matt Harrington has, you overmatch any
high school team. I've been coaching 15 years and he's absolutely
the best I've ever seen, no doubt about it. He's just leaps and
bounds ahead of everyone else and this year he just matured so much
on the mound. You couldn't rattle him. I really hope he's the No. 1
pick in the draft. He's earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Pierson is taking the day off to be with Harrington's
family when that phone call comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Matt's always been just Matt,'' Pierson said. ``But the
other day I got the new issue of Baseball America in the mail, and
there he was on the cover. That's when it really hit me for the
first time, how special he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Harrington says he'll never forget this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some games, it just felt like I was untouchable out there,
that I was throwing the ball right by every guy in the lineup,'' he
said. ``But even the times when I wasn't doing as well, I just
tried to go out there with that same attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a confident young man, but he feels no sense of
entitlement. He knows the road to the majors is long and filled
with curves, even for a bonus baby with commas in his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Is he really planning on waiting all the way until school's over
Monday before finding out what happened?
</P>
<P>
   He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well ... my last class is baseball. Since the season's already
over, maybe I will go home just a little bit early.''

BLAZERS: PRESSURE ON L.A., NOT US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They're enjoying all this, make no mistake. This
back-from-death's-door routine, this new-life-from-the-darkness
bit.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the Trail Blazers have risen to push the Lakers to
this unexpected edge, Portland is curious how L.A. will react to
now being the one at death's door.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, and maybe even eager. The Blazers can't help wondering,
even thinking, the Lakers might not handle the pressure as well as
they did in winning the last two games to force a decisive Game 7
in their Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they're a little bit of a fragile team,'' Blazers
forward Scottie Pippen said. ``They don't have the experience. They
don't truly believe in the triangle system. They've already talked
(about it). Once you catch guys like that, you tend to think things
are working in your favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Only six teams in NBA history have come back after trailing 3-1
in a best-of-seven series, and the Blazers believe they are now
poised to make it seven. And just maybe, the Lakers are starting to
feel the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the team that's had to win the last couple of games,''
Blazers forward Bonzi Wells said. ``Now we want to see how they
take the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers first stayed alive when they won their second
consecutive at Staples Center in Game 5 and then forced a final
game with their fairly easy 103-93 victory Friday in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two games we came out aggressive, took it right to
them and really never gave them a chance to get going on either end
of the floor,'' Portland guard Damon Stoudamire said. ``It will be
interesting to see how they respond, especially on their home
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen maintains the truth is the Blazers weren't really the
team under all that pressure - despite Lakers coach Phil Jackson's
comment the 3-1 deficit put them at death's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been under pressure,'' Pippen said. ``We've been in
the best position we could have been in. There's no pressure when
you're down 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is when you're up 3-1, trying to close a team
out. We're in a great position. We're in a position to beat this
team three times in a row. And we're up for the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who coached Pippen to six NBA titles while with the
Bulls, had been playing mind games with the shooting forward all
series. Jackson said it was up to Pippen to lead the Blazers and
said he should have been suspended for throwing a forearm at John
Salley's head in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Jackson was declaring the Lakers had to stop Pippen's
penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of it has come as a surprise to Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Phil has already told them, the only way you're going
to beat this team is to cut their heads off,'' Pippen said. ``They
feel like I'm the head, and they need to cut me off. That's his
philosophy and that's just how he's telling them to go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've tried it all series, and it hasn't worked. I'm sure
tomorrow they're going to try and come out and complete their
mission. But my mindset is just to go out and stay focused on what
I have to do in the game and allow the officials to take care of
all the rest of the stuff going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy would rather the Blazers didn't
concern themselves with anything the Lakers are feeling or even
consider they have an edge from already surviving two elimination
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think about it,'' he said. ``Don't worry about it.
That's not our problem. Our problem is staying alive tomorrow and
playing our game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get caught up in any other type of feelings but the
ones we've had these last two ballgames, with the same kind of
mindset, the same kind of determination.''
</P>
<P>
   The past two games, the Blazers have played like a team that has
figured the Lakers out. Their post players are killing the Lakers,
their outside shooters are hitting, their pick-and-roll with center
Arvydas Sabonis keeps burning Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, they've collapsed well on O'Neal and forced the
Lakers into an outside shooting game that has mostly failed.
</P>
<P>
   And they're promising to come aggressively again today.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, you don't want to come in and wait for their
punches,'' Blazer Steve Smith said. ``You want to come out throwing
punches. Like a boxing match, you'd rather throw punches and maybe
run out of gas instead of waiting and waiting, and then maybe it's
too late.''

PACERS SAVOR TITLE, BUT BEST SETS SIGHTS ON LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was only one problem when Travis Best was asked
about the upcoming NBA Finals and started talking about boyhood
memories of Larry Bird against the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers aren't facing Bird's Indiana Pacers just yet.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his Pacers teammates were measured in their
predictions Friday after winning the Eastern Conference title over
the New York Knicks, Best said he had no doubt they will face the
Lakers in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the thought reminded him of his youth in
Springfield, Mass., watching the NBA's top two teams, Bird's Boston
Celtics and the Lakers of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way Shaq is playing, with the way Kobe is playing and
the guys around them, that is the challenge,'' said Best, Indiana's
point guard. ``Not taking anything away from Portland. But if
you're going to win the championship, why not go through the best
team.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the league's best regular-season record, the Lakers
lost their Game 6 to the Trail Blazers and have blown a
three-games-to-one lead in the Western Conference finals. Game 7 is
this afternoon at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only the Pacers can celebrate. The postgame lockerroom
after Friday's 93-80 victory over the Knicks was bedlam. Indiana
never has been to the Finals, falling short several times despite
often-heroic efforts by veteran Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit has been given to Bird, who says he will step
down as coach despite a 147-67 record in three seasons on the job.
Bird won three NBA titles as a player and was the league's MVP for
three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But after a quiet series against the Knicks, Miller took over
the spotlight Friday night, scoring 17 of his game-high 34 points
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who refused to bite on the thought of a Pacers/Lakers
final despite growing up in Southern California and attending UCLA,
has played some of his greatest games in Madison Square Garden. But
his best work Friday might have been a pregame pep talk to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell by the look in his eyes before the game and
what he said, that he was going to be on,'' teammate Dale Davis
said. ``I definitely thought that he wasn't going to be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lakers-Pacers?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time to reflect on what we've done,'' Davis said.
``We'll have plenty of time to think about that in the days ahead.
There are a lot of guys who have been here a long time and known a
lot of pain. This is a proud moment for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lakers/Indiana matchup also would be of interest because
former Laker Sam Perkins now plays for the Pacers. Mark Jackson
also played one season in Los Angeles, although he did it with the
Clippers and left after demanding a trade.
</P>
<P>
   But Lakers-Pacers?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a difference,'' Jackson said. ``Either way it
is going to be a war.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Best to lend a Bird/Lakers showdown some historical
perspective and show that players can be fans, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember those games like they were yesterday,'' said Best,
who is in his fifth season from Georgia Tech. ``Those games were
intense. Everyone would get on the couch, and you couldn't help but
keep a ball in your hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtics were huge in Springfield, but they were only my
third favorite team. Larry was everything, but my favorite teams
were Philly and the Lakers. James Worthy? That was my guy. And
Magic? Every game was so hard. Larry has brought that to this team.
It is going to be an incredible series.''

`60 MINUTES' PRODUCER AIMS BITTER BLAST AT EX-COLLEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The simmering five-year debate over the way ``60
Minutes'' handled a controversial report about the tobacco industry
heated up again on Saturday as the show's executive producer
attacked Lowell Bergman, a former ``60 Minutes'' producer and
longtime investigative reporter, in a speech to more than 1,000
journalists in New York. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt, the executive producer, said that Bergman should not
be allowed ``within a hundred miles of a newsroom.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hewitt opened the floor to questions, supporters of Bergman
responded angrily to Hewitt's comments, sparking a spirited debate
that continued after the speech. Matters came to a head when David
Fanning, a friend of Bergman, confronted Hewitt and Mike Wallace,
the ``60 Minutes'' correspondent, as a thick crowd knotted around
the men.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning argued that Bergman should have been given a chance to
respond to Hewitt's comments, especially since they came at the
annual meeting of Investigative Reporters and Editors, an
organization to which Bergman has belonged essentially since its
inception in 1975. After several minutes of debate, Wallace and
Hewitt broke off from Fanning and left.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's criticism stems from the way he and Wallace were
portrayed in ``The Insider,'' a 1999 movie about the way the CBS
program handled the report on the tobacco industry in 1995. Bergman
consulted on the film, which cast him as a principled reporter who
eventually quit his job over CBS's handling of the report, while
portraying Hewitt as more concerned with CBS's stock price than the
truth. Bergman has been a respected investigative reporter for a
generation, and is a contract freelancer and consultant for The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy highlights the potential for corporate
censorship in journalism at a time when a handful of major media
companies control much of what is seen and heard by consumers, as
well as the responsibility that reporters have when Hollywood
fictionalizes their stories.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Hewitt said that
``The Insider'' portrayed him dishonestly and that Bergman had a
responsibility to make sure that the story the movie told was
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said he had stood up to his bosses at CBS for the report,
and that it would only have been broadcast in the form Bergman
preferred if Hewitt and Wallace had hired ``a band of guerrillas''
to take over a CBS television station and broadcast the report
themselves. By turning himself into a hero and portraying Hewitt as
a toady, Bergman lied, destroying his credibility as a journalist,
Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home in Berkeley, Calif., Bergman said he did not
have control of ``The Insider,'' but he said he believed Hewitt had
``gotten off lightly'' in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman said he believed self-censorship and advertiser pressure
on television news is a serious and growing problem, but said that
fact did not excuse Hewitt's actions on the tobacco industry
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he couldn't have'' gotten the story to run, Bergman said
of Hewitt, but ``he didn't try.''

   &QL; 
WAGE _ Starting pay for most entry-level positions in Arizona, such
as customer service representatives, nurses assistants and office
clerks, is $10 an hour, according to Arizona companies. That's well
above the national minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, evenwell above
the higher minimum wage of $6.15 an hour being proposed by
President Clinton. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TRASH _ In this booming economy, we are buying and replacing and
throwing away like never before. Nationally, people bought 40
percent more stuff _ cars, armchairs, toasters and computers _ last
year than four years ago, the U.S. Department of Commerce says. And
in the Phoenix metro area, where there are few basements and fewer
attics, we must confront our stuff. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WASTE-MINING _ Because of hard-rock mine waste, Arizona has had
more toxic releases than any state but Nevada. The numbers,
recently released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
suggest that the decades of prosperity generated by hardrock mining
in Arizona have come at a price. How big a price is in dispute
between industry and environmentalists. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN _ (Phoenix) _ A young mother, much like the young
mother of ElianGonzalez, gave up her life last week during a brave
but foolish attempt to bring her child into this country, and from
the politicians we hear nothing. They speak with misty affection
about how Elian's mother sacrificed her life to provide a better
future for her child. It's exactly what this other mother did, and
still they say nothing. Because she didn't come from Cuba. She came
from Mexico. By EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''
categories. &QL;

NEW&AMP;NOTABLE (undated) _ Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new
books. By ANNE STEPHENSON. Story will move in the ``E'' and ``L''
categories. &QL;

TV-GOODY-SEX (Undated) - There is TV for chicks that serves as an

LEFT FIELD FOR DODGERS, ANGELS MIGHTY FINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ I whiled away the early innings of a quiet
Saturday-afternoon cross-towner at Edison Field playing Jimmy the
Greek with the lineups.
</P>
<P>
   I penciled check marks on the Los Angeles Dodgers' half of the
scorecard next to the positions where they have the edge - second
base, shortstop, right field, catcher, bench and starting pitching
- and on the Anaheim Angels' side where they're stronger - first,
third, center, bullpen and team speed. A small check for
``intangibles'' went to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Left field became a very pleasant problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield or Darin Erstad? Darin Erstad or Gary Sheffield?
Which would you rather have? Could you go wrong either way?
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-area teams haven't enjoyed two players this good
at the same position at the same time since Rod Carew of the Angels
and Steve Garvey of the Dodgers were holding down first base jobs
circa 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'd get much argument from whoever picked
second,'' said Angels manager Mike Scioscia, imagining a two-player
draft. ``The answer is that Erstad is the perfect fit for this
club, and Sheffield is the perfect fit for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need Sheffield in the middle of the lineup. I need Erstad
at the top of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, their dissimilar skills were displayed for 34,580 fans
at the season's second clash of the Dodgers and Angels, and
Sheffield got the edge.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his 16th and 17th home runs, driving in four runs, and
added a sharp single and run scored as the Dodgers beat Brian
Cooper and the Angels 8-3. Erstad settled for three singles and an
RBI in five at-bats, raising his American League-leading average to
.377.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield pulled a shoulder-high fastball into the left-field
foul pole to make it 3-0 before Cooper retired a batter, and drove
a hanger 425 feet to straightaway left to make it 5-0 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who doesn't have Sheffield's power, showed his speed,
collecting his third hit by beating out a bouncer to first baseman
Eric Karros in the eighth inning. When's the last time you saw a
leg single to first?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, baseball players at the same position never actually
duel. Hitters and pitchers duel.
</P>
<P>
   One left fielder might watch the other with slightly keener
interest. But it's unlikely Sheffield and Erstad have even thought
about how special it is to have players of such class sharing a
corner of the local ballfields.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to fans - and daydreaming club officials - to think
about which they'd choose.
</P>
<P>
   Angels officials make the case that Erstad is younger (he turns
26 today), is more versatile (Scioscia bats him leadoff but could
as easily slot him third), and is too intense to let down when the
rest of the team is going flat.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Sheffield (32) is any less of a gamer. He plays hurt,
as he did during the Florida Marlins' World Series championship run
in 1997, Sheffield's only sub-.300 season in the past five, and
when he's healthy he's the kind of big hitter who'll carry a team.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't healthy Saturday and he carried a team anyway.
Sheffield sprained his right ankle for the third time this season
with an awkward slide at Dodger Stadium on May 22 and still feels
the effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not near 100 percent,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``But I'll take him however he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said he was sore after going 2 for 5 - matching Erstad
swing for swing - in the Angels' 12-5 victory Friday night. So he
switched to rubber spikes Saturday. Improvement noted.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of the way through the season, he's on a pace
for 50-plus homers and 140 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in the middle of the lineup have to pick it up a
notch with some guys (injured),'' Sheffield said. ``We have to make
a difference in the ballgame every time we come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield made a difference in the second interleague game of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And, for now, it's the difference between two outstanding left
fielders brought together in time and space. Saturday the edge went
to Sheffield. But I'll be checking again today.

METS BEAT TAMPA, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is amazing, Al Leiter said after his last start, the way one
bad pitch can turn a good game into a bad one. That day, his bad
pitch turned into a grand slam by the Dodgers' Shawn Green, and the
Mets lost for the first time this season with Leiter pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter made several bad pitches against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
Saturday night, but none of them hurt. He allowed five walks, his
most in any start since last August, and the Devil Rays had a
runner in scoring position in five of his seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter was tough when it mattered most, and he shut out the
Devil Rays for six and two-thirds innings on the way to a 1-0
victory. Dennis Cook, John Franco and Armando Benitez preserved the
shutout as the Mets won for the 11th time in their last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays were hitless in six at-bats against Leiter with
runners in scoring position; three times, he retired the former
All-Star Vinny Castilla to end an inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Leiter allowed a single to pitcher Steve
Trachsel, the leadoff hitter. After two outs, he walked Greg Vaughn
for the fourth time, this time on four pitches, and Cook came in to
retire Fred McGriff on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter allowed only four hits _ all singles _ and had eight
strikeouts. He improved his record to 6-1 and his earned run
average to 3.23.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel, meanwhile, continued a quirky trend by pitching
heroically against a top starter. The right-hander has beaten some
of the American League's best pitchers _ Pedro Martinez, Orlando
Hernandez and Brad Radke _ but entered the game with a 3-5 record
and a 5.54 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Leiter, whose first nine starts were Mets victories,
Trachsel was stingy, allowing only six hits over seven innings.
After giving up a leadoff double to Matt Franco in the third _
Franco's first extra-base hit of the year _ Trachsel left him
stranded, striking out Leiter, who was trying to bunt, retiring
Melvin Mora on a flyout and freezing Derek Bell on a third-strike
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel did his job again in the fourth, but Vaughn didn't do
his. After permitting a leadoff double to Edgardo Alfonzo, Trachsel
got two ground-ball outs. Then Todd Zeile lofted a high pop to
left. With a slight wind blowing, Vaughn tried in vain to follow
the ball's flight, roaming around the warning track before seeing
the ball skim off the wall. Zeile got a double and the Mets had a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's game was the Mets' 55th; after 55 games last
year, General Manager Steve Phillips fired three coaches, and Bobby
Valentine suggested he should no longer be the manager if the team
did not improve over the next 55. The team did improve, of course,
and Valentine stayed.
</P>
<P>
   In their 55th game last season, the Mets' lineup included only
three players who are currently active with the club. Rickey
Henderson and John Olerud now play for Seattle, Roger Cedeno for
Houston and a trimmer Bobby Bonilla for Atlanta. Brian McRae is
retired and shortstop Rey Ordonez is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's team was 27-28 after 55 games; this year's team is
31-24. Valentine brushes off comparisons, believing them unfair to
players and, probably, irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But this team is playing better, and there is more stability in
the starting rotation, with four of the Mets' five starters turning
in solid performances with relative consistency. The bullpen has
not been dominant, but it is again a strength. The lineup and bench
are works in progress. Valentine is constantly tweaking with the
parts Phillips gives him.
</P>
<P>
   Mora has batted leadoff in all four games since returning from
the disabled list, but Valentine has not committed to any leadoff
man since the release of Henderson in mid-May. He said Saturday
that he used the process of elimination based on who else was
playing; the only two players on the roster he has used there on
consecutive days are Mora and Joe McEwing.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Ordonez, the Mets essentially have five
everyday players and three positions where the starters can change
daily, which can sometimes be confusing. The nameplates in the
lineup posted in the clubhouse do not include positions, and when
Matt Franco saw his name in the lineup Saturday afternoon, he was
not sure where he was playing _ it was left field, his first start
there this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been carried by a few players _ Mike Piazza and
Alfonzo most prominent among them _ and the bench could become a
concern if it continues to struggle. Darryl Hamilton, the starting
center fielder, and Ordonez are not expected back until around the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips shook up the mix this weekend by adding the left-handed
hitters Lenny Harris, who joined the team Saturday, and Ryan
McGuire, and designating for assignment Jon Nunnally, who had 26
strikeouts in 74 at-bats. Catcher Vance Wilson was optioned to
Norfolk to make room for Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a contact guy, not a high-walk guy, but he puts it in
play,'' Phillips said of Harris, acquired from Arizona for Bill
Pulsipher.

DEVILS BEAT STARS, 2-1. 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Devils were a good road team in the first three
rounds of these Stanley Cup playoffs and they continued the trend
Saturday night in Game 3 of finals against the Dallas Stars. After
splitting the first two games back home at Continental Arena, the
Devils took a 2-1 victory over the defending champions Saturday
night on the slushy ice of Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best game so far in the series, and it improved the
Devils' road record to 8-2 in the postseason. Leading by two games
to one in the four-of-seven-game final round, which resumes here on
Monday night, the Devils are two games away from winning their
second Stanley Cup championship. They won their first in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The game began at a fast pace, with both teams aggressively
pushing the tempo. The first period, which ended in a 1-1 tie, was
the best yet in this series. Scoring for Dallas on the power play
was Sylvain Cote. Scoring at even strength for the Devils was Jason
Arnott.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was just as intense, with little of the slow
and cautious strategy that marked the second game, a 2-1 Dallas
victory on Thursday night. The Devils got the only goal of the
period when Petr Sykora scored on the power play and gave his team
a 2-1 lead going into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Cote scored after intercepting a clearing pass by Scott Stevens,
the Devils' defenseman, who tried to move the puck out of danger
after goalie Martin Brodeur had made a save on Jere Lehtinen.
Brodeur was pulled to the right and Stevens was over him when Cote
sent the puck into the open net from the right-wing circle at 13
minutes 8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   That power play was the first of three consecutive penalties
against the Devils, two of which overlapped by 49 seconds. The
Devils killed off that two-man advantage and got the equalizer at
18:06 when Arnott broke clear, took a pass, split the defense, beat
goalie Eddie Belfour with a low shot and fell in celebration. Brian
Rafalski and Colin White got the assists.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden, the Devils' penalty killer, was asked in a
television interview at intermission if the special-teams
performance had inspired the Devils. ``I think so,'' he said. ``We
killed off a five-on-three situation. They had the momentum
going.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of action aside from the goals. The Devils'
Randy McKay sent Joe Nieuwendyk into the boards with a check that
left Nieuwendyk slow to get off the ice. Claude Lemieux of the
Devils, penalized for slashing earlier, took advantage of a shove
from Dallas defenseman Darryl Sydor to fall over Belfour while
charging the net for a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:27 of the second period, Sykora scored after taking a long
slap shot from the left side, near the blue line. The puck may have
deflected off the stick of Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher before
it glanced off Belfour's glove and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, much was made of the ice conditions. Late in
periods, the surface tends to get mushy and chippy here,
particularly in June with its high temperatures. Because the Stars
play here regularly and the Devils visited only once during the
regular season, this was thought to be an advantage for the home
team.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Coach Larry Robinson was not one to use that as a
preconceived explanation for whatever was to transpire later. When
asked how the ice was after Saturday morning's practice, he said:
``Ice is fine. It is frozen.''

WE'VE GOT WAY TOO MUCH STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Richard Buffington knows he has too much stuff. It's
piled in the two-car garage, the storage roomand the spare bedrooms
of the ranch house he and his wife have shared for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Seems his neighbors have the same problem. Recently, he put
castoffs on the curb that were too big for the trash can _ and the
pile grew.
</P>
<P>
   `Someone else put their stuff there,` said Buffington, 66, a
retired dentist, looking over the mound. `See that light fixture?
And there was even some kind of toy. That's not even ours.`
</P>
<P>
   Like Buffington's heap, the evidence is mounting: We have too
much stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In this booming economy, we are buying and replacing and
throwing away like never before. Nationally, people bought 40
percent more stuff _ cars, armchairs, toasters and computers _ last
year than four years ago,the U.S. Department of Commerce says.
</P>
<P>
   And in this Phoenix area of few basements and fewer attics, we
must confront our stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill donations are up 40 percent nationally in the past five
years. At least half of all new homes built in the Phoenix area
have three-car garages, while most people only have two cars.
Storage companies boast of doubling business in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   You can even buy more stuff _ books, even a new magazine _
telling you how to get rid of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But the most obvious sign of our overstuffed society may be our
own front yards. Simply look at the curbs on the day the city hauls
away bulk trash. Note the ugly sofa Goodwill won't take, the old
swamp cooler and the patio chairs Dad meant to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix collectors picked up 90,000 tons of it, including the
usual palm fronds and lawn clippings, last year. That's a 50
percent increase from eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   `We've just got a lot of stuff,` says Dean Schwindt, operations
manager for Waste Management Inc., which picks up trash in north
Phoenix. `We see everything including the kitchen sink.`
</P>
<P>
   During the quarterly bulk trash pickup, going on now in Phoenix,
once-tidy neighborhoods turn junky. Everything that can be hidden,
squirreled away in a back closet, pushed to the back of the garage
or crammed into the shed is put in plain view. You can see a toilet
sitting in front of your neighbor's house. It's like showing your
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   A tan couch sits outside a brick bungalow in central Phoenix.
Beside it are twin mattresses, a busted playpen and a baby swing.
</P>
<P>
   David Hovorak, 19, is sweeping the patio outside the home,
finishing the cleanup. He surveys the pile, a little bigger than a
van.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm just glad it's not in the house,` he says.
</P>
<P>
   This is the stuff that even the Salvation Army doesn't want. But
more and more, it's dropped off anyway.
</P>
<P>
   `Someone will give us an old chair, and we can't take it. We
don't have time to upholster it,` says Maj. Barry Lucas of the
Salvation Army, who adds that donations are up 5 percent over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   `They'll say, `You can give it to a homeless person.' But whose
doorstep will it go on? You can't put it under a tree.`
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army spends about $10,000 a month getting rid of
unusable goods.
</P>
<P>
   But even as we crave simplicity, we make room for more. Many
times, stuff put out on the curb is picked through before it gets
to the landfill. Neighbors bet each other on how long it will take
for someone to take a broken ceiling fan or console television.
</P>
<P>
   `Aluminum chairs, they go fast,` Buffington says, adding that
even he, trying to streamline his own stuff, has eyed neighborhood
castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   `Like one time there were some nice couches on our street. I
wanted to put on a mask and go get them,` he says. `But my wife
wouldn't let me.`
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhoods near Central and Glendale avenues, sidewalk
shoppers nicknamed city goats prowl through the stuff, picking and
hauling away lamps, bikes or furniture before the city picks them
up.
</P>
<P>
   The city says the stuff still belongs to the property owners, so
people should ask before taking.

RED SOX COME UP EMPTY IN PHILADELPHIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Just a week ago, the Red Sox were making their
case that with Pedro Martinez, they feared no team, including the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Without Martinez, scratched from his start Saturday night
because of a sore muscle in his side, the Sox have lately been
propagating the notion they're no match for any team, including the
Phillies, who own the second-worst record in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who were 12 games over .500 May 19, were clobbered by
the Phillies, 9-3, which assured them of losing a series for the
fourth time in their last five sets. They've lost two out of the
three to the Tigers, Blue Jays, and Royals, and dropped their
second straight to Philadelphia in another of those interleague
exercises detested by manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who outhit the Sox, 10-3, were not ashamed to
admit they were happy to have dodged Martinez, who was not around
to put an end to a Sox losing streak that stands at four games,
matching their longest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro's the best pitcher in the world,'' said Phillies second
baseman Alex Arias, who messed with the Sox' travel plans from the
outset with a winning, 11th-inning pinch hit Friday night off John
Wasdin, who was shipped to Pawtucket the next afternoon. ``Any time
you don't have to face him, it's a good feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys you probably don't even watch the
video, because you've seen him so much on SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   By night's end, the Sox were still in first place, tied with the
Bombers, the only team they've beaten in a series the last two
weeks, but the record (29-22) was now just seven games above the
break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a well-pitched game, we need a clean game, get some
guys in scoring position and get some hits,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Those elements were absent Saturdy night. Tim Wakefield, the
knuckleballer working on a day's rest, would have been better off
staying in bed than in Veterans Stadium, where the Phillies
celebrated their liberation from Martinez by exploiting every quirk
in Wakefield's unpredictable repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies scored one run on an error by rookie third baseman
Wilton Veras, two more after a botched pitchout and a third-strike
passed ball, one on a home run by catcher Mike Lieberthal, another
on a sacrifice fly, and one more on a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I gave up only two hard-hit balls all night,'' said
Wakefield, who was taking the bullet for an overworked bullpen.
``The home run and the line drive by the pitcher (Randy Wolf). I
felt strong. I could have pitched some more, but the results didn't
dictate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Veras allowed Lieberthal's slow roller to pass through his legs
undisturbed in the first, the rookie's team-leading ninth error in
33 games and second costly miscue since John Valentin's
season-ending knee injury. It was the start of a dreadful night for
Veras, who went 0 for 4 and whiffed thrice, the last time on three
pitches in the eighth inning, when the Sox had scored once and
still had two men on base.
</P>
<P>
   Is the kid feeling the pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' Williams said. ``Not for me. I think he's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies put the game out of reach in the eighth inning,
when Lieberthal crushed a three-run home run off Rob Stanifer, the
reliever recalled Saturday from Pawtucket in place of Wasdin, who
apparently left his ``Way Back'' nickname behind. The home run was
the second of the game for Lieberthal, who drove in five runs, or
two more than Sox catcher Jason Varitek has knocked in since May 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not hitting at the right time, we're not pitching at the
right time,'' said Varitek, who was charged with two passed balls,
saw his throw go wide right on the pitchout attempt, and struck out
twice and popped out, leaving four runners on base. ``We were in a
situation where we had chances today, and I was one who didn't
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, who has 23 RBIs in his last 17 games, drove in two
runs. Nomar Garciaparra, who has 12 hits in 17 at-bats in his last
five games, knocked in the other with the 100th home run of his
career. Mike Stanley, who flied out twice and just missed a
three-run home run in the eighth when his drive down the left-field
line went foul, was the only other Sox starter to hit the ball out
of the infield. The Sox went down on strikes 11 times against the
lefthanded Wolf (9 whiffs) and reliever Chris Brock.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' frustration revealed itself on the final out. Darren
Lewis, who went hitless in five at-bats out of the leadoff hole,
flung his helmet at the feet of first base umpire Jim Joyce after
being called out on a borderline play. Joyce instantly ejected
Lewis, who had to be kept from the umpire by first base coach Tommy
Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game can turn this around real quick,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   For it to be quick, it will have to come from someone other than
Pedro.

WILLIAM E. SIMON, 72, EX-TREASURY SECRETARY AND HIGH-PROFILE
INVESTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William E. Simon, who directed the nation's energy policy and
served as treasury secretary in the dark economic days of the 1970s
and then proved to have a golden touch as an investor in the boom
days of the 1980s, died Saturday at Cottage Hospital in Santa
Barbara, Calif. He was 72 and lived in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from pulmonary fibrosis, a
lung disease that he had been fighting for more than a year, said
James Piereson, executive director of the John M. Olin Foundation
in New York, where Simon was president.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative Republican, Simon left a successful Wall Street
career as a bond trader in 1973 to join Richard Nixon's
administration as deputy Treasury secretary. He went on to become
director of the Federal Energy Office _ or ``energy czar,'' as he
was known _ later that year when the economy reeled in the wake of
the Arab oil embargo, and in April 1974 he was named Treasury
secretary, a post he retained when Gerald Ford succeeded Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office at the end of the Ford administration,
Simon returned to Wall Street, where he became emblematic of a
breed of aggressive investor. In 1982, Simon and a partner, Raymond
G. Chambers, paid $80.5 million, almost all of it borrowed, to
purchase Gibson Greetings, a card maker, in one of the first
high-profile leveraged buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months later, they sold the company in a public
offering to shareholders for $290 million, yielding Simon and
Chambers a profit of $70 million each and creating a mystique about
Simon's investing prowess that was only partly tarnished in recent
years by a string of disappointing deals.
</P>
<P>
   Simon also served as the U.S. Olympic Committee's treasurer from
1977 to 1980, and as its president for the subsequent four years,
playing important roles in the American decision to boycott the
1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, and in planning the 1984 games in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   William Edward Simon was born on Nov. 27, 1927, in Paterson,
N.J. His father was an insurance agent, and he lived a middle-class
life through the Depression. After graduating from high school in
1946, he served in the Army and then enrolled at Lafayette College,
in Easton, Pa., where he met Carol Girard. They were married in
1950.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Lafayette in 1952, he got a $75-a-week job
trading municipal bonds. By 1964, he was working at Salomon
Brothers, where he was known as a quick-tempered, outspoken and
very skilled bond trader. Within Salomon's aggressive culture, his
sometimes-abrasive personality was no drawback. By the early 1970s,
he was one of the firm's senior partners and was earning more than
$2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   On the recommendation of Attorney General John Mitchell, a
former Wall Street lawyer, Treasury Secretary George Shultz
recruited Simon as his deputy at the beginning of Nixon's second
term. Even as the Watergate scandal was beginning to envelop the
White House, Simon was enmeshed in another national crisis, the
embargo imposed by Arab oil producers on nations friendly to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1973, Simon was coordinating the administration's
efforts to encourage conservation and to allocate scarce supplies
of oil _ favoring factory production and home heating oil over
gasoline for motorists. It was a job that brought him criticism
from all sides, not least from consumers, who resented gasoline
shortages and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the guy that caused the lines at the gas stations,'' Simon
once said.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon seemed sufficiently thick skinned to cope and more
than willing to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become a nation of great energy wastrels,'' he said in
1973. He publicly chastised another administration official for
crossing him, saying the official should ``keep his cotton pickin'
hands off energy policy.'' He labeled statements by the shah of
Iran, then a key ally of the United States, ``irresponsible and
reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   By early 1974, the country was in a recession, and when Shultz
resigned as Treasury secretary, Nixon quickly named Simon to
replace him. Simon spent much of his time on international policy,
pressing Arab nations to reinvest the dollars they were reaping
through oil sales in the United States and creating an
international credit line for poor nations that had been hurt by
soaring energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   At home, with inflation rising, he counseled against deficit
spending to stimulate the economy, in keeping with his fiscal
conservatism. In 1975, he created a political firestorm when he
helped persuade Ford not to bail New York City out of its deep
financial crisis. He argued that coming to New York's aid would
encourage profligacy among other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then came the New York fiscal crisis, and I was Genghis
Khan,'' he recalled a dozen years later.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from bankers, who countered that if New York City
were to default on its debt, it could reverberate through markets
around the world, Simon and Ford ultimately agreed to aid the city.
</P>
<P>
   After Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976, Simon left Washington
and became a consultant to investment firms and businesses, as well
as becoming treasurer of the Olympic committee, for which he had
raised funds before entering government service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when Carter urged the committee to boycott the Moscow
Olympics that summer to protest the Soviet presence in Afghanistan,
most American amateur sports officials and athletes were opposed.
Simon's impassioned speech to the committee's house of delegates in
favor of the boycott swung the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, when Simon was elected president of the Olympic
committee by acclamation, the organization was $9 million in debt
and had to meet an $88 million budget for the next four years. The
boycott had hurt fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon turned potential doom into a financial bonanza by
having the Olympic committee become an equal partner with the Los
Angeles Olympic organizers. Despite a retaliatory boycott by the
Soviet Union and most of its allies, those Olympics earned $225
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic committee, with its 40 percent share and an
additional $35 million from the Olympic coin program, created the
U.S. Olympic Foundation as a permanent financial source for
American amateur sports. That became the major legacy of Simon's
era at the committee.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, Simon was building a fortune with his
investments in leveraged buyouts, of which the Gibson Greetings
deal was the best known. The company he operated in partnership
with Chambers, Wesray, bought undervalued companies with borrowed
money, whipped them into shape or waited until a willing buyer
appeared, and then sold them, often for hefty profits. By the late
1980s, Forbes magazine was estimating Simon's wealth at $300
million.
</P>
<P>
   But his partnership with Chambers came apart in 1986, as Simon
turned to building a network of financial institutions on the West
Coast and across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   He had some success purchasing banks and failed savings and loan
associations and reselling them, but he never approached his stated
goal of building a trans-Pacific merchant banking empire. In 1993,
federal regulators seized one of his properties, Western Federal
Savings and Loan, when it sank into insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Simon had dedicated more of his time to
philanthropy and charitable work. A Roman Catholic, he volunteered
to assist pilgrims to the shrine at Lourdes in France, worked with
AIDS patients in New York, and served communion to cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   He gradually turned much of the responsibility for his business
over to his two sons, William E. Simon Jr., and J. Peter Simon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Simon received the Blessed Hyacinth Cormier Award for
outstanding Catholic leadership, and in 1999, he was honored by the
Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's first wife, Carol, died in 1995. He is survived by his
second wife, Tonia Adams Donnelley, whom he married in 1996, and by
seven children from his first marriage. In addition to his two
sons, they are Mary Beth Simon Streep; Carol Leigh Simon Porges;
Aimee Simon Bloom; Julie Ann Simon Munro; and Johanna Katrina
Simon.

CONGRESSIONAL PANEL FAULTS U.S. EFFORT ON IRAN AND 1996 BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has not done enough to
press Iran for cooperation in the investigation of a 1996 bombing
that killed 19 U.S. servicemen, despite evidence of Iranian
involvement, a bipartisan commission on terrorism has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report to be released Monday, the National Commission
on Terrorism concludes that the administration has done little to
mount an international campaign to put diplomatic pressure on Iran
to cooperate in the investigation into the bombing of the Khobar
Towers complex in Saudi Arabia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, created by Congress, recommends that the United
States make no any further concessions to Iran as part of its
rapprochement with political reformers until Tehran cooperates
fully in the investigation and ends its support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. efforts to signal support for political reform in Iran
could be misinterpreted in Iran or by U.S. allies as signaling a
weakening resolve on counterterrorism,'' the commission's argues.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for the United States to create the kind of
international campaign against Iran that worked to a limited degree
with Libya, which was forced to hand over two intelligence officers
for trial in connection with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton sent a letter to the Iranian president,
Mohammed Khatami, asking for help in the Khobar Towers probe, and
senior U.S. officials publicly acknowledged that they have evidence
of Iranian involvement in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission concluded that the administration has not
acted aggressively enough on the case at a time when it is also
seeking a diplomatic opening with Tehran. Its report notes that
``the U.S. government has not sought similar multilateral action to
bring pressure on Iran to cooperate in the Khobar Towers bombing
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The report argues that Iran remains the ``clearest case'' of a
state sponsor of anti-American terrorism as an element of its
government's policy.
</P>
<P>
   In response, an administration official denied that the United
States has failed to seek international support for its efforts to
gain Iranian cooperation on Khobar Towers. ``We have pursued
approaches to Iran through a variety of means, including trying to
elicit support from other countries,'' the administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said that ``Khobar Towers
remains under investigation, and we continue to pursue all aspects
of the case, including possible Iranian involvement. Nothing is
being overlooked and this remains a high priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member terrorism commission was created by Congress last
year with six members appointed by the Republican congressional
leadership and four by the Democratic minority. Its report is based
on interviews with officials throughout the government, including
at the State Department, Pentagon, National Security Council, FBI
and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   One of its most controversial recommendations calls on the CIA
to drop its human rights guidelines on the recruitment of terrorist
informants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the CIA established new procedures for the agency's
case officers to seek approval before recruiting informants who may
have been involved in past human rights abuses. The guidelines were
put in place following charges that the CIA knowingly hired paid
informers among Guatemalan military officers suspected of
involvement in political murders, including the killing of a U.S.
citizen and a rebel leader married to another American.
</P>
<P>
   The commission argued that the guidelines have made it more
difficult for the CIA to penetrate terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These procedures have deterred and delayed vigorous efforts to
recruit potentially useful informants,'' the report concluded.
``The CIA has created a climate that is overly risk averse.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommends that the 1995 guidelines no longer be
used in terrorist cases. ``The Director of Central Intelligence
should issue a directive that the 1995 guidelines will no longer
apply to recruiting terrorist informants,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA spokesman denied Saturday that the 1995 guidelines impede
the agency's ability to gather intelligence on terrorist
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that our human rights guidelines are an impediment
to fighting terrorism is simply wrong,'' said CIA spokesman Bill
Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows better than we do that when combating terrorism,
it is often necessary to deal with unsavory individuals,'' he said.
``But we do so with our eyes wide open, and with appropriate
notification to senior officials. The bottom line is this, CIA
headquarters has never turned down a request to use someone, even
someone with a record of human rights abuse, if we thought that
person was valuable to our overall counter-terrorist program.''
</P>
<P>
   But L. Paul Bremer, the chairman of the commission and a former
ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism in the Reagan
administration, said the panel heard testimony from both current
and former CIA officers who said the guidelines served as
disincentives to the recruitment of agents inside terrorist groups.
The commission's members were unanimous in recommending the
guidelines be dropped in terrorist cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA official argued that the guidelines serve to protect CIA
case officers from second-guessing if they recruit an agent who
later emerges as a human rights violator. With the guidelines in
place, CIA case officers can show they received approval from
senior officials to go ahead with the recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guidelines haven't been a problem,'' the official said.
``We want people to be aggressive in the field, and we think they
have been pretty successful at that.''

<P>
   &UR; ANOTHER LIFE: A Memoir of Other People &LR;  By Michael Korda.
Delta, $14.95. A perpetually optimistic book editor recalls his
many years at Simon &AMP; Schuster and his encounters with nearly
everybody who is anybody, from Richard Nixon to Joan Crawford.
``Korda's tone of voice is affectionate and urbane, his manner that
of the accomplished raconteur who never spoils the story with a
heavy-handed moral,'' Lewis Lapham wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAYOVER &LR;  By Lisa Zeidner. Perennial, $13. Claire Newbold is a
successful middle-aged saleswoman who, after the death of her
3-year-old son and her husband's infidelity, simply refuses to go
home one day. Instead, she embarks on an odyssey of lust,
seduction, forbidden desire and furtive hotel hopping. ``The novel
rocks with a lot of great, sexy scenes, in which Zeidner's fine
writing is on glorious display,'' Karen Karbo wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999. ``With `Layover,' Zeidner joins the
ranks of Doris Lessing, Margaret Atwood and Fay Weldon, all of whom
have written in the women-spiraling-into-madness genre.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST: A History of Financial Speculation &LR;  By
Edward Chancellor. Plume, $13.95. The author employs ballads,
newspaper articles and gossip in this tour of speculative manias, a
long trail of wild dreams, burst bubbles and lost fortunes
stretching back to the 17th century. Last year the reviewer Adam
Smith praised the book's ``admirable scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIPPING THE VELVET &LR;  By Sarah Waters. Riverhead, $13.95. The
heroine of this erotic first novel is a wide-eyed girl who falls
for a music-hall actress in late Victorian England. This
infatuation leads to heartbreak and a harrowing (if ultimately
redeemed) life as a cross-dresser and kept woman in the back alleys
and elegant homes of London. ``If lesbian fiction is to reach a
wider readership ... Waters is just the person to carry the
banner,'' Miranda Seymour wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY PILGRIM'S PROGRESS: Media Studies, 1950-1998 &LR;  By George W.S.
Trow. Vintage, $13. This book-length essay is not so much about
media as it is a social history of the decline of patrician New
York and the loss of authority once wielded by traditionally
civilized people like the author. Trow is ``an inspired close
reader of all the stuff we gloss, graze and glance at,'' Gerald
Marzorati wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEA CAME IN AT MIDNIGHT &LR;  By Steve Erickson. Perennial, $14.
This apocalyptic novel revolves around a girl with a twisted past
who hooks up with an obsessive millennial freak; other plot lines
involve a creator of improbable maps and an illicit trade in time
capsules. ``The various stories mesh together at the level of
verbal echo and poetic metaphor,'' Geoff Nicholson wrote last year.
``Erickson also writes brilliantly sentence by sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LADIES FROM ST. PETERSBURG: Three Novellas &LR;  By Nina
Berberova. New Directions, $12.95. This posthumous collection
revolves around themes of flight and exile from Mother Russia, and
is steeped in an unromantic view of the author's homeland. In 1998
the reviewer Ken Kalfus admired ``the lucidity of ... Berberova's
prose and the deftness of her characterizations.''
</P>
<P>
   New Directions has also reissued  &UR; THE BLUE LANTERN: And Other
Stories &LR; , by Victor Pelevin ($12.95), in which irony, dark humor
and existential musings are given free rein in the strange
landscape of post-Soviet Russia. Pelevin continues to ``gnaw at our
confidence in conventional reality, like a dog worrying a bone,''
Kalfus wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROME AND A VILLA &LR;  By Eleanor Clark. Steerforth Italia, $18.
This series of rapturous sketches of postwar Rome and its people,
originally published in 1952 and updated in 1974, displays Clark's
``genius for attention, observation and recording'' and ``a true
sense and love of the grand, the tragic, the beautiful,'' Katherine
Anne Porter wrote in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE MIRACLE OF CASTEL DI SANGRO &LR; , by Joe McGinniss
(Broadway, $14.95), the author of ``Fatal Vision'' travels to a
remote Italian village to chronicle the efforts of the local soccer
team to recreate its Cinderella season of a year earlier. The
result is ``an engaging tale well worth telling, rich in comic
incidents, delightful characters and dramatic surprises,'' Bill
Barich wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIDNIGHTS: A Year With the Wellfleet Police &LR;  By Alec Wilkinson.
Ruminator, $14. At the age of 23, the author spent a year as a
rookie policeman on the nine-man force in a small town on Cape Cod.
His account of the trials and tedium of life in uniform ``enchants
the reader into caring about the subject and wanting to read on,''
Peter Benchley wrote in 1982. ``His perceptions of and compassion
for his fellow officers are profound.''
