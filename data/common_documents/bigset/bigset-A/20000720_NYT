<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The nine-day Camp David summit meeting, convened
by President Clinton in an attempt to settle the 52-year-old
conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis, ended without an
agreement Wednesday night, despite a fervent 11th-hour push by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement reflecting sharp disappointment at the
collapse of intense negotiations, Clinton's spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, announced shortly after 11 p.m.: ``The summit has come to
a conclusion without reaching an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   For several hours before leaving the secluded mountain retreat,
Clinton shuttled between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak,
and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in a last desperate
attempt to salvage the talks. But evidently he was unable to bridge
the differences on the major issues.
</P>
<P>
   And in what many observers considered a sign of trouble, the two
Middle East leaders remained apart all day.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio reported immediately after the breakdown that
Clinton had proposed that both leaders accept a partial agreement
that covered major issues _ including the territorial shape of a
Palestinian state and the fate of 3 million Palestinian refugees in
the Middle East _ but excluded a solution on the status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to immediately pinpoint the major
sticking points, but in the last several days of the summit
meeting, reports filtered out that the question of Jerusalem was
the most intractable issue on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prepared to return to the White House to make a
statement before departing for a gathering of the leaders of the
seven major industrial nations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was expected to give a news conference before flying back
to Israel, while Arafat was preparing to leave without making any
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who had pushed Clinton hard to call the summit and wanted
an overarching agreement ending the conflict to sell back home, was
expected to say that Arafat had failed to negotiate in good faith
and that the Palestinians should carry the full brunt of the
breakdown, an Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of high tension and rapidly shifting moods. Late
into the evening, Clinton was still making an all-out effort to
salvage the talks. Briefing reporters at 5:30 p.m., Lockhart had
said that the talks were at a ``pivotal moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But in letters written in the last 48 hours, Arafat and Barak
made private appeals to Clinton, all the while gearing up to lay
the blame for a failed summit meeting squarely on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the high-tension, high-stakes day see-sawed. At
midday, it seemed certain that the talks were fizzling out. By
early evening, when the parties were still entrenched at Camp David
and tentatively scheduled final news conferences were postponed, it
seemed possible that Clinton would be able to pull out an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unexpectedly quick first climax, the Israeli
journalists accompanying Barak were ordered in the afternoon to
rush to their hotels for a security check so that their luggage
could be shuttled to Andrews Air Force Base for an 8 p.m. departure
for Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ran down, expectations were rife that there had
been a breakdown. Israeli television reported, and a U.S. official
later confirmed, that Barak had sent a letter to Clinton announcing
the prime minister's departure and laid the blame for the summit
meeting's failure on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian side is conducting negotiations insincerely
and is not willing to negotiate in a serious and practical manner
for a permanent peace between us,'' an Israeli reporter cited as a
direct quotation from the letter.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who himself was
heading to the airport to fly home to his son's wedding, brushed
off what he saw as an eleventh-hour Israeli tactic to increase
pressure on the Palestinians. Talks were ongoing, he said, and the
fate of Jerusalem, a seemingly intractable issue, was still on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television reported that Barak sent Arafat a message
that he was willing to return to Camp David for another round of
talks but that he might not still be prime minister by then.
Palestinian officials reported, in turn, that Arafat, seeing this
as a threat, retorted that if he made too many concessions, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas
group, would be taking his place.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a briefing at the Thurmont Elementary School some 5
miles from Camp David, Lockhart gave the final day an extended
lease on life. He said that as he spoke, Clinton was sitting down
at the retreat's Birch Cabin to his second face-to-face session
Wednesday with the Arafat. Clinton had met with Barak earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the changing dynamic of refreshed momentum, Israeli
journalists returned to the press filing center, where one, Keren
Neubach, announced breathlessly that their bags were being returned
from the Air Force base to the Hampton Inn where they were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton also received a letter from Arafat,
which arrived on Tuesday, before Barak's. He did not characterize
its contents, but Palestinian officials said that Arafat had
reached a peak of frustration on the eighth day.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart made clear that the two leaders were having trouble
making concessions on deeply emotional issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders both want to go home with an agreement,'' Lockhart
said. ``The problem is the substance and structure of the
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the extended deadline would have to stand.
``There comes a time when you have to put a time limit on
discussions,'' he said.

 THURMONT, Md.: discussions,'' he said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the day, Clinton telephoned other leaders in the Middle
East to brief them on the developments, the first such contacts
since the summit meeting began.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that an ultimate sticking point concerned the future
status of Jerusalem, the most divisive issue and one that has never
before been negotiated by Israeli and Arab leaders. It was seen as
the make-or-break issue, but it is possible that other stumbling
blocks remained, too.
</P>
<P>
   After conquering East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, Israel declared that the city would ``eternally''
remain united and under exclusive Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The visit of the Egyptian leader, Anwar el-Sadat, to Jerusalem
in the fall of 1977 was interpreted by the Israelis as recognition
of Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital. But a year later, at the
first Camp David summit meeting between Sadat and Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin, the question of Jerusalem threatened to
scuttle the entire conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Carter tried to find some sort of symbolic solution _
such as flying Muslim flags on the Temple Mount _ but the
suggestions were rejected by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oslo agreement of 1993, under which Israel recognized the
Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinians renounced
all violence against Israel, the future of Jerusalem, along with
the fate of Palestinian refugees, final borders and some other
issues, was left for ``final status'' talks. The official position
of the United States has been that the fate of Jerusalem must be
negotiated between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven years, diplomats, professors, demographers
and officials from both sides have tried to come up with various
arrangements that could satisfy the demands of both sides,
including ideas that involved ``autonomy'' for Palestinian
neighborhoods in Jerusalem and allowing the Palestinians to claim
the neighboring village of Abu Dis as their Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But these ideas were dismissed by the Palestinians as a ``Jewish
solution.'' Abu Dis, they argued, is not Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have watched Arafat over many years say that he always
set a benchmark: He would not be the Palestinian who went down in
history as the one who gave up Arab claims to East Jerusalem as the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, they point out, was not asking for a divided city but
rather shared sovereignty in an open and undivided city. Offering
municipal control over some neighborhoods, they said, fell far
short.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, for Barak, making concessions on a city that many
Jews regard as their capital by divine fiat was extremely
difficult.

ANALYSIS: JERUSALEM PROBLEM TOO TIGHTLY TIED TO OTHER ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: The following story is an added starter on The New York Times
front page) 
(With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Before sifting through the rubble of the failed
Camp David summit meeting, it bears noting that the mere fact of an
Israeli and a Palestinian leader confronting the intractable issue
of Jerusalem's sovereignty was a milestone in Middle Eastern
history.
</P>
<P>
   That nine days of high-stakes, high-level talks apparently
disintegrated in large part on that volatile issue, which Middle
Eastern leaders have never before dared to touch, is not as
surprising as the fact that they finally broached this taboo
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the status of Jerusalem need not have been a deal-breaker
if the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestine
leader, Yasser Arafat, had been willing or able to go for a partial
accord that delayed decision-making on this subject.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not. Or they could not because the interplay
between Jerusalem and the other issues was too intricate to allow
one issue to be solved or left unsolved without affecting the
overall balance of concessions.
</P>
<P>
   And that meant that one of the most momentous peace meetings in
modern history fizzled to a close on a rainy night that dampened
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of ending a 52-year conflict, it may have put in
jeopardy, temporarily at least, the whole notion of
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking. It is possible that lower-level
negotiators will resume their work, but it is hard to imagine a
profitable dynamic when their leaders had visited and revisited
every compromise possible and rejected them conclusively.
</P>
<P>
   So the end of talks greeted the Mideast, which was about to wake
up when the talks finally broke down shortly before 11 p.m. here,
with an uncertain future at what was supposed to be the end of a
seven-year peace effort. And it raised the specter of violent
confrontations, of a genuine, street-level battle for Palestinian
independence building toward Arafat's pledged deadline of Sept. 13
for declaring a state.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know, at this point, if the talks did more
harm than good. The meeting, which the Israelis pushed for, but the
Palestinians resisted, was premised on the idea of averting a
violent climax to the peace effort. While the Palestinians
predicted failure, saying the summit meeting was premature, the
Israelis, and the Americans who eventually convened the meeting,
thought it better to try than not to try, considering the political
and social tensions building in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The language in Barak's closing letter to President Clinton did
not offer any suggestion that the meeting had brought the parties
closer, even though they were locked up in a presidential retreat
for nine days of intimate, emotional conversations. Instead, it
demonstrated, as did statements by the Palestinians, that the
mutual recriminations were not only still strong, but were perhaps
stronger than ever in Barak's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat met only three times during the nine days that
Clinton spent shuttling between them, and there is no evidence that
their relationship grew stronger in the bucolic setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day,'' said David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who has chronicled the
peace effort for the last decade. ``Camp David was high noon for
the Middle East, time to finish all the business of the 20th
century, but now we will be stuck there, in the past, for the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, according to an Israel Radio report at 11
p.m., the Americans proposed a partial agreement that omitted
Jerusalem. Israel Radio said that Arafat would not accept it.
Earlier in the day, Palestinian officials made clear that Arafat
did not believe that he had a formal mandate from the Arab and
Muslim world to recognize the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem
and concede it forever.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by what several Israeli officials said earlier in
the day, Barak also had been unwilling to consider a partial deal.
And by political calculations, he probably could not have done so
successfully, since, despite his pre-meeting assertions that his
disintegrating government would not hobble him, it inevitably did.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost his majority government when rightist parties
defected before the meeting, Barak faces an uncertain future as a
leader. And he would have under any scenario. But analysts believe
that he would have had the most trouble surviving if he returned
with a partial deal that entailed further Israeli concessions but
no resolution of the conflict, no end of claims, no way to declare
that peace had broken out. In this case, something probably would
have been worse than all or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, politically, the middle ground was the most
dangerous route for Barak to take,'' a senior Israeli official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to bring home an agreement will spell an end, at
least temporarily, to Barak's grand dream of forging a
comprehensive peace between Israeli and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But it could help him resuscitate his broad coalition, fleshing
out his minority government back into a majority. It could enable
Barak, if he chooses, to forge a coalition with the rightist Likud
government to face the tensions ahead. Or it could provoke him to
dissolve the government and call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Barak used his political weakness as a strategy before
and during the summit meeting. Israeli television reported that he
sent a message to Arafat that he would be willing to return to Camp
David for a second meeting but that he would probably have to do so
as an opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, though, reportedly had a retort. He sent a message back
saying that if he made the requested concessions on Jerusalem and
the refugees, he would be forced into retirement, too. And then the
Israelis would be left to face Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual
leader of the radical Hamas movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the land of the possible, the deep-seated
Israeli-Palestinian conflict almost seemed, improbably, on the
point of being solved, at least on paper. But even in the green
hills of Maryland, the arid land that is the center of their acrid
dispute was palpably close and the passions surrounding it still
too far from being tempered by reason and compromise.

PRESIDENT LEAVES TALKS AS A FRUSTRATED PEACEMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twice in the past seven months President Clinton
has invested enormous amounts of time and prestige in an attempt to
reach historic accords between Israel and its neighbors, first the
Syrians, then the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases his aides bet that changing times and the force of
Clinton's own personality as a mediator with a finely honed sense
for the middle ground might be enough to win agreement, and with it
a legacy for a president with six months and a day remaining in his
term.
</P>
<P>
   Twice so far, they have been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hardly about to be blamed for the failure of the
talks that collapsed Wednesday night between Israel's prime
minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. He
entered the talks with little to lose, save for his dwindling hoard
of time. Yet his reported outbursts of anger during the final hours
of talks Wednesday suggested how emotionally involved he has become
in an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the talks, one of Clinton's closest aides suggested
that, while no deal was certain, ``the stars are aligned.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, White House officials had concluded, needed an agreement
if he had any hope of remaining in office after the collapse of his
ruling coalition. Arafat, they continued, knows that his own days
as the leader of the Palestinians are dwindling down.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. prosperity, they concluded, meant that Clinton might
well succeed in persuading Congress to allocate tens of millions of
dollars to support a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have an opportunity like this for a long, long
time,'' the aide said more than a week ago, a theme Barak alluded
to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the end, Clinton and his staff may have overestimated the
amount of political capital either side could put at risk. And now,
while the peace effort is by no means over, it will be harder and
harder to put the pieces back together again under Clinton's own
watch.
</P>
<P>
   That is a conclusion Clinton appeared to be grappling with
Wednesday night, as he reassessed his options over the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He could well attempt to bring the sides together again before
the Sept. 13 deadline Arafat has set for declaring an independent
Palestinian state. But as one of Clinton's close aides said
Wednesday, ``rebuilding momentum is very hard, which is why we want
everything we can to be done now.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also possible that he may have limited options. There
was talk about bringing top Syrian officials back to the United
States after their talks in Shepherdstown, W. Va., broke down. It
never happened, and Clinton's later meeting with Hafez Assad,
Syria's leader until his death two months ago, was considered a
failure, evidence that even Syria's declining economy could not
overcome years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It was soon after that confrontation with Assad that Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and Clinton's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, concluded that their best bet was to focus
on the ``Palestinian track'' of Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting the Palestinians to the table took a considerable
effort by Clinton. Placing the talks at Camp David was an effort to
re-create the magic of 1978 and 1979, when Israel and Egypt signed
their famous accord.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, no number of ``bridging proposals'' by the
president, no dealmaking over U.S. aid or land swaps in Jerusalem
could make the difference. And so Clinton left Wednesday night for
Japan as a frustrated peacemaker, the outlines of the deal that
hadn't happened _ at least yet _ precisely formed in his mind.

SHOULDER PAIN NAGS SALMON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calilf. _ For the third straight game Wednesday night,
right fielder Tim Salmon was not in the starting lineup because of
an inflamed left shoulder. He had a cortisone injection Monday and
Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia wanted to give him at least
one more day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wear-and-tear injury,'' Salmon said. ``I've played with
it a long time. A lot of guys have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he first began feeling some pain in the shoulder
just before the All-Star break, and figured the three days off
would clear it up. But when he jarred the shoulder trying to make a
sliding catch Sunday in San Diego, he aggravated it enough to ask
Scioscia for a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scioscia's been on me for two weeks to take time off,'' Salmon
said. ``I said, `No, I'll suck it up.' You try to play through
these kinds of injuries. But finally I said I needed a day.''
</P>
<P>
   One day has turned into three, and Salmon might be limited to DH
duty for the first few games when he does come back.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon came into the season with a .291 career batting average
but is hitting just .259 this year. He has 18 homers and 49 RBI,
but those numbers rank only fifth best on the team in both
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been swinging the bat well the past couple of
weeks,'' Salmon said. ``We were facing Seattle when it all started,
so sometimes when you think you're not swinging good, maybe it's
just good pitching. But then the last couple of days before the
break I was swinging at pitches I don't normally swing at. When you
have a nagging injury, you can get into bad habits.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Trade bait: If the Angels make a trade before the July 31
deadline, it most likely would be for a run-producing DH. But the
problem for the Angels is the makeup of their roster.
</P>
<P>
   They keep 12 pitchers on the roster and as a result begin each
game with only four players on the bench. So they can't afford to
carry a DH who can't play defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way our club lines up right now,'' Scioscia said.
``Our bench has to be versatile. With a four-man bench, they have
to be multidimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   The bench consists of catcher Matt Walbeck (he can also play
first base), Scott Spiezio, who can play first, second and third,
Kevin Stocker and Benji Gil, who share the shortstop duties and can
also play second, and Edgard Clemente and Orlando Palmeiro, who can
both play all three outfield spots.
</P>
<P>
   __ Un-American: There has been talk around the major leagues
about realignment, but one scenario that hasn't been discussed is a
move by the Angels to the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia wouldn't mind such a move, considering how his team
played in interleague games this season (12-6) and how he uses his
DH more as a semi-day off for the regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``A case could be made for us being a better National League
club than American League club,'' he said. ``Our starting eight
match up with anybody. And we don't have a big bat (in the DH spot)
like Edgar Martinez's to take out of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Schoeneweis update: Pitcher Scott Schoeneweis, who is
recovering from a strained rib-cage muscle, made his second rehab
start Wednesday, pitching for Triple-A Edmonton at Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis made 79 pitches in seven innings, allowing one
unearned run and two hits with six strikeouts and one walk.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis will need at least one more rehab start before
returning to the starting rotation.

YANKEES GET A CHARGE OUT OF CLEMENS
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derek Jeter will swing at just about any pitch within
two time zones of home plate. It's his nature, always has been,
always will be. His aggressiveness is why, at age 26, he is already
approaching 1,000 career hits.
</P>
<P>
   But someone as intelligent and seasoned as Tim Raines said in
spring training that Jeter would be a better offensive player if he
were more selective, and that probably applies to the New York
Yankees collectively. They are a better team when they are patient;
always have been, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   They waited for Detroit's Hideo Nomo to throw strikes at Yankee
Stadium Wednesday night, drew three walks and created hitters'
counts, then they pounded the right-hander for five extra-base hits
in a 9-1 thrashing of the Tigers. Roger Clemens pitched eight
innings, struck out 11 and won his fourth consecutive start, the
first time he has accomplished that since joining the Yankees last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens ascertained quickly that Brian O'Nora, the home plate
umpire, was calling a wide strike zone. O'Nora called strikes on a
fastball and a slider low and away _ Luis Polonia glanced back at
O'Nora after each _ and Clemens began attacking the Tigers with his
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Several Detroit batters griped about the strike calls as Clemens
looked on passively; Brad Ausmus, Rich Becker and others turned and
yelled at O'Nora.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (8-6) kept pumping strikes, allowing only six hits, on
his way to his 255th career victory, good for 35th place. Clemens
has a 1.84 earned run average in his four starts since being
activated from the disabled list July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Batting second in the Yankees' lineup, Jeter took all five
pitches thrown to him in the first inning Wednesday night, most of
them low, for a walk, his second first-inning walk since April 24.
Before drawing a walk against Florida last Friday, Jeter had gone
55 consecutive games without doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill took two pitches out of the strike zone, and with
the count in his favor, he looked for a fastball, got it, and
hammered it into the right-field stands for his 12th homer.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Brosius singled and Jose Vizcaino doubled with two
out in the Yankees second, Knoblauch took a four-pitch walk from
Nomo, loading the bases. Jeter patiently took the first two pitches
thrown to him to get ahead in the count, then fouled off a pitch
and took another ball.
</P>
<P>
   With the count 3-1, Jeter ripped a line drive between the
outfielders in right and center. All three runners scored ahead of
him before he slid into third with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams walked leading off the third and came around to
score. That was the inning in which Nomo was knocked out after
surrendering six runs. David Justice finished the Yankees scoring
in the fourth, crushing a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter walked again in the eighth and has 26 walks this season,
after drawing 91 last year. But then almost all the Yankees are
collecting fewer walks this season. Knoblauch, their lead-off
hitter, has 24, after collecting 83 last year. Even Williams, their
most productive hitter, has 40 walks, after drawing 100 last year.
His batting average is about the same as it was last year, but his
on-base percentage is down almost 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' biggest victory of the season might have come on
Sunday, when they rebounded twice from multirun deficits to beat
the Phillies, 9-8. That comeback was fueled by the patience of
their hitters, their willingness to draw walks.

WHITE READY FOR REHAB STINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Center fielder Devon White could be back in the
starting lineup as early as Saturday if all goes well on his
two-game rehab assignment, which begins today at Class A San
Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   After the short rehab, White will be evaluated by the Dodgers
medical staff and he could be given clearance to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better. I'm definitely better,'' White said. ``I'm going
down to see pitches. It's just a matter of getting ready to get
back to the big leagues and play. I'll be down there for two days.
I've got two days to get my stuff ready and see how it feels and
see where I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   However, White isn't expected to be given the starting center
fielder's spot back immediately. Instead, club officials said it's
likely White will be eased back into the position and split time
with Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   White batted .289 with three homers and nine RBI in 22 games
before the injury. Hollandsworth was hitting .238 with seven homers
and 21 RBI in 71 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged,'' Malone said. ``We've missed him. He can
play, and he's going to be a big help when he gets back.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Davey released: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was released
from Centinela Hospital Medical Center about an hour before
Wednesday's game and went to his La Canada-Flintridge home.
Johnson, who was admitted Sunday morning and diagnosed with an
irregular heartbeat, is expected to return to the bench Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dodgers officials wouldn't rule out Johnson returning
for tonight's contest against the Colorado Rockies. Upon his
release, Johnson and his wife, Susan, issued a statement of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon release from the hospital, we wanted to assure everyone
that we are doing fine and looking forward to getting back into the
baseball routine,'' the Johnsons said in the statement. ``We also
wanted to take this opportunity to thank all of our family and
friends who expressed their thoughts and concerns through warming
gifts, prayer, visits and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming support for us, in addition to the tremendous
care and attention displayed by the wonderful staff at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center, have been invaluable throughout this
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster shuffle: Before Wednesday's game, the Dodgers placed
outfielder F.P. Santangelo on the 15-day disabled list with a
left-hand bruise. The move is retroactive to July 17. Also,
right-hander Mike Judd was expectedly sent to Triple-A Albuquerque
after allowing seven runs in four-plus innings in his spot start
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves cleared the way for right-hander Al Reyes and first
baseman Chris Donnels to be promoted from Albuquerque. Donnels, by
far, is the more interesting individual. He gives the Dodgers
another left-handed bat off the bench. Donnels played parts of six
seasons with three major-league clubs, including the Mets, and was
hitting .334 with 26 homers and 80 RBI with the Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes came to the Dodgers in the Alan Mills trade to Baltimore
last month. He was 2-1 with a save at Albuquerque after going 1-0
with a 6.92 ERA with the Orioles. But the Dodgers promoted Reyes
because they want innings after their bullpen was worked hard
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Santangelo's move to the disabled list means he won't
serve his five-game suspension beginning Saturday. He's eligible to
be activated Aug. 1, and then he'll serve the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   __ Appeal update: It appears Gary Sheffield's appeal on his
five-game suspension will have to wait until the club travels to
Milwaukee at the end of August.

FREE ROUNDS PAY OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You see guys like Jim Haffner at muni courses everywhere,
slashing at the ball with swings designed in front of the TV and
refined on the range. Sometimes, with enough work and athletic
ability, a golf swing actually emerges. Sometimes, too, the result
is a train wreck of body parts out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   All that matters, though, is that the swing we build gets the
ball around the course.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes the result is stunning even to ourselves, which is
why Newbury Park resident Haffner is in such a jovial mood these
days. He's had a career year, as the sterling-silver plate in his
trophy case indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Haffner, who plays to a 17.4 index, won the Treasurer Flight at
the 66th Southern California Golf Association Amateur Net
Championships at Borrego Springs Golf Resort &AMP; Country Club. This
is a major for everyone of us who has an SCGA index card stuffed in
our wallet.
</P>
<P>
   His two-round score of 125 bested runner-up David Cogsewell of
Oak Park by four shots.
</P>
<P>
   Haffner says luck and his game peaking at just the right time
added up to the win. He advanced from the qualifying stage on what
is called a card-off. He finished in a tie for the last spot and
got it by virtue of shooting the lower score over the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   So the trip to the desert became a lark.
</P>
<P>
   Haffner is 53 now and back surgery has forced him to alter his
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just going down there to have fun with my wife and spend
a couple of days in Borrego Springs,'' he recalled. ``I didn't even
play a practice round. The way I was looking at it was I got two
free rounds of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually it was a big surprise,'' he said of the win. ``The
first day everything was clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is neat about this tournament is that age is not a
factor. Golfers compete against others of their own ability and the
scores are adjusted for handicap. But the event is played strictly
by the book. There are no mulligans or conceded putts.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this a hard event to win, it's hard to get into. The
SCGA entry forms go out early in the year and the available spots
are snapped up in a matter of a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And Haffner, a self-taught golfer, knows that golf is a quirky
game.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend after the SCGA event he headed to Arizona for an
annual weekend tournament with some friends. What he had the week
before was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in there just brimming with confidence and immediately
fell flat on my face. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't shoot my
handicap. I just happened to be on that one weekend, that was it,''
he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   __ Longevity: Hall of Famer Gary Player always set his sights
high. No challenge was too great. Now the South African great has
another goal. He wants to become the first golfer to record a win
over six decades in a full-field event.
</P>
<P>
   He's a fitness fanatic, so he still has the physical skills.
</P>
<P>
   And while he's won 160 tournaments worldwide, this might be his
toughest task considering the skill level of today's players. He'll
take his shot this fall in the Transamerica at Silverado Country
Club in the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Trevino is the only other player to record a win over five
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Player won the 2000 Senior Skins Game, a sanctioned event. But
he doesn't count it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about winning against a full field of the best
senior players in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Silly prediction: Despite what the oddsmakers say, there is
really no such thing as a favorite in a golf tournament. That's why
it's so silly installing Tiger Woods as the betting favorite in the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   How goofy is this? Well, it was not that long ago that the smart
money was betting that Woods would never win a U.S. Open because
the set-up for that tournament did not fit his game.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Course at St. Andrews seems perfect for Woods, though.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't expect him to win the U.S. Open by 15 shots. I do
expect him to embrace the Claret Jug come Sunday evening.

TEACHERS UNION, ANTI-TAX GROUP JOIN TO FIGHT SCHOOL
VOUCHER  INITIATIVE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ In a strange political pairing, the state's largest
teachers union and a conservative anti-tax group have joined forces
against a school voucher initiative _ even though the two groups
are fighting each other on another school initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the voucher initiative accuse the California Teachers
Association of buying opposition to the voucher measure by agreeing
to pay the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association to be included in
the group's campaign mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Both CTA and the taxpayer's association deny the charge.
Nevertheless, the ``no on vouchers'' campaign is negotiating a
price for it to be included in the taxpayer group's campaign
mailers, The Chronicle has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Those mailers will also urge voters to oppose an initiative
similar to one the CTA spent $13 million trying to pass in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association was shopping around
its endorsement; we didn't feel like playing that game,'' said
Chris Bertelli, a spokesman for the campaign to approve Proposition
38, which would give parents a $4,000 check from taxpayers to pay
for their child's private school education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very odd. Here's an organization that's always been an
ardent opponent of a CTA-backed measure now taking money from the
CTA,'' Bertelli said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a reversal of the taxpayer group's voucher stance. It
backed a similar measure on the November 1993 ballot that the CTA
spent heavily to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Like that 1993 measure, Proposition 38, the new voucher
initiative is the most heated issue on the November ballot. The
fight over its passage will easily be the most expensive initiative
campaign this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's union has said it has budgeted at least $10
million to defeat Proposition 38, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the taxpayers association, its main goal this fall is
defeat of Proposition 39, a measure that would lower the approval
threshold for local school bonds from 67 percent to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 39 is backed by Gov. Gray Davis and promoted by his
political team.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the taxpayers association spearheaded opposition to
Proposition 26, which would have lowered the bond approval
threshold to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest spending supporter was the CTA, at some $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the taxpayers association has been soliciting funds
to fight Proposition 39, which is supported by the CTA.
</P>
<P>
   Six days before the taxpayer group announced its position on the
voucher initiative, the group's direct mail firm, Lord-Butcher
Company, sent a memo to supporters of the voucher initiative
outlining the group's proposed direct mail campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, Bill Lord-Butcher, said he had approached both
sides of the campaign ``to learn what level of interest exists in
participating in the mailing program.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo says that the taxpayer group has yet to make an
endorsement. It then details the program and the cost: $850,000 for
four pieces of mail going to 1.25 million California voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never responded to it and then learned (the taxpayers
association) went the other way,'' Bertelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Lord-Butcher, a consultant hired to defeat Proposition 39, said
in an interview he told the pro-voucher campaign he had no control
over the taxpayer group's endorsement, and the memo was just a
breakdown of the mechanics of the direct mail program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult for me to keep a straight face and say
this showed the endorsement was for sale,'' Lord-Butcher said.
``Shame on them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the CTA did not agree to pay $850,000 to participate in
the direct mail program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with the endorsement, but the CTA has made no
commitment to give money to Howard Jarvis to pay anything to
them,'' said Becky Zoglman, a spokeswoman for the union. ``Any
negotiations are made with the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lenzner, a spokesman for the ``no on vouchers'' campaign,
said there were no conversations between the taxpayer group and the
campaign before the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Vosburgh of the taxpayers association said ``no money is
going to either the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association or to any
of its committees.
</P>
<P>
   Vosburgh said ``money from the CTA'' would go to Lord-Butcher's
direct mail effort.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to announcing its opposition to the voucher initiative,
the taxpayer group reversed itself on Proposition 35, which would
allow greater contracting-out of state engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpayer group initially supported the proposition, then
became an opponent. It opposed an initiative on the June 1998
ballot making it harder to contract out to private firms.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the campaign to defeat Proposition 35, which
is being advocated by the Professional Engineers in California
Government, said it is eager to work with the taxpayer group on
mailings but that eagerness had nothing to do with securing their
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They changed their position before we started talking with
them, said Steve Hopcraft, who runs the ``no'' on Proposition 35
campaign.

LOS ANGELES AIRPORT PACKED WITH FRUSTRATED PASSENGERS &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA BARTHOLOMEW and ORITH GOLDBERG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spurred by the booming economy and high gas
prices, air traffic at Los Angeles International Airport has soared
to record levels, jamming planes, terminals and freeways, officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines report flights are leaving at near-capacity, with air
traffic at LAX expected to rise by 5 percent this summer to nearly
6 million passengers a day, officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials report ``record usage at LAX,'' but could not
provide numbers for June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard from the airlines, in a general sense, that their
capacity is over 90 percent,'' said Tom Winfrey, a spokesman for
Los Angeles World Airports and LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic passengers, he said, should report to the airport two
hours early; international travelers three hours before their
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in passengers has been felt throughout the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some flights every day go out full,'' said Janis Magnuson, Los
Angeles station manager for TWA. ``Out of Los Angeles, with TWA,
we're doing good _ well over 90 percent, if not better.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people flying out of LAX was up 7 percent this
spring compared to last year, officials said. International flights
were up 13 percent. While Winfrey said some airlines are adding
flights to take up the slack, officials with several airlines said
the additions were planned prior to the summer rush.
</P>
<P>
   A flush economy and record gas prices have encouraged more
travelers to get out of their cars and head for the airport, flight
industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The result: more passenger delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it seems like it's exceptionally crowded,'' said Mary
Stanton, 70, of Los Angeles as she stood in a United Airlines
ticket line to send her granddaughter off to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's vacation time, but there have been other years
that just didn't seem as crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in passengers has only worsened record delays
caused in recent weeks by air traffic control mix-ups, mechanical
difficulties, flight attendant shortages and summer storms, the
major holdup in flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole airline experience has really been very crowded,''
said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association.
``There are lines at the ticket counter, at the newspaper stand,
the security belt, the sandwich bar _ then you get on the airplane
and there's still a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a lot of tension.''
</P>
<P>
   From the airlines' perspective, however, business is good and
getting better.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, which ferries 22 percent of LAX passengers,
reported a 6.5 percent increase in passengers at LAX last month
from a year ago. Its airplanes ran at 80 percent capacity, a nearly
6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out in L.A., our biggest carrier, we are running very strong
loads in all segments and that is expected to increase later this
summer,'' said Alan Wayne, regional director of public affairs for
United. International traffic is up 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Southwest Airlines marketing representative reported Fourth of
July capacity surpassed 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know that we're getting some record numbers systemwide,''
said Southwest spokeswoman Christine Turneabe-Connelly, who
declined to release any statistics. ``Of course, LAX is one of our
top 10 busiest cities, so we have seen record customer numbers
there as well.''
</P>
<P>
   An America West official said full airplane loads prompt
managers to shout, ``Keep hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers Wednesday seemed resigned to the crowds, if not
the delays.
</P>
<P>
   One frustrated traveler, Deirdre Kiely, 18, of San Jose, had
just dragged herself off an almost 13-hour flight from Dublin,
Ireland, when she learned her United Airlines flight to San
Francisco was canceled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exact same company did this to me four weeks ago,'' she
said angrily from her perch atop her duffel bag. ``I'll never fly
with them again.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the crowded skies, airports nationwide are
experiencing record delays this summer for the second year in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Brownlee, 62, of Redondo Beach, Calif., said it seems few
flights have empty seats anymore. ``I'm finding it difficult to get
mileage upgrades because the seats are already taken.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Mary Kay, was also indignant about being forced by LAX
security officials to constantly circle the airport in lieu of
waiting at the curb for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to move around if you get harassed.'' she said.
``It's very frustrating.''

OATES SAYS TRADE WON'T HURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When the Rangers traded pitcher Esteban Loaiza
yesterday, they did so for two minor-league players. In doing so,
the Rangers improved their farm system, but manager Johnny Oates
said the trade shouldn't hurt the major-league team.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Oates said. ``In my mind, if we had given
the ball to \RRyan\S Glynn, \RMatt\S Perisho or \RDoug\S Davis,
they would have had five wins by now. I don't think this says we're
giving up. We're going to be just as good and in the long-term, we
could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade also could have the benefit of giving Glynn and
Perisho the confidence that Loaiza is not longerout in the bullpen,
ready to reclaim his spot in the rotation should they stumble.
That's what happened last year. Glynn joined the rotation May 25
and made eight starts, going 2-3 with a 6.95 earned-run average
before losing his job to Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could help,'' Oates said. ``Less competition, one less
veteran to pick from. They still have to pitch. Doug Davis is still
waiting for his turn.''  &QL; 
OLIVER READY TO GO Darren Oliver, 2-4 with a 6.66 ERA, returns to
the rotation tonight, making his first start since June 16, when he
pitched against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He has been on the
disabled list for the past month with weakness in his left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver started the season 1-2 with a 5.15 ERA in his first eight
starts and then went 1-2 with a 9.92 ERA in his last five starts,
before going on the disabled list. He signed a three-year, $19
million contract in the off-season, but has yet to be the
consistent starter the Rangers that they were getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been right,'' Oliver said. ``As long as I'm healthy
and taking it pitch-by-pitch and doing everything I can, that's all
that matters. I just need to go out there and throw strikes.
Quality strikes, not just throw the ball down the middle of the
plate.''
SECOND-ROUND PICK SIGNS The Rangers announced that have signed
right-handed pitcher Randy Truselo, one of their two second-round
picks from the June first-year player draft. He received a $600,000
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have signed eight of their top nine picks. The one
holdout is University of North Carolina outfielder Tyrell Godwin,
who was taken as the 35th overall pick of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still working on that one,'' Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin said. ``He's the one guy that still hasn't come around
yet.''  &LR; subheds:Losing late  &LR; agatea:More on the Rangers' 5-3 loss
to the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time this season the Rangers have lost a game
when leading after the eighth inning. They lost four times in those
situations all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh time this season the Rangers have lost on the
road in the bottom of the ninth inning. Four of those have come on
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last night, the Rangers have lost 25 times this
season, despite having a lead at some point in the game.
BRIEFLY The Rangers have signed former Tampa Bay Devil Rays
outfielder Rich Butler to a Triple-A contract. He was released by
the Devil Rays this year and has a career .223 average in 86
major-league games in 1997-99. The Rangers finished interleague
play with a 7-11 record, the first time in four seasons they've had
a losing record against the National League. Overall, the American
League was 136-115 against the National League. The Rangers' 5.40
ERA in 18 games against the National League was the third highest
by an American League team in interleague play.

WITH WEBB AND SORENSTAM, IT'S TEE FOR TWO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
LIBERTYVILLE, Ill. _ Together, they peer down at peers from the
summit of most significant statistical categories kept by LPGA Tour
officials. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Season-money list? Annika Sorenstam is first, Karrie Webb
second. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Player of the Year race? Webb leads Sorenstam by a thin margin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dynamic Duo also has placed a 1-2 hammerlock on tour
pursuers in terms of scoring average (Webb leads), greens in
regulation (Advantage, Sorenstam) top-10 finishes (Webb) and
victories (Sorenstam). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In LPGA circles, Webb and Sorenstam impact leader boards and
opponents' thoughts the way Tiger Woods dominates the PGA Tour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got one Tiger. We've got two,'' Meg Mallon said,
summarizing the difference between the respective tours as they
prepare for today's opening rounds of major championships on
opposite sides of the globe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the men turn into Tiger chasers at the British Open, the
quest for the LPGA contingent is to reel in Webb and Sorenstam _ or
Sorenstam and Webb, if you prefer _ at the Merit Club in the U.S.
Women's Open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similar in their soft-spoken approaches off the course,
Sorenstam and Webb play entirely different games. Not surprisingly,
each plans a different approach for the Merit Club, which is the
longest course (6,540 yards, par 72) ever to host the Women's
Open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, 29, describes herself as a ``statistical nerd,'' who
tracks her weekly progress on a laptop computer. Asked about being
characterized by peers as a methodical player, Sorenstam replied:
``I take it as a compliment. I have feel in my game, but I don't
play with my heart. I use more strategy than most players. I have a
game plan, I stick with it and it works.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, that includes a heavy dose of 7-woods and 3-woods off
tee boxes at the Merit Club, despite the course's wide fairways and
lack of trees. The idea, said Sorenstam, is to keep the ball in
play, remain patient, pad her tour-best greens-in-regulation
percentage (75.5) and accept whatever birdies fall her way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Webb, by comparison, plans to break out the driver as often as
possible and aggressively create scoring chances. By her own
admission, Webb lacks Sorenstam's patience, [ on the course ]but
tries to compensate with power and creativity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the Open, my biggest hurdle I have to overcome is my
patience,'' said Webb, 25. ``I go along and keep everything in, and
then I have one bad break or one bad swing and I just lose it.
That's what I have to work on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that Webb, like Woods, is willing to attempt
high-risk shots in quest of birdies. That paid off in a 10-stroke
victory at the Nabisco Championship, the season's first major
championship and one of Webb's four titles this season. Sorenstam
has five victories, along with a slight lead in the money race
($985,635 vs. $963,742), proving that the Dynamic Duo's differing
methods are equally effective[ capable of yielding fruit]. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Webb, the 1999 Player of the Year, her 20 titles in five
years have [ has ]been the continuation of a trend that began in
1996, when she [ Webb ]won four events, received Rookie of the Year
honors and became the first LPGA player to top $1 million in a
season. Sorenstam, the 1995 and 1996 Open champ, said Webb's
emergence _ particularly her six victories last season _ motivated
Sorenstam [ her ] to sharpen her focus this season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think golf is 90 percent mental,'' Sorenstam said. ``I
wanted to get going with Karrie. I knew what I was capable of and I
think that's what motivated me the most. When I stopped being No. 1
\Rin the [ golf ] rankings\S, I realized how much I enjoyed it and
how much it meant to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both players downplay any rivalry[ between them], Webb
admitted she is quick to check Sorenstam's scores at the end of
each round. But she does not dwell on them, even though Sorenstam
has cut Webb's lead in the Player of the Year race by more than 100
points in the past three months. Heading into the Open, Webb has
197 points. Sorenstam has 175.93. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do anything about the way Annika is playing,'' Webb
said. ``And she's playing great. I can only do my best. And if my
best isn't No. 1 at the end of the year, I'm still going to be
happy with the way things have gone.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peers, on the other hand, are becoming resigned to aiming for
the third spot on a weekly basis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I always felt I was good enough to be one of the best
players,'' said Laura Davies, a 19-event winner in her 13-year
career. ``But now, because of what they're doing, I'm not good
enough and I need to get better. So I'm hitting a few more shots
every day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Webb and Sorenstam, on the other hand, are hitting a few less
shots every tournament. That's why they figure as co-favorites at
the U.S. Women's Open. &QL;

By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ After two days off, during which Marion Jones
had time to check with her investment guy and Michael Johnson could
decide which color million-dollar Nikes he'll wear next, it will be
back today to the business of picking Olympians.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials resume with the opening
events of the decathlon and with finals scheduled in the men's
javelin throw and 3,000-meter steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
   Another sold-out crowd of 23,000 is expected at dusty Hornet
Stadium on the campus of Cal State-Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly chorus of applause for the new Olympians has been
raising both eyebrows and questions.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Lamine Diack, the new president of the
International Amateur Athletic Federation, the world governing body
for track and field, praised these trials and proclaimed them
indicative of the ``tremendous strength of athletics in America.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there isn't a lot else going on in Sacramento
these two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first four of the eight days of competition,
grizzled track watchers are describing the meet as decidedly ...
well, ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   No world records. Minimal upsets. The closest thing to an
intriguing storyline has been Johnson's tell-it-like-it-is
commentary in ``USA Today,'' during which he supposedly dissed,
among others, fellow sprinters Maurice Greene and Inger Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Both made the Olympic team in the men's and women's 100 meters,
respectively. And then they took off on His Goldenness for (pick
one) having an opinion, calling his coach a coach and not a
``guru,'' and showing up in a new curly hair style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's cute,'' said Antonio Pettigrew, who finished
third to Johnson in the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Johnson politely responded.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Greene, as expected, won the 100. Jones quelled
Miller's yapping and won the women's 100, and then continued her
quest for five Sydney gold medals by making the team in the long
jump.
</P>
<P>
   The top three women's 1,500-meter runners all made the team _
Regina Jacobs, Suzy Favor-Hamilton and Marla Runyan. And the
country's No. 1-ranked shot putter, C.J. Hunter, survived a flurry
of 70-foot throws to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   The lone shocker of the first four days of competition came in
the men's pole vault, where American record-holder Jeff Hartwig
complained about his contact lenses being fogged and failed to
clear a height in the qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, you would never know it from the four days of cheers. There
are high school football stadiums in Texas bigger than Hornet
Stadium. And the dirt concourses beneath the bleachers have been
wreaking havoc on camera lenses, white Nikes and reporters' laptop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Diack said, ``I think what's happening here will help
tremendously. On my travel here, I found that everyone in the world
now is watching these trials. I saw it was on television in
Nigeria, in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be successful in the coming years if we continue to
have this kind of progress in our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The likely withdrawal of Dan O'Brien from the decathlon due to
injury won't help the excitement level of the next three days. But
the final day, Sunday, is expected to be dramatic, featuring the
likely showdown in the 200 between Johnson and Greene. nn

EMMITT SMITH SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON THIS SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Emmitt Smith knows how to hold court.
Minutes after the Cowboys' morning workout at Midwestern State
University ended yesterday, the NFL's leading active rusher stood
in the middle of the practice field and talked 20 minutes about
what's on his mind, as well as what he tries to keep off his mind.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent retirements of Michael Irving and Daryl ``Moose''
Johnston have left him feeling, well, like there has been a death
in the family. He has grieved. He has mourned. He now is moving on.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're Emmitt Smith, with 13,963 career rushing yards
after 10 seasons with the Cowboys and you have only Walter Payton
(16,726) and Barry Sanders (15,269) ahead of you on the NFL's
all-time rushing list, you're careful not to get ``too'' far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith needs 1,307 yards to pass Sanders, who remains retired
after coming to that decision a year ago this month, and 2,764
yards to pass Payton for the NFL record ... but Smith says his mind
is on this day, this camp, this season, and nothing beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Campo said yesterday that the emphasis on the
Cowboys' passing attack with off-season acquisitions of Joey
Galloway and Jackie Harris to complement Rocket Ismail shouldn't
pre-empt the notion that the Cowboys will be an Emmitt Smith
running team again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some weapons in the throwing game, but I don't want
anyone to get the impression that we're not going to be a running
football team,'' Campo said. ``Because to win, we have to be able
to run the football and be a physical, power-running football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 31, doesn't know what to expect as far as his number of
carries or his number of touches in what is a return of the
Cowboys' old Super Bowl offense with some modifications. He is
coming off his busiest season (329 carries, 1,397 yards) since
1995, and that included missing 10 quarters because of hand and
groin injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Smith had to say:
</P>
<P>
   Question: How tough has it been to watch three-time Super Bowl
championship teammates such as Irvin and Johnston retire?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``It's been tough. People might think that it's hard to
get close to people when you're in the business of a revolving
door, but you do get close and then players like Daryl and Michael
retire. I mean, it lets you know the reality that your day is
coming. Do y'all pick up on the key word that these \Rretired\S
guys use? ``Family.'' Well, now it's like a person in your family
has just died. In reality, they move on to the real world. But in
the sports world, they're with you in spirit, but they're no longer
with you in body.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, what do you do?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``What do you do when somebody dies in your family? You go in
mourning, then eventually you pick yourself up and move forward.
I'm picking myself up and moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there comfort in seeing No. 8 _ Troy Aikman _ still in the
huddle?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Yes, some comfort. But we're coming down to the last of the
Mohicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Erik Williams' agent is now saying that Williams is
contemplating retirement. What do you make of that, and did you see
if coming?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``All this is new to me. But it's Erik's decision, so let the
man make it. It's not my job to guess or judge if he's making the
right decision. My job is to get here, play football and help this
team win. I hope Erik can get on board with us. And when that day
happens, it's up to him to be prepared. Right now, I'm not going to
worry about it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much do you think about breaking Walter Payton's record?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``That's down the road. I'll just take it one day at a time
and keep moving toward that mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You caught 40 to 60 passes per season in the Norv Turner and
Ernie Zampese offenses of the '90s. You're getting back to that
same basic philosophy. Do you anticipate getting more touches this
season?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``In the old system, I got both \Rrushes and catches\S. But I
don't see that happening in this system because I think I'll still
be spared playing on third down.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a realistic goal for the 2000 Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I agree with Troy. Realistically, a goal of going to the
Super Bowl is not something that is unattainable. But it's going to
take a lot of work, a lot of blessings and a lot prayers to stay
healthy.'' nn

ERIK WILLIAMS STILL ABSENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. and RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Offensive tackle Erik Williams'
holdout//retirement continued to hover over Cowboys training camp
yesterday at Midwestern State University.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another day only resulted in more questions.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams indeed plans to retire and has contemplated this for
more than a year, as his agent Alan Herman has said, why would he
wait until the week of training camp to spring the news on the
Cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   Doing it now puts the Cowboys in a bind, as they formulated
their plans for the season with Williams part of the mix. They now
are limited in what they can do to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the way the Cowboys have stood by the 10-year
veteran Williams during his troubles earlier in his career, didn't
he owe them more notice?
</P>
<P>
   And if Williams told the Cowboys about his plans to retire, as
Herman has also said, then why don't the Cowboys totally believe
that he's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for him to announce something,'' a Cowboys
official said. ``He's got to say something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys hesitancy to believe Williams' decision is final was
embodied by the fact that second-year offensive lineman Solomon
Page, who has been tabbed to someday replace Williams at tackle, is
practicing at tackle and guard, the position he would play if
Williams was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you need to work the guy there,'' Cowboys coach Dave
Campo said. ``There's a possibility [Williams could come back]. You
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his off-season conversation about the four-time Pro
Bowl pick's supposed loss of desire, Campo said a lot players go
through things during the off-season and change their mind. He said
Williams' work ethic in the weight room didn't show that he was
ready to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had no problems with rehabbing from off-season surgery
to remove bone spurs from his elbow and was cleared by the doctors
to practice in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erik has to be an emotional player in order to be good,''
Campo said. ``That's something we are going to find out about in
the near future. But I thought during the whole off-season he was
going to be a factor. Now he's not here, I'm disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cowboys official spotted Williams at the Cowboys' Valley Ranch
Headquarters on Monday getting work out gear.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the money issues? Of course, Herman said
Williams is set financially for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   However, if he walks away from the game now, he would be walking
away from roughly $5.4 million over the next two years _ $1.9
million in each of the next two years in salary, while also
repaying the Cowboys $1.6 million in already paid signing bonus
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all good questions,'' Campo said. ``But you asked
them, not me.''
WILLIAMS' SPOT CLEARED The Cowboys officially placed Erik Williams
on the Reserve/Did Not Report list, thus freeing a roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Cowboys have not given up hope that Williams will
return, they are going to take advantage of the situation and bring
in another player to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent receiver Darren Hall, a Colorado State product, could
be on the field as early as today. He was expected to come to
Wichita Falls last night and sign a contract.
ZELLNER SPRAINS KNEE The Cowboys' already thin defensive end spot
took a hit yesterday when Peppi Zellner, who is subbing for Greg
Ellis (fractured leg), left the afternoon practice with a sprained
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Zellner underwent an MRI last night. Results of the test won't
be known until today.
COUNTDOWN TO KICKOFF
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys got more than just a pass-catching tight end when
they signed Jackie Harris away from the Tennessee Titans this past
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, beginning his 11th NFL season, is judge and jury of a
new Kangaroo Court that has been started among the offensive
players. It is meant to heighten their level of concentration by
lightening their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   The fine schedule, as imposed by Harris:
</P>
<P>
   Throw an interception _ $10
</P>
<P>
   Fumble the ball _ $5
</P>
<P>
   Drop a pass _ $1
</P>
<P>
   Bobble a catch _ $1
</P>
<P>
   Miss an assignment _ $1
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Campo is an enthusiast of the court because it
enables the players to concentrate on eliminating mistakes while at
the same time having some fun among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing an interception yesterday morning in which the
ball whistled throw Joey Galloway's hands, quarterback Troy Aikman
jokingly made an appeal that maybe Galloway should be fined $11 for
the drop ``and'' the interception.
</P>
<P>
   The motion was denied.
SPOTLIGHT ON SAFETY CHRIS AKINS Height: 5-foot-11 Weight: 195
pounds College: Arkansas-Pine Bluff Experience: Second year
Scouting Report: Is one of the team's top players in terms of
athletic ability. Combine that with a hard-nosed attitude, and it's
little wonder Akins is considered a demon on special teams. The
only concern is his pass defense and whether he can show enough
progress to contribute in nickel situations. He is battling Jason
Kaiser for playing time behind starters George Teague and Darren
Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know? Akins is a second cousin of Cowboys tight end
Jackie Harris.
WHO'S HOT
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo got hot tempered during the middle
drill yesterday morning. After a couple of penalties, he called the
team together and erupted into a profanity-laced tirade about the
importance of being focused in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman and tight end Jackie Harris
showed quickly they are bonding with each other _ while rudely
introducing rookie linebacker Orantes Grant to the NFL _ when the
two hooked up on a deep sideline pass in the morning practice.
Harris, split out wide right, just ran by Grant and hauled in a
perfect aerial from Aikman.
WHO'S NOT
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jorge Diaz was helpless competing in pass rushing drill
against defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman, who easily drove him back
one time and then tossed him aside for a quarterback sack the next
time.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Peppi Zellner likes the idea of replacing Greg
Ellis (fractured leg) in the starting lineup. However, he might not
like going up against offensive tackle Flozell Adams, who
thoroughly dominated Zellner in a pass rushing drill.
INJURY REPORT Today's Injuries:
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Peppi Zellner (sprained knee) _ underwent MRI last
night.

not have gotten some of the visibility that some other teams have
gotten in what they did in the off-season, but I believe we were
very aggressive in getting the players at the positions we needed.
It has really created competition at wide receiver, secondary,
linebacker and defensive line. It also gives us a chance to have
depth ... maybe superior depth to anything we've enjoyed over the
last four or five years.'' \Nname: _ Jerry Jones

LOS ALAMOS, LIVERMORE LABS CLAIM ENERGY DEPT. TO BLAME
FOR  SECURITY TROUBLES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ and BERNADETTE TANSEY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the wake of accusations of lax security at
the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratories,
officials from the University of California and the labs claimed
Wednesday they are being scapegoated for Energy Department
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos Director John Browne said the department has relaxed
its procedures for safeguarding weapons secrets and provided
inadequate funding for security measures that were deemed necessary
at the two labs managed by the university.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said the Energy Department never responded to a 1999 memo
from lab directors at the Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Sandia
national laboratories calling for bar-coded tracking devices on
classified computer storage media.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rules aren't adequate, is that the responsibility of
the DOE or the University of California? I maintain it is the
responsibility of DOE,'' Browne said at a meeting of the UC Regents
in San Francisco. ``If we don't have the resources or we don't have
the appropriate rules, the university is put in an awkward position
in oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Regent Ward Connerly said the barrage of criticism against the
university from Congress and the Department of Energy has been
fueled by election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public needs to understand we are just as concerned about
national security as anyone. The university is not asleep at the
wheel,'' said Connerly.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department Deputy Secretary T.J. Glauthier responded by
phone, saying that Energy Department security policies were strong
enough but lab scientists did not follow agency rules requiring
that visitors log in when visiting vaults containing classified
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``If procedures we did have in place had been followed, those
hard drives would not have disappeared,'' said Glauthier,
Richardson's top assistant.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of the security scandal at Los Alamos,
Glauthier said the agency will now require bar-code tracking of
classified files, and it will increase funding for security
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in a way, John (Browne) is right that we have a
shared responsibility here,'' Glauthier said. ``We shouldn't get
into a finger-pointing exercise of who's at fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of both the Energy Department and the university
erupted when two hard drives packed with nuclear weapons secrets
went missing at Los Alamos earlier this year. The missing hard
drives were discovered months later behind a copy machine, and the
FBI is now trying to find out where they were and whether they
might have been copied or shared with unauthorized people.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drives turned up missing while the agency and the lab
were under scrutiny for the controversy surrounding scientist Wen
Ho Lee, who was indicted for allegedly transferring secret files
out of secured computers.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced last month he may end
UC's decades-long record as the sole manager of the two nuclear
labs and assign security functions to another contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The university is cooperating with the Energy Department as it
studies hiring a security contractor, but Browne has reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine a separate group of people coming in and
saying, `We are responsible for security,' because the individual
employees have the actual information in their hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a regent by virtue of his office,
blasted Browne at the meeting for the lab's security problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are responsible, this university is responsible. If we are
going to take the responsibility of running these two facilities,
we cannot continue to have these kind of breaches,'' Bustamante
said. ``We owe it to the security of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Browne insisted that he and other lab officials did make
attempts to tighten security.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, Browne and the directors of Lawrence Livermore
and Sandia national labs faxed a memo to the Energy Department's
deputy director, Ernie Moniz, requesting a better system for
managing classified information.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, then Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary loosened
controls on classified information. The directors wanted to return
to a bar-coded tracking system such as the one used before the end
of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   They never heard back from the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't been able to find the information we faxed to
them,'' Browne said he was told last week.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier said the memo was lost because it did not come through
regular channels of correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   After the recent debacle with the missing hard drives, Browne
and Lawrence Livermore lab director Bruce Tarter started their own
tracking systems, without additional funding from the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said his lab has bar coded 60,000 pieces of ``high
density media,'' including computer discs and hard drives. But it
will take about $60 million, he said, to tag all of the lab's 6
million pieces, and the lab does not have the funds in its $1
billion operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking system may not have protected the missing hard
drives, but it could have provided a record of who had them before
they disappeared, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the management contract at the labs could prove both
embarrassing and costly to UC.
</P>
<P>
   UC receives $11 million a year to defray the costs of its
overhead in managing the two nuclear labs, as well as Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, for the Department of Energy. UC can
receive as much as $14 million in extra fees depending on its
performance ratings.

MEDIA BYTES: DRIVE TO SUCCEED CONTRIBUTES TO DEMISE OF
YOUNG  DOT-COM EXEC
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Aaron Bunnell was the boss' son _ there was no
escaping it.
</P>
<P>
   But if working for his dad, tech magazine pioneer and Upside
Media Chief Executive Officer David Bunnell, meant that he could
slack off, he sure didn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell drove himself relentlessly, working all hours, pushing
his underdog Web site to greater heights.
</P>
<P>
   But that drive may have ultimately contributed to his demise. On
Monday, Aaron Bunnell, 26, was found dead in his room at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A champagne bottle was in the room, and his father, who flew to
New York immediately upon hearing the news, believes he may have
been taking uppers to fuel his work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from a couple of his friends that he was getting very
burned out,'' said David Bunnell, a well-known tech publishing
figure who founded PC, PC World, MacWorld and other magazines. ``He
may have been stimulating himself to keep going and going. He
pushed it too far.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City medical examiner is investigating, and Bunnell
said it may take six weeks to get the results.
</P>
<P>
   But the story that emerged as news of the death spread was of a
young, ambitious dot-com executive who poured everything into his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this dot-com atmosphere, people get totally fixated on
work,'' said Adam Feuerstein, a senior writer at Upside Today, the
Web business that Aaron Bunnell spearheaded. ``It becomes their
obsession. Aaron worked all the time. If the software wasn't right,
he was in programming something. He worked and worked and worked.
You've got to step back, have some balance in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Bunnell apparently knew he was working too hard, and,
according to his father, he had talked about cashing out his stock
options when the time was right and going back to his true passion:
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Bunnell had been in the prestigious filmmaking program at
the University of Southern California and was making documentaries
about World War II when he got the call from his father.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago, and David Bunnell was looking to expand
Upside's Web presence. ``We were just running on fumes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked him into coming up for a short time and doing some
work for me,'' Bunnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron moved in with his father, and the two drove to work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, David Bunnell paid his son out of his own pocket, but
when he saw how hard Aaron was working, he gave him a staff job. To
quell talk of nepotism, he had Aaron reporting to Gini Talmadge,
the company president and group publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he put Aaron in charge of the Internet team and
started growing the online business. About 25 people work for the
Web site  &LR; (www.upside.com &LR; ), and Aaron had risen to become vice
president and editorial director of the online business. (The site
now features a tribute to Aaron from colleagues and other friends.)
</P>
<P>
   Adam Feuerstein remembers his job interview with Aaron Bunnell:
``We sat down, and he was wearing a ratty T-shirt and had a
baseball cap on backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take long for Feuerstein to see that ``he was one
of the savviest people when it came to new media and the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real casual. He wore flip-flops to work and T-shirts
with holes in them, but he was really serious about his work,''
said Sylvia Carr, a senior editor on the site.
</P>
<P>
   He instilled the site with a sense of whimsy: It features a
``dot-com graveyard,'' mocking Internet firms that have gone out of
business, and each week it puts a different high-tech personality
on trial, with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison being found guilty of
immoral conduct, and Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy being found
guilty of having a big mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell became something of a cheerleader, praising reporters
for their scoops, hailing every small victory. ``He definitely
celebrated with his staff,'' Carr said. ``We felt important to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   His hard work and his drinking may have taken a toll, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very worried about him working so late. I don't think he
was taking very good care of himself,'' Bunnell said. ``I knew he
drank. He would even have a few drinks and go back to the office.
He worked until 4 a.m. frequently. Sometimes he would work so late,
he would check into a hotel nearby. Other times, he would just
sleep on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to New York last week to help develop a new Internet
radio venture, opening an office and studio for another 25 people.
His meetings had apparently gone well, colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll still be able to do it,'' said David Bunnell.
``If we can do it, we'll dedicate it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein said it was odd that no one had received an e-mail
from Aaron on Sunday; colleagues were accustomed to hearing from
him at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, David Bunnell received a call from a New York police
detective that a hotel worker had found Aaron in his hotel room.
David Bunnell flew to New York right away. Aaron's body will be
sent to Albuquerque, N.M., where his mother lives and where a
funeral will be held. There will also be a service in San
Francisco, possibly next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest part for me is that he lived with me these past
couple years and we rode together in the car to work,'' said David
Bunnell. ``This was precious time that can never be replaced. Aaron
was my constant companion and friend. We went to basketball and
baseball games together after work. He was funny and smart and
really hip to the dot-com world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what he would have done,'' Bunnell said. ``At age
26, he was far ahead of me and I was really proud of this. It is a
great painful loss for me and a loss, I think, for the world at
large.''

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: EASY TIPS TO REGISTER DOT-COM  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: We'd like to register the name of our new business as a Web
address. Can you steer us to a company or two that can handle the
registration process? And how much does it cost?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Two of the leading companies in the field are Network Solutions
(www.nsi.com) and Register.com (www.register.com). Either one will
let you quickly search to see if the address you want is available,
and _ if it is _ let you register it for as little as $35 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be disappointed, however, if your choice of a dot-com name
already has been taken by someone else. Most common words in the
English language _ and lots of uncommon ones as well _ have long
since been registered as Web addresses. You may have to get
creative to come up with a variation of your name that will be
available as a dot-com. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Internet Offers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm thinking about buying a new PC and have been intrigued by
the $400 rebate I can get if I sign up for three years of Internet
service (from Microsoft Network). It sounds almost too good to be
true. And you know what they say about that: If it sounds too good
to be true, it probably is. So what's the catch?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: There is no catch. Microsoft is just trying to attract new users
to its Internet service, which has not been as popular as the
company had hoped it would be. And the rebate strategy (plus some
good TV advertising) seems to be working. In the quarter that ended
in June, Microsoft signed up some 800,000 new MSN customers and now
has a total of 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   MSN is as good as any other ISP, so committing to a three-year
deal isn't the worst thing in the world. On the other hand, if
you're willing to put up with an on-screen ad banner, you can get
Internet access for free from companies like NetZero,
FreeInternet.com and Juno. And over a three-year period, that would
save you nearly twice as much as the $400 rebate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Add Attachments
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How do I e-mail a document? It has columns, and I am unable to
copy and paste it into an e-mail message. I use America Online.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Any document that includes special formatting such as columns
should be sent as an attachment. That way, it accompanies the
e-mail without actually being part of it, and the formatting is
preserved. Attachments are a great way to send all kinds of files,
including photos.
</P>
<P>
   The only caveat is that the recipient must have software capable
of opening and viewing the attachments you send. But that's not
much of a problem because Microsoft Word and Excel have become the
lingua franca of word processors and spreadsheets, and almost
everyone has a program that can view graphics.
</P>
<P>
   In AOL version 5, you can easily attach files to e-mail. Just
open a new e-mail window, click Attachments in the lower left
corner and follow the instructions. You can even have more than one
attachment for the same message (my brother sends me several
pictures of his new daughter every time he writes).
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: When sending attachments, it's a good idea to
let the recipient know to expect its arrival. Many computer users,
wary of attachments that may be carrying computer viruses, will
automatically discard attachments from senders they don't
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Scan, Edit Forms
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: As an amateur genealogist, I send a lot of forms to government
agencies. I know I can scan and print the forms, but is it also
possible to enter information on them once they're in the computer?
That would save me lots of time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You need something like OmniForm, a $120 program (street price)
from ScanSoft that lets you scan and edit almost any kind of form.
I haven't tried it myself, but it comes from the company that also
sells OmniPage, the standard for optical character recognition
software (OCR), which turns scanned pages of text into editable
documents. So I bet it would do the job nicely for you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Bad habits are easy to fall into, and if you're not paying
attention to how you sit in front of your PC, you could wind up
with painful _ and perhaps permanent _ stress-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   You can reduce the risk by following a few simple guidelines:
Adjust your chair and keyboard height so that your feet rest
comfortably on the ground and your forearms are parallel to the
floor when you type. Raise or lower your monitor so that the top of
the screen is level with your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Always put the monitor directly in front of you, not off to the
side. And position the PC so that the light in your room _ or the
sunlight outside _ doesn't splash glare all over your screen.

 WORLDCOM FACES LAWSUIT OVER BILLING  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California attorney general's office and the
Public Utilities Commission are preparing to launch a
double-barreled lawsuit against WorldCom for improperly billing
thousands of customers in the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom, the nation's second-largest long-distance company,
sparked more than 9,000 complaints to the PUC during the past three
years, mostly over billing issues, more than any other
long-distance firm. And state regulators have already warned the
company, which also uses the MCI brand, that it needs to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``MCI is by far and away the worst big telecommunications
company in the state,'' said Charles Carbone, a consumer advocate
with the Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego consumer
group. ``Any action is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit could be filed as early as Thursday said a government
source close to the investigation. But the action has already been
delayed in the past and could still be postponed. Plus, WorldCom
could always try to avert a suit with a last-ditch settlement
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom spokesman Les Kumagai said the company couldn't comment
on any ``speculative'' action. PUC President Loretta Lynch and a
spokesman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer also declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators have already cracked down on WorldCom elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the New York State Public Service Commission fined
WorldCom $50,000 for slamming customers _ switching their telephone
service without permission. It also threatened to fine the company
$3 million unless it reduces complaint levels for local service.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, WorldCom agreed to pay the U.S. government $3.5
million to settle federal charges that the company slammed
customers. The Federal Communications Commission said it received
2,900 slamming complaints about WorldCom last year, more than any
other long-distance firm.
</P>
<P>
   California regulators helped the FCC with its investigation and
found that WorldCom also received far more slamming complaints in
California than any other long-distance provider. A source said the
main thrust of the state's case against WorldCom would also focus
on slamming complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kenyon, who lives in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury
neighborhood, said she was slammed twice by the company in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon, who uses MCI for her local phone company, said the firm
suddenly claimed her as a long-distance customer last spring. She
immediately called and wrote the phone company. But, Kenyon said,
``Nothing happened until I contacted the PUC,'' which ordered MCI
to switch her back and give her a $400 refund.
</P>
<P>
   Then in May, Kenyon said, it happened again. Kenyon, who works
for a Marin nonprofit that investigates housing complaints, said
the PUC ordered MCI to give her an $800 refund and switch her
service back again. This time, Kenyon also dropped MCI as her local
phone service. ``It doesn't pay for the stress of living through
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom declined to discuss the slamming complaints. But when
it settled the FCC case, it blamed the problem on a ``few sales
employees, who have since been terminated.'' WorldCom also created
a 200-person ``consumer affairs and quality'' team to reduce
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, state regulators are concerned that even when
customers cancel WorldCom's service, the company sometimes
continues to bill those customers. A PUC judge, for instance, is
considering whether to sanction WorldCom because of complaints that
the phone company refused to stop billing about 50 customers for
local phone service after they signed up with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically said their billing system was so screwed up
they couldn't fix it,'' said Carbone, the consumer advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Another customer, Mrs. Holden in Oakland, who asked that her
first name not be used, said MCI started misbilling her after she
switched calling plans.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company kept charging her the minimum fees for the
old calling plan (somewhere between $4 to $6 per month, she
recalled). Then, the company neglected to send her bills itemizing
the calls under the new plan. Instead, she just received a past-due
notice demanding payment.
</P>
<P>
   Holden said the company mostly ignored her complaints until she
sent a letter to the PUC and watchdog groups. Then, she suddenly
received copies of the bills via overnight mail. ``It's one of
those little annoyances,'' said Holden.
</P>
<P>
   Although WorldCom declined to comment about the PUC complaints
for this article, company executives have said in previous
interviews that they receive more complaints than rivals because
they spend more on telemarketing and aggressively signing up new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives also say complaints have fallen in recent months.
Through the early part of this year, WorldCom generated 45 percent
fewer complaints filed with the PUC than AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at a pretty good trend,'' said Sally McMahon,
WorldCom's vice president of consumer affairs and quality in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But WorldCom still received far more complaints per customer
than AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T has roughly three times as many customers as
WorldCom nationwide, and the ratio is even greater in California.

 APPLE'S NEW PRODUCT LINE IS SLEEK AND SIMPLE  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The speeds, feeds and colors keep changing, but not
the formula that's brought Apple Computer back from the brink since
the second coming of Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino, Calif., company Wednesday updated its entire
lineup of desktop computers, from entry-level iMacs to powerhouse
G4s. But the principles behind the products Jobs introduced during
a long keynote presentation at New York's semiannual Macworld Expo
trade show are the same ones he's focused on since retaking the
Apple helm three years ago this month: The only viable alternative
to the me-too PC game is to combine style and simplicity with
cutting-edge technologies, backed by slick marketing and
competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new products unveiled Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   -- G4 Cube. The most eye catching of the new Macs _ and without
question the most original new computer, in terms of industrial
design, since the iMac first appeared in 1998 _ is the Power Mac G4
Cube.
</P>
<P>
   Due early next month at $1,799, it packs all the power (though,
of course, none of the expandability) of the company's big G4
desktop models into an 8-inch white cube suspended in a clear
plastic enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Jobs' long-standing distaste for the fans that
generate the steady hum most computers make, the cube is cooled
entirely by convection, through a ventilation channel that runs
vertically through the machine. (Just don't put a book on top.) The
slot-loading DVD-ROM drive also opens at the top, popping out
ejected discs like a toaster.
</P>
<P>
   The system is so quiet that even when the hard drive is
spinning, it emits only about 20 decibels _ about as much as a
whisper at 15 feet, according to Phil Schiller, Apple's vice
president of worldwide marketing.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to fill the void with more pleasant sounds,
the cube will come with external speakers, encased in spheres of
clear plastic, that were co-designed by Apple and Harman
Multimedia, the Northridge (Los Angeles County) maker of high-end
audio components.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Apple classifies the cube as part of its
``professional'' product line, and Schiller said the company
expects it to appeal to graphic artists and designers who don't
need the slots and bays that take up most of the space in the other
G4 models, as well as to executives, consultants, small-business
owners, academics and other professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But to judge by the crowd swarming around the cubes on display
in New York's Javits Convention Center, the stylish new machine
will appeal to a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want one because it doesn't take up a lot of room on your
desk,'' said Chris Nelson, 10, of Niskayuna, N.Y., who said he now
uses a PowerBook portable. Marty Butherus, information-technology
manager at a St. Louis manufacturing company that runs entirely on
Macs, said he was interested for the same reason: ``Remember,
people have to have room for other things on their desks,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Bontempo, a high-school student from Mentor, Ohio, said
he's ``ready to dip into the college fund'' to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   -- New iMacs. For the families and schools who are again
becoming Apple's bread and butter, as they were in the age of the
Apple II, Jobs rolled four new iMac configurations, featuring new
colors _ indigo, ruby, sage (gray-green) and snow _ and roomier
hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   And he cut $200 from the price of admission to the Mac world:
The new entry-level model, still called simply the iMac but now
indigo instead of blueberry, will sell for $799 when it ships in
September.
</P>
<P>
   For $999, previously the price of the low-end iMac, users can
now get a new version of the more advanced iMac DV, which offers a
wider choice of colors, a slightly faster processor, a bigger hard
drive and built-in support for wireless networking, with the
addition of Apple's $99 AirPort card.
</P>
<P>
   The DV version, like the new $1,299 iMac DV+ and the $1,499 iMac
DV Special Edition (now in ``snow'' as well as graphite colors),
also offers digital video editing capabilities: All three have
high-speed FireWire ports for connecting digital camcorders (as
well as a growing selection of other peripherals), and they'll come
with a new version of Apple's iMovie editing software.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the $799 iMac, the other three new configurations are
available immediately, according to Apple. To promote them, the
company is launching a TV ad campaign that will show them off to
such tunes as ``Blue Suede Shoes,'' ``Ruby, Ruby'' and the Kermit
classic ``It's Not Easy Being Green.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Dual-processor Power Mac G4s. Jobs began the ``professional''
portion of his presentation with a demonstration intended to show
that current top-of-the-line Macs outperform the fastest Windows
PCs on the market _ even though the fastest version of Apple's
processor, the PowerPC G4, runs at 500 megahertz, only half the
clock speed of today's fastest Intel Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 500-megahertz Mac completed a sequence of Adobe
Photoshop operations used to produce a poster for Disney's
``Inspector Gadget'' movie in 100 seconds, versus 124 seconds for
the gigahertz Pentium III PC.
</P>
<P>
   But then Jobs announced a step long rumored among Apple
watchers, but not generally expected this week: Starting Thursday,
the company will ship two processors as standard equipment in its
high Power Mac G4 models. He then ran the Photoshop sequence again,
this time on a system with two 500-megahertz G4s, where it took
only 61 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs then compounded the surprise by declaring that the extra
chip won't change prices: The 450-megahertz Power Mac G4, now with
dual processors, will sell for $2,499, the same as the previous
450-megahertz single-processor G4 system, and the 500-megahertz
equivalent will stay at $3,499.
</P>
<P>
   The low-end G4, with a single 400-megahertz chip, will retain
its $1,599 price.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Photoshop is one of only a handful of Mac programs that
can take advantage of multiprocessing under the current version of
the Mac operating system. But Photoshop is a key application in the
publishing and graphics marketplace, so the extra performance in
that program alone could reinforce Apple's already strong position
there _ even when Intel this fall delivers the Pentium 4, a chip
that is expected to give PCs a noticeable performance boost.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chizen, president of Adobe, appeared on stage to hammer
that point home, calling the new G4 models ``the ultimate Photoshop
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mac fans who don't use Photoshop won't get much benefit from the
dual-processor systems today. But that will change with the arrival
of Mac OS X, which is scheduled for release as a ``public beta'' in
September and in final form early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The new operating system will automatically distribute tasks
among both processors, so overall system performance will be
improved even when individual programs aren't optimized for
multiprocessing.
</P>
<P>
   All three conventional G4 models (but not the cube) will also
incorporate another potentially significant technological advance:
They'll have built-in support for ``gigabit Ethernet,'' a
networking scheme that moves data up to 10 times as fast as a
``100-megabit'' version used in other Macs and most new PC network
adapters _ and 100 times as fast as the classic form of Ethernet
still used in most offices.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, gigabit Ethernet adapters sold for about $1,500, and
now they're generally priced around $1,000, so building the
technology in without increasing prices makes the new Macs a real
bargain for those who need the fastest-possible network.
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure needed to run such networks, however, won't
come free: Several Mac-oriented networking companies, including
Farallon Communications and Asante Technologies, Wednesday
announced four-port gigabit Ethernet switches priced between $1,300
and $1,500 _ roughly 10 times the price of similar devices for
100-megabit networks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Monitors, mice and more. Jobs also unveiled a new generation
of Apple monitors designed to reduce cable clutter: They get power
from the computer through the same cable that carries the video
signal, so users will no longer need to connect a separate AC
cable. The new, Apple-designed cable will also carry Universal
Serial Bus signals, and the monitors will have dual USB ports where
users can connect their mouse, keyboard and other add-ons.
</P>
<P>
   The new display line includes a 15-inch flat-panel LCD priced at
$999 and a 17-inch conventional CRT in a see-through plastic case,
priced at $499, as well as a new version of Apple's $3,999 22-inch
LCD.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new displays depend on the new cable design, which
is proprietary to Apple, they'll work only with new G4 models,
including the cube.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also showed off iMovie 2, a new version of the digital
video-editing software Apple now bundles with all its desktop
models except the entry-level iMac. Among the enhancements in the
new release are a simplified user interface, better audio editing
and options to add such effects as sepia tones or to speed up or
slow down particular sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also responded, at last, to near-universal displeasure
among its customers about the small keyboard and hockey-puck-shaped
mouse it has been shipping for the past two years. Among other
improvements, the new Apple Pro Keyboard offers full-size function
keys, more navigation keys and a new key that automatically ejects
a CD.
</P>
<P>
   The new Apple Pro Mouse is more innovative: It's elliptical in
shape; it has no buttons (you simply press down on the top of the
device); and like several recently released and well-received
Microsoft mice, it relies on optical technology instead of moving
parts, so it works on almost any surface and never needs to be
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse and keyboard will be standard with all new desktop
Macs, and they'll be available, at $59 each, as an upgrade for
older USB-equipped Apple systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going from what many considered the worst mouse in the
industry to what we think is the best,'' Jobs crowed. And to the
delight of the thousands who sat through the long keynote, he
closed it by pointing out that glued to the underside of each seat
in the auditorium was a coupon entitling the user to get one of the
new mice free on the way out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The search begins not at the first hole,
but at the 17th tee, for that is where the soul of St. Andrews
lives most fiercely. The Road Hole, it is called. You know that the
infamous road bunker awaits two shots away, but standing there,
your only thought is of the building that stands no more than 100
yards from the tee, blocking your view of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   What is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Old sheds,'' said the marshal. ``Used to be for the machines,
but now they are offices.''
</P>
<P>
   So players have to drive over the building?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aye. At least, they're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   You mean some don't?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aye, a player yesterday hit the building. A local qualifier.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the public plays? They have to hit over, too?
</P>
<P>
   The marshal nodded yes and smiled. ``Aye, why do you think there
are no windows on that side?''
</P>
<P>
   Aye, indeed. The 129th British Open has once again taken us to
St. Andrews, which has no equal simply because it has never tried
to be anything but what it is. Sitting in the shadows of history
that are so daunting they are measured in centuries, not decades,
St. Andrews remains the world's most beloved golf course,
withstanding not only the fury of Mother Nature but the wrath of
disgruntled players through the years.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he played here, Bobby Jones tore up his scorecard
and stormed off. Sam Snead in 1946 described it as looking like
``an abandoned golf course,'' and in recent years players such as
Scott Hoch and Lee Westwood have expressed their displeasure with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not enjoyed it so much,'' said Westwood, who once told
Mark James that St. Andrews wasn't in his Top 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Scotland?'' asked James.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Fife,'' snapped Westwood, who concedes that his only visits
to the birthplace of golf have come in October, when it has been
cold and wet. In the days leading up to the British Open, it has
been warm and dry, so perhaps there is hope, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand what the former champions around here say,
Seve (Ballesteros) and Tom Watson, people like that,'' said
Westwood. ``The first time (they came here) they didn't
particularly like it, but it has grown on them. I can see that
happening to me.''
</P>
<P>
   If it does, Westwood will join a fraternity that surely numbers
in the millions, for St. Andrews elicits more passion than any
other golf course. Just being here is a sacred experience, these
people will tell you, and you are on a golf course that is like no
other you have seen.
</P>
<P>
   Bless them, for they are right.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When St. Andrews was designed in about the year 1400, the
architect did not subscribe to the theory that golf should be fair.
The architect, of course, was Mother Nature, and caretakers of this
piece of property _ most especially Old Tom Morris from 1865-1903 _
have taken great care not to alter what she had intended.
</P>
<P>
   Morris widened some fairways, built the first and 18th greens as
they are today, and was responsible for adding sand to help grow
the grasses that are dominant here. The layout, however, was
dictated by nature and is quite simplistic _ nine holes out, nine
holes in.
</P>
<P>
   What you find along the way, however, is one of the most
challenging tests the game of golf can provide.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, there are 112 bunkers. Deep, nasty pot bunkers,
with steep walls and fluffy sand. They are hidden well, holes in
the ground, really, with steep faces that will make some players
consider hitting out sideways or even taking an unplayable lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a mine field,'' said Bob Estes, who first saw St.
Andrews with his college golf team in 1985. ``The pot bunkers are
the mines. You just don't want to go in them. They're like
miniature water hazards, where, if you go in them you'll lose one
or maybe two shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the greens, all of them with undulations that
easily roll approaches far off line, forcing players to face lag
putts upwards of 100 feet. There are just four free-standing greens
_ the first, ninth, 17th, and 18th. The rest are double-greens. The
second green is also the 16th; the third also the 15th; the fourth
and 14th; the fifth and 13th; the sixth and 12th; the seventh and
11th; the eighth and 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Where to hit? You can't aim down the tree line because there are
no trees. Rough line? There's no rough to speak of. Aim at the
bunkers? Sure, though many times you can't see them. So what?
</P>
<P>
   The players will get a break this week. It's the British Open, a
huge attraction to spectators and a TV bonanza. Which means
construction objects. ``If you had to play this golf course without
having the TV towers and bleachers, you'd have no idea where to hit
it,'' said Tom Scherrer, who is making his British Open debut and
saw St. Andrews for the first time Monday. ``Half of us wouldn't
have any idea where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they will know when to go, because hidden from view
on many of the holes are marshals who obediently pop into action
from out of the gorse and heather at certain points on the course.
They will wave red flags to tell you the group ahead is still in
range, green flags to advise all is clear.
</P>
<P>
   On his first visit to St. Andrews, in 1970, Tom Weiskopf looked
around and wondered what he had gotten himself into.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, this is so different. I had read about it, heard
about it, and I wanted to experience it, but I didn't know. I
didn't dislike it, but I said to myself, `I don't have the game for
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the 18th, he turned to his caddie and asked for a
sight line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father time,'' said his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me?'' said Weiskopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father time,'' said the caddie, pointing down the fairway,
more than 350 yards away to a building with a clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to aim for the clock, and so I did,'' said Weiskopf,
who soon fell in love with St. Andrews and links golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never played this kind of golf, but I was going to learn
how to play it. And it made me a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rock-hard fairways and wind. ``It's the only defense the course
has,'' said Peter Thomson, who won his five British Opens on
different venues, including St. Andrews in 1956. He adores the
place, embraces its tradition, and understands that it will test a
player's nerve as much as his skill.
</P>
<P>
   That St. Andrews has changed so little over the years makes
Thomson happy. When players go in a bunker here, they are
penalized, which, he reasons, is what a bunker should do. There are
times when you will get a bad bounce, other times when you get a
good bounce, and isn't that the glory of golf, he further reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, John Daly won here during a week in which the wind
howled at various times. He shot 6-under 282, which was the highest
winning score in a British Open in nearly 10 years. In 1990, when
the wind was down, Nick Faldo posted 18-under 270, still a record
for the 24 British Opens that have been held here.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Estes, is the appeal to the place. ``They let nature
dictate the course conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no manipulation, no changing the elements. It is what it
is.
</P>
<P>
   That means at least four par 4s _ including the 357-yard 18th _
will be driven by a host of players. That means if your ball comes
to rest against the lip of a pot bunker, you may have to just slam
it into the wall and hope it bounces out. That means, if you end up
on the road behind the 17th green, you need to play it where it
lies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it means that the building in front of the 17th is
in play. You have to drive over it to a fairway you can't see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's greatest par 4 in the world. Without a doubt,''
said Weiskopf, whose love affair with this tournament paid off with
a victory in 1973 at Royal Troon. He has become one of the world's
most sought-after course architects, but never could he draw up
something where you hit over a building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great, isn't it? That's part of it. What's wrong with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. Not a thing. Just as long as you pick out the correct
line. Which is? Well, caddies offer varying advice, though commonly
they will tell you to look at the big, white words ``Old Course
Hotel,'' take aim at the letter `C,' and have a little fade on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Estes laughed. ``I'm not that good that I can aim at a letter. I
aim at a word.''

 OFFICE FOR MAC IS A MUST-HAVE  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the common view of Microsoft and Apple
as archenemies, the reality is that Microsoft makes the lion's
share of Mac software. Its offerings dominate virtually every basic
category, from word processing and spreadsheets to e-mail and Web
browsing.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, especially in the early '90s when
Microsoft was working to establish Windows, updates to these core
Mac products were few and far between. They also lagged
considerably behind their Windows counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation _ antitrust jitters or simply a
recognition that there is money to be made in the resurgent Mac
market _ that neglect has turned around sharply in the past year or
two. Microsoft's Explorer 5 Web browser for Mac, for example,
boasts a truly Mac-like interface and many features not found in
the Windows version.
</P>
<P>
   At Macworld Expo NYC on Wednesday, Microsoft took the wraps off
the revamp of its flagship Office suite for Mac, which includes
Word (word processor), Excel (spreadsheet), PowerPoint
(presentation program) and Entourage (a new personal information
manager/e-mail application).
</P>
<P>
   While current users will find it reassuringly familiar, Office
2001 is a major overhaul. Most of the rework centers on making it
easier to use, more Mac-like and more integrated. This is in stark
contrast to earlier versions that kept adding layers upon layers of
obscure features, few of which were ever used.
</P>
<P>
   With Office 2001, Microsoft has added hundreds of templates,
sample projects and clip art files, all designed to get users up
and running quickly. The sample files do more than serve as
shortcuts, however. They spark ideas and offer professional design.
Some examples are newsletters, brochures, financial forms, resumes,
Web pages and labels.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've chosen a template (or just opened a plain document),
you're greeted with the new interface, which looks much like that
in Explorer 5, and takes advantage of Mac OS 9's built-in
appearance manager. Toolbars and palettes now float anywhere,
making it easy to customize your desktop for each application.
</P>
<P>
   Toolbars and palettes also facilitate much of the integration in
the new Office. For example, a Web browser toolbar in Word takes
you directly to Explorer, while the Data Merge Manager palette
makes it simple to do a mail merge with address book information
from Entourage or other standard database files. And the mail merge
can result in either printable documents or e-mail, a major new
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Another cool new feature that facilitates sharing info between
the various Office applications is Collect and Paste. This lets you
clip text, tables, pictures, charts, etc. and place them all on one
big clipboard for pasting anywhere else, separately, or all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that 81 percent of Mac Office users operate in
cross-platform environments with PCs, which is probably a fair
assessment. So another major area of improvement is in the ease of
sharing documents with PC users. Documents are code-identical with
PC Office files, so no conversion is necessary. Further, Office
2001 can now automatically append the three-letter file extensions
native to Windows, so Windows users can simply double-click Mac
Office files to open them.
</P>
<P>
   You can also now save any Word, Excel or PowerPoint document as
a Web page, ready for posting on your site. Limited HTML export
facilities were present in earlier versions, but Office 2001 goes
much further. You can literally save an entire PowerPoint
presentation in Web format with just one mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Another handy option is to export PowerPoint presentations as
QuickTime movies. QuickTime movies can be played back on any Mac or
PC with the freely available QuickTime Player, without requiring
the PowerPoint application.
</P>
<P>
   While the improvements to Word, Excel and PowerPoint can be
viewed as incremental, no matter how useful or welcome, Entourage
is a new application that integrates well with the others and
finally brings a professional contact manager/e-mail program to the
Mac platform.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Outlook Express for Mac has e-mail and address book
functions only, without the calendar, task list and other features
available in Outlook for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could have called the new program Outlook, like the PC
application, but chose to go with a new moniker since the interface
and capabilities are quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Current users of Outlook Express for Mac will salivate over
Entourage's features. It can synchronize directly with Palm
handheld devices, import existing information from most other Mac
e-mail and contact management programs and integrates directly with
other Office applications, such as the aforementioned Mail Merge.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the calendar to keep track of due dates for Office
projects and set reminders. You can also create multiple custom
views on the information in Entourage that pertain to a particular
topic, such as all home or office work. Color-coding that works
across all facets of Entourage (e-mail, calendar, address book,
task list) also helps with organization.
</P>
<P>
   Entourage also offers support for Web standards like vCard and
iCalendar, so colleagues with PCs or Macs can make appointment
requests or send you their contact information.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2001 for Mac will ship this fall. For current Office
users it is a must-have upgrade; for others, the new emphasis on
ease-of-use, compatibility and integration should go a long way
toward erasing old objections. Entourage is simply the icing on the
cake.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: EASY TIPS TO REGISTER DOT-COM  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: We'd like to register the name of our new business as a Web
address. Can you steer us to a company or two that can handle the
registration process? And how much does it cost?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Two of the leading companies in the field are Network Solutions
(www.nsi.com) and Register.com (www.register.com). Either one will
let you quickly search to see if the address you want is available,
and _ if it is _ let you register it for as little as $35 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be disappointed, however, if your choice of a dot-com name
already has been taken by someone else. Most common words in the
English language _ and lots of uncommon ones as well _ have long
since been registered as Web addresses. You may have to get
creative to come up with a variation of your name that will be
available as a dot-com. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Internet Offers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm thinking about buying a new PC and have been intrigued by
the $400 rebate I can get if I sign up for three years of Internet
service (from Microsoft Network). It sounds almost too good to be
true. And you know what they say about that: If it sounds too good
to be true, it probably is. So what's the catch?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: There is no catch. Microsoft is just trying to attract new users
to its Internet service, which has not been as popular as the
company had hoped it would be. And the rebate strategy (plus some
good TV advertising) seems to be working. In the quarter that ended
in June, Microsoft signed up some 800,000 new MSN customers and now
has a total of 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   MSN is as good as any other ISP, so committing to a three-year
deal isn't the worst thing in the world. On the other hand, if
you're willing to put up with an on-screen ad banner, you can get
Internet access for free from companies like NetZero,
FreeInternet.com and Juno. And over a three-year period, that would
save you nearly twice as much as the $400 rebate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Add Attachments
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How do I e-mail a document? It has columns, and I am unable to
copy and paste it into an e-mail message. I use America Online.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Any document that includes special formatting such as columns
should be sent as an attachment. That way, it accompanies the
e-mail without actually being part of it, and the formatting is
preserved. Attachments are a great way to send all kinds of files,
including photos.
</P>
<P>
   The only caveat is that the recipient must have software capable
of opening and viewing the attachments you send. But that's not
much of a problem because Microsoft Word and Excel have become the
lingua franca of word processors and spreadsheets, and almost
everyone has a program that can view graphics.
</P>
<P>
   In AOL version 5, you can easily attach files to e-mail. Just
open a new e-mail window, click Attachments in the lower left
corner and follow the instructions. You can even have more than one
attachment for the same message (my brother sends me several
pictures of his new daughter every time he writes).
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: When sending attachments, it's a good idea to
let the recipient know to expect its arrival. Many computer users,
wary of attachments that may be carrying computer viruses, will
automatically discard attachments from senders they don't
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Scan, Edit Forms
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: As an amateur genealogist, I send a lot of forms to government
agencies. I know I can scan and print the forms, but is it also
possible to enter information on them once they're in the computer?
That would save me lots of time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You need something like OmniForm, a $120 program (street price)
from ScanSoft that lets you scan and edit almost any kind of form.
I haven't tried it myself, but it comes from the company that also
sells OmniPage, the standard for optical character recognition
software (OCR), which turns scanned pages of text into editable
documents. So I bet it would do the job nicely for you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Bad habits are easy to fall into, and if you're not paying
attention to how you sit in front of your PC, you could wind up
with painful _ and perhaps permanent _ stress-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   You can reduce the risk by following a few simple guidelines:
Adjust your chair and keyboard height so that your feet rest
comfortably on the ground and your forearms are parallel to the
floor when you type. Raise or lower your monitor so that the top of
the screen is level with your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Always put the monitor directly in front of you, not off to the
side. And position the PC so that the light in your room _ or the
sunlight outside _ doesn't splash glare all over your screen.

STANLEY IS STILL A LEADER ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ORIOLES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The whole thing looks suspect. Mike Stanley was
placed on the disabled list with a trumped-up injury _ one day it's
a shoulder strain, the next it's tendinitis _ and now he's
languishing in limbo two days after he was eligible to come off the
DL.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have room on their roster for Izzy Alcantara, a minor
league journeyman who has played just twice in the last three weeks
after offending the baseball sensibilities of manager Jimy Williams
and his teammates. But they can't find a place for Stanley, who
admittedly has been buried deep in a slump but has climbed out of
similar slumps in the past, and also is acknowledged as a key
leader of this team?
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette has played such roster games
before. Last year, Reggie Jefferson had to go to the players'
association to be reinstated from the DL. Catcher Scott Hatteberg
had to threaten to do the same. And few veterans in the Sox
clubhouse are buying the argument that Alcantara must be kept here
because he is out of options and another team could claim him on
waivers. Their response to the possibility he could be taken: So?
</P>
<P>
   But while other players would be calling press conferences,
complaining of their predicament, Stanley has held his tongue after
flashing some bitterness when he was first placed on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan-o has too much dignity and class for that,'' one Sox
player said Wednesday. ``And he's not going to call attention to
himself. He cares too much about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, while the Red Sox waited for a game against the
Orioles that eventually was washed out and rescheduled as part of a
day-night doubleheader Thursday, Stanley tried to place a positive
spin on his situation. He planned to hit in the cage Wednesday,
then take some early hitting Thursday and talk again with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   While he concedes that anything is possible, that the Sox could
be buying time while they try to trade him or perhaps even release
him, Stanley said that after talking to Williams, he doesn't
believe that's the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the impression Jimy wants me to help him win some
games,'' Stanley said. ``He knows what I've been able to do for
them in the past, and thinks this time off may have been for the
benefit of me and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, after the team had just been swept in
Chicago by the White Sox and endured the embarrassment of
Alcantara's indifferent effort, Stanley called a players-only
meeting in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first meeting I've ever called in my life,'' he
said. ``Mo (Vaughn) used to call them, and last year we didn't need
to call any.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley acknowledged feeling a little apprehensive when he got
up to talk. ``I had the sweaty palms,'' he said. ``I talked the
first 10 or 15 minutes, then opened it up to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mo would have been a little more boisterous and loud
than the mild-mannered person I reflect, but we let everything get
out. Even if there were things that offended some people, we needed
to say what had to be said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about how we had to look at where we are, not where
we've been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox took four straight from the Twins, pulling themselves
out of a tailspin that threatened to destroy their season at the
midpoint. They lost two of three to the Braves when they came home,
but played well, and now have won five of six since the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   But now, just when it seems they have things turned around, the
Sox are braced for life without Carl Everett, who leads the club in
home runs and RBIs. Insurmountable? Stanley thinks not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain core of us who were here last year who
knows what it takes to win,'' Stanley said. ``We were in a pretty
deep funk there for awhile, but we've got to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one is happy to be losing Everett (``he's given us a
huge lift''), Stanley said that sometimes a team draws together
after a crisis like that engendered by Everett's ejection Saturday
and certain suspension for contact with an umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you rally around things when you're put in that
situation,'' Stanley said. ``When you get backed into a corner, you
come out fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all realize what's ahead of us. But we've played and won
without Nomar (Garciaparra), and while Carl has been a major
influence on us this year, he wasn't here last year and we won. We
have to go back and do the little things we did last year, when we
didn't have Carl to pick us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who was warmly greeted by outfielder Rondell White and
coach Luis Pujols, among others, while Montreal was in Boston this
week, appeared in good spirits Wednesday, joking easily with
bullpen coach John Cumberland and Lee Thomas, one of Dan Duquette's
lieutenants, in the visitors' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said he has not spoken with Everett about Saturday's
incident. ``I don't think there was anything really that could be
said,'' he said. ``It's not something a person is really prepared
for. It happened in that moment, and you can't say, `Don't let that
happen again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, asked why more players didn't come out of the dugout
when Everett was raging at umpire Ronald Kulpa, said the players
were essentially caught by surprise. ``Usually the manager and the
coaches come to take a guy away,'' he said. ``It took us by
surprise that it lasted as long as it did. Plus, he'd already done
his damage. What were we going to do about it? Even if we'd gotten
there earlier, the damage was already done, the stuff he's going to
get suspended for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like, `The guy threw him out, let him go and get
his money's worth.' He'd already dug his grave by bumping an umpire
and doing whatever it is they say he did.''

MEDIA BYTES: DRIVE TO SUCCEED CONTRIBUTES TO DEMISE OF
YOUNG  DOT-COM EXEC
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Aaron Bunnell was the boss' son _ there was no
escaping it.
</P>
<P>
   But if working for his dad, tech magazine pioneer and Upside
Media Chief Executive Officer David Bunnell, meant that he could
slack off, he sure didn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell drove himself relentlessly, working all hours, pushing
his underdog Web site to greater heights.
</P>
<P>
   But that drive may have ultimately contributed to his demise. On
Monday, Aaron Bunnell, 26, was found dead in his room at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A champagne bottle was in the room, and his father, who flew to
New York immediately upon hearing the news, believes he may have
been taking uppers to fuel his work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from a couple of his friends that he was getting very
burned out,'' said David Bunnell, a well-known tech publishing
figure who founded PC, PC World, MacWorld and other magazines. ``He
may have been stimulating himself to keep going and going. He
pushed it too far.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City medical examiner is investigating, and Bunnell
said it may take six weeks to get the results.
</P>
<P>
   But the story that emerged as news of the death spread was of a
young, ambitious dot-com executive who poured everything into his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this dot-com atmosphere, people get totally fixated on
work,'' said Adam Feuerstein, a senior writer at Upside Today, the
Web business that Aaron Bunnell spearheaded. ``It becomes their
obsession. Aaron worked all the time. If the software wasn't right,
he was in programming something. He worked and worked and worked.
You've got to step back, have some balance in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Bunnell apparently knew he was working too hard, and,
according to his father, he had talked about cashing out his stock
options when the time was right and going back to his true passion:
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Bunnell had been in the prestigious filmmaking program at
the University of Southern California and was making documentaries
about World War II when he got the call from his father.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago, and David Bunnell was looking to expand
Upside's Web presence. ``We were just running on fumes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked him into coming up for a short time and doing some
work for me,'' Bunnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron moved in with his father, and the two drove to work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, David Bunnell paid his son out of his own pocket, but
when he saw how hard Aaron was working, he gave him a staff job. To
quell talk of nepotism, he had Aaron reporting to Gini Talmadge,
the company president and group publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he put Aaron in charge of the Internet team and
started growing the online business. About 25 people work for the
Web site  &LR; (www.upside.com &LR; ), and Aaron had risen to become vice
president and editorial director of the online business. (The site
now features a tribute to Aaron from colleagues and other friends.)
</P>
<P>
   Adam Feuerstein remembers his job interview with Aaron Bunnell:
``We sat down, and he was wearing a ratty T-shirt and had a
baseball cap on backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take long for Feuerstein to see that ``he was one
of the savviest people when it came to new media and the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real casual. He wore flip-flops to work and T-shirts
with holes in them, but he was really serious about his work,''
said Sylvia Carr, a senior editor on the site.
</P>
<P>
   He instilled the site with a sense of whimsy: It features a
``dot-com graveyard,'' mocking Internet firms that have gone out of
business, and each week it puts a different high-tech personality
on trial, with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison being found guilty of
immoral conduct, and Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy being found
guilty of having a big mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell became something of a cheerleader, praising reporters
for their scoops, hailing every small victory. ``He definitely
celebrated with his staff,'' Carr said. ``We felt important to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   His hard work and his drinking may have taken a toll, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very worried about him working so late. I don't think he
was taking very good care of himself,'' Bunnell said. ``I knew he
drank. He would even have a few drinks and go back to the office.
He worked until 4 a.m. frequently. Sometimes he would work so late,
he would check into a hotel nearby. Other times, he would just
sleep on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to New York last week to help develop a new Internet
radio venture, opening an office and studio for another 25 people.
His meetings had apparently gone well, colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll still be able to do it,'' said David Bunnell.
``If we can do it, we'll dedicate it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein said it was odd that no one had received an e-mail
from Aaron on Sunday; colleagues were accustomed to hearing from
him at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, David Bunnell received a call from a New York police
detective that a hotel worker had found Aaron in his hotel room.
David Bunnell flew to New York right away. Aaron's body will be
sent to Albuquerque, N.M., where his mother lives and where a
funeral will be held. There will also be a service in San
Francisco, possibly next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest part for me is that he lived with me these past
couple years and we rode together in the car to work,'' said David
Bunnell. ``This was precious time that can never be replaced. Aaron
was my constant companion and friend. We went to basketball and
baseball games together after work. He was funny and smart and
really hip to the dot-com world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what he would have done,'' Bunnell said. ``At age
26, he was far ahead of me and I was really proud of this. It is a
great painful loss for me and a loss, I think, for the world at
large.''

SKY VISITOR ARRIVING ON SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  A newfound comet will appear in the sky Sunday night. And while
it won't approach the brightness of comets that flashed across the
heavens a few years ago, it should still prove a worthy spectacle
to anyone with a pair of binoculars.
<P>
   The comet will appear as a faint, fuzzy blob just below the
familiar constellation of the Big Dipper. It is named Linear-S4,
for the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project, whose
telescope at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico first
detected the comet in September.
</P>
<P>
   Linear appears to be a first-time visitor to the inner solar
system. It will fly around the sun next Wednesday in a long orbit
that will carry it within about 3.5 million miles of the Earth,
then far beyond the distant planet Pluto, astronomers say.
</P>
<P>
   Estimating how bright the comet will appear during the next few
nights is extremely tricky, according to National Aeronautics and
Space Administration astronomers at the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Even where weather permits, the comet will be only barely
visible to the naked eye, appearing as a very faint star. But
through good binoculars it could show up as a glowing ball with the
faintest of tails, like a smudge in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Linear will not approach the brilliance of comet Hayakutake,
which fascinated observers when it crossed the sky in 1997, nor the
amazing sight of comet Hale-Bopp the year before, which lured 39
members of the Heaven's Gate cult to kill themselves in order to
board a fancied space ship hidden behind the comet.
</P>
<P>
   Linear should be visible through binoculars for the next few
weeks, appearing above the west-northwest horizon soon after dark.
It will fade from view _ even in telescopes _ sometime late next
month or in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln asteroid project in New Mexico is run by the Lincoln
Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is
financed by the Air Force. Its highly automated telescope has
detected more than 397,000 asteroids in orbit around the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those rocky objects may be only a few feet in diameter,
while others could be classed as minor planets several miles
across. Scientists agree there is a remote possibility that one of
the larger orbiting objects will hit the Earth one day in what
could be a major catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The Linear comet is believed to have been launched on its
100-year voyage around the sun from a huge cloud of similar objects
that surrounds the solar system more than a trillion miles away.
Known as the Oort Cloud, it is often called the ``nursery'' of
comets.

 SMALL E-TRADE PROFIT RESPECTABLE  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Online brokerage giant E-Trade Group eked out a
small profit in its most recent quarter despite slower account
growth and a drop in trading volume from the previous period.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 online broker said Wednesday it earned $5.69 million
(2 cents a diluted share) in the three months ended in June, its
third fiscal quarter, compared with a loss of $23.8 million (8
cents a share) in the comparable period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Menlo Park, Calif.'s E-Trade slipped 19 cents to
$17.75 Wednesday after earnings were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The latest quarterly results for E-Trade, as well as those of
rival online brokers, reflect last year's stunning rise in the
popularity of investing on the Internet, followed by a pullback
after the technology-laden Nasdaq stock market plunged several
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a period of severe market volatility, people
step out and stand on the sidelines,'' said Mitchell Caplan, chief
of E-Trade's banking unit.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's revenue jumped to $330.3 million, up 77 percent from
the June 1999 quarter, but was well below the record $407.4 million
recorded in this year's March quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Other key measures also showed slowing growth during the
March-to-June quarter. Net new accounts increased 330,545 to 2.94
million, compared with 603,000 new accounts in the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, E-Trade handled an average of 169,000 transactions
each day, down from an average of 229,000 in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, E-Trade's performance was respectable, analysts said,
given the impossibility of sustaining the growth levels that it
feasted on when a bull market was raging. The company ``didn't
knock the cover off the ball, but they hung in there pretty well,''
said Matthew Vetto, an analyst with SolomonSmithBarney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading customers to move assets to E-Trade has been one of
the company's top priorities during the past year. In the most
recent quarter though, assets grew more sluggishly than expected,
Vetto said.
</P>
<P>
   The company drew in $7.6 billion in new assets from customers
after subtracting withdrawals, compared with $10 billion in the
March quarter. Slower growth combined with plunging stock prices
pushed E-Trade's total customer assets down 6.9 percent to $60.7
billion from March to June.
</P>
<P>
   The company managed to post a profit by cutting back on its
near-saturation advertising. Marketing costs during the June
quarter were $115 million, down 35 percent from the previous
period.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's results in the most-recent quarter were also boosted
by the company's diversification into new business areas, such as
banking and money management, in order to buffer itself from
volatile brokerage results.
</P>
<P>
   In the June quarter, E-Trade's brokerage accounts grew 11.4
percent to 2.7 million. But accounts at E-Trade Bank, which the
company bought at the beginning of the year and began promoting in
April, jumped 30.5 percent to 222,582.

THEY'RE SCOUTING NBA'S SUMMER STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Bob Ryan 
c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A writer's dilemma: Do you just say hello, or do you genuflect
and kiss the ring?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, we've got some basketball royalty hanging around the
Clark Athletic Center at UMass-Boston this week. There's Wes
Unseld, who won a title on the floor, as did Paul Westphal, whose
fourth-quarter basket in Game 7 against Milwaukee 26 years ago
stopped a Bucks run and helped ensure Celtic title No. 12. There's
Gregg Popovich, who won the 1999 title as coach/GM of the Spurs.
There's Donnie Walsh, of the Eastern Conference champion Indiana
Pacers. There's Rod Thorn, who drafted Michael Jordan _ hey, that's
more than Houston and Portland did, so why not give him some
credit? _ and who now has the task of legitimizing the New Jersey
Nets. There's, well, a lot of people with NBA clippings, and that
doesn't even include His Airness, His Nike-ness, His Majesty,
Himself, who is rumored to be planning an appearance later in the
week to check out the lads representing his Washington Wizards.
Meanwhile, if you absolutely, positively must see a Michael Jordan,
the three-time All-Ivy namesake out of Penn is here with the 76ers
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Rick Pitino is also present and accounted for. We can't
forget him.
</P>
<P>
   And for what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of time,'' laughs one NBA guy, whose identity
will be protected, lest he suffer the wrath of both his ownership
and his comrades. ``Some of these players have been going to these
leagues for six or seven years. What don't we know about them?''
</P>
<P>
   Dissing the Shaw's Pro Summer League? That's borderline NBA
heresy. Next thing you know, someone will swear off the knee-jerk
double team of everyone but the Underassistant West Coast Promotion
Man. This is serious stuff, you know. It's not summer pickup ball.
Those days are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a half-hour of film this morning and an hour and a half
walkthrough for our team,'' marvels Pitino, who, for the record, is
here in his capacity as Total Big Cheese, rather than Mentor.
Associate coach Jim O'Brien actually is coaching the team.
</P>
<P>
   Back in simpler times, offseason meant, believe it or not,
offseason. Yeah, there was competition available, but it wasn't
exactly monitored very closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play in the LA Summer League,'' recalls Westphal,
who happens to be the Seattle coach, in case you've lost track of
the comings and goings in The World's Greatest Basketball League.
``The Celtics didn't even know what I was doing. I'd come back here
for camp, and they'd say, `Hey, I hear you did pretty good in that
league out there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what exactly are these hoop luminaries doing here, other
than stimulating the local economy with money spent on hotels,
meals, rental cars, cabs, and buses?
</P>
<P>
   For openers, they might as well call this the Adrian Griffin
Memorial Tournament. For he has become the symbol of all the
wannabes and fall-through-the-cracks survivors who annually make
their way from IBL or CBA teams to this pro camp and that pro camp,
then over to
France/Spain/Germany/Turkey/Israel/Venezuela/Uzbekistan and back
again in a repeat cycle, hoping to endear themselves to just one
NBA honcho the way Griffin did with Pitino last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for a guy with what Stu Inman used to call
`stickability,' '' says Celtics general manager Chris Wallace.
``That's what Adrian has. Some guys just can't handle the
rejection, and these guys often get rejected, multiple times.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``stickability,'' Pitino reports an immediate
discovery. ``We've searched everywhere for a big man,'' he says,
``and we've found one.''
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking of Mark Blount, the peripatetic 7-footer whose
relationship with Pitino began when the latter was recruiting the
former to be a Kentucky Wildcat. That was a lot of a lot of things
ago for Blount, who has always been slobbered over far more for his
potential than his actual achievements. He now weighs an acceptable
220, and he appears to have his head on reasonably straight, and so
Pitino has laid it on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we would take him if he would promise not to go
running off somewhere, and that if he could make it through the
first two weeks of training camp he would make the team, and that
there was no reason why he wouldn't make it through the first two
weeks of training camp unless he didn't want to work hard enough,''
said Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Understand something. Mark Blount might be the only one of these
free agents walking out of here with a job.
</P>
<P>
   Reason two for this league's existence is for teams to give some
valuable playing time either to rookies (e.g. Jerome Moiso, DerMarr
Johnson, Desmond Mason, Joel Pryzbilla, etc.), or to young players
on their current roster who didn't get much of a look last year.
Hence the presence of Indiana's Jonathan Bender, the 6-10
19-year-old the Pacers drafted out of Picayune (Miss.) High School,
who played all of 130 minutes as a rookie. Small wonder that team
president Walsh and team GM David Kahn, seated behind the basket,
practically played Bender's Tuesday game against the Atlanta squad
along with him. ``Keep moving, Jonathan,'' exhorted Walsh, maybe 10
or 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   A third and rather intriguing argument for the existence of the
Shaw's Pro Summer League is to provide experience for rookie
coaches. Byron Scott (Nets) at least has an NBA pedigree (lotsa
rings, too), but neither Leonard Hamilton (Washington) nor Lon
Kruger (Atlanta) have ever spent a second in the employ of any NBA
team. Oy vey, do they have a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Cracked one NBA veteran exec, ``Lon will have to understand he
won't be outcoaching anyone in the Eastern Conference, and he won't
be outworking anyone, either. So he'd better make sure they give
him some players.'' You can make a copy of that and stick it in Mr.
Hamilton's mail box, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's all serious stuff, and if you don't believe it, look at the
scores. It's more of that dreary 75-68 business that nauseates us
during the regular season. That rollicking LA League would have
given us 145-140. Geez, guys, can't you lighten up? It's only July.
</P>
<P>
   Glancing up at a ``27'' on the board at the end of one first
period, Westphal smiled. ``I might have had that much myself in the
old LA League.'' You kidding? Raymond Lewis probably averaged 50.
</P>
<P>
   But these guys are all business, and if you don't believe that,
you should have seen Indiana coach Mel Daniels in action. The
Pacers coach was in full game-face mode, pacing the whole game,
slamming down towels and acting as if this was a Game 7. His team
lost by 1, and when Mel walked off the floor you fervently wished
there was going to be a cardiologist waiting for him in the locker
room. Mel, Mel. It's only July. And, anyway, Isiah already has the
job. Isn't that right, Mr. Walsh?
</P>
<P>
   It is what it is, and if you need a hoop fix, go for it. You
just have to decide whether you think it's worth eight bucks. All I
know is that's what I paid for a front-row balcony seat to see
Larry back in '79. Depressing, huh?

 LAKER FANS RULE THIS LEAGUE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now forming: my new mass-murderer rotisserie league (MML).
</P>
<P>
   It's not as bad as it sounds. A normal rotisserie league works
like this: A group of people, like your canasta club, antes up a
few bucks each and drafts teams from all active players in a given
sport. Each day, you get points based on the performance of your
players in the previous night's games.
</P>
<P>
   Standings are kept. At season's end a champion is crowned and
the pot awarded.
</P>
<P>
   In my MML, each participant drafts several sports franchises.
But it's not seasonal. Your roster might wind up consisting of the
L.A. Dodgers, the French Davis Cup tennis team, the Winnipeg Blue
Bombers, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   You score points when criminal suspects wearing your team's gear
appear in news photos or TV news clips.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 90 percent of all felony suspects wear team-logo gear
when committing crimes or when apprehended. If The Chronicle runs a
photo of a man robbing a bank while wearing a Dodger cap _ bingo,
points for you.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus points if your team figures into the crime somehow, like a
few years ago when a Raiders fan was robbing banks to pay for his
Raiders tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Points are awarded on a sliding scale based on the severity of
the crime, from mass murder to jaywalking. The maximum score is
100, which would be awarded if someone discovered a photo of Hitler
wearing a New York Yankees cap.
</P>
<P>
   NEWS IN THE NEWS: Restaurant prices rising in the Bay Area,
because of low supply of good servers (so we'll pay more for worse
service). Coffee prices rising, because of freak snowstorm in
Coffeebeanland (can't we just switch to iced coffee?). Gas prices
rising, because the Gas Fairy is feuding with Zeus (I'm making a
mental note to sell the SUV riding mower). Home prices and rents
rising, because rich people are invading Bay Area (``The Greenbacks
are coming!'').
</P>
<P>
   I'm no Greenspan, but I think I detect a trend, folks.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE going to drive, don't phone, fax, e-mail, channel
surf, surf the Internet and/or play Mortal Kombat.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has
determined that doing all that stuff could be distracting to a
driver.
</P>
<P>
   They have also determined that taking a toaster into the bathtub
could be distracting to a bather.
</P>
<P>
   Shockingly, the mobile-phone industry says ``Pish,''
cell-phoning from a car is perfectly safe, as long as you're not
phoning your wife to get the details of her affair with the Webvan
delivery guy.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone industry spokesperson quoted by the L.A. Times is
Tom Wheeler. How cute is that?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wheeler makes the point that cell phone users can report
accidents quickly. Which is nice, since they cause so many of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   SOME ENGLISH folks are offended by the portrayal of British
brutishness in the movie ``The Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, they claim, shows British soldiers committing
atrocities that are more atrocious than the atrocities they
actually committed.
</P>
<P>
   The British are whining! The British are whining!
</P>
<P>
   ANYTHING YOU read here, you can give it the Tom Tolbert
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert is co-host of a KNBR sports-talk program. Doug Wilkins
heard Tolbert say, when referring to some baseball statistics,
``You can throw them out the window with a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   GERMANS THROW the book at two criminals! But the book is a very
thin paperback, titled, ``Winning With Honor and Integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, a former East German Olympic official and a doctor
have been found guilty of systematically and secretly doping female
Olympic athletes with steroids for at least 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your German engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty official was sentenced to 22 months probation; the
guilty doctor to 18 months probation. Because they showed remorse,
they also got their courthouse parking validated.
</P>
<P>
   Their work ruined lives of scads of athletes, caused
birth-defect babies, corrupted the Olympic games, set off a domino
effect wave  &LR; of steroid abuse worldwide, and they get off with ...
probation.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 East German coaches, doctors and others have been
convicted in the decades-long dope-a-thon. The total amount of time
these people will spend in jail or prison: Zip.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the East Germans, one word will be added to the
official motto of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swifter, higher, stronger, hairier.''

 ALL WORK AND NO PLAYBOY FOR GORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLA MARINUCCI and LYNDA GLEDHILL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A night at the legendary Playboy Mansion is usually one hot
ticket. But as fast as you can say ``silicone,'' Congresswoman
Loretta Sanchez's choice of location for her next high-profile
campaign event has even fund-raising-friendly politicos making
polite excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Vice President Al Gore nor Gov. Gray Davis will be
attending Sanchez's Aug. 15 party at the luxurious manse best known
for stars, starlets _ and whatever goes on when the two mix. The
Sanchez party, to be held during the Democratic National
Convention, has not only raised eyebrows _ but also handed
Republicans in California a few good punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, the Orange County Democrat who defeated Republican Rep.
Bob Dornan in a 1996 squeaker, is bravely sending out 600
invitations to the Los Angeles event, which benefits a Latino unity
group.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy representatives promise there will be a veritable orgy
of dignity: no trademark bunnies or bikinis, and absolutely no
rubbing elbows inside the mansion. In fact, Sanchez's fiesta won't
be inside, with the sexy waterfalls and jacuzzis, but outside, in a
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hugh Hefner, the 74-year-old pajama-clad founder of the
nudie magazine, is expected to drop in _ though there is no word
yet on whether his 25-year-old blonde bombshell girlfriends,
Brande, Mandy and Sandy, will come along.
</P>
<P>
   All the excitement prompted the media to ask if Gore, who will
receive his party's presidential nomination at the Democratic
convention and has aggressively courted Latino voters, will pass
this one by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know he was even invited,'' said Gore spokeswoman
Maria Meier Wednesday. ``We never said we were going to go, we
never committed, and we were never involved in that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Davis, who has raised millions already in his two years in
Sacramento, also appears to be nixing a chance to mingle with big
check-writers.
</P>
<P>
   A Davis spokesman said the governor already is committed to
attending a dinner that night at the home of supermarket mogul Ron
Burkle. Davis is the honoree at the private event.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing news that two Demo bigwigs won't show did not
keep GOP state spokesman Stuart DeVeaux from taking off the gloves
on Sanchez, while at the same time borrowing a Tuesday night joke
from Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it poor taste, it just shows another example of
her lack of leadership,'' he said. ``But if Bill Clinton got an
invitation, I'm sure he'd be the first in line.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity sweepstakes has begun, and Al Gore is winning by a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics has
done an analysis of celebrity donors to both Gore and the GOP
presidential hopeful, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore's check-writing camp includes a slew of Academy
Award winners: Nicolas Cage, Robert DeNiro, Michael Douglas, Tom
Hanks, Norman Lear, Jack Nicholson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Steven
Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Barbra Streisand, Warren Beatty and Tommy
Lee Jones, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   There is also almost the whole Zappa clan: Ahmet, Diva, Sweezil
and Gail (no Moon Unit).
</P>
<P>
   But Bush? Well, it's short, and a little bit country: ``Coal
Miner's Daughter'' Loretta Lynn, Joe Bonsall, one of the Oak Ridge
Boys, and Larry Gatlin.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Green Party's Ralph Nader has done better. He got
actress Susan Sarandon, Bay Area-based Peter Coyote and _ need we
say more? _ Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Beatty again: He apparently can't make up his
mind between the Green and the Gore.

REVOLUTION BEAT WIZARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Fernando Clavijo regained his winning touch
Wednesday night. Early in the season, Clavijo made a habit of
unexpected or unorthodox tactical changes which made the difference
in Revolution victories. This time, the 84th-minute addition of
Paul Keegan helped provide the difference in a 1-0 victory over the
Kansas City Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   A minute after coming in, Keegan flicked on a throw-in to Wolde
Harris, who converted on his second attempt past Tony Meola. The
result might have surprised supporters of both teams; the
Revolution entered the match with an 0-6-1 record since June 10,
and the Wizards fell for only the second time at Arrowhead Stadium
this season.
</P>
<P>
   And Keegan could be assuming an even more prominent _ and
uncharacteristic _ role when the Revolution visit San Jose
Saturday. Unless the Revolution acquire a defender, Keegan could
replace Mauricio Wright, who was cautioned and will be suspended
for the game, as a central defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't winning any balls on top, and we needed more
size,'' Clavijo said after replacing William Sunsing with Keegan.
``I wanted Paul to stay high and if we lost the ball, drop back. He
brings a lot of energy to the game, and he gives you everything he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had played a conservative game, bypassing
midfield to go over the top to a three-forward alignment of Harris,
Sunsing, and Jose Luis Morales. Harris and Sunsing were most
effective pressing as the Wizards struggled to play out of the
back, but Morales, who is the team's most accomplished striker,
showed he is not yet in condition to be a sustained factor.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Juergen Sommer kept the Revolution in contention in
the early going, often simply by positioning and presence. Sommer
stopped a Matt McKeon point-blank shot, then stuffed Preki's
rebound in the 19th minute. McKeon, Mo Johnston, and Preki sent
open chances high and/or wide. Eventually, the Revolution defense
seemed to find cohesion. Leonel Alvarez limited Preki by working
with John Harkes in midfield to close space on the Wizards' most
dangerous offensive players.
</P>
<P>
   Preki departed in the 67th minute, leaving Kansas City with few
effective weapons. The return of Imad Baba and Ted Chronopoulos
from injury enabled the Revolution to neutralize the wing play of
the Wizards. And Wright stayed back to support young outside backs
Joe Franchino and Rusty Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution now have 29 points, 2 less than Dallas in the
race for the final playoff spot, with 10 matches remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't chasing enough in the middle in the first half, but
our intensity picked up in the second half,'' Clavijo said. ``We
started concentrating on forcing them to the outside instead of to
the middle. Maybe it was not too pretty, but I've played wonderful
games and lost. I want to play good soccer, but at the end of the
day the result is what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution, approaching the sort of lengthy losing
streak that had destroyed their confidence in previous seasons,
were desperate for a win.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding play occurred quickly and unpredictably as the
Revolution turned an innocuous throw-in from their own end into a
goal. Chronopoulos bounced the throw-in to Keegan, whose back
header sent Harris in alone on goal. Harris outran Nick Garcia but
was stopped by Meola, then collected the rebound on the edge of the
goal area and finished into an open goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took two or three touches, and I was in the box, I shot to
Tony's left, and he did a great job to get a paw on it,'' said
Harris, who scored his ninth goal of the season. ``I think they
were flat-footed. They were expecting to win the header, but I was
expecting Keegan to get the ball and I was running onto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was on the same page, and that's how we have to play.
Everyone attacks and everyone defends.''

 &HT;    CLINTON CONVINCES ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS TO REMAIN FOR TALKS IN
HIS ABSENCE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ In a dramatic last-ditch effort to salvage
faltering Mideast peace talks, President Clinton convinced Israeli
and Palestinian leaders late Wednesday to remain at Camp David for
the next four days while he journeys to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns _ as early as Sunday afternoon _ Clinton said he
will resume talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the negotiations will be lead by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, though at a decidedly scaled-down pace
than the nine grinding days and nights of summitry that wound up
inconclusively Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had concluded that the summit had failed
Wednesday evening, and he was preparing to leave the presidential
retreat at nearby Camp David empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought it was over,'' Clinton told some 200 reporters
gathered in this Catoctin mountain hamlet to cover the Camp David
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's presidential motorcade loaded and ready to convey
him to Washington for an early morning flight Thursday to Japan,
the parties agreed to remain at the presidential compound and
resume leader-level peace talks upon his return.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned that there remained no guarantee of success in
the talks, aimed at resolving the thorny territorial and security
disputes at the heart of 52 years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gaps remain substantial, but there has been progress,''
Clinton said, adding that he believed all parties needed to be
prepared ``to go the extra mile'' for peace.
</P>
<P>
   After staring at the prospect of a failed peace summit, Clinton
said, neither Arafat nor Barak wanted to return to the tumultuous
region without a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to give up,'' Clinton said during brief remarks
early Thursday to reporters at the temporary media center set up in
a tiny elementary school in this town of 4,400.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat had been prepared to leave the Camp David
summit earlier at an acrimonious impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, in fact, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
released a statement declaring that the talks had collapsed in
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit has come to an end without reaching an agreement,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a prepared statement
read to reporters just before 11 p.m. (ET) by National Security
Council spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours, though, Clinton shuttled between Arafat and
Barak, who haven't met directly since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks faltered through a wild day of brinkmanship, high
drama and heated negotiations, both sides blamed each other for not
yielding on the intractable issue of the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat came into the talks vowing to reject any accord that
didn't guarantee Palestinian control over East Jerusalem, the site
of some of the holiest shrines in the Moslem, Christian and Jewish
worlds. Israel captured that part of the city in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.

<P>
   Barak, for his part, had pledged that an undivided Jerusalem
would remain the eternal capital of Israel, fully under Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unable to bridge those differences, by Wednesday,
and said only that he would try again after his return.
</P>
<P>
   The president Clinton left Thurmont by motorcade shortly after 1
a.m. (ET) Thursday. He was scheduled to go to the White House and
then to leave early Thursday morning for Dulles Airport, outside of
Washington, where he was to board Air Force One for the 15-hour
flight to Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There, far from the crucible of Mideast summitry and even
farther from the flesh and blood issues the talks were designed to
address, Clinton was to assume the role of elder statesman at his
farewell session of the annual summit of leaders from the so-called
Group of Eight democratic powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can sleep on the plane,'' said Clinton.

IN PRIVATE, CLINTON MAKES HIS CHOICES KNOWN FOR V.P. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Maine, Ind., S.D., R.I., Nev., Conn., Iowa)  (Eds: Inserts 4 grafs towards end bgng, Gore, speaking ..., with
Gore talking about what he is looking for in a running mate.) 
By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has told friends and associates
that two of his favorite choices for Vice President Al Gore's
running mate are former Sen. George Mitchell and Sen. Bob Graham,
both of whom he considered picking eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has gone out of his way to stay clear of the selection
process, people close to him said, because he wanted to avoid
appearing as though he was imposing his preferences on Gore _ or
injecting himself into his vice president's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton is regarded by many Democrats as his party's most
brilliant strategist. And when he is questioned privately at party
functions about who he thinks would make sound choices, he has not
been reluctant about offering his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is a political brain attached to a body,'' said
a Democratic lobbyist who has heard Clinton rattle off vice
presidential possibilities recently. ``He can't help himself. It's
how he's wired.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Clinton said he sounds most animated when he is
discussing Mitchell, the former Senate Democratic leader from Maine
whom he picked to preside over the peace negotiations in Ireland.
Clinton has told people that Mitchell would bring a weight and
dignity to the ticket, has no skeletons in his closet and would be
particularly appealing because he is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton loves him,'' said a strategist close to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had considered Mitchell as a potential running mate in
1992, but he was not on the final short list, according to people
involved in the process then.
</P>
<P>
   The president also tells people he has quite high regard for
Graham of Florida, who, according to aides at the time, he came
quite close to selecting eight years ago. The president has long
been deeply interested _ some of his aides say obsessed _ in
winning Florida for the Democrats and has told people that could
happen if Graham were on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   One person who worked closely with Clinton eight years ago said
he remembered that the then-governor of Arkansas said more than
once that Graham, who had been governor of Florida, ``was the best
governor I served with.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Graham said that after undergoing the
background checks and interview with Clinton in 1992 he was not
sure whether he would be picked. But he said he had been
``anxious'' because he was seeking re-election that year and wanted
the matter settled. In Florida, candidates cannot run
simultaneously for the Senate and on the national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I feel as if I was going to get a call to join the ticket
or definitely not going to get one? I didn't know,'' Graham
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he discussed his prospects for helping Clinton win
Florida that year, Graham said: ``I'm sure we did. He has told me
personally that he feels one of the major mistakes that was made in
'92 was that they gave up on Florida too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Clinton said he is also intrigued with Sen. Evan Bayh
of Indiana because of Bayh's involvement with the Democratic
Leadership Council _ a centrist group that Clinton once headed _
and because he would evoke an energetic and vibrant image, similar
Gore's when he was picked in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to Clinton said the president spoke positively
early on about Defense Secretary William Cohen, a former Republican
senator. But Cohen is not discussed much anymore by people close to
Gore. Some Gore loyalists said they had been disturbed about nice
things Cohen said about Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in a
television interview in May.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can be considered an expert on the selection of a
running mate. He sometimes says that his choice of Gore will be an
important part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The president's musings are very sensitive in Gore's circles.
People who have discussed the No. 2 slot with the president said he
has been careful not to push one prospect above another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart enough not to say, `My first choice is ...''' said
one Democratic official who has talked with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That official also said he believed that Gore was so concerned
about being viewed as independent from the administration that he
might change his mind on a choice if it looked like he was
following the president's counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking Wednesday night in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said he
wanted a vice president who would be much like himself, someone who
has helped the president carry the load of a job so heavy that it
ages the occupants of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been able to help my country by strengthening President
Clinton's hand and helping him in a thousand ways carry the heavy
load that sometimes is pretty crushing for a president of the
United States,'' Gore said here in response to a question at a town
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it up close,'' he said of his spot at the president's
side. ``Have you ever noticed how all of them seem to age in
office? You know? That's because the burdens really are heavy, and
I'm excited about the opportunity but I've seen it close enough to
know that it's a hard job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore still refused to discuss any names publicly. ``I'm trying
to keep the process as private and dignified as possible,'' he
said, ``so that the ones that aren't picked aren't accidentally
hurt in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also seems to enjoy keeping up the suspense. At a
fund-raising reception last month for Sen. Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut, Clinton joked about the selection process in a hotel
ballroom full of senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing crowd of people here tonight,'' Clinton said.
``And not all of them want to be vice president. But a lot do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the audience were Sens. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Jack Reed of Rhode Island
and Harry Reid of Nevada.

ANALYSIS: JERUSALEM DERAILED TALKS BEFORE LEADERS AGREED TO ONE
MORE TRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating and rewriting throughout)   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Before the Camp David summit meeting, pronounced
dead, was buried, it came back to life in a startling turnabout
suggesting that the contemplation of failure raised prospects too
grim for the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to accept.
</P>
<P>
   After nine stormy days in which each Middle Eastern leader
threatened to walk out, it was President Clinton's bag-packing that
drove home the unsettling possibilities of what the future without
a peace effort could hold. Clinton did not label it brinkmanship,
the assembling of his motorcade, the changing from casual to formal
clothes, the preparations for sealing hope for a negotiated peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way it was. And somehow, the rebirth of the talks, with
no guarantees of any greater success, underscored a milestone in
Middle East history that got lost in the brief pronouncement of
failure. During nine days at Camp David, a Palestinian leader and
an Israeli leader confronted the intractable issue of Jerusalem's
sovereignty, a volatile, taboo issue that Middle Eastern leaders
have never before dared to broach.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that the issue was responsible for
derailing the summit before it climbed back on track, an issue that
could not even be discussed much less resolved previously. And it
won't get any easier.
</P>
<P>
   But the status of Jerusalem needn't be a deal-breaker if Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestine leader, Yasser
Arafat, are willing or able to go for a partial accord that delays
decision-making on this subject. In the first nine days, they
weren't, but that meant that, before it was given a new lease on
life, one of the most momentous peace summits in modern history
fizzled to a close on a rainy night that dampened spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Until the second announcement, it seemed that instead of ending
a 52-year conflict, the summit might have put in jeopardy the whole
notion of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking itself. It seemed barely
possible that lower-level negotiators would have been able to
return home and create a profitable dynamic when their leaders had
visited and revisited every compromise possible and rejected them
conclusively. Perhaps it is that eventuality that turned the
leaders' heads around and convinced them to stay, abetted by the
``powers of persuasion'' of Clinton, as his spokesman described it.
</P>
<P>
   At around 11 p.m. Wednesday here, the summit's supposed failure
greeted the Middle East region, which was about to wake up when the
talks broke down. It greeted them with an uncertain future at what
was supposed to be the end of a seven-year peace effort, and it
raised the specter of violent confrontations, of a genuine,
street-level battle for Palestinian independence building toward
Arafat's pledged deadline of Sept. 13 for declaring a state.
</P>
<P>
   Before the decision to stay on, people were already wondering if
the summit had done more harm than good or more good than harm. It
was impossible to know. The meeting, which the Israelis pushed for
but the Palestinians resisted, was premised on the idea of averting
a violent climax to the peace process. While the Palestinians
predicted failure, saying the summit was premature, the Israelis,
and the Americans who eventually convened the meeting, considered
it better to try than not to try amid the political and social
tensions building in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The language in Barak's closing letter to Clinton did not offer
any suggestion that the summit had brought the parties closer
together, despite the fact that were locked up in a presidential
retreat for nine days of intimate, emotional conversations.
Instead, it demonstrated, as did statements by the Palestinians,
that the mutual recriminations were not only still strong but
perhaps stronger than ever during Barak's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat met only three times during the nine days that
Clinton spent shuttling between them, and there is no evidence that
their relationship grew stronger in the bucolic setting.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost his majority government when rightist parties
defected before the summit, Barak faces an uncertain future as a
leader. And he would have under any scenario. But analysts believe
that he would have had the most trouble surviving if he returned
with a partial deal that entailed further Israeli concessions but
no resolution of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, politically, the middle ground was the most
dangerous route for Barak to take,'' a senior Israeli official
said.

PITCHERS' DUEL DECIDED BY PLAY AT PLATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Another Anaheim Angels starter pitched deep
into the game Wednesday night. In this case, it was Kent
Bottenfield, who pitched at least seven innings for the third
consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Rangers starter Kenny Rogers was a little better,
holding the third-best hitting team in the American League in check
m in a 3-2 Rangers victory before 20,083 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended in controversy, as the final out came when
Rangers right fielder Scarborough Green threw out Scott Spiezio at
the score from second on a single by Kevin Stocker. Replays
appeared to show Spiezio touched the plate before the tag from
catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Even though at 35 he is hardly the same pitcher who threw a
perfect game against the Angels six years ago, Rogers changes
speeds well and keeps hitters off-balance. Rogers (10-7) allowed
only a solo homer by Bengie Molina in the fifth inning and an RBI
single by Spiezio in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also did a number on Darin Erstad, who went 0 for 4
with a walk. It was only the 15th game this season Erstad has gone
hitless, and the Texas pitchers got him in key situations.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad was up with runners at first and third and two outs in
the fifth, and Rogers struck him out on a 72-mph curveball out of
the strike zone. They walked him intentionally with runners on
second and third and two outs in the seventh and got out of the
inning. Then in the ninth, with the potential tying run on second
and one out, John Wetteland got him on a soft liner to second.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't exactly hammer Bottenfield (6-8), but two RBI
singles by Dave Martinez and a solo homer by Gabe Kapler (Taft High
of Woodland Hills) got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   The loss stopped the Angels from becoming the AL wild-card
leader. Instead, they remained tied with Oakland for the top spot
in the wild-card race. They still consider themselves contenders
for the d even a wild-card berth sounds appealing to an
organization that hasn't been to the playoffs since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take it any way you can get it,'' right fielder Tim Salmon
said. ``It would be nice to hang division banners up, but we've
been so close and just missed it. We'll take it however it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, the Angels reached a one-game playoff with
Seattle in 1995 and lost, and challenged for the division crown in
1997 and '98 only to fail in the waning days of each season. Is
this season just another tease for the Angels and their fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a pretty good club right now,'' Salmon said. ``We
have guys having fabulous years. You look at playoff teams and see
how some guys have career years. You wonder if this year is our
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team scored in the first three innings, but the Rangers
turned a leadoff walk by Rafael Palmeiro in the fourth into a run,
Martinez getting an RBI single with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had just one hit against Rogers through four innings
but got something going in the fifth. With one out, Molina homered
to tie the game at 1. Benji Gil followed with a single and Spiezio
singled Gil to third.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when Rogers got tough. Edgard Clemente, subbing in
right field for the injured Salmon, was frozen by a 68-mph
curveball on a 2-2 pitch for strike three. Rogers then went to a
full count on Erstad and got him to chase a 72-mph curveball out of
the strike zone for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   The game didn't stay tied for long as Texas scored to go ahead
2-1 in the top of the sixth. Rodriguez led off with a double and
one out later scored on a single by Martinez. The Rangers' lead
became 3-1 in the seventh on Kapler's leadoff homer.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers came out with runners on second and third and two out
leading 3-2 in the seventh, and got a boost from reliever Doug
Davis. After intentionally walking Erstad to load the bases, Davis
got Stocker to ground out to second.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the eighth, Mo Vaughn had a leadoff single against
Davis, but Jeff Zimmerman came in and got Troy Glaus to hit into a
double play. That was big, because Garret Anderson and Molina
followed with singles. Zimmerman got pinch-hitter Adam Kennedy on a
popup to center to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 24th save.

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ In a dramatic turnaround, President Clinton
announced early Thursday morning that the Middle East peace talks
that were described by his spokesman as having failed to reach an
agreement would remain intact, and that the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders would stay at Camp David to continue meeting with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that after the announcement that no agreement had
been reached, but there had been a substantial change of mind. ``We
all thought it was over,'' Clinton said at an elementary school
here, five miles away from Camp David. ``Then we discovered nobody
wanted to give up. And that should be encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who met repeatedly with the Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, who
were at Camp David for nine days, then left for Japan. He is to
attend a meeting of the leaders of the seven major industrial
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The swing from announced failure to a renewal of talks came in
just over two hours. The presidential spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said
that the motorcade taking Clinton to the White House and then the
airport was set to leave Camp David when word spread around the
delegations who had never stopped negotiating that it really was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were getting ready to leave, it became clear there was a
willingness to stay and an unwillingness to let it break down,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who was preparing to give a midnight news conference
before leaving for Israel, canceled his departure plans. Similarly,
Arafat, who was ready to go too, decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat will meet with Albright over the next four days
to try and close the gaps on the main issues, Clinton said. On his
return from Japan, Clinton said he would assess the progress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke in a hoarse voice, said the two sides had
made an ``intensive effort'' and though the gaps remained
``substantial,'' there ``has been progress.'' He declined to stay
what the major stumbling blocks were, maintaining that the news
blackout which has been in force would remain in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   The last hours before Lockhart's announcement just before 11
p.m. that the summit meeting had ended without agreement involved
an intensive round of consultations by Clinton with the two leaders
and a series of discussions with their delegations. Just before the
public announcement of no agreement was made, Lockhart said that
word was passed to the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made the judgment that it was time to leave,''
Lockhart said. Then in the following 90 minutes the reversal
emerged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the summit meeting in a sweeping effort to close
the 52-year conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians and
put on the table the major issues that the parties had been unable
to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the sovereignty of Jerusalem was reported to be
the main obstacle. And earlier in the evening, according to Radio
Israel, Clinton unsuccessfully proposed that Barak and Arafat
accept a partial agreement that did not include Jerusalem. This
accord would have dealt with the territorial shape of a Palestinian
state and brought a solution to the fate of 3 million Palestinian
refugees scattered through the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his aides appeared relieved that they had been able
to pull the summit meeting from the brink and push it into a new,
second phase. But Lockhart warned: ``I don't know if a few more
days will help the process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was a day of high tension and rapidly shifting moods.
Late into the evening Clinton was still making an all-out effort to
salvage the talks, shuttling between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Clinton shuttled between Barak and Arafat _
who did not meet directly with each other _ fending off an Israeli
initiative to leave early and turning repeatedly to his advisers
and to the negotiators in search of some formula that would save
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   During the nine days of talks, Barak and Arafat apparently dealt
with every issue in the conflict _ from borders and the fate of
Jewish settlements to the right of return of Palestinian refugees
to the status of Jerusalem. But it was unclear whether the ultimate
stumbling block was a single issue, like Jerusalem, or the
trade-offs needed to fashion an overall agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Each side seemed to be gearing up to lay the blame for a failed
summit meeting on the other, and each leader appealed privately to
Clinton in letters written in the last 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the high-tension, high-stakes day seesawed. At
midday, it seemed certain that the talks were fizzling out.
</P>
<P>
   The day built to an unexpectedly quick first climax, when the
Israeli journalists accompanying Barak were ordered in the
afternoon to rush to their hotels for a security check so that
their luggage could be shuttled to Andrews Air Force Base for an 8
p.m. departure for Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ran down, expectations were rife that there had
been a breakdown. Israeli television reported, and aU.S. official
later confirmed, that Barak had sent a letter to Clinton announcing
the Israeli prime minister's departure and laying the blame for the
meeting's failure on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian side is conducting negotiations insincerely
and is not willing to negotiate in a serious and practical manner
for a permanent peace between us,'' an Israeli reporter cited as a
direct quotation from the letter.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who himself was
heading to the airport to fly home to his son's wedding, brushed
off what he saw as an 11th-hour Israeli tactic to increase pressure
on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton had also received a letter from
Arafat, which arrived on Tuesday, before Barak's. He did not
characterize its contents, but Palestinian officials said that
Arafat had reached a summit of frustration on the eighth day.
</P>
<P>
   If news of the letters lowered expectations of a deal, Lockhart
reported that Clinton had managed by late afternoon to keep the
leaders from walking out. ``They are still there, they are all
still talking,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart made clear that the two leaders were having trouble
making concessions on deeply emotional issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders both want to go home with an agreement,'' Lockhart
said. ``The problem is the substance and structure of the
agreement.'' But he added that the extended deadline would have to
stand. ``There comes a time when you have to put a time limit on
discussions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, Clinton telephoned other leaders in the Middle
East to brief them on the developments. They were the first such
contacts since the meeting opened.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Camp David, cabin fever combined with exhaustion and the
anxiety intensified as the day lengthened into night. Discussions
went on, Lockhart said, at the ``leader level, the negotiator
level, between teams and within teams.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that an ultimate sticking point concerned the future
status of Jerusalem, the most divisive issue and one that has never
before been negotiated by Israeli and Arab leaders. It was seen as
the make-or-break issue, but it is possible that other stumbling
blocks remained.
</P>
<P>
   After conquering East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, Israel declared that the city would ``eternally''
remain united and under exclusive Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The visit of the Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat, to Jerusalem in
the fall of 1977 was interpreted by the Israelis as recognition of
Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital. But a year later, at the
first Camp David summit meeting between Sadat and the Israeli prime
minister, Menachem Begin, the question of Jerusalem threatened to
scuttle the entire conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Carter tried to find some sort of symbolic solution _
such as flying Muslim flags on the Temple Mount _ but the
suggestions were rejected by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oslo agreement of 1993, under which Israel recognized the
Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinians renounced
all violence against Israel, the future of Jerusalem, along with
the fate of Palestinian refugees, final borders and some other
issues, was left for ``final status'' talks. The official position
of the United States has been that the fate of Jerusalem must be
negotiated between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven years, diplomats, professors, demographers
and officials from both sides have tried to come up with various
arrangements that could satisfy the demands of both sides,
including ideas that involved autonomy for Palestinian
neighborhoods in Jerusalem and would allow the Palestinians to
claim the neighboring village of Abu Dis as their Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But these ideas were dismissed by the Palestinians as a ``Jewish
solution.'' Abu Dis, they argued, is not Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have watched Arafat over many years say that he always
set a benchmark: he would not be the Palestinian who went down in
history as the one who gave up Arab claims to East Jerusalem as the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, they point out, was not asking for a divided city but
rather shared sovereignty in an open and undivided city. Offering
municipal control over some neighborhoods, they said, fell far
short.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, for Barak, making concessions on a city that many
Jews regard as their capital by divine fiat was extremely
difficult.

DODGERS ACE HOLDS ROCKIES TO ONE HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Yep. Kevin Brown's right shoulder is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Really. Trust us. It wasn't just the Colorado Rockies and their
typical road performance.
</P>
<P>
   In his most overwhelming performance as a Dodger and one of the
most dominating in his career, Brown allowed one hit in eight
innings in a 9-1 win Wednesday against the Rockies at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Los Angeles Dodgers (48-45) leaped over
Colorado (47-45) into third place in the National League West
Division. The Dodgers began the night five games behind Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The only hit Brown allowed was a clean, ground-ball single
through the middle of the infield to Larry Walker, the game's third
batter. Reliever Mike Fetters walked one in a scoreless ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My shoulder's) stiff, but I was able to get through it and
keep working,'' Brown said. ``You never have everything working for
you. My fastball wasn't what I wanted it to be. (Location) was
probably my saving grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that kept Brown from his third career
complete-game one-hitter was the fear of overextending his right
shoulder, in which tightness forced him from his last start.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a hint of the ailment cropped up during his 104-pitch
masterpiece. Brown allowed an unearned run when Jeff Cirillo
reached on shortstop Alex Cora's first error in 36 games and Walker
singled.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Brown (9-3) was awesome. The only batter to reach
base after Walker's single was a four-pitch walk to Todd Helton
with one out in the fourth. Brown retired 23 of the last 24 batters
he faced, and only three of the 24 outs he got were recorded by
outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what a big-time pitcher does, he keeps you in the game
until you have the opportunity to do something offensively,''
Colorado manager Buddy Bell said. ``It was all Kevin Brown. He had
that sinker, sailer, slider. He's able to kind of make up (stuff),
too, as he goes along, which makes it tough. The SOB can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   And, to think, Brown's start was actually in question as late as
Monday afternoon because he left his last start, Friday against
Anaheim, with tightness in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But after being examined by team physician Dr. Frank Jobe, Brown
was given the OK to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught him in the minor leagues coming up and now here, and
for me,when he pitches his best it's when he's sick or a little bit
tired because it makes him a little more finesse,'' Dodgers catcher
Chad Kreuter said. ``It makes him more conscious of really hitting
his spots. When he throws 95 or 96 ith his fastball and his split
is around 93 or 94, sure it's easier to get guys out, but the
location night not be as good. You didn't see one ball hitting the
middle of the plate today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Brown's mastery, it took a Dave Hansen three-run homer
to give the Dodgers the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield tied it 1-1 in the third with a single to center
and Hansen, getting a rare start at third base in place of Adrian
Beltre, followed singles by Shawn Green and Eric Karros with his
fifth homer of the season off Rockies starter Rockies starter
Rolando Arrojo. It gave the Dodgers a 4-1 lead, and was Hansen's
first non-pinch hit homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it would advantageous to our ballclub to use another
left- handed bat in the lineup,'' said Jim Tracy, the Dodgers bench
coach who is taking over as manager until Davey Johnson returns
from his irregular heartbeat. ``With Arrojo, I had seen him when I
was coaching in Montreal and was aware of the type of arm slot he
had and the type of pitches he throws to right vs. left-handed
hitters, and I thought it would be great to put another left-handed
bat in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added five runs in the eighth inning to put the game
away. Kreuter had the big hit, a two-run double to right-center
field with the bases loaded. Alex Cora added a sacrifice fly and
Chris Donnels, just recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque, and Todd
Hollandsworth added RBI doubles.

AETNA TO SELL ITS INTERNATIONAL AND FINANCIAL SERVICES UNITS
</HEADLINE>
  By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc. has agreed to sell its international and financial
services units to the ING Group of the Netherlands for $5 billion
in cash, people close to the deal said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, which ING planned to announce before the opening
of the stock markets in Europe Thursday, Aetna will create a new
health care company that will keep the name Aetna. Aetna's
shareholders will receive $35 in cash and one share of the new
company in exchange for each share of the old Aetna. ING will also
assume $2.7 billion of Aetna's long-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   ING plans to operate its growing U.S. financial business from
its existing headquarters in Atlanta. It also plans to keep a
strong presence in Hartford, where Aetna is based, and in
Minneapolis, the headquarters of ReliaStar, another recent purchase
by ING, people close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   They said ING had agreed to maintain the number of Aetna
employees at close to current levels, with future reductions mainly
from attrition as employees retire or leave.
</P>
<P>
   ING, the Dutch financial giant based in Amsterdam, has made a
series of offers to buy parts of Aetna as part of its strategy of
becoming one of the 10 largest insurance companies in the United
States. Earlier this year, Aetna rejected a tentative offer of $70
a share for the entire company from ING and Wellpoint Health
Networks of California. Under that deal, Wellpoint planned to
absorb Aetna's health care business.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's biggest health insurance company, has been
struggling with unexpected increases in medical costs, which
reduced its profits. The company surprised investors on Tuesday by
announcing that its second-quarter earnings per share would fall
short of Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would tighten its operations and raise its
rates as soon as current contracts expire. Aetna promised to
disclose details of its finances when it reports second-quarter
profit on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has also been wrestling with money-losing operations of
its big Prudential Health Care unit, which it bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been pressing Aetna to sell off units to generate
immediate value for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said the sale to ING could reduce shareholder
value over the long run. Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said before the deal was reached
that a sale for less than $12 billion would dilute the value of
Aetna's stock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company said on Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings
would be 85 to 95 cents a share, well below analysts' estimates of
$1.20, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks
company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said medical costs in its core commercial health
maintenance organizations rose 10 percent to 12 percent in the
second quarter as members spent more time in hospitals, emergency
rooms, outpatient surgery centers and doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz said Aetna would have to raise its rates by 12
percent or more next year to fix its problems, even if resistance
to the increase by customers stalled the growth of its membership.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Donaldson, who took over as chief executive of Aetna
in February had said he would split the company into health care
and financial units. Several senior health care executives have
departed, and Aetna is seeking a new chief executive to run the
health care business.
</P>
<P>
   Several Aetna health care executives left the company this year,
and analysts said that absence of experienced senior leaders might
have added to the company's operating problems.

ANGELS LOSE ON PLAY AT PLATE
</HEADLINE>
 ... WRITETHRU (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Another Anaheim Angels starter pitched deep
into the game Wednesday night. In this case, it was Kent
Bottenfield, who worked at least seven innings for the third
consecutive outing.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Rangers starter Kenny Rogers was a little better,
holding the third-best hitting team in the American League in check
most of the night in a 3-2 Rangers victory before 20,083 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended in controversy, as the final out came when
Rangers right fielder Scarborough Green threw out Scott Spiezio
trying to score from second on a single by Kevin Stocker. Replays
appeared to show Spiezio's foot touched the plate before the tag by
catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out for an explanation and (home-plate umpire) Doug
Eddings said (Spiezio) never reached the plate,'' Angels manager
Mike Scioscia said. ``Why don't you go ask him for an
explanation?''
</P>
<P>
   Eddings refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was safe,'' Spiezio said. ``No question about it.
Obviously, someone else didn't think so. It's part of the game, but
it is frustrating. We thought we tied the game right there and it
ended up the game's over. Who knows what would have happened after
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was asked if he thought he tagged Spiezio before he
touched the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I was blocking the plate and we made the out,'' he said.
``It's a tough play to see the runner. On a play like that, I try
to sit on the plate and block the runner and that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have done well in one-run games at home this season.
They are 13-5 in one-run games at home and 20-16 in one-run games
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our share of tough losses,'' Scioscia said. ``This
team has the ability to turn the page and we'll certainly do that
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring opportunities were scarce for the Angels against Rogers.
Even though at 35 he is hardly the same pitcher who threw a perfect
game against the Angels six years ago, Rogers changes speeds well
and keeps hitters off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (10-7) allowed only a solo homer by Bengie Molina in the
fifth inning and an RBI single by Spiezio in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also did a number on Darin Erstad, who went 0 for 4
with a walk. It was only the 15th game this season Erstad has gone
hitless, and the Rangers pitchers got him in key situations.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad was up with runners on first and third and two outs in
the fifth, and Rogers struck him out on a 72-mph curveball out of
the strike zone. They walked him intentionally with runners on
second and third and two outs in the seventh and got out of the
inning when Stocker grounded out. Then in the ninth, with the
potential tying run on second and one out, John Wetteland got him
on a soft liner to second.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't exactly hammer Bottenfield (6-8), but two RBI
singles by Dave Martinez and a solo homer by Gabe Kapler (Taft High
of Woodland Hills) got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   The loss stopped the Angels from becoming the American League
wild-card leader. Instead, they remained in a virtual tie with
Oakland for the top spot in the wild-card race. They still consider
themselves contenders for the division title, but even a wild-card
berth sounds appealing to an organization that hasn't been to the
playoffs since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take it any way you can get it,'' right fielder Tim Salmon
said. ``It would be nice to hang division banners up, but we've
been so close and just missed it. We'll take it however it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, the Angels reached a one-game playoff with
Seattle in 1995 and lost, and challenged for the division crown in
1997 and '98 only to fail in the waning days of each season. Is
this season just another tease for the Angels and their fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a pretty good club right now,'' Salmon said. ``We
have guys having fabulous years. You look at playoff teams and see
how some guys have career years. You wonder if this year is our
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers came out with runners on second and third and two outs,
leading 3-2 in the seventh, and got a boost from reliever Doug
Davis. After intentionally walking Erstad to load the bases, Davis
got Stocker to ground out to second.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the eighth, Mo Vaughn had a leadoff single against
Davis, but Jeff Zimmerman came in and got Troy Glaus to hit into a
double play. That was big, because Garret Anderson and Molina
followed with singles. Zimmerman got pinch-hitter Adam Kennedy on a
popup to center to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 24th save.

 MARINERS DOUBLE UP A'S BEHIND MOYER, McLEMORE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mark McLemore resurrected his bat with a
couple of key doubles, mixed in enough defense to fill a highlights
show and Jamie Moyer played hide-and-seek with the baseball
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That combination proved fatal to second-place Oakland on a cool
Coliseum night. The first-place Mariners padded their lead in the
AL West with a 6-3 win that made the difference between first and
second place in the division an imposing five games.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has won three of its last four and is now a season-best
17 games over .500 at 55-38. That's the best any Mariners' team has
done since the 1997 squad finished the year at plus-18 (90-72).
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, who drove in three runs with a pair of doubles _ his
first hits to drive in runs in a month _ cautioned against making
too much of the victory. Seattle and Oakland play four more times
in the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we won this one doesn't mean we can sit back and
coast,'' McLemore said. ``This was one game.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another Thursday. Seventy more the rest of the way.
Those will be easier for the Mariners to win if McLemore can play
closer to his form of Wednesday night. A .226 hitter, he doubled
home two runs in the second inning and doubled in another run as
part of a three-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   It's not true that McLemore hadn't had a hit in a month,
although it may have seemed that way. It was true, however, that
McLemore's last hit to drive in a run was last month. On June 19,
he'd singled to score a run, but since then, zip. ``I'm not a .220
hitter,'' McLemore said. ``I've been struggling all year. It came
together a little tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense was part of the package. In the space of four batters in
the third and fourth innings, McLemore turned three would-be
singles into outs with a combination of deft hands, great lateral
movement and acrobatic throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing you love to see, because with Mac, he doesn't
take the (low) batting average out to the field,'' infield coach
Larry Bowa said. ``That's part of being professional. And it's easy
to play defense when you're hitting .300. It's harder when you're
hitting .220.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to pitch when you get that kind of defense behind
you, too, and Moyer got plenty of it. All four infielders made
exceptional defensive plays to help Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer allowed just one hit in the first four innings and one run
in the first seven innings, running his career record against
Oakland to 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland played sloppy defense, couldn't hit and couldn't pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse was true for Seattle, which was sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a solid game for us, top to bottom,'' manager Lou
Piniella said. ``Mac came up big for us tonight on offense and
defense, and the defense and the bullpen were great. And Jamie?
Well, he just knows how to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer glittered, allowing a two-out single in the first, then
not another base runner until the fifth, when the A's got two hits
and a walk to load the bases with one out. However, third baseman
David Bell started an inning-ending double play, as important a
play as the Mariners made all night.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve broke up the shutout, leading off the seventh with a
solo homer, his 18th. An inning later, Moyer had to bow out after a
Ramon Hernandez pinch-hit two-run homer cut the Mariners' lead to
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rhodes took over and, as has been his wont all season,
quickly restored order.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki closed it out for his 23rd save. He struck out
the side, including blowing away right fielder Matt Stairs on a 3-2
pitch for the inning's second out. That was some sweet revenge for
Sasaki, because it was Stairs who beat Sasaki with a three-run
homer back on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   That loss had moved the A's one-half game ahead of the Mariners
in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks later, the AL West has an entirely different
landscape.

ATHLETICS UNLIKELY TO TURN SINKING TIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Slugger Jason Giambi and his straggly hair
grace the cover of this week's Sports Illustrated. The messy look
is a metaphor for what his team is doing on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, losers of 13 of their past 18 after Wednesday night's
implosion against the Mariners, have become another sort of fodder
for ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what 91 errors will do for you.
</P>
<P>
   One-a-day, just like the vitamins. Or two-a-day _ eight in the
past four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset with our defense,'' A's manager Art Howe said after
the 6-3 loss. ``We have to pick it up defensively. We're not this
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not help matters that the A's were battered in Denver
before returning home for this eight-game stretch against the
Mariners and Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Call what happened at Coors Field, where the A's gave up 38 runs
in three games, a serious farewell to arms.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, when Oakland starter Kevin Appier struggled out
of the gate, you could feel the throats tighten in the A's dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Who was going to go out there and pitch long relief, if it came
to that? Giambi?
</P>
<P>
   At least he's a lefty. He might have thrown a loop in Lou
Piniella's left-leaning lineup, but Giambi didn't have the gas.
``Three games in 24 hours? I know I'm exhausted,'' Giambi said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Appier hung in there by necessity, serving up 10 hits
and six runs while the A's bullpen was put on mandatory bed rest.
</P>
<P>
   By the sixth inning, the crowd at Oakland Coliseum was peppering
their white-shoed team with a healthy dose of boos. ``I heard them.
Who can blame them?'' Appier said.
</P>
<P>
   The longer this goes on, the more Taco Tuesdays will be a big
part of the reason for A's fans to come out to the ol' ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Dollar Wednesday. A buck gets you a seat in the upper
deck, which helped explain the bump in attendance. Walk-up ticket
sales hit 14,700, bringing the house to a respectable 31,466.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't fair, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are one of the franchises on Major League Baseball's
endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   They're in the bottom third league-wide in payroll, at about $32
million. And last week, the ``commissioner's'' blue-ribbon panel
suggested the A's were a prime candidate for relocation.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, Howe's team has endeavored to keep pace with the
Mariners despite horrendous defense and the loss of 30 homers and
100 RBI in the injured John Jaha. While the Yankees' payroll has
soared to $115 million thanks to big trades, little guys like the
A's are more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to do something. I don't want to sell the
farm, but at the same time, we need to do something. Not that we
can spend a lot of money,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   If the A's were already seeing their chance to stay in the hunt
for the AL West title slip away, it wasn't exactly breaking news to
Howe. ``I don't feel we have the same energy,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the A's picked up Appier, Omar Olivares and Randy
Velarde at the trade deadline, and the club felt a boost. But at
this point in their season, the A's are tanking a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Howe was unwilling to completely concede that the fight
for the division was an uphill battle _ the grade of which is
starting to look like Mt. Shasta.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Mariners executed extraordinarily well.
Mark McLemore could be seen diving to his left, diving to his
right, jumping up like Nureyev to make big plays.
</P>
<P>
   And that was McLemore getting his first RBI in a month to give
the Mariners a 3-0 lead in the second. The second baseman added
another in the sixth, putting Seattle up 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell single-handedly killed Oakland's best chance for a
rally in the fifth when he gloved Sal Fasano's grounder, stepped on
third, then threw the catcher out for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are getting a sense of what the big boys can do in the
heat of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made unbelievable defensive plays, which is what you have
to do,'' Giambi said. ``Jamie Moyer did what he always does, get
you to hit grounders. He gives you a solid performance every time
out. McLemore made some great plays. That's a veteran ballclub over
there. We're young and we're still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about seizing the moment. The Mariners have opened a
five-game lead over the A's and given Bay Area baseball watchers
the distinct impression that the two clubs are heading in opposite
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been in a real down time as a team lately. It's
depressing,'' Appier said.
</P>
<P>
   Howe tried to put a positive spin on the state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we need to have a good stretch here. I hope we can. We
can't seem to get things in sync,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In sync? The A's look like they're in the sink, circling slowly.

 &HT;    `X-MEN' MISSES TARGET(a) 
 &HT;    REPEATING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED IT
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By Bill Muller(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To demonstrate the pitfalls of blatant prejudice and
discrimination, (beginitalic)X-Men (enditalic)takes us back to the
political sensibilities of the '50s - the 1650s.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts with a full-blown witch hunt, as a
McCarthyesque figure (Bruce Davison) calmly tells the U.S. Senate
that all mutants must be rounded up and registered. Instead of
bursting into uncontrollable laughter, the extras in the gallery
nod approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   In the same 10 minutes, the movie compares the U.S. government
to Nazi Germany, then supplies a mob waving racist signs to drive
the point home.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. I thought this was supposed to be a movie about a comic
book.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if the filmmakers had stuck to cartoons,
(beginitalic)X-Men(enditalic) might have been better. But probably
not. Unlike the Marvel comic about superpowered mutants, the movie
has a profound case of the stupids.
</P>
<P>
   Example: All the world's leaders are gathering in New York for a
giant conference (this is pounded into our heads with news
reports), but the X-Men literally need a psychic to figure out that
this is the target of their archenemy, Magneto (Ian McKellen, who
does his best though forced to wear a very funny hat).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite the world's supposed hatred of mutants,
Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is able to operate a school for
mutant children out in the open, simply by hanging a ``school for
the gifted'' sign out front. Yeah, that ought to fool them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's not really clear how much the mutants are being
hounded. The only evidence we have is a guy who kicks Wolverine
(Hugh Jackman) out of a bar. Given that criterion, I might be a
mutant.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, all the silly politics just seem out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the comic was created in the 1960s by Stan Lee, who drew on
the protest-torn era for material. But 40 years later, the same
themes just don't work, especially in what should be a fun
shoot-'em-up.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie fails there, too. The fight scenes are
(beginitalic)Matrix (enditalic)Lite, giving the distinct impression
that the actors spent a lot of time hanging from wires in front of
blue screens. Everybody's floating all over the place, and it just
looks silly. The famous X-Men jet leaves the hangar just once,
maybe because it resembles a plastic toy.
</P>
<P>
   The story is pretty simple: Magneto plans to make war on humans,
and the X-Men try to stop him. In case you miss something, don't
worry, Stewart's character explains everything about three times.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pointless romance between Wolverine and Rogue (Anna
Paquin), whose Southern accent fades in and out throughout the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   There also are too many characters, and they aren't given
anything to do. That's what happens when you use the first movie to
set up an inevitable sequel.
</P>
<P>
   The telepathic Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) does little more than
coo over the beds of various injured X-Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Storm (Halle Berry) spends much of the movie standing around
with a cool haircut. Her big line comes when she fights Toad (Ray
Park of Darth Maul fame).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happens to a toad when it's struck by
lightning?'' Storm asks. ``The same thing that happens to
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of the powers of the X-Men, which don't
seem to click on when needed. As a result, they spend much of the
movie as punching bags for the evil mutants.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, you start rooting for the appearance of
Nightstick Man, who just bonks everybody on the head and is done
with it.
</P>
<P>
   But where's the political message in that?

   What is the deal with Russell Crowe? Just being a movie star and

no, not randy Russ, who now evidently adds home wrecker to his list
of credits. That's the topic of (beginitalic)People's
(enditalic)cover story, and the saga of Meg Ryan's ``SHOCKING
SPLIT'' from Dennis Quaid to find ``comfort'' with the
``(beginitalic)Gladiator (enditalic)bad boy'' is a heartbreaker
from Quaid's perspective at least. The inescapable CBS series
(beginitalic)Survivor (enditalic)gets a six-page spread devoted
entirely to the instant-celebrity losers who got booted off the
island in the show's first few weeks; charming curmudgeon Walter

   Right up front, Christopher Caldwell spends a tidy essay
decrying American anhedonia (''a loss of interest or pleasure in
all or almost all usual activities and pastimes''), and it's more
than just a good excuse to run a 1961 photo of Brigitte Bardot
riding a bicycle, which the editors also do, so thank you, editors.
Among the chief culprits, Caldwell guesses, is our unhealthy
obsession with health and longevity. ``Would Picasso have made it
to 91 without tobacco and sex?'' he asks. We'd answer, but, uh,
what was the question? A few pages later, George W. Bush's media
adviser Mark McKinnon is profiled; Tucker Carlson measures John
McCain's lingering coolness quotient; and there's an interview with
Elizabeth Hurley, who is no Brigitte Bardot circa 1961 but close.

   The members of your expedition are tired, sore, grumpy, itchy,

Disney dwarfs? Heading back to campus on the last afternoon of
spring break? Or just midway through your annual family theme park
hajj? If you answered hajj, it's time for a teaching moment! This
handy site, Amusement Park Physics, reminds us that amusement park
thrills are about more than the mere conversion of credit card
limit to credit card debt. A roller coaster, for example, is all
about the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy. Wheeee!
Bumper cars and carousels also get the slide rule treatment here,

   The most important article on the shelves right now, maybe in
the entire history of magazinedom, is this month's update on the
Harry Potter movie. The first in an inevitable series,
(beginitalic)Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, (enditalic)is
set to shoot this fall for November 2001 release. Chris
((beginitalic)Home Alone(enditalic)) Columbus, urged to pursue the
Potter franchise by his four kids, will direct. Jennifer Lopez gets
the cover, and we get an embarrassing glimpse at one of Lopez's
too-fussy handlers scolding a room service waiter over the
temperature of the diva's breakfast milk. Writes Johanna Schneller:
```You have to go back for hot milk (beginitalic)right
now(enditalic),' she says in the tone one would use to say, `You

   What is the deal with Russell Crowe? Just being a movie star and

no, not randy Russ, who now evidently adds home wrecker to his list
of credits. That's the topic of (beginitalic)People's
(enditalic)cover story, and the saga of Meg Ryan's ``SHOCKING
SPLIT'' from Dennis Quaid to find ``comfort'' with the
``(beginitalic)Gladiator (enditalic)bad boy'' is a heartbreaker
from Quaid's perspective at least. The inescapable CBS series
(beginitalic)Survivor (enditalic)gets a six-page spread devoted
entirely to the instant-celebrity losers who got booted off the
island in the show's first few weeks; charming curmudgeon Walter
Matthau gets a loving send-off; and making a few campaign

   Right up front, Christopher Caldwell spends a tidy essay
decrying American anhedonia (''a loss of interest or pleasure in
all or almost all usual activities and pastimes''), and it's more
than just a good excuse to run a 1961 photo of Brigitte Bardot
riding a bicycle, which the editors also do, so thank you, editors.
Among the chief culprits, Caldwell guesses, is our unhealthy
obsession with health and longevity. ``Would Picasso have made it
to 91 without tobacco and sex?'' he asks. We'd answer, but, uh,
what was the question? A few pages later, George W. Bush's media
adviser Mark McKinnon is profiled; Tucker Carlson measures John
McCain's lingering coolness quotient; and there's an interview with
Elizabeth Hurley, who is no Brigitte Bardot circa 1961 but close.

   The shudder-inducing cover story tracks the secret life of

   You fill stadiums for big soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   You're the toast of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   At America West Arena on Monday, you'll stage the second WNBA
All-Star Game, a celebration of acceptance that nonetheless
struggled to fill even $10 seats.
</P>
<P>
   You've come halfway, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades after Congress enacted Title IX and threw
the weight of law behind gender equity for amateur female athletes,
that's the official assessment of the Women's Sports Foundation, or
WSF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're halfway'' to equity, said Donna Lopiano, executive
director of the WSF, founded by Billie Jean King in 1974 to seek
justice for women bucking the male-dominated American jockocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say halfway isn't a long way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the year before Title IX mandated that no American
``shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any
educational program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance,'' fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to foundation statistics, the total was 2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in intercollegiate athletics, also regulated under
Title IX, has grown at a slower pace, but nonetheless gains have
been substantial, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, athletic scholarships for women totaled less
than $100,000 nationally, according to the WSF. Currently, the
total tops $180million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the WSF's advocacy hotline averages three to four calls a
day from sports-program participants who suspect inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day there's a new unbelievable,'' said Lopiano.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example, close to home: Desert Vista High School
opened a few years ago in Phoenix with a sparkling baseball field
for boys but not a single softball field for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's resistance - I think it's (lack of)
knowledge,'' said Sister Lynn Winsor, athletic director and coach
at Xavier College Prep in Phoenix. ``You go up to someone and say,
`You've got a wonderful boys' baseball facility with concrete
dugouts. And the girls are sitting on three little park benches.'
It's not that they don't want to - it's that they don't think of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winsor, an Xavier coach and administrator for 26 years, serves
on a committee of the Arizona Interscholastic Association that
evaluates state schools for gender equity. It's not enforcement,
exactly, but rather positive reinforcement - the committee hands
out an annual prize to schools that have made the most progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look around Arizona, I think we're one of the better
states,'' said Winsor, who's also served as an officer for a
national coaches association. ``We've come a long way, especially
compared to some of the Southern states. They really have some
issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of change. I'm impressed by what's happening.
Sometimes change is painful, but it's for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, or
OCR, is charged with enforcing Title IX. This summer, several
Valley high schools are upgrading facilities to comply, and an OCR
spokesman said there are no open complaints in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Desert Vista softball situation wasn't resolved until a
player's father threatened a Title IX complaint. Title IX scholars
dub it the ``Mad Dad'' phenomenon - fathers who played sports as
kids who now insist on equal opportunity for their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has definitely been a father-led movement,'' said
Lopiano. ``It's not a women's initiative at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lopiano said, the women's movement did not initially
embrace sports as a battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport was originally how we trained men for war,'' Lopiano
said. ``They didn't think it was a healthy thing for women at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dad was there right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, the first generation of mothers to enjoy Title
IX-decreed equality are coaching their young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Dad was rabid, wait until Mom gets into it,''
she said. ``You don't want to ever see your children discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
   College scholarships, which drive participation at lower levels,
are viewed as crucial to the continued march toward sports equity.
Title IX requires that women be awarded scholarship dollars
proportional to their participation in a school's athletic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another index by which schools are measured is whether the
percentage of female athletes matches the percentage of female
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   That test has proved somewhat vexing to sports administrators at
Northern Arizona University, where female enrollment has grown from
52percent to 56 percent in the past few years. In the 1998-99
school year, 48.5 percent of NAU's student athletes were women, up
from 36 percent in the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   One way NAU achieved its gains is a rallying point for
gender-equity critics, who point out that Title IX has been most
painful to participants in minor sports for men. To meet equity
mandates, many colleges have eliminated teams.
</P>
<P>
   Attributing the cut to Title IX, Northern Arizona University,
which had recently added soccer and golf teams for women, last year
dropped men's swimming and diving. More than 50 Division I colleges
have killed wrestling programs in the past two decades. Gymnastics,
tennis {ndash} even baseball {ndash} have been threatened or axed
at colleges around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, fiscally you have to say, We can't add another
female sports if the dollars aren't there,''' said Steve Holton,
NAU's athletic director. ``The only way to stay in compliance with
the federally mandated law is to eliminate men's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Title IX's inception, various male-sports coaches'
associations have mounted organized opposition, and repeated
efforts have been made to exempt football from equity formulas.
According to the Women's Sports Foundation Gender Equity Report
Card for 1997, women gained a net increase of 1,658 National
Collegiate Athletic Association programs since 1978. During the
same years, total men's programs also increased, by 74. However,
schools in the NCAA's Divisions I-A and I-AA, the largest
universities that tend to have the largest athletic programs,
showed a decrease in the number of men's sports programs, a net
loss of 152.
</P>
<P>
   According to the WSF, the explosive growth in female
participation in high school sports during the past couple of
decades didn't dim growth for boys programs. In 1971, 3.6million
boys played high school sports. In 1998, 3.7million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Title IX, I really can't see the sharing of resources
that was required to really give women the opportunity to play,''
said Lopiano. ``It has been a tooth-and-nail fight every step of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSF estimates that 80percent of America's college and
universities are not yet in full compliance with Title IX, though a
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates that more than
three-fourths of the sample supported the drive to equity - even if
it means further cuts in men's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that the general public gets it,'' Lopiano
said. ``The problem is not the general public. It's the
decisionmakers holding the purse strings of sports, a small group
of dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   David F. Salter, author of 1997's (beginitalic)Crashing the Old
Boys' Network: Tragedies and Triumphs of Girls and Women in
Sports(enditalic), said that the 1996 Summer Olympics, where
several American women teams won gold medals, was a watershed
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really look at the Atlanta Olympics as the culmination of
the first 20 years of the Title IX effort,'' he said. ``From there,
the growth and quality of females athletic programs has improved
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salter warned: ``I'm afraid that men and women, fathers and
mothers will get the impression that because we have the WNBA on
television, because we have the World Cup soccer team getting a lot
of publicity, that we've overcome these Title IX challenges, and
the momentum slows or stops.''

director of the WSF, founded by Billie Jean King in 1974 to seek
justice for women bucking the male-dominated American jockocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say halfway isn't a long way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the year before Title IX mandated that no American
``shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any
educational program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance,'' fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to foundation statistics, the total was 2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in intercollegiate athletics, also regulated under
Title IX, has grown at a slower pace, but nonetheless gains have
been substantial, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, athletic scholarships for women totaled less
than $100,000 nationally, according to the WSF. Currently, the
total tops $180million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the WSF's advocacy hotline averages three to four calls a
day from sports-program participants who suspect inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day there's a new unbelievable,'' said Lopiano.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example, close to home: Desert Vista High School
opened a few years ago in Phoenix with a sparkling baseball field
for boys but not a single softball field for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's resistance - I think it's (lack of)
knowledge,'' said Sister Lynn Winsor, athletic director and coach
at Xavier College Prep in Phoenix. ``You go up to someone and say,
`You've got a wonderful boys' baseball facility with concrete
dugouts. And the girls are sitting on three little park benches.'
It's not that they don't want to - it's that they don't think of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winsor, an Xavier coach and administrator for 26 years, serves
on a committee of the Arizona Interscholastic Association that
evaluates state schools for gender equity. It's not enforcement,
exactly, but rather positive reinforcement - the committee hands
out an annual prize to schools that have made the most progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look around Arizona, I think we're one of the better
states,'' said Winsor, who's also served as an officer for a
national coaches association. ``We've come a long way, especially
compared to some of the Southern states. They really have some
issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of change. I'm impressed by what's happening.
Sometimes change is painful, but it's for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, or
OCR, is charged with enforcing Title IX. This summer, several
Valley high schools are upgrading facilities to comply, and an OCR
spokesman said there are no open complaints in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Desert Vista softball situation wasn't resolved until a
player's father threatened a Title IX complaint. Title IX scholars
dub it the ``Mad Dad'' phenomenon - fathers who played sports as
kids who now insist on equal opportunity for their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has definitely been a father-led movement,'' said
Lopiano. ``It's not a women's initiative at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lopiano said, the women's movement did not initially
embrace sports as a battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport was originally how we trained men for war,'' Lopiano
said. ``They didn't think it was a healthy thing for women at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dad was there right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, the first generation of mothers to enjoy Title
IX-decreed equality are coaching their young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Dad was rabid, wait until Mom gets into it,''
she said. ``You don't want to ever see your children discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
   College scholarships, which drive participation at lower levels,
are viewed as crucial to the continued march toward sports equity.
Title IX requires that women be awarded scholarship dollars
proportional to their participation in a school's athletic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another index by which schools are measured is whether the
percentage of female athletes matches the percentage of female
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   That test has proved somewhat vexing to sports administrators at
Northern Arizona University, where female enrollment has grown from
52percent to 56 percent in the past few years. In the 1998-99
school year, 48.5 percent of NAU's student athletes were women, up
from 36 percent in the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   One way NAU achieved its gains is a rallying point for
gender-equity critics, who point out that Title IX has been most
painful to participants in minor sports for men. To meet equity
mandates, many colleges have eliminated teams.
</P>
<P>
   Attributing the cut to Title IX, Northern Arizona University,
which had recently added soccer and golf teams for women, last year
dropped men's swimming and diving. More than 50 Division I colleges
have killed wrestling programs in the past two decades. Gymnastics,
tennis {ndash} even baseball {ndash} have been threatened or axed
at colleges around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, fiscally you have to say, We can't add another
female sports if the dollars aren't there,''' said Steve Holton,
NAU's athletic director. ``The only way to stay in compliance with
the federally mandated law is to eliminate men's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Title IX's inception, various male-sports coaches'
associations have mounted organized opposition, and repeated
efforts have been made to exempt football from equity formulas.
According to the Women's Sports Foundation Gender Equity Report
Card for 1997, women gained a net increase of 1,658 National
Collegiate Athletic Association programs since 1978. During the
same years, total men's programs also increased, by 74. However,
schools in the NCAA's Divisions I-A and I-AA, the largest
universities that tend to have the largest athletic programs,
showed a decrease in the number of men's sports programs, a net
loss of 152.
</P>
<P>
   According to the WSF, the explosive growth in female
participation in high school sports during the past couple of
decades didn't dim growth for boys programs. In 1971, 3.6million
boys played high school sports. In 1998, 3.7million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Title IX, I really can't see the sharing of resources
that was required to really give women the opportunity to play,''
said Lopiano. ``It has been a tooth-and-nail fight every step of
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSF estimates that 80percent of America's college and
universities are not yet in full compliance with Title IX, though a
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates that more than
three-fourths of the sample supported the drive to equity - even if
it means further cuts in men's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that the general public gets it,'' Lopiano
said. ``The problem is not the general public. It's the
decisionmakers holding the purse strings of sports, a small group
of dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   David F. Salter, author of 1997's (beginitalic)Crashing the Old
Boys' Network: Tragedies and Triumphs of Girls and Women in
Sports(enditalic), said that the 1996 Summer Olympics, where
several American women teams won gold medals, was a watershed
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really look at the Atlanta Olympics as the culmination of
the first 20 years of the Title IX effort,'' he said. ``From there,
the growth and quality of females athletic programs has improved
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salter warned: ``I'm afraid that men and women, fathers and
mothers will get the impression that because we have the WNBA on
television, because we have the World Cup soccer team getting a lot
of publicity, that we've overcome these Title IX challenges, and
the momentum slows or stops.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SOUL OF A CHEF''
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Ruhlman
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $26.95)
</P>
<P>
   That pizza from Uncle Sam's looked mighty good to us after we
finished reading about the pressure and politics behind the making
of great food. In the first part of this book, Ruhlman, who wrote
on the same subject in (beginitalic)The Making of a
Chef(enditalic), investigates the grueling certified master chef
exam at the Culinary Institute of America (where one participant
was berated for his ``knife skills'' after a slice of duck terrine
turned up wider at one end than at the other). Part two moves to
the kitchen of the personable Michael Symon of Cleveland's Lola
Bistro and part three to California's French Laundry, opened by
Thomas Keller (who had no formal culinary training) in 1994 and
three years later called ``the most exciting restaurant in
America'' by Ruth Reichl of the (beginitalic)New York
Times(enditalic). The Keller chapters are the best, showing both
the chef's severe perfectionism and the relentless stress under
which he and his staff create extraordinary meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE UNWANTED GAZE''
</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey Rosen
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, legal affairs editor of the (beginitalic)New
Republic(enditalic), takes a disturbing look at the legal and
social changes that ``have undermined our ability to control how
much information about ourselves is communicated to others.'' If
that sounds harmless, consider this: E-mail, even deleted, is
really a permanent record that can be retrieved by employers or
prosecutors at any future time. Kenneth Starr was able to confront
Monica Lewinsky with love letters written on her computer but never
sent to Bill Clinton, and later he was able to subpoena receipts of
Lewinsky's book purchases for 1995. Rosen also offers the
controversial suggestion that Clinton's alleged actions with Paula
Jones in that infamous Little Rock, Ark., hotel room did not
constitute sexual harassment but an invasion of her privacy. He
makes a complex subject fascinating by showing us how vulnerable we
all are. His message: Pay attention. It could happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``WERE YOU ALWAYS AN ITALIAN?''
</P>
<P>
   By Maria Laurino
</P>
<P>
   (Norton, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   When Mario Cuomo graduated from law school and tied for first
place in his class, the dean suggested that he change his name in
order to get a job on Wall Street. ``Can you imagine me as Mark
Conrad?'' Cuomo asked Laurino, and then he posed the question that
became her book's title, establishing between them a bond of ethnic
ambivalence. Yes, she once wanted to change her name to Laurin, to
free her of her Italian identity. And, no, she could not imagine
him as Mark Conrad. A warning: This is no warm and fuzzy book of
Italian jokes and anecdotes, with some references to
(beginitalic)The Godfather (enditalic)thrown in for good measure.
With intelligence and honesty, Laurino discusses her family, her
self-image, the contradictory effects of her ethnicity (she winces
at books and documentaries on ``the Italian-American experience,''
yet is quick to romanticize her own history) and the fierce ties
that hold her to a heritage she does not completely understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A GATHERING OF SPIES''
</P>
<P>
   By John Altman
</P>
<P>
   (Putnam, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the reference to Cary Grant and Carole Lombard on the
first page, but this book has the feel of one of those great old
movies about World War II. If you were to compare it to another
novel, it would be Ken Follett's (beginitalic)Eye of the
Needle(enditalic). Unlike Follett's Henry Faber, however, Altman's
spy is a woman. Katarina Heinrich has murdered a friend, assumed
her identity and married her employer, plodding Princeton scientist
Richard Carter. In true old-movie tradition, Richard is invited to
work on the bomb project at Los Alamos, N.M., and his stunned wife
goes along, planning her next move on behalf of Germany. Meanwhile,
British authorities recruit aging professor Harry Winterbotham to
spy for them, and Harry sees an opportunity to rescue his Jewish
wife, who was caught in Poland during Hitler's invasion. Are you
taking notes? Good, because there's more. It's all easy,
old-fashioned fun. Just bring the popcorn.

   If it's Wednesday, it must be Scotland, and a reporter from
the(beginitalic) Daily Record (enditalic)in Glasgow is calling to
ask about Sheriff Joe Arpaio's plan to put cameras in the booking
room of the Madison Street Jail and broadcast live over the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it trrrue?'' says Gary Ralston, who, for a newspaper
writer, does a better than average impersonation of Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's told. But that was only in the paper yesterday, how
did you hear about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about it in an Irish paper,'' he says. ``And some
British papers have stories as well. So, we'll be doing a feature
on the sheriff here. Is it true he said he wants the fellas
arrested with prostitutes to wave to the cameras so their wives
will see?''
</P>
<P>
   More or less. The sheriff says his Web camera will be a
deterrent, adding, ``Maybe those guys who get busted on Van Buren
(for soliciting prostitution) can wave to their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How funny,'' Ralston says, doing a better than average
imitation of Sean Connery laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would Sheriff Arpaio do such a thing?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's been about one month since his last big publicity
stunt, he's told.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Back in June, Joe announced he would provide better
accommodations and more expensive food for the dogs under his care
than he would for the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quite bold with statements like this, isn't he?'' Ralston
says. ``And they seem to go over quite well?''
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by your call, yes, he's told. The month before the
dogs, there was the story about (beginitalic)60 Minutes
(enditalic)coming to town to interview Joe. And reports about a
movie company planning to film the story of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Ralston says, ``that made the papers as well. He wants
Robert De Niro or Joe Pesci to play his part, I recall. What do you
make of that?''
</P>
<P>
   I tell him it will be a first for American cinema. Most
biographical films fictionalize a real-life story. Joe's picture
would tell the true story of a purely fictional character {ndash}
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston called me because my name appeared in the newspaper
research he did, as well as in the thick file he received on
Sheriff Joe from Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel from guys like me there is an unfair
representation of Arizona (because of all the stories about
Arpaio)?'' he asks. He also wonders if I'm tired of talking about
the sheriff to out-of-towners. I've tried to stop, I say (in a
better than average imitation of Al Pacino in Godfather III), but
they keep pulling me back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me that this man could hire the sharpest PR talent
in the land and they couldn't do as good a job as he does,''
Ralston says. ``Why do you suppose that is?''
</P>
<P>
   I tell him it's because Arpaio is a naive genius. He's like
Grandma Moses, the painter, untrained in classic technique, but
still a master.
</P>
<P>
   He's the kid who's never played organized ball weaving through
defenders on the basketball court, faking a pass and going in for
an easy lay-up. What Joe's got, you can't teach.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter from Glasgow said he hopes to find out for himself
sometime soon, with an interview. Arpaio won't disappoint him. He
never does. After years of rehearsals and performances, he does a
better than average impersonation of a sheriff.

 &HT;    CLINTON CONVINCES ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS TO REMAIN FOR TALKS IN
HIS ABSENCE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ In a dramatic last-ditch effort to salvage
faltering Mideast peace talks, President Clinton convinced Israeli
and Palestinian leaders late Wednesday to remain at Camp David for
the next four days while he journeys to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns _ as early as Sunday afternoon _ Clinton said he
will resume talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the negotiations will be lead by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, though at a decidedly scaled-down pace
than the nine grinding days and nights of summitry that wound up
inconclusively Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had concluded that the summit had failed
Wednesday evening, and he was preparing to leave the presidential
retreat at nearby Camp David empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought it was over,'' Clinton told some 200 reporters
gathered in this Catoctin mountain hamlet to cover the Camp David
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's presidential motorcade loaded and ready to convey
him to Washington for an early morning flight Thursday to Japan,
the parties agreed to remain at the presidential compound and
resume leader-level peace talks upon his return.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned that there remained no guarantee of success in
the talks, aimed at resolving the thorny territorial and security
disputes at the heart of 52 years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gaps remain substantial, but there has been progress,''
Clinton said, adding that he believed all parties needed to be
prepared ``to go the extra mile'' for peace.
</P>
<P>
   After staring at the prospect of a failed peace summit, Clinton
said, neither Arafat nor Barak wanted to return to the tumultuous
region without a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to give up,'' Clinton said during brief remarks
early Thursday to reporters at the temporary media center set up in
a tiny elementary school in this town of 4,400.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat had been prepared to leave the Camp David
summit earlier at an acrimonious impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, in fact, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
released a statement declaring that the talks had collapsed in
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit has come to an end without reaching an agreement,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a prepared statement
read to reporters just before 11 p.m. (ET) by National Security
Council spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours, though, Clinton shuttled between Arafat and
Barak, who haven't met directly since Saturday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOP goal on marriage tax is to cast Democrats as
anti-family
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you were wondering, all that fuss in Washington over
fixing the so-called ``marriage penalty'' _ some couples pay more
together than they would filing individually _ isn't about the
marriage penalty at all. It's about snookering Democrats. Hey, this
is an election year, folks.
</P>
<P>
   So, Republican majorities in the House and Senate, with a few
Democratic crossovers, have passed legislation that, its
enthusiasts say, would end the cruel business of unfairly harrying
financially struggling couples and the unholy business _ the
religious right is still out there, to be played to _ of favoring
probably wanton singlehood over the presumed fidelities of the
marital couch.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. Mostly no.
</P>
<P>
   The real game here is to put the Clinton administration and
specifically Vice President and White House aspirant Al Gore in a
blind alley and watch them squirm. It's working.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP legislation is designed virtually to force the president
to veto the legislation on the grounds that it is tilted too
heavily to well-off couples and, passing out goodies even to
couples who pay no marriage penalty, would create an irresponsible
drain on revenue.
</P>
<P>
   All true, by the way. Citizens for Tax Justice figures that just
15 per cent of the benefit from the core provision of the
legislation would go to low- and moderate-income couples earning
under $50,000 a year. They account for 45 percent of married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the benefit would go to the one-third of couples
earning better than $75,000 a year. And the payout would lavish
benefits even on the nearly one-half of couples who, thanks to
another tax code quirk, already get what amounts to a marriage
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   (Say this for the legislation. At least so-so and average
earners would benefit to a degree, which is more than you can say
for other GOP tax giveaways, most notoriously the inheritance tax
repeal, a boon only to our richest 2 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   The full-blown program -- more recently slightly moderated --
would open a sump that would drain $248 billion out of national
revenues over the next 10 years, compounding as time goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rejected a proposal pitched by the White House and
congressional Democrats that would have limited benefits to couples
actually getting the short end now and would have targeted the
payouts more purposefully to mid-range incomes, with relatively
modest strain on revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But legislation that could pass White House muster _ and
independent analysis _ wouldn't give the GOP what it really is
after _ a chance for George W. Bush and Republican congressional
candidates to cast Democrats as anti-family and enemies of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, grandstanding, too, instead of haggling, Gore and
other Democratic candidates could denounce Republicans for enacting
legislation that, put another way, in fact uses tax policy to favor
the married and discriminate against young singles just starting
out and widow ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but that wouldn't be fair, would it?

THEY'RE SCOUTING NBA'S SUMMER STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 
(Resending, correcting slug; originally moved as CELTICS)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Bob Ryan 
c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A writer's dilemma: Do you just say hello, or do you genuflect
and kiss the ring?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, we've got some basketball royalty hanging around the
Clark Athletic Center at UMass-Boston this week. There's Wes
Unseld, who won a title on the floor, as did Paul Westphal, whose
fourth-quarter basket in Game 7 against Milwaukee 26 years ago
stopped a Bucks run and helped ensure Celtic title No. 12. There's
Gregg Popovich, who won the 1999 title as coach/GM of the Spurs.
There's Donnie Walsh, of the Eastern Conference champion Indiana
Pacers. There's Rod Thorn, who drafted Michael Jordan _ hey, that's
more than Houston and Portland did, so why not give him some
credit? _ and who now has the task of legitimizing the New Jersey
Nets. There's, well, a lot of people with NBA clippings, and that
doesn't even include His Airness, His Nike-ness, His Majesty,
Himself, who is rumored to be planning an appearance later in the
week to check out the lads representing his Washington Wizards.
Meanwhile, if you absolutely, positively must see a Michael Jordan,
the three-time All-Ivy namesake out of Penn is here with the 76ers
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Rick Pitino is also present and accounted for. We can't
forget him.
</P>
<P>
   And for what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of time,'' laughs one NBA guy, whose identity
will be protected, lest he suffer the wrath of both his ownership
and his comrades. ``Some of these players have been going to these
leagues for six or seven years. What don't we know about them?''
</P>
<P>
   Dissing the Shaw's Pro Summer League? That's borderline NBA
heresy. Next thing you know, someone will swear off the knee-jerk
double team of everyone but the Underassistant West Coast Promotion
Man. This is serious stuff, you know. It's not summer pickup ball.
Those days are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a half-hour of film this morning and an hour and a half
walkthrough for our team,'' marvels Pitino, who, for the record, is
here in his capacity as Total Big Cheese, rather than Mentor.
Associate coach Jim O'Brien actually is coaching the team.
</P>
<P>
   Back in simpler times, offseason meant, believe it or not,
offseason. Yeah, there was competition available, but it wasn't
exactly monitored very closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play in the LA Summer League,'' recalls Westphal,
who happens to be the Seattle coach, in case you've lost track of
the comings and goings in The World's Greatest Basketball League.
``The Celtics didn't even know what I was doing. I'd come back here
for camp, and they'd say, `Hey, I hear you did pretty good in that
league out there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what exactly are these hoop luminaries doing here, other
than stimulating the local economy with money spent on hotels,
meals, rental cars, cabs, and buses?
</P>
<P>
   For openers, they might as well call this the Adrian Griffin
Memorial Tournament. For he has become the symbol of all the
wannabes and fall-through-the-cracks survivors who annually make
their way from IBL or CBA teams to this pro camp and that pro camp,
then over to
France/Spain/Germany/Turkey/Israel/Venezuela/Uzbekistan and back
again in a repeat cycle, hoping to endear themselves to just one
NBA honcho the way Griffin did with Pitino last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for a guy with what Stu Inman used to call
`stickability,' '' says Celtics general manager Chris Wallace.
``That's what Adrian has. Some guys just can't handle the
rejection, and these guys often get rejected, multiple times.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``stickability,'' Pitino reports an immediate
discovery. ``We've searched everywhere for a big man,'' he says,
``and we've found one.''
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking of Mark Blount, the peripatetic 7-footer whose
relationship with Pitino began when the latter was recruiting the
former to be a Kentucky Wildcat. That was a lot of a lot of things
ago for Blount, who has always been slobbered over far more for his
potential than his actual achievements. He now weighs an acceptable
220, and he appears to have his head on reasonably straight, and so
Pitino has laid it on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we would take him if he would promise not to go
running off somewhere, and that if he could make it through the
first two weeks of training camp he would make the team, and that
there was no reason why he wouldn't make it through the first two
weeks of training camp unless he didn't want to work hard enough,''
said Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Understand something. Mark Blount might be the only one of these
free agents walking out of here with a job.
</P>
<P>
   Reason two for this league's existence is for teams to give some
valuable playing time either to rookies (e.g. Jerome Moiso, DerMarr
Johnson, Desmond Mason, Joel Pryzbilla, etc.), or to young players
on their current roster who didn't get much of a look last year.
Hence the presence of Indiana's Jonathan Bender, the 6-10
19-year-old the Pacers drafted out of Picayune (Miss.) High School,
who played all of 130 minutes as a rookie. Small wonder that team
president Walsh and team GM David Kahn, seated behind the basket,
practically played Bender's Tuesday game against the Atlanta squad
along with him. ``Keep moving, Jonathan,'' exhorted Walsh, maybe 10
or 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   A third and rather intriguing argument for the existence of the
Shaw's Pro Summer League is to provide experience for rookie
coaches. Byron Scott (Nets) at least has an NBA pedigree (lotsa
rings, too), but neither Leonard Hamilton (Washington) nor Lon
Kruger (Atlanta) have ever spent a second in the employ of any NBA
team. Oy vey, do they have a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Cracked one NBA veteran exec, ``Lon will have to understand he
won't be outcoaching anyone in the Eastern Conference, and he won't
be outworking anyone, either. So he'd better make sure they give
him some players.'' You can make a copy of that and stick it in Mr.
Hamilton's mail box, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's all serious stuff, and if you don't believe it, look at the
scores. It's more of that dreary 75-68 business that nauseates us
during the regular season. That rollicking LA League would have
given us 145-140. Geez, guys, can't you lighten up? It's only July.
</P>
<P>
   Glancing up at a ``27'' on the board at the end of one first
period, Westphal smiled. ``I might have had that much myself in the
old LA League.'' You kidding? Raymond Lewis probably averaged 50.
</P>
<P>
   But these guys are all business, and if you don't believe that,
you should have seen Indiana coach Mel Daniels in action. The
Pacers coach was in full game-face mode, pacing the whole game,
slamming down towels and acting as if this was a Game 7. His team
lost by 1, and when Mel walked off the floor you fervently wished
there was going to be a cardiologist waiting for him in the locker
room. Mel, Mel. It's only July. And, anyway, Isiah already has the
job. Isn't that right, Mr. Walsh?
</P>
<P>
   It is what it is, and if you need a hoop fix, go for it. You
just have to decide whether you think it's worth eight bucks. All I
know is that's what I paid for a front-row balcony seat to see
Larry back in '79. Depressing, huh?

 (Color art is included.) 
 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
and Anders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, can plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist

they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
and Anders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, can plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.

Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous

and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
and Anders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, can plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And
since everyone knows that they're trying to clap in unison, the
cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''
 &HT;    Eighteen months ago, Tamas Vicsek, together with physicists
Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana
and Zoltan Neda of Romania's Babes-Bolyai University in
Cluj-Napoca, set out to probe the dynamics of clapping more
closely.
 &HT;    Neda began the project by suspending microphones from the
ceilings of concert halls in Romania and recording the applause. He
and the other researchers then analyzed the recordings and found a
fairly consistent pattern: several rounds _ up to six or seven _ of
synchronized clapping, interspersed with incoherent cacophony.
Moreover, the periods between claps doubled during synchronization.
 &HT;    To study the process further, Neda and his graduate student
Erzsebet Ravasz asked 73 high-school students to stand alone in a
room and clap quickly, as they would after an outstanding
performance. Then he asked them to clap as if they were
synchronizing with others.
 &HT;    He found that their clapping rates varied quite widely when they
were asked to clap quickly _ between three and five claps per
second _ but when asked to simulate synchrony, most people clapped
at around the same, relatively slow rate: about two claps per
second.
 &HT;    As for the waves of chaotic clapping that interrupt the
synchrony periodically, Barabasi and Vicsek think they're a matter
of crowd psychology. When synchrony sets in, the overall noise of
the applause decreases; when it disappears, the noise level rises.
Synchronization, they conclude, triggers a cozy feeling of
togetherness among audience members, whereas faster clapping feels
more enthusiastic. Conflicting desires swing the clappers between
the two modes.
 &HT;    There was a time, Barabasi adds, when comradeship reigned
supreme in countries such as Hungary and Romania and exuberance had
no place, when swings between synchrony and chaos couldn't be
heard.
 &HT;    At the giant rallies common to Barabasi's childhood in communist
Romania _ a childhood marked by the tyrannical regime of Nicolae
Ceausescu _ audiences applauding the ``great leader'' would clap
monotonously and dutifully in synchrony in response to party
speeches. But there was no enthusiasm to spur their clapping into
disorder. Then one day in late December 1989, the synchronized
applause ended _ abruptly.
 &HT;    ``When Ceausescu was overthrown, he organized a huge rally of
250,000 people in Bucharest to show support for him,'' Barabsi
remembers. ``People were supposed to clap synchronously, and at the
beginning they did. But then the clapping stopped. Some people
threw their banners down, and then the shooting started and the
revolution began.''
 &HT;    Four days later, on Christmas day, Ceausescu was shot dead.

 By JACK McCLINTOCK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
andAnders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, can plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 By JOSIE GLAUSIUSZ 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trumpeting cherubs peer down from the walls of Budapest's
opulent music academy. As pianist Dezso Ranki pounds at the keys,
his breathing is at times so stertorous one could swear that
someone in the audience is snoring.
 &HT;    But there are no somnolent spectators here. When the final
chords of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major crash out, the
crowd bursts into applause _ at first tumultuously, but then,
suddenly, in perfect unison.
 &HT;    There is no signal, no leader; the synchrony is spontaneous. The
pianist bows, his pageboy hairdo flopping about his solemn face. He
disappears backstage, then returns to applause that grows stronger.
Yet as the clapping gathers strength, its synchrony dissolves.
 &HT;    Ranki retreats and reappears repeatedly, and so does the rhythm
of the applause _ one moment chaotic, the next a perfect beat. Then
without warning the entire audience stops, as one, on a single
clap.
 &HT;    Tamas Vicsek, a physicist at Budapest's Eotvos University,
twists around from his second-row seat and explains. \
 &HT;    ``This synchronized clapping is called `iron' applause in
Hungarian,'' he says. ``There was a time when an iron curtain would
descend after a performance between the stage and the audience,
which would clap rhythmically to induce the conductor or actors to
appear in front of the curtain, through a little door at its
center.''
 &HT;    The iron curtain is gone _ in more ways than one _ from this
country, but the rhythmic applause remains. In fact, it's hardly
unique to the theaters of Budapest: When hockey player Wayne
Gretzky retired from the Rangers, for instance, the crowd at
Madison Square Garden burst into rhythmic applause, and the same
response met Cecilia Bartoli when she sang an aria at the Teatro
Olimpico in Vicenza, Italy.
 &HT;    The reason, Vicsek and his colleagues in the United States and
Romania believe, has as much to do with mathematics as it does with
aesthetics and psychology.
 &HT;    According to Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University who has studied synchronization for 20 years, the same
set of mathematical principles governs the phenomenon wherever it
occurs _ be it among applauding people, flashing fireflies or
roomfuls of grandfather clocks.
 &HT;    Strogatz has been fascinated by synchronization since he
experimented with pendulums in his first science class. Now he
seems to see it wherever he looks.
 &HT;    Asian fireflies flash together each night in the mangrove trees
along a riverbank. Crickets chirp in unison, and cicadas emerge
from the ground at the same moment every 17 years.
 &HT;    The moon rotates around its own axis at exactly the same rate as
it orbits around Earth, which is why one side of the moon is never
seen. Pacemaker cells in the heart oscillate in harmony. There is
even the curious case of menstrual synchrony among women who live
together.
 &HT;    To understand the mechanics of synchrony, Strogatz suggests,
imagine several athletes running around a circular track.
 &HT;    ``Suppose these runners are friends, and they would prefer to
run together so that they can talk,'' he says. ``If their speeds
are not too different _ that is, if the slowest one can keep up
with the fastest one _ then you can get a group of runners all
going in sync. But first, they have to be sensitive to each other.
 &HT;    ``They have to be willing to adjust their speeds from what they
would prefer. The fastest ones have to slow down, and the slowest
ones have to speed up, to find some compromise. And that same
principle _ that slow oscillators have to speed up and fast ones
have to slow down, and that this happens because of mutual
interactions _ is a pretty universal principle for synchrony.''
 &HT;    The interactions, Strogatz adds, can be obvious: The runners see
each other, the clappers hear the other claps.
 &HT;    They can also be subtle. Two grandfather clocks can synchronize
their pendulum swings _ an effect first observed in 1665 by their
inventor, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens _ through
imperceptible vibrations traveling through the wall against which
they both lean.
 &HT;    But the story can also be more complicated than that. Picture,
for example, some crickets living alone in soundproof chambers, as
they did in Strogatz's lab. They can listen to their neighbors'
sounds only when controlled levels of chirping are piped in.
 &HT;    ``If we make the sounds loud enough _ if we let enough of the
chirping sound through _ at some point, there will suddenly be
enough mutual influence that they can synchronize. Below that
point, they can't. This is what physicists call a phase
transition,'' Strogatz says. ``There's a critical amount of
interaction when synchrony will burst out. It doesn't just build up
gradually.''
 &HT;    A similar phase transition lies behind an audience's sudden
switch to synchronized clapping.
 &HT;    ``Say the people are clapping in a disorganized way, but they
all know that they're trying to synchronize,'' Strogatz explains.
``However, they don't hear a beat. But then _ and this is rather
mysterious _ suppose a beat just happens to emerge a little bit,
maybe because a few clappers get lucky. That beat will then be
audible above the din of the disorganized rest of the audience. And

cooperative clappers will try to join in with that beat. The pulse
becomes stronger, and then it takes off.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    In the cool morning, Oumar the Tuareg guide announces that the
elephants might have arrived at watering holes near the
InAdyatafane oasis, so everyone piles into the Land Rovers to cross
60 miles of hot open desert.
 &HT;    Six hours later, the vehicles lurch to a stop a mile from where
the herd should be. The rest of the distance must be covered on
foot to keep from spooking the elephants.
 &HT;    Wildlife veterinarian Billy Karesh carefully screws the barrel
of his rifle into its stock and drops two fully charged anesthetic
darts into the pocket of his cargo pants.
 &HT;    He strides briskly across a desert landscape _ his senses on
full alert. A six-ton pachyderm could be just feet away.
 &HT;    ``It's easy to walk up on them by accident in the thorn scrub,''
he says. ``I don't want to encourage anybody to get close to these
elephants. It's very possible a human could die in this.''
 &HT;    The elephants Karesh hopes to track fatten themselves during the
rainy season in the lush countryside of Burkina Faso, 100 miles
south of here. When the vegetation withers in October, they wander
north to these few reliable water holes in the Gourma region just
south of Timbuktu, in Mali. It's the longest elephant migration in
Africa _ a 600-mile round trip.
 &HT;    To outsiders, the herd remains virtually unknown, but recently,
as the advancing Sahara has eroded the elephants' habitat and
nomads-turned-farmers have seized more of it to grow crops,
scientists have taken notice.
 &HT;    Karesh has come to help Anne Orlando, a wildlife biologist from
the University of California at Davis, who plans to put radio
collars on 10 elephants, track their movements over two years and
develop a conservation program.
 &HT;    Karesh is one of a half dozen globe-trotting wildlife vets, and
Orlando chose him because he knows how to fell wild animals without
injuring them.
 &HT;    Not long ago, scientists studying wildlife diseases simply shot
a few animals and studied their carcasses. But with Karesh in
charge, ``the risks to the elephants will be minimal, so I can
justify putting collars on them,'' Orlando says. She laughs. ``I
have to follow these elephants for the next two years on foot, and
I don't want them to have a bad experience, so that eventually
they'll forgive me. It's rare to find someone with his sensitivity
to animals.''
 &HT;    As the intrepid vet for the Wildlife Conservation Society based
at the Bronx Zoo in New York, Karesh has collected blood samples
from vampire bats in Peru, darted buffalo in Gabon and extracted a
mass of maggots from the festering head wound of an okapi in the
Congo.
 &HT;    ``Billy's kind of beyond real life,'' says his girlfriend,
Stacey Beard, a publicist for Neiman Marcus. ``He has a tremendous
sense of joy, he's enormously compassionate, and he's very real,
very authentic.''
 &HT;    Over the years, Karesh has brought down more than 100 elephants.
He's familiar with the calm, tourist-acclimated elephants of East
Africa. He understands their aggressive cousins in Cameroon, where
poaching is rampant.
 &HT;    He has tracked the vehicle-shy elephants of the Congo and the
hard-to-find forest elephants in the Central African Republic.
 &HT;    But Mali is different. The rangy, short-tusked desert elephants
are mysterious. One thing he does know is that they're
unpredictable.
 &HT;    And dangerous. Last year, they killed two of the goatherds.
 &HT;    As dry limbs crunch under his feet, Karesh moves from a
sun-blasted clearing into a patch of acacias, followed by Orlando
and Anders Lindgren, a technician whose Swedish firm, Televilt,
manufactured the 10 elephant-sized collars from tough fire-hose
material.
 &HT;    Behind them come Oumar, the Tuareg translator and guide, and
Samake, a uniformed Malian forestry official armed with a
high-powered rifle _ at the government's insistence, he's there to
protect Karesh if an elephant charges.
 &HT;    Karesh ignores him. No matter how dangerous the situation,
Karesh refuses to carry any weapon except his C02 rifle.
 &HT;    A hoarse cough from the bush stops him in his tracks. Then comes
a screaming roar, and everyone instinctively ducks. The first
elephant appears over the stunted treetops 90 feet away, followed
by a half dozen others and an enormous bull.
 &HT;    He trumpets, and at the sound two Tuaregs _ nomads who have
known elephants all their lives _ drop their walking sticks and
take off at a full run.
 &HT;    Karesh sets his feet, calmly raises his rifle and fires at a
medium-sized female, hitting her cleanly in the haunch.
 &HT;    Karesh yells and waves his arms to drive off the other
elephants. The herd melts away and, in the silence, there's a slow
crash as the female topples sideways into a thorn tree, shoving it
over as she falls asleep.
 &HT;    The team swarms over her warm body. She's snoring, and her feet,
big as dinner plates, shake.
 &HT;    Karesh drapes a moist blue cloth over her eyes to protect them
from the sun. He injects the dart wound with a long-lasting
antibiotic normally used to prevent mammary infections in lactating
cows.
 &HT;    Karesh inserts a pulse oximeter into her trunk to check her
heart rate (43) and blood oxygen level (95 percent). She's doing
fine and soon stops twitching.
 &HT;    Orlando begins measuring leg length, shoulder height and tusk
size, trying to estimate the animal's age. Lindgren crouches by the
elephant's head, her breath hot and wet on his face as he drapes an
eight-foot-long, 18-pound collar around her neck and fixes it there
with bolts through grommets.
 &HT;    The radio-tracking collar contains a tiny global positioning
satellite receiver linked to a memory chip. As the elephant moves
about, the collar will record her position in latitude and
longitude every two hours.
 &HT;    Every eight weeks, the collar will transmit the data to a radio
receiver, from which it can be downloaded into a laptop computer.
 &HT;    The computer, fitted with geographical software, an plot the
herd's movements on a map. Orlando can then analyze the travel
patterns of the elephants and assess their needs by plugging in
other variables, such as the location of water holes, the density
of vegetation and the movements of nomads and the goatherd.
 &HT;    The research will help her develop a conservation plan for the
Gourma-region elephants.
 &HT;    Karesh finishes examining the elephant for parasites and wounds
as Orlando measures a front leg.
 &HT;    ``I'd get that quickly,'' he says. ``We don't want her to get
overheated.''
 &HT;    He finds a vein in the elephant's ear and injects the antidote
that will wake her. The elephant shivers.
 &HT;    ``OK, I think it's time to go now,'' Karesh says.
 &HT;    Everyone backs away without taking their eyes off the trembling
elephant.
 &HT;    She's waking quickly, eyelashes fluttering and crushing the tree
beneath her as she tries to get to her feet. She waves her trunk in
the air, staggers erect and stands there dazed, swaying.
 &HT;    Karesh, Orlando and the others continue backing away. The
elephant shuffles, senses strangers, lifts her head and turns to
face them. Her eyes focus.
 &HT;    Karesh yells, ``Get the hell out of here!'' as the elephant
throws a cloud of dust into the air with her trunk and charges.
Karesh is already running. Oumar runs. A cameraman sets down his
lenses and runs.
 &HT;    The uniformed Malian official begins to raise his high-powered
rifle, then lowers it, turns and runs.
 &HT;    Panicked, everyone stumbles through the rough gullies and across
the thorn-strewn clay while the elephant crashes through the trees.
 &HT;    Finally the sound fades as she slows, turns and heads upwind to
join the herd.
 &HT;    Scattered and alone in the cover of thorny bush, people lean on
trees, catch their breath and glance around quickly, hearts
pounding. Karesh shakes his head, recalling what some local
``experts'' had proclaimed.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no, they never charge,'' he says with more than a touch of
irony.
 &HT;    The team doesn't spot a single elephant the rest of the day. In
the evening, Karesh divides the blood into ampoules and labels
them. Normally, he'd do a blood-cell count and then freeze samples
in liquid nitrogen, but a promised consignment of nitrogen hasn't
materialized.
 &HT;    ``This is Africa,'' he says, and shrugs.
 &HT;    He smears blood one cell thick on glass slides to be checked for
immune function and parasites.
 &HT;    Later, in New York, he will compare his data with that of other
scientists who monitor the incidence and spread of wildlife
diseases. More blood goes onto filter paper for genetic and
infectious-disease
 &HT;    Time and again during the research expedition, Karesh gets the
best data he can and keeps the team safe. But his concern about
elephants' unpredictability is not misplaced.
 &HT;    One day, as Oumar's 12-year-old cousin tends the family's sheep
and goats at the edge of the forest, an elephant attacks from
nowhere, crushing the boy's skull and leaving his dismembered body
scattered across the sand.
 &HT;    When Karesh arrives at the family's leather-roofed tent, all he
can do is splint the broken arm and leg of the boy's screaming
4-year-old friend, who was injured in the same attack.
 &HT;    The family shrieks in misery as Karesh hydrates the child and
tries to pull him out of shock before sending him off to what
passes for a hospital hours away across the desert.
 &HT;    For a week, Karesh can barely speak of the incident.
 &HT;    When he finally tells Beard about it, she is stunned _ and
relieved.
 &HT;    ``I'm incredibly sad for the child and the family,'' she says.
``And selfishly, I can't help thinking, `That could have been
Billy.'''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Greasing up the old (and new) glove
 &HT;    For release, Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenny went out and bought his eight-year-old grandson a baseball
glove the other day. And now it was time to break it in, which
puzzled the child because most kids today just take their glove off
the store shelf and go straight to the field -- which is why the
ball bounces out of the glove so often.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, Kenny, who treks three miles with me each morning in an
effort to stave off overwhelming weight gain and joint lockup,
asked me if I remembered the kind of oil we used to grease our
gloves with when we were kids as he wanted to get some to break in
his grandson's new glove.
</P>
<P>
   This caused a great deal of thought. Even though I still carry a
baseball glove in the trunk of my car (you never know when a
grandson is going to honor you by asking for a game of catch) I
cannot recall the last time I oiled it, or if ever I did.
</P>
<P>
   My glove is a Fred Lynn model and he played in the major leagues
beginning in 1974. I don't believe he played into the '90s. Thus,
you know how long I've had that glove (with a beat-up baseball
jammed into its pocket and a strap wrapped around it to keep it
closed and formed.)
</P>
<P>
   So what was that oil we used to use as kids? Think more!
</P>
<P>
   My first glove was a Goose Goslin model. That ought to give away
my age, but it really doesn't. Goslin broke into the major leagues
in 1921 and played into 1935. But I didn't get the glove until the
1940s; it was used when I got it.
</P>
<P>
   Like other boys, I kept a bottle of that whatsit in my closet,
every once in a while taking it out and rubbing it firmly into the
pocket of the glove. Then I would pound it with a baseball until
the color of the pocket turned dark reddish-brown as opposed to the
lighter chestnut look of the rest of the glove.
</P>
<P>
   Don't kids rub oil into their d, or if ever I did it for them?
He said he didn't know and that his eight year old not only didn't
know that but also didn't know on which hand to put the glove.
</P>
<P>
   Make him put some oil on it, I told Kenny; maybe something like
WD-40 or Three-In-One oil or even Mazola oil. Soften up that
pocket, make it supple; the better to close your hand around ground
balls.
</P>
<P>
   No, Kenny insisted, he wanted the real McCoy -- whatever it is.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoonists show it as a light bulb flashing on over your
head, that sudden realization of what your brain was searching for.
Suddenly, the bulb over my head flashed on, a full 300 watts.
</P>
<P>
   Neatsfoot oil!
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't heard the word in years, hadn't uttered it. It just
came to me. This is not a sign of brilliance, or even high
intelligence. It's just a knack many of us have for remembering
things old while, conversely, not being able to recall what
happened just five minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neatsfoot oil,'' I shouted to Kenny. ``Yes!,'' he exclaimed in
celebration, ``that's it, neatsfoot oil. Where would I get it?''
</P>
<P>
   So we started thinking again and decided that we used to get it
either from the corner hardware store or the drug store nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But, asked Kenny, what is neatsfoot oil? And so we thought again
but no light bulbs were forthcoming. Is it possible that the term
is in a dictionary? Well, yes it was.
</P>
<P>
   Neat's-foot oil, or neatsfoot oil (either way is OK) is a
``light yellow oil obtained by boiling the feet and shinbones of
cattle, used mainly as a dressing for leather.'' Aaaargh! I'm sorry
I looked it up; I thought it came out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Kenny hustled down to a hardware store and with
authority newly achieved asked for a small bottle of neatsfoot oil.
And they had it!
</P>

   Did you get some for me, I asked Kenny, thinking that perhaps my
glove drying out in car trunks lo these many years might need some
rejuvenation. No, he hadn't thought of that.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well. Nobody's asked me to play catch for some time
now.

THEY'RE SCOUTING NBA'S SUMMER STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 
(Resending, correcting slug; originally moved as CELTICS)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Bob Ryan 
c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A writer's dilemma: Do you just say hello, or do you genuflect
and kiss the ring?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, we've got some basketball royalty hanging around the
Clark Athletic Center at UMass-Boston this week. There's Wes
Unseld, who won a title on the floor, as did Paul Westphal, whose
fourth-quarter basket in Game 7 against Milwaukee 26 years ago
stopped a Bucks run and helped ensure Celtic title No. 12. There's
Gregg Popovich, who won the 1999 title as coach/GM of the Spurs.
There's Donnie Walsh, of the Eastern Conference champion Indiana
Pacers. There's Rod Thorn, who drafted Michael Jordan _ hey, that's
more than Houston and Portland did, so why not give him some
credit? _ and who now has the task of legitimizing the New Jersey
Nets. There's, well, a lot of people with NBA clippings, and that
doesn't even include His Airness, His Nike-ness, His Majesty,
Himself, who is rumored to be planning an appearance later in the
week to check out the lads representing his Washington Wizards.
Meanwhile, if you absolutely, positively must see a Michael Jordan,
the three-time All-Ivy namesake out of Penn is here with the 76ers
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Rick Pitino is also present and accounted for. We can't
forget him.
</P>
<P>
   And for what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of time,'' laughs one NBA guy, whose identity
will be protected, lest he suffer the wrath of both his ownership
and his comrades. ``Some of these players have been going to these
leagues for six or seven years. What don't we know about them?''
</P>
<P>
   Dissing the Shaw's Pro Summer League? That's borderline NBA
heresy. Next thing you know, someone will swear off the knee-jerk
double team of everyone but the Underassistant West Coast Promotion
Man. This is serious stuff, you know. It's not summer pickup ball.
Those days are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a half-hour of film this morning and an hour and a half
walkthrough for our team,'' marvels Pitino, who, for the record, is
here in his capacity as Total Big Cheese, rather than Mentor.
Associate coach Jim O'Brien actually is coaching the team.
</P>
<P>
   Back in simpler times, offseason meant, believe it or not,
offseason. Yeah, there was competition available, but it wasn't
exactly monitored very closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play in the LA Summer League,'' recalls Westphal,
who happens to be the Seattle coach, in case you've lost track of
the comings and goings in The World's Greatest Basketball League.
``The Celtics didn't even know what I was doing. I'd come back here
for camp, and they'd say, `Hey, I hear you did pretty good in that
league out there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what exactly are these hoop luminaries doing here, other
than stimulating the local economy with money spent on hotels,
meals, rental cars, cabs, and buses?
</P>
<P>
   For openers, they might as well call this the Adrian Griffin
Memorial Tournament. For he has become the symbol of all the
wannabes and fall-through-the-cracks survivors who annually make
their way from IBL or CBA teams to this pro camp and that pro camp,
then over to
France/Spain/Germany/Turkey/Israel/Venezuela/Uzbekistan and back
again in a repeat cycle, hoping to endear themselves to just one
NBA honcho the way Griffin did with Pitino last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for a guy with what Stu Inman used to call
`stickability,' '' says Celtics general manager Chris Wallace.
``That's what Adrian has. Some guys just can't handle the
rejection, and these guys often get rejected, multiple times.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``stickability,'' Pitino reports an immediate
discovery. ``We've searched everywhere for a big man,'' he says,
``and we've found one.''
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking of Mark Blount, the peripatetic 7-footer whose
relationship with Pitino began when the latter was recruiting the
former to be a Kentucky Wildcat. That was a lot of a lot of things
ago for Blount, who has always been slobbered over far more for his
potential than his actual achievements. He now weighs an acceptable
220, and he appears to have his head on reasonably straight, and so
Pitino has laid it on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we would take him if he would promise not to go
running off somewhere, and that if he could make it through the
first two weeks of training camp he would make the team, and that
there was no reason why he wouldn't make it through the first two
weeks of training camp unless he didn't want to work hard enough,''
said Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Understand something. Mark Blount might be the only one of these
free agents walking out of here with a job.
</P>
<P>
   Reason two for this league's existence is for teams to give some
valuable playing time either to rookies (e.g. Jerome Moiso, DerMarr
Johnson, Desmond Mason, Joel Pryzbilla, etc.), or to young players
on their current roster who didn't get much of a look last year.
Hence the presence of Indiana's Jonathan Bender, the 6-10
19-year-old the Pacers drafted out of Picayune (Miss.) High School,
who played all of 130 minutes as a rookie. Small wonder that team
president Walsh and team GM David Kahn, seated behind the basket,
practically played Bender's Tuesday game against the Atlanta squad
along with him. ``Keep moving, Jonathan,'' exhorted Walsh, maybe 10
or 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   A third and rather intriguing argument for the existence of the
Shaw's Pro Summer League is to provide experience for rookie
coaches. Byron Scott (Nets) at least has an NBA pedigree (lotsa
rings, too), but neither Leonard Hamilton (Washington) nor Lon
Kruger (Atlanta) have ever spent a second in the employ of any NBA
team. Oy vey, do they have a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Cracked one NBA veteran exec, ``Lon will have to understand he
won't be outcoaching anyone in the Eastern Conference, and he won't
be outworking anyone, either. So he'd better make sure they give
him some players.'' You can make a copy of that and stick it in Mr.
Hamilton's mail box, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's all serious stuff, and if you don't believe it, look at the
scores. It's more of that dreary 75-68 business that nauseates us
during the regular season. That rollicking LA League would have
given us 145-140. Geez, guys, can't you lighten up? It's only July.
</P>
<P>
   Glancing up at a ``27'' on the board at the end of one first
period, Westphal smiled. ``I might have had that much myself in the
old LA League.'' You kidding? Raymond Lewis probably averaged 50.
</P>
<P>
   But these guys are all business, and if you don't believe that,
you should have seen Indiana coach Mel Daniels in action. The
Pacers coach was in full game-face mode, pacing the whole game,
slamming down towels and acting as if this was a Game 7. His team
lost by 1, and when Mel walked off the floor you fervently wished
there was going to be a cardiologist waiting for him in the locker
room. Mel, Mel. It's only July. And, anyway, Isiah already has the
job. Isn't that right, Mr. Walsh?
</P>
<P>
   It is what it is, and if you need a hoop fix, go for it. You
just have to decide whether you think it's worth eight bucks. All I
know is that's what I paid for a front-row balcony seat to see
Larry back in '79. Depressing, huh?

 &HT;    CHINESE PROVINCE CRACKS DOWN ON CHEATING HUSBANDS, AND THEIR
CONCUBINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, just
over the border from high-flying Hong Kong, there's a saying: If a
man doesn't keep a concubine, he's not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are a lot of successful men in Guangdong. So
successful, in fact, some men have acquired not only a second
``wife,'' they have even a third or a fourth. It's called bao ernai
in Chinese, or taking a second wife. And like the concubines of
traditional China, she gets money, gifts and usually even a house
to live in from her married lover. She often even bears him
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Guangdong, the bao ernai phenomenon has reached the point
where we can no longer ignore it,'' Cui Shuhui, an official of the
state-run All-China Women's Federation recently told the Yangcheng
Evening News, a Guangdong newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so serious, local law enforcement could
no longer wait for China's outdated divorce laws to catch up. So
last month, four provincial law-enforcement and judicial agencies
jointly issued a legal ``opinion'' _ which they claim has the
weight of law _ that makes it easier for women to divorce husbands
who bao ernai.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion entitles the wife to half of everything her husband
has bought for his mistress, even if the item, such as a house, car
or stocks, is in the other woman's name. If the wife has no hard
evidence that her husband has been cheating, the opinion allows
police to help her obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   Local women's groups that had been demanding something be done
to protect the financial interests of wives are over-joyed. Since
the legal opinion was announced, the phones at local offices of the
All-China Women's Federation, which operates at all levels of
government, have been ringing off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangcheng Evening News called the opinion a ``huge bomb.''
One reporter wrote that in two days of interviewing women, the
phrase he heard most often was: ``I was so excited I couldn't sleep
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guangdong opinion comes just as the communist National
People's Congress, China's legislature, is in the midst of debating
a badly-needed revision of the marriage law. Chinese society has
seen huge changes since the law was last updated in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce rates have more than tripled; domestic violence has
increased; and marriages now are based more on individuals'
feelings rather than the old standard of political or familial
ties. The current law gives few guidelines on how to handle issues
such as support payments, splitting assets and custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to amend the law comes at a time when Chinese
society is increasingly troubled by such social problems as
proliferating concubinage and worsening family violence,'' said
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce rate was just 3 percent in 1980 but has climbed to
13 percent. In large cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, it is
well over 25 percent. A 1998 survey in Shanghai found that 36
percent of divorces were due to incompatibility and 22 percent to
extramarital affairs, according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Lu Ying, who teaches marriage and family law at Zhongshan
University in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, said
women often lose out in divorce because the husband can easily hide
his assets from the court. Moreover, housing for many people is
still provided by the employer, usually the husband's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many divorce cases, the woman would be left with nothing,''
said Lu. ``No husband, no child, no house.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While many of the men with modern-day concubines are from Hong
Kong and Taiwan, plenty of mainland men are indulging as well. The
Communist Party views the issue as not only a matter of morality
but a problem that could threaten social stability, one of its
paramount concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just foreign businessmen who are taking second
wives,'' said Hu Kanghsang, an official of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee who is working on the marriage law
revision. ``It also includes domestic factory heads, executives,
private businessmen, even party cadres. This phenomenon seriously
goes against socialist morality and customs . . . and seriously
impacts social stability and family planning.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although concubines are most common in Guangdong, they exist in
other prosperous regions also. In Shanghai it's called ``keeping a
golden canary,'' that is, a lovely, frail creature who lives in a
cage and comes out only when you take it out. In Beijing, she's
called a ``little honey.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a status symbol,'' said Liu Donghua, a lawyer at the
Center for Women's Law Studies &AMP; Legal Services of Beijing
University. ``Men think, 'Everyone else is doing it,' so they just
copy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of cases at the non-profit law center are
for divorce. Of those, almost one-fifth involve extra-marital
relations. To be sure, cases of adulterous women are numerous also
but are vastly outnumbered by philandering husbands. Some men even
bring their mistresses home, Liu said, forcing wife and concubine
to live under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Guangdong opinion doesn't go far enough. Liu, for
example, believes that not only should the husband be made to pay
compensation, so should the other woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third party has to take responsibility for destroying a
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other legal experts in China believe that would be allowing the
law to go too far into the moral realm. Even allowing police to
help gather evidence of adultery, as the Guangdong opinion does,
opens personal lives up to dangerous abuses of police power, says
sociologist Li Yinhe, a researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes have been dividing feminists since a revision of
the marriage law was first proposed in 1995. Passage this year is
unlikely, experts say.

<P>
   TRES ESQUINAS, Colombia _ The flood-swollen Orteguaza River
slices through the Colombian lowlands, its dirty brown water
straining at banks that give way to swampy clumps of thick forest
and patches of cleared land.
</P>
<P>
   Bright green coca plants and poppy fields dot many of the
clearings, verdant cash crops in a land of hunger and war.
</P>
<P>
   This remote territory in Colombia's far south has become ground
zero in the escalating conflict against narcotics traffickers, and
Marxist rebels who have tapped the drug trade as a major source of
revenue to fuel their 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cocaine and heroine grown here is destined for the
United States, which recently approved a $1.3 billion aid package
to help Colombia fight its drug war. Colombian pilots will fly a
fleet of 60 U.S.-supplied helicrops from low-flying crop dusters.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the high-tech U.S. technology, the Amazonian
headwaters of southern Colombia are a primitive, hostile region.
There are few towns, fewer roads and thousands of square miles of
dense green growth perfect for hiding illegal operations _ and
enemies. The muddy brown streams are ideal for transporting
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rivers are the super highways here,'' said General Mario
Montoya, head of a new Colombian anti-narcotics task force. ``They
carry everything they need for the production of cocaine on those
rivers. Ten years ago, there was very little coca here, but today
this area has the highest concentration of coca production in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear the jungle _ and Colombia's tortured landscape of
leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary groups, drug barons, a
questionable military and rancorous domestic politics _ may swallow
up the American aid, drawing the U.S. further into a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a profound and dramatic shift in focus from
supporting a police force in a friendly country to supporting an
army engaged in a civil war,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
shortly after Congress approved the aid package. ``I wonder how
long it will be until we read the first news story of some of this
equipment showing up in the hands of rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the dangers, Colombia's largest guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, has
launched a coordinated series of attacks against rural towns and
villages since the U.S. aid package was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla leaders warn that the stepped-up U.S. aid may threaten
the precarious peace process and trigger an intensified war.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist the aid is strictly for fighting drugs,
not to help Colombia fight its civil war. But Montoya admits that
in the remote wilds, the two are often intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC, with all its guns and all its evil, is involved in
the drug trade,'' he said, referring to the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest and oldest guerrilla
group. ``If the guerrillas are involved in drug trafficking, as we
know they are, we're going to attack them.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, a nation of 39 million, supplies an estimated 80
percent of the world's cocaine. It is also a growing source of
heroin. Both drugs are worth billions on the streets of America and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There are no accurate figures on how much the country's
guerrillas gain by taking a cut from the poor farmers who grow the
crops and the traffickers who process and smuggle it, but some
Colombian newspapers have cited figures in the hundreds of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   With the guerrillas and drug lords so powerful, Colombian
President Andres Pastrana stunned the nation 18 months ago by
starting peace talks with the FARC. To show his goodwill, he
ordered Colombian troops out of a Switzerland-sized chunk of the
nation that has become de facto FARC territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace talks have since stumbled without much real
progress, and Pastrana's popularity has plummeted. Many Colombians
fear he has given the guerrillas too much without getting anything
in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas are terribly strong because they have so much
money from drug trafficking,'' said Eduardo Gomez, who retired from
the Colombian military and now works in Bogota, the capital. ``We
have no confidence in our institutions. The money from the U.S.
will be wasted, because our army, our police and our government are
corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on FARC strength range from 17,000 to 22,000 soldiers
in the field, but they are only one of the warring forces in
Colombia. Another guerrilla group, the Army of National Liberation
or ELN, has some 5,000 soldiers, while right-wing paramilitary
groups, which also take tribute from drug traffickers, have an
estimated 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's military _ the army, air force and navy _ has about
120,000 personnel. It also has a reputation for corruption and
human-rights abuses, with many observers citing close ties between
army officers and the paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has named his bold new strategy for saving the country,
``Plan Colombia.'' The U.S. aid - which will mostly fund military
equipment, but also provides money for crop substitution and other
social programs _ will be supplemented by more than $600 million
for social programs that Pastrana recently obtained from European
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his four-year term in office, however, Pastrana
has been hamstrung by a corruption scandal and bitter relations
with the national congress. He recently appealed to Colombians to
be more positive, saying, ``I'm tired of the bad news that does not
let us see and construct a better country for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than a positive attitude to vanquish
Colombia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Plan Colombia will escalate the war on both
sides,'' said Marco Alberto Romero, a political scientist at
Colombia's National University. ``If the guerrillas resist this
first campaign, the logic will be that the U.S. will increase its
aid and become more committed to the Colombian conflict. It's a
very complicated problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero believes the focus should be on providing more
opportunity for the rural peasants who grow the coca and poppy. The
peasants now have no alternatives, and wiping out their only cash
crop by fumigation could foul the environment, sicken the poor
farmers and create a new wave of internal displacement within
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have regional consequences,'' he said. ``The drug
trafficking affects the whole Andean region. This could lead to the
breakdown of the peace talks in Colombia, but also could trigger an
arms race. Already both (the FARC and the government) are building
up their forces even as they are participating in the peace
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the front lines, Gen. Montoya downplays the criticism and
confidently predicts victory.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent briefing for reporters complete with slides,
tapes of radio conversations among drug traffickers and maps laying
out the alignment of forces, Montoya said the new U.S. aid _
especially a fleet of about 30 sophisticated Blackhawk helicopters
_ will tip the balance in favor of his 3,000-man force in the
southern region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get the helicopters, we can really go to work,'' he
said. ``They will give us the element of surprise and mobility. We
will move in and immediately neutralize the crops.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats patrolling the rivers to intercept cocaine shipments, as
well as the supplies of gasoline, cement and chemicals needed to
convert the coca leaves into cocaine will augment the force.
</P>
<P>
   The only role for U.S. troops _ no more than a few hundred at
the time _ will be to train the Colombian pilots and soldiers, and
help operate sophisticated surveillance equipment the U.S. will
send, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports that the guerrillas may have _ or will soon
obtain _ surface-to-air missiles or other advanced weapons to shoot
down the helicopters. Critics also warn that the drug farmers and
traffickers will simply move elsewhere once the Colombian offensive
picks up steam.
</P>
<P>
   But Montoya remains upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups will try to defend their operations because there
is lots and lots of money involved in narco-trafficking,'' he said.
``But we're prepared militarily for this fight. We're in this for
the long haul.''

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN _ They are one of the world's few
remaining bands of Marxist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Fidel Castro's rag-tag army of Cuban peasants in the
1950s or leftist insurgents dodging around Central America in the
1980s, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are flush with
cash _ lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, as they are known by their Spanish acronym, have
tapped a 1990s source of revenue: drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted with AK-47 rifles, black berets, new uniforms and
knee-high black rubber boots, these guerrillas have become a
battle-proven force of soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   They control huge swaths of the Colombian countryside, and buy
their guns and equipment with tribute paid by poor farmers who
raise coca and poppy, as well as drug traffickers who process and
smuggle the contraband destined for the streets of Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   They also make millions by kidnapping, holding their victims _
sometimes children _ for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   But their connections to Colombia's notorious drug industry are
what have propelled the FARC from a backwater group to powerful
military force with a sophisticated propaganda machine. Their top
negotiators now hobnob with visiting diplomats and recently toured
several European countries with a delegation aiming to bring peace
to Colombia. They even have their own Website.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents, however, bristle at the notion that the FARC
are anything more than ruthless, ideologically driven killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't answer to anybody on this earth or in the next
life,'' said Gen. Mario Montoya, head of a new Colombian
anti-narcotics task force that will spearhead a campaign funded by
a $1.3 billion U.S. anti-drug package. ``They make huge amounts of
money from the drug trade. Coca grows like a weed here, and they
are the middle men.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bulk of their forces still hide in the mountains
and the jungles, the FARC now have their own territory where they
walk the streets free from fear of attack by government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to jump-start peace talks, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana pulled his troops out of a Switzerland-sized area in
southern Colombia in January 1999, in effect creating a safe haven
for the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   But after starting amid great hopes, he peace talks have made
little progress, with the two sides barely able to agree on a rough
list of topics to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FARC have consolidated their hold on their turf,
turning San Vicente _ a town of about 15,000 _ into something of a
rebel showcase.
</P>
<P>
   Few tourists venture to the town, which can be reached by
regular commercial airillas with shouldered automatic rifles and
hand grenades clipped to their belts are clearly the real power in
town.
</P>
<P>
   The local courts collapsed when the judges fled, and they've
been replaced by a FARC system of justice that includes a complaint
center where citizens bring gripes about everything from disputes
with neighbors to domestic squabbles. There are numerous reports
that a separate FARC tribunal deals sternly with those accused of
spying for the government, sometimes imposing death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   FARC billboards urge the people toward ``a new Colombia,'' and
extol the ``Bolivarian Movement,'' a campaign named after South
America's revolutionary hero, Simon Bolivar. There are also banners
decrying government torture and crop fumigation aimed at the coca
plots that support many poor farmers _ as well as the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a rebel information office just off the town
square, where an attractive young woman dressed in fatigues and a
beret takes reque-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD stores
and appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market, you
hear the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish _
occasionally even English.
</P>
<P>
   The market's shops and stalls offer London's best Afro-Caribbean
and African fare _ plantains, caramel-colored smoked fish,
thermo-nuclear peri-peri sauce and yams. The air smells of scorched
coffee, limes and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, bright red double-decker busses _ the symbols
of familiar London seem drab in Brixton _ pass through, a reminder
that the heart of the Anglo-Saxon universe is a 10-minute commute.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Parliament House with Big Ben and Churchill's
statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the fiber of modern
London, a city rapidly being redefined by its ethnic variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is this that is
igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote Yasmin
Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper and
author of Who Do We Think We Are: Imagining the New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation started at the end of World War II, when
Britain began accepting a substantial number of immigrants from
countries that for the most part had been colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Most settled in London's boroughs. Today, nearly 25 percent of
Londoners are from non-white minorities. In boroughs such as
Brixton, the percentage of non-whites is 40 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Wilson, a Brixton resident, came to London in 1952 from
Spanish Town in the hills above Kingston, Jamaica. Wilson, an
electrician, has raised children and now grandchildren in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still Jamaican,'' he says, buying a pair of fresh chickens
for his wife to grill. ``But these young ones, they are Londoners _
not Englishmen, mind you, but Londoners.''
</P>
<P>
   People here insist that London is no melting pot, as immigrants
don't shed their cultural identities in the process of
manufacturing a new one. Nor is London seen as a multicultural
mosaic on the order of Toronto or Chicago, which have ancient,
separate and sheltered ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In London, things are more fluid. With notable exceptions, few
neighborhoods could be called ``Little Delhi,'' ``Little Jamaica,''
or ``Little Lagos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard perhaps said it best when it described
London as an ``ethnic kaleidoscope _ always shaking into a new
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling city of 8 million has 33 distinct ethnic
communities speaking 300 languages. One central London school
recently reported that its 800 students speak 79 languages at home.
At school they are unified in their struggle with English.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this multi-ethnic seasoning is palpable. In fact,
the favorite food in Britain no longer is fish and chips or
steak-and-kidney pie _ it's curry.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has sparked a wave of creativity matched only by
the bell-bottomed Carnaby Street revolution of the mid '60s that
introduced wide belts and frilly Edwardian suits to millions of
American closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other place in the world like this city today,''
London musician Aki Navaz said recently in The New York Times. ``I
used to look through the windows at the white world. Now I know
that white kids are looking through mine, wanting to join in with
this energy.''
</P>
<P>
   London even has become a cultural center for other cultures. In
June, the best and brightest of ``Bollywood'' - the Indian version
of Hollywood - flocked to the Millennium Dome for the Indian
version of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   With Britons, ``Bollywood'' takes a backseat only to Hollywood.
A new 30-screen cineplex is dedicating six screens to Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Three Bollywood movies, known as extravagant productions of epic
lengths and lavish musical interludes, entered the United Kingdom's
top 10 list this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mambo Sharman, one of the Bollywood awards organizers, said he
was amazed at this trend. ``Often I go past a cinema in London and
look at the queues for Bollywood films and there are as many white
faces as Indians,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It makes me
feel guilty for not going as often as I should myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Tussaud's, the venerable British waxworks museum, soon
will add its first ever Bollywood display. And Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the superstar British musical machine with a keen sense of the
popular, is preparing to stage Bombay Dreams, a new musical set in
Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an exaggeration to say non-whites now dominate the
London entertainment scene, the ethnic variety is nevertheless
remarkable. A number of black and Asian comedians _ notably Nina
Wadia and Meera Syal _ have become household names.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Britons are plugged in to Fun-Da-Mental, a
multiracial group that plays a fusion of Persian jazz, rap and
hip-hop. The music produced by these hip, young musicians as well
as the established Jazzie B of Soul II Soul reflects a mix of
original cultures shaken but not stirred in the traditions of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The British cutting edge is layered with artists such as Steve
McQueen, the black Turner Prize winner whose haunting film The Bear
has received praise at the new Tate Modern museum.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   These changes have not come comfortably to all Britons.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving, the historical writer and accused Holocaust
denier, earlier this year said he spoke for many of his countrymen
when he expressed longing for the days when Britain was more
British.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go to Heathrow airport, take a 747 and fly back
10 hours later to find England as it used to be,'' he said during
his libel trial against Emory University professor Deborah
Lipstadt. ``I can't say I applaud uncontrolled colored immigration.
I regret the passing of old England.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has found political capital in attacking
what it describes as a flood of immigrants from Asia and Africa,
with the implied threat to British culture and institutions if the
torrent isn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has responded by
tightening immigration rules. It has become so difficult to enter
Britain that a thriving black market has emerged in trafficking
immigrants. Last month, 58 Chinese immigrants were found dead in
the back of a vegetable truck where they suffocated while being
smuggled into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   For all the worries about immigrants, Britain remains very white
_ 94.6 percent white, according to government statistics. Away from
London and other large cities such as Birmingham and Manchester,
non-whites are rare. About half of all the non-whites in Britain
live in London.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, blacks _ mostly from the Caribbean _ constitute 1.6
percent of the population. Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis _
generally lumped together and called Asians _ constitute about 2.7
percent. The balance includes Chinese and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the minority population is much younger than the
white population, the government estimates that in 20 years, the
percentage of non-whites in British society will double.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the predictable tensions over change, blacks and Indians
often say they believe for the most part they have been accepted _
if not embraced _ by whites.
</P>
<P>
   When Rasshied Din started in business a few years ago, he was
warned not to use his own name because the English would think he
was a ``second-hand sari salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Din Associates is now the seventh-largest design consulting firm
in the country with a client list that features retail and fashion
heavyweights such as Tommy Hilfiger and Selfridges.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1980s, Din was a pioneer. ``People would call
up and say, 'Oh, you speak English,' as if they were surprised,''
he said. ``It seems strange looking back, but you have to remember
that this was before there were any prominent Asians in business or
in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the changes, race doesn't occupy the august station in
British society or politics that it holds in the United States. For
many Londoners, it is a topic like sex and religion, best not
discussed over the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. A strong minority vote was essential to
Ken Livingstone's election in May to become London's first elected
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone now represents the largest base of constituents in
the country, potentially elevating the agenda of London minorities
to national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hall, a respected black intellectual, believes Britain is
becoming more like the United States in its racial dynamics _ if
perhaps in a gentler, more civil fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Britain going to accept its diversity and become more
humane? We don't yet know,'' he said. ``Yes, things are better in
some ways, but a lot of people feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's no going back in the fundamental change in the
nature of London, making the city a unique and fascinating
experience, said Trevor Philips, a black politician and social
critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hum of London's streets cannot be replicated,'' Philips
wrote recently. ``It's the sound of a hundred cultures softly
clashing, sometimes melding, occasionally grating uncomfortably.''

 &HT;    CHINESE PROVINCE CRACKS DOWN ON CHEATING HUSBANDS, AND THEIR
CONCUBINES

<P>
   BEIJING _ In the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, just
over the border from high-flying Hong Kong, there's a saying: If a
man doesn't keep a concubine, he's not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are a lot of successful men in Guangdong. So
successful, in fact, some men have acquired not only a second
``wife,'' they have even a third or a fourth. It's called bao ernai
in Chinese, or taking a second wife. And like the concubines of
traditional China, she gets money, gifts and usually even a house
to live in from her married lover. She often even bears him
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Guangdong, the bao ernai phenomenon has reached the point
where we can no longer ignore it,'' Cui Shuhui, an official of the
state-run All-China Women's Federation recently told the Yangcheng
Evening News, a Guangdong newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so serious, local law enforcement could
no longer wait for China's outdated divorce laws to catch up. So
last month, four provincial law-enforcement and judicial agencies
jointly issued a legal ``opinion'' _ which they claim has the
weight of law _ that makes it easier for women to divorce husbands
who bao ernai.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion entitles the wife to half of everything her husband
has bought for his mistress, even if the item, such as a house, car
or stocks, is in the other woman's name. If the wife has no hard
evidence that her husband has been cheating, the opinion allows
police to help her obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   Local women's groups that had been demanding something be done
to protect the financial interests of wives are over-joyed. Since
the legal opinion was announced, the phones at local offices of the
All-China Women's Federation, which operates at all levels of
government, have been ringing off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangcheng Evening News called the opinion a ``huge bomb.''
One reporter wrote that in two days of interviewing women, the
phrase he heard most often was: ``I was so excited I couldn't sleep
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guangdong opinion comes just as the communist National
People's Congress, China's legislature, is in the midst of debating
a badly-needed revision of the marriage law. Chinese society has
seen huge changes since the law was last updated in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce rates have more than tripled; domestic violence has
increased; and marriages now are based more on individuals'
feelings rather than the old standard of political or familial
ties. The current law gives few guidelines on how to handle issues
such as support payments, splitting assets and custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to amend the law comes at a time when Chinese
society is increasingly troubled by such social problems as
proliferating concubinage and worsening family violence,'' said
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce rate was just 3 percent in 1980 but has climbed to
13 percent. In large cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, it is
well over 25 percent. A 1998 survey in Shanghai found that 36
percent of divorces were due to incompatibility and 22 percent to
extramarital affairs, according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Lu Ying, who teaches marriage and family law at Zhongshan
University in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, said
women often lose out in divorce because the husband can easily hide
his assets from the court. Moreover, housing for many people is
still provided by the employer, usually the husband's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many divorce cases, the woman would be left with nothing,''
said Lu. ``No husband, no child, no house.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While many of the men with modern-day concubines are from Hong
Kong and Taiwan, plenty of mainland men are indulging as well. The
Communist Party views the issue as not only a matter of morality
but a problem that could threaten social stability, one of its
paramount concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just foreign businessmen who are taking second
wives,'' said Hu Kanghsang, an official of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee who is working on the marriage law
revision. ``It also includes domestic factory heads, executives,
private businessmen, even party cadres. This phenomenon seriously
goes against socialist morality and customs . . . and seriously
impacts social stability and family planning.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although concubines are most common in Guangdong, they exist in
other prosperous regions also. In Shanghai it's called ``keeping a
golden canary,'' that is, a lovely, frail creature who lives in a
cage and comes out only when you take it out. In Beijing, she's
called a ``little honey.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a status symbol,'' said Liu Donghua, a lawyer at the
Center for Women's Law Studies &AMP; Legal Services of Beijing
University. ``Men think, 'Everyone else is doing it,' so they just
copy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of cases at the non-profit law center are
for divorce. Of those, almost one-fifth involve extra-marital
relations. To be sure, cases of adulterous women are numerous also
but are vastly outnumbered by philandering husbands. Some men even
bring their mistresses home, Liu said, forcing wife and concubine
to live under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Guangdong opinion doesn't go far enough. Liu, for
example, believes that not only should the husband be made to pay
compensation, so should the other woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third party has to take responsibility for destroying a
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other legal experts in China believe that would be allowing the
law to go too far into the moral realm. Even allowing police to
help gather evidence of adultery, as the Guangdong opinion does,
opens personal lives up to dangerous abuses of police power, says
sociologist Li Yinhe, a researcher at the state-run Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes have been dividing feminists since a revision of
the marriage law was first proposed in 1995. Passage this year is
unlikely, experts say.

   LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   Four miles from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster,
Brixton is a riot of noise and color.
</P>
<P>
   It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae rhythms dancing
from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD stores and
appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market, you hear
the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish _

lengths and lavish musical interludes, entered the United Kingdom's
top 10 list this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mambo Sharman, one of the Bollywood awards organizers, said he
was amazed at this trend. ``Often I go past a cinema in London and
look at the queues for Bollywood films and there are as many white
faces as Indians,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It makes me
feel guilty for not going as often as I should myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Tussaud's, the venerable British waxworks museum, soon
will add its first ever Bollywood display. And Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the superstar British musical machine with a keen sense of the
popular, is preparing to stage Bombay Dreams, a new musical set in
Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an exaggeration to say non-whites now dominate the
London entertainment scene, the ethnic variety is nevertheless
remarkable. A number of black and Asian comedians _ notably Nina
Wadia and Meera Syal _ have become household names.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Britons are plugged in to Fun-Da-Mental, a
multiracial group that plays a fusion of Persian jazz, rap and
hip-hop. The music produced by these hip, young musicians as well
as the established Jazzie B of Soul II Soul reflects a mix of
original cultures shaken but not stirred in the traditions of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The British cutting edge is layered with artists such as Steve
McQueen, the black Turner Prize winner whose haunting film The Bear
has received praise at the new Tate Modern museum.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   These changes have not come comfortably to all Britons.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving, the historical writer and accused Holocaust
denier, earlier this year said he spoke for many of his countrymen
when he expressed longing for the days when Britain was more
British.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go to Heathrow airport, take a 747 and fly back
10 hours later to find England as it used to be,'' he said during
his libel trial against Emory University professor Deborah
Lipstadt. ``I can't say I applaud uncontrolled colored immigration.
I regret the passing of old England.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has found political capital in attacking
what it describes as a flood of immigrants from Asia and Africa,
with the implied threat to British culture and institutions if the
torrent isn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has responded by
tightening immigration rules. It has become so difficult to enter
Britain that a thriving black market has emerged in trafficking
immigrants. Last month, 58 Chinese immigrants were found dead in
the back of a vegetable truck where they suffocated while being
smuggled into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   For all the worries about immigrants, Britain remains very white
_ 94.6 percent white, according to government statistics. Away from
London and other large cities such as Birmingham and Manchester,
non-whites are rare. About half of all the non-whites in Britain
live in London.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, blacks _ mostly from the Caribbean _ constitute 1.6
percent of the population. Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis _
generally lumped together and called Asians _ constitute about 2.7
percent. The balance includes Chinese and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the minority population is much younger than the
white population, the government estimates that in 20 years, the
percentage of non-whites in British society will double.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the predictable tensions over change, blacks and Indians
often say they believe for the most part they have been accepted _
if not embraced _ by whites.
</P>
<P>
   When Rasshied Din started in business a few years ago, he was
warned not to use his own name because the English would think he
was a ``second-hand sari salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Din Associates is now the seventh-largest design consulting firm
in the country with a client list that features retail and fashion
heavyweights such as Tommy Hilfiger and Selfridges.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1980s, Din was a pioneer. ``People would call
up and say, 'Oh, you speak English,' as if they were surprised,''
he said. ``It seems strange looking back, but you have to remember
that this was before there were any prominent Asians in business or
in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the changes, race doesn't occupy the august station in
British society or politics that it holds in the United States. For
many Londoners, it is a topic like sex and religion, best not
discussed over the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. A strong minority vote was essential to
Ken Livingstone's election in May to become London's first elected
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone now represents the largest base of constituents in
the country, potentially elevating the agenda of London minorities
to national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hall, a respected black intellectual, believes Britain is
becoming more like the United States in its racial dynamics _ if
perhaps in a gentler, more civil fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Britain going to accept its diversity and become more
humane? We don't yet know,'' he said. ``Yes, things are better in
some ways, but a lot of people feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's no going back in the fundamental change in the
nature of London, making the city a unique and fascinating
experience, said Trevor Philips, a black politician and social
critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hum of London's streets cannot be replicated,'' Philips
wrote recently. ``It's the sound of a hundred cultures softly
clashing, sometimes melding, occasionally grating uncomfortably.''

 &HT;    I still hear those waves crashing in Galveston
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ My first impression of Galveston was
literally a blur. I was 14 years old and there on a Scout trip.
Being terribly nearsighted and full of teen-age stupidity, I wore
my glasses into the surf so I would be able to see if I was about
to be bit by a jellyfish, or worse, a shark.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I wore black plastic-frame glasses that weren't in
style and which I terribly resented, my mother having made the
selection even though everyone knew wire-rims were the rage in
1969. Now, thick plastic frames are hip and wire-rims are passe, so
of course I still wear wire rims.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe losing my glasses was a Freudian slip, an unconscious
desire to rid myself of nerdiness. I was already three strikes
behind in the Pine Curtain, since:
</P>
<P>
   I was a Yankee still unable to lose the French-Canadian accent
of my forebears. I managed to accomplish this with great practice
by the next year and now draw quizzical glances from people when I
tell them I was born and raised in New Hampshire and lived there
until nearly 13. I have adapted. I can say ``as all-get-out'' like
a native.
</P>
<P>
   I was the shortest kid in Foster Junior High in Longview. That
may not be true, but it was my perception. Up in Live Free or Die
country, there are plenty of short Arcadians, so I didn't stick
out. Down here, I felt as if I had been transported into the land
of giants. It didn't take long for me to abandon all hope of
playing football or basketball, opting for baseball, swim team and
tennis, none of which I excelled at.
</P>
<P>
   I was a Catholic. In 1969, in Longview, being a Catholic was as
common as being, well, a Baptist in New Hampshire. The
Congregationalists were as exotic as denominations got in the
Granite State, and every little town had a parochial school, even
my hometown of Allenstown, which had at most 1,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, with all this social pressure bearing down upon my
enraged teen hormones, is it any wonder I lost my glasses not 30
minutes after hitting the beach? Galveston was a romantic blur
whose focus has become sharper on return trips, but it's a town
that still appeals to me mightily. (This was well before one could
get eyeglasses grinded and delivered in an hour.) For us
red-landers, Galveston is a required summer vacation because it's
close, inexpensive, and the people and ambiance aren't much
different from what we're used to here. It's East Texas with sand
and salt water.
</P>
<P>
   There are better beaches in Texas, with blue water and sparkling
sand. South Padre, for example, and Corpus Christi. Galveston has
brown water, which we're used to here in East Texas, an
over-abundance of seaweed, and far too many trashy tourists who
leave their litter scattered along the shore. As I said, it bears a
similarity to home.
</P>
<P>
   There are coastal towns with more quaintness to them, such as
Port Aransas and High Island. But Galveston has a funkiness that's
hard to beat, with great food, cheap condos, the best micro-brewery
and hamburger joint in the state _ the Strand Brewery and Grill _
and one of the finest avenues in Texas _ Broadway _ with its
majestic homes, statues and palm trees. Plus, it's home to the
state's oldest existing newspaper _ still one of the best papers of
its size in Texas. There's no lack of news in Galveston given its
diverse population.
</P>
<P>
   Our standard stops:
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp 'N' Stuff, on Avenue O at about 39th street. Located in a
modest neighborhood in an ugly green building with asbestos siding,
the best fried shrimp in the city can be found here. This is the
place the locals are rumored to favor, though I can't confirm that.
All I know is that five fat shrimp with the trimmings cost about
$7. Five's plenty unless you're starving.
</P>
<P>
   The Strand, the restored historic town center. My favorite
attraction is the giant chessboard outside the brewery. I watched
two teen-agers play a game, moving pieces as tall as them, walking
among the bishops and knights to ponder their next move. 3-D chess.
There's hope in the world if kids still play chess instead of Doom.
</P>
<P>
   Mario's, a pizza place on Seawall Boulevard that plays oldies
music though most the cooks barely speak English. I always expect
``Godfather''-type music. Go figure. By the last day of vacation,
seafood has lost its luster, and it's time for some grease and
cheese. Mario's delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Beach. It's crowded, the beach is strewn with the litter
of cretins, but you can get a decent hot dog and a shower, and the
people-watching can't be beat. Thankfully, alcohol is prohibited,
since many of your fellow tourists don't need additional stimulants
or depressants.
</P>
<P>
   There's a standing dream among us red-landers about moving to
Galveston upon retirement, and I always say, but where would you go
on vacation? Well, East Texas, of course. You could get away from
that annoying sand and salt-water breeze and still be somewhere the
rent's cheap, and the locals talk your language. Y'all come on up.

 &HT;    Comptrollers play politics with budget
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Wait. You actually think the Texas comptroller _
a partisan elected official _ would trot out revenue statistics
with an eye to politics? Next you'll say Santa Claus is my mom and
dad.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not to suggest the recent revenue estimate by Republican
Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander isn't accurate. But suffice it
to say that Rylander and her Democratic predecessors know how to
use the revenue estimate as a political tool.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop:
</P>
<P>
   Legislative budget officials recently estimated that the cost to
run Texas government for the two years ending Aug. 31, 2001, will
be $610 million more than the Legislature budgeted last year.
</P>
<P>
   The political problem is that Gov. George W. Bush, who is the
GOP nominee for president, pressed for and got a $1.7 billion tax
cut last year when the Legislature was writing the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore, says this is
proof that Bush's plans to have a huge national tax cut if elected
could spend away a projected surplus that might then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   So up steps Republican Rylander, with an early estimate of a
minimum of a $1.1 billion budget surplus for the biennium. That's
more than enough to cover the $610 million projected budget
overrun.
</P>
<P>
   With a straight face, Rylander said the unscheduled revenue
estimate wasn't to help Bush's presidential hopes, but because she
was nervous Gore's ``misleading and incorrect'' charge that Texas
had a budget shortfall could hurt the state's financial standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the state of Texas to have the best possible bond
ratings, therefore the lowest interest rates, and therefore saving
Texans millions of dollars,'' Rylander said. ``There is no deficit
in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   That $1.1 billion is a ``conservative'' estimate, Rylander said.
Numbers were being crunched for a more specific figure she unveiled
at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So, is it politics? Or is it economics? Or both?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it gives Rylander a chance to help the governor's
presidential race. Also obviously, it gives Rylander _ who some
think has ambitions beyond the comptroller's office _ opportunities
to get her name in the paper and her face on television.
</P>
<P>
   But this ain't strange. The comptroller's using the
revenue-estimating power as a tool for a variety of purposes is
about as regular as the moon influencing the tides.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, almost to the day, then-Comptroller John Sharp _
a Democrat who was running for lieutenant governor _ disclosed in
an early revenue estimate a projected surplus of $3.7 billion for
the current biennium. Coincidentally, Sharp also dropped a few
hints on how the surplus might be spent, including a teacher pay
raise and a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller was given the power to estimate the state's
projected revenue to keep the Legislature from overspending. Under
the state's balanced-budget approach, the Legislature's budget in
its regular legislative session is limited to what the comptroller
estimates will come in.
</P>
<P>
   Comptrollers usually are conservative at the start of the
budgeting cycle _ partly because if they have to change the
estimate later, they'd rather raise it than lower it. But certainly
the past three comptrollers _ Rylander, Sharp and the late Democrat
Bob Bullock _ also kept back a little swag for bargaining leverage
late in the legislative session. And for a chance to be Santa
Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always held back about $400 million,'' said a former
Bullock aide, for ``trade bait'' for computers, extra auditors,
even000 Cox News Service

<P>
   SOMEWHERE IN THE WEST _ ``But it was a blue spruce.''
</P>
<P>
   This was my wife, pining to no one in particular. I was
listening but my ear was of no comfort to her.
</P>
<P>
   We'd just driven by a gorgeous stand of mountain evergreens. Her
entreaty to the back-seat boys to observe it in wonder had met
towering indifference.
</P>
<P>
   As had ``look _ Pike's Peak.'' As had ``look at Denver's
skyline.'' If the advisories were met with looks at all, that was a
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout our trip, only rare appeals succeeded in drawing
attention: ``Look, a volcanic cone'' (our middle-schooler looked,
apparently thinking he'd see lava spewing); ``Look, Britney
Spears.'' (He didn't appreciate being tricked.)

<P>
   Ah, for the days when Mom and Dad were merry tour guides and two
young passengers clung to our every word.

Watson had in mind when she got involved in the painfully unfunny

such sober social dramas as Angela's Ashes and Cradle Will Rock,
you'd yearn to break out into a brazenly comic role too. And it
sort of made sense for her to place her trust in director Alan
Rudolph, the resolutely offbeat filmmaker who has given
affectionate showcases to actresses from Geraldine Chaplin
(Remem-ber My Name) to Genevieve Bujold (Choose Me) to Julie
Christie (Afterglow). (Erstein, Palm Beach Post). 35.

   COXNET WHEELS 0718 -- Although the 2000 Isuzu Rodeo is a quite
civilized sport-utility vehicle, it will issue reminders that Isuzu
is a truck manufacturer and not a carmaker. The ride is noticeably
trucklike, and not even Isuzu's Intelligenthad its share of hits
(Reeling in the Years, Do it Again, Peg, Rikki Don't Lose That
Number), this wasn't exactly music for the masses. (Passy, Palm

has practically built a career on it. So why shouldn't Robert
Zemeckis take a crack at making a thriller in the style of Alfred
Hitchcock? No one understood the psychology and mechanics of
suspense quite like Hitchcock, yet for much of What Lies Beneath _
a creepy little yarn of guilt, gullibility and ghosts _ the
Oscar-winning director of Forrest Gump concocts a reasonable
facsimile of the British master's. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post).

<P>
   REVIEW-LOSER _ Either Billy Wilder is going to be very flattered
by the new teen romantic comedy Loser or he is going to have great
grounds for a plagiarism suit. Writer-director Amy Heckerling has

Watson had in mind when she got involved in the painfully unfunny
``screwball film noir,'' Trixie. After stunning performances in
such sober social dramas as Angela's Ashes and Cradle Will Rock,
you'd yearn to break out into a brazenly comic role too. And it
sort of made sense for her to place her trust in director Alan
Rudolph, the resolutely offbeat filmmaker who has given
affectionate showcases to actresses from Geraldine Chaplin

Christie (Afterglow). (Erstein, Palm Beach Post). 35.

 &HT;    Electric cars aren't complete answer to cutting smog
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Recently I repeated a study that said consumers would
demand that a battery-powered electric vehicle be approximately
$28,000 less expensive than a comparable internal-combustion
vehicle before they would agree to own it. The survey was
sponsored, among others, by Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers questater.
</P>
<P>
   When I drove GM's EVI, I was in constant fear of running out of
juice, and no charging facilities were available anywhere that I
needed to go. Yes, the vehicle had good power, but if I stepped
down hard on the throttle, the needle indicated that I had used up
almost 50 percent of its stored energy. Until battery technology
greatly improves, I can't see mainstream drivers adapting to
totally electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, research and development costs for alternative-fuel
vehicles are expensive for auto manufacturers. Those costs are
showing up on the bottom line consumers pay for their other
vehicles. It costs Toyota and Honda a lot more than the
$20,000-plus each they are charging to actually produce their
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take this the wrong way. Electric and hybrid vehicles can
go a long way toward cleaning up the air. I spent three wonderful
weeks in the clean air of Iowa, South Dakota and Minnesota. But I
wonder if electricity is the only answer.
</P>
<P>
   How would we produce the power? Power companies also are being
blamed for contributing to air pollution problems, so how can they
meet the demand without producing additional pollution? Nuclear
power has its own problems, and coal or natural gas are limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The only plentiful alternative fuel is corn-based ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be ironic if after all the years that ``revenooers''
spent chasing North Georgians who were transporting a different
kind of corn alcohol that the government would mandate the use of
corn-based fuel?

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Recently I repeated a study that said consumers would
demand that a battery-powered electric vehicle be approximately
$28,000 less expensive than a comparable internal-combustion
vehicle before they would agree to own it. The survey was
sponsored, among others, by Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers questioned the findings, but I don't.
</P>
<P>
   One look at general sales trends of American auto buyers will
tell you that totally electric vehicles are facing a steep uphill
climb.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mercedes-Benz, which is having a record sales year,
sells more M-Series sport-utility vehicles in this country than any
other of its models. General Motors says it expects the luxury
sport-utility market will maintain its momentum and grow an
additional 13 percent, all in spite of higher gas prices. In the
meantime, GM has virtually stopped making and leasing the only
mass-produced all-electric car, the EV1.
</P>
<P>
   The only reasonable alternative is the hybrid. Hybrids combine
gasoline and electric motors, resulting in mileage figures of more
than 60 miles per gallon. Only two are available, or will be soon,
the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius is on the way, and it's selling like crazy in Japan.
Honda recently announced it will greatly increase the limited
number of Insights it sends to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent test drive, I found the Prius to be totally
``transparent'' with no discernible characteristics different from
a conventionally powered vehicle. And it had room for four people.
The Insight is a two-seater.
</P>
<P>
   When I drove GM's EVI, I was in constant fear of running out of
juice, and no charging facilities were available anywhere that I
needed to go. Yes, the vehicle had good power, but if I stepped
down hard on the throttle, the needle indicated that I had used up
almost 50 percent of its stored energy. Until battery technology
greatly improves, I can't see mainstream drivers adapting to

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ GALVESTON, Texas _ My first impression of
Galveston was literally a blur. I was 14 years old and there on a
Scout trip. Being terribly nearsighted and full of teen-age
stupidity, I wore my glasses into the surf so I would be able to
see if I was about to be bit by a jellyfish, or worse, a shark.

recent revenue estimate by Republican Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander isn't accurate. But suffice it to say that Rylander and

 &HT;    Lantana is an annual or tender perennial in colder climates
 &HT;    By Diana Blowers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - The first time Lisa Johnson of Riverside saw
lantana, she nicknamed it the Fruit Loop plant ``because it had all
of the colors, and it smelled kind of fruity.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has had her multicolored lantana for about four years
and grows it as a perennial, although most experts consider the
plant, which also comes in solid colors, to be a tender perennial
best treated as an annual in our area.
</P>
<P>
   L. camara produces inch-wide clusters of small flowers with
contrasting eyes on upright, stiff stems in solid yellow, orange,
pink or white, as well as the multicolored variety that Johnson
grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a gorgeous plant. It has nice deep-green leaves
and beautiful blooms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many gardeners love lantana's fragrance, others find
the smell offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In temperate climates, lantana is a popular deciduous shrub
growing to 3 to 4 feet tall. In tropical areas it can be invasive.
In colder climates, when grown as an annual, it is more likely to
grow to a height of 12 to 18 inches. Johnson also grows it as a
houseplant.
</P>
<P>
   Lantana grows wild in the tropics. It originated in Jamaica.
Several cultivars have been developed in recent years with various
colors of flowers. `New Gold' is a popular prolific bloomer with
golden-yellow flowers. `Dwarf Pink' has bright-pink blooms, and
`Irene' has deep-red blossoms. The blooms of `Radiation' blooms are
multicolored but mostly orange-red, and `Samantha' has cream and
yellow flowers with green-and-yellow foliage.
</P>
<P>
   The trailing lantana, L. montevidensis, has small clusters of
rosy lilac blooms with yellow centers. The trailing variety, which
also comes in white, has limber, cascading stems.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Midwest Gardener's Handbook,'' author Jan Riggenbach
recommends the `Patriot' series, which includes both mounding and
vining forms and comes in several color combinations of orange,

   Riggenbach recommends keeping lantana for several years by
digging it up in the fall, trimming back the roots and top to the
desired size and planting it in a pot, which should be placed in a
sunny window.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Time Life Plant Encyclopedia's'' Web site at
www.vg.com, lantana does best if it gets at least four hours of
direct sunlight and the soil is allowed to dry slightly between
waterings.

&HT;     ENVIRONMENTALISTS LAUNCH BIOTECH FOOD FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Environmentalists are grabbing Kellogg's Tony
the Tiger by the tail and scolding the Campbell's soup kids in a
new wave of activism against the spread of genetically modified
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Seven environmental and consumer groups are leading a campaign
to pressure the two food giants to remove altered ingredients from
their products sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a Safeway grocery in San Francisco on Wednesday, at one
of 22 simultaneous news conferences and protests around the
country, the groups accused the companies of having a double
standard because they make food lines with biotech crops in the
United States, but not in many European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters dressed like Monarch butterflies, a species
apparently harmed in lab tests on modified corn, carried signs
calling for new regulation on the biotech food industry by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Pesticide Action Network, Friends of the Earth, State Public
Interest Research Groups, Organic Consumers Association, National
Environmental Trust, Center for Food Safety and Institute for
Agriculture and Trade Policy want safety testing and labeling
before the foods go to market.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the FDA doesn't require any extra tests on the
altered products than it would require on traditional foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see the food and biotechnology industries
heed the desires of American consumers,'' said Skip Spitzer, a
researcher at Pesticide Action Network in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers would like to know whether the foods they're eating
contain genetically engineered ingredients. Furthermore, most
consumers would like to know so they can avoid eating genetically
engineered ingredients,'' Spitzer said, citing polls conducted over
the past years.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ervin, a spokeswoman for Kellogg Co. in Battle Creek,
Mich., said the criticisms are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic position has always been that this is one of the
safest food supplies in the world, and that Kellogg would never do
anything to jeopardize its 96-year reputation for making
nutritious, healthful and safe foods,'' Ervin said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Campbell's in Camden, N.J., did not respond
to calls. In June, the Campbell's consumer affairs department
spokeswoman, Marilyn DeCiuceis, responded to a query about the
company's use of the products in the following way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Campbell's use of genetically modified ingredients is small,
restricted primarily to part of its supply of products derived from
corn and soybeans. Much of the current global supply of corn and
soybeans includes a mix of genetically and non-genetically modified
crops.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCiuceis said the ``genetically modified crops are tested
thoroughly for safety and many, such as soybeans and corn, have
been safely used around the world for more than a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Foes of biotech foods say altering the genetic structure can
produce unanticipated allergens or toxins. They also warn that
crops growing in the fields possibly can harm wild species by
poisoning insects and animals as well as changing the genetic
makeup of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the technology say government regulators ensure
that these problems would not occur, and that years of scientific
knowledge have verified it. In April, a panel for the National
Academy of Sciences did not find environmental or health concerns
over the technology, they say.

</P>
<P>
   Simon Harris, an organizer for the Organic Consumers Association
based in Little Marais, Minn., called the new grass-roots campaign
to target individual companies a turning point in the movement
against genetically engineered foods in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, opposition has been simmering only in the United
States, but it is at the forefront of public debate in Europe,
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous public pressure in Europe is bringing a de facto ban on
foods made with crops changed in the lab _ most commonly corn,
soybeans, canola, cotton and potatoes, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the large food companies that sell genetically
engineered foods in the U.S. don't do it in Europe,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   In a list compiled by Greenpeace, the following companies are
some that are beginning to get rid of engineered crops in Europe
but not in the United States: Kellogg's, Burger King, Dannon,
Kraft, Nabisco, McDonald's, Nestle, PepsiCo, Procter &AMP; Gamble,
Pillsbury, Quaker and Bird's Eye.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has been endorsed by 250 groups and individuals,
including the Sierra Club, Pesticide Watch, Global Exchange,
national Catholic Rural Life Conference, Food First and the
Children's Health and Environmental Coalition.

&HT;     PRICE SPIKE WORRIES TEQUILA DRINKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DARYL BELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The taste of tequila is distinctive, and its
effects range from soothing to bewitching.
</P>
<P>
   But what tequila drinkers are discovering is that its once
relatively moderate price has been shooting up. In San Antonio,
where tequila shots and margaritas are the preferred libation of
many bar hoppers and social drinkers, the price increase could
force some to make attitude adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tequila is great,'' said Richard Hattaway, a tourist from
Dallas. ``Drinking it is part of the flavor of being in San
Antonio. It's not the same without it. But if the price goes a
little too high, it may force me to change my drink.''
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of blue agave, the plant from which tequila is made,
is causing the price increase.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a fungus destroyed many agave plants but demand
continued to rise. As a result, prices began climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council, which governs the industry,
watched proudly as the drink's popularity soared in the past
decade. Mexican production doubled with half of that being exported
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got word about prices going up a few months ago,'' said Ron
Moore, manager of Blanco Liquors in San Antonio. ``My distributors
told me what was happening but there's not much I can do about it.
It's sort of like gas, what are you going to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone up, in some cases, about $3 or $4 a bottle. It may
be going up higher. I believe people are going to still get it
because they love their margaritas and they like their tequila.''
</P>
<P>
   Tequila, a distilled liquor, contains 40 percent to 50 percent
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   A similar distilled liquor, mescal, also is derived from the
agave plant. It is less expensive and its taste is stronger than
tequila.
</P>
<P>
   Tequila was named after a small town of that name in the Mexican
state of Jalisco. Some say the word tequila comes from the Mexican
Indian word for ``lava hill'' or ``from the volcano.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of years ago, the Aztecs began producing a drink known
as pulque, which was taken from the blue agave plant. The beverage
was fermented by sugars taken from the plant that grows only in
soils rich in volcanic ash.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century, the Spaniards arrived and introduced
distilling. That eventually led to the creation of tequila as it is
known today.
</P>
<P>
   Tequila has an effect on people. In some cases, it has brought
individuals closer together. For example, Homer and Elva Garcia are
devout tequila drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been together for 29 years,'' Homer said. ``We both like
tequila. I think without it, it would seem like 108 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the novice tequila drinker quickly becomes enamored
with its lasting taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking around and felt like having a margarita,'' said
Lori Genk, a resident of Tampa, Fla., visiting San Antonio on
business. ``I've had one before so I know what it tastes like, and
it does taste good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the price of tequila going up is really going to
have an effect on me. I'm either going to buy it or not. If it's
something I really want, I'm going to buy it.''

&HT;     FRUIT BLAST MAKES A SMOOTH TREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's not the fruit that makes a smoothie, it's
the milk. Or the yogurt. Or the ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Smoothies, by definition, are fruit blended with dairy products
to make a thick beverage, says Sharon Tyler Herbst in the ``Food
Lover's Companion.'' Fruit and juice mixed with ice is a slushy,
not a smoothie. Slushies are grainy and smoothies are, well,
smooth. Smoothies have the texture of a milkshake.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell something is more than just a passing fad when you
see stores devoted to the product in big shopping malls where the
real estate is expensive. Using that criteria, smoothies have gone
from a fad to a certified rage in recent years. But you don't have
to go to the mall to get a good smoothie. You can make them at home
fairly easily.
</P>
<P>
   There are two essential parts to every smoothie recipe:
</P>
<P>
   A base of milk, yogurt or ice cream: For smoothies with fewer
calories use skim milk, to make the smoothie thick, freeze the milk
in ice cube trays. For rich, decadent smoothies use ice cream. For
smoothies that are in between, use yogurt. Plain yogurt works fine
but to intensify the flavor of the smoothie, use a flavored yogurt
that will complement the fruit. For example, use strawberry or
banana yogurt in a strawberry smoothie.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit: Any combination of fresh, canned or frozen fruit can
be used. To make thick smoothies, freeze the fruit before blending.
To keep things easy, we cut our fruit into chunks and placed it in
a single layer in baking pans and froze. After making the
smoothies, any leftover fruit can be stored in freezer bags and
used as needed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the essentials, smoothies may contain flavorings
such as vanilla extract, nutmeg, cinnamon and fruit-flavored
liqueurs. If you want to make your smoothie a meal, add protein
sources such as powdered milk, peanut butter or instant breakfast
mix, suggests the American Dairy Association and the Dairy Council
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As far as mixing the smoothies is concerned, the process is
simple: Put all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and
hit the button. Start with chilled ingredients and pour the
finished drink into chilled glasses to keep the smoothie cold
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a straw.

 &HT;    
 By JESSICA KERWIN 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Too`busy to mcke it to that $1,000-c-plate dinner, mail in a
donation or participate in!an all-day walk-a-thon?
 &HT;   $Now there's an easidr way tn save the world: by rhtting at home
ald shoppine. In a rare convergence of corporate marketing and the
common gond$ a handful of new for-profit Web sites are leading
online shoppers to top Internet retaaling sites, such as
amazon.com, cdnow.com ant beautyjungle.com, then donating a portion
of each shopper's bill to a favorite charity.
 &HT;    Shoe fanatmcs will be happy to note that greatergood.com offers
a link to the Neiman Marcus site (among almost 100 e-commerce
sites),(which means that there are two ways to buy Manolo Blahniks
without feeling guilty. One involves satting in The store's shoe
depart)ent with your eyes shut while you sigj the credit-card slip;
the other is to use greatergood.com's link to sjap up a pair of
beaded mules for $545, of which a percentage (the"site doesn't say
exactly how much) goes directly to a charkty you srecify. The
donation isn't"tax deductible, but the karmic benefits alone make
it well worthwhile.
 &HT;    Likewise, once you've regisuered with iGive*com, ordering a new
Palm TII through iGo.com cnuld sejd $37.43, or 7.5 percent of the
rale, to Habatat for Humanity. The pocsibilities are endless: Stock
up on Bliss produbts by linkinf to hbeauty.com, buy the new Elliot &HT; 
Smith album at cdnow.com or jid on a vintage Pauline Trigere coat
at sothebys.amazon.com _ all in the name of philanthropy _ while
the retailer and the umbrenla site ibsorb the cost of"your
donation. For them, it's all about marketing.
 &HT;  ( ``We'rg an extremely effective way of faining customers for &HT; 
ratailers,'' says Robert Grosshandler, president and founder of
iGive.com. ``Al iGive customer tends to buy more often and buy
more, so they hike sending us money.''
 &HT;    And it's not only the online marketeers getting in on the act.
Nonprofit organizations are quickly$catching on and have begun vo
use the Web themselves is a fund-raising tool.
 &HT;   (Mosu major charities, including Doctors Witjout Borders
(dwb.org), Unicef (unicefusa.org) and the World Wildlife Foundation
(panda.org) have developed their own Web sites and accept online
credit-card tax-deductible donations directly.
 &HT;    Others, such as the National Audubon Society (audubon.org) and
Amnesty International (amnestyusa.org), have taken their
letter-writing campaigns digital. At redcross.org, you can even
download a stock-donation form to submit to your broker, while
helping.org offers lists of volunteer opportunities by zip code.
 &HT;    ``A lot of nonprofits are starting to take advantage of the ease
with which you can do auctions online as well,'' says Andrew
McInnes, director of special projects for amfAR (amfar.org). AmfAR
has used the method by auctioning the chance to attend its
star-studded Cinema Against AIDS benefit in Cannes on yahoo.com.
 &HT;    But to experience the power of Internet marketing at its most
beneficent, try making a contribution through thehungersite.org.
When you click a button, a pack of advertisements for the site's
sponsors pops up on your screen and 2 1/4 cups of rice are promised
to the United Nations World Food Program. Sort of like a
bike-a-thon, but easier.
 &HT;    Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin, founders of the Internet
venture-capital firm Venture Frogs in San Francisco and of
charityfrogs.com, have taken a similar approach, pledging $1 to the
American Red Cross for each visitor's click of the site's ``ribbit
button'' until the sum totals $1 million.
 &HT;    A generous offer, to be sure, and one that separates the Frogs
from the dot-coms that might invest in a Super Bowl Sunday ad spot
instead.
 &HT;    ``It raises awareness for the Red Cross in a way that writing a
check just wouldn't,'' Hsieh says. ``But it also raises awareness
for our own company.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 By THE EDITORS OF WWD, DNR AND W MAGAZINE 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From WWD, W magazine and DNR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 NEW WAVE  
 &HT;    ``It really brought out the baby in me,'' Mark Wahlberg
confessed.
 &HT;    Though the bright sunshine outside the premiere of ``The Perfect
Storm'' was a far cry from all those grueling days in the waves,
Wahlberg's expression hinted that the trauma wasn't entirely behind
him.
 &HT;    ``We tried to make it as real as possible _ which meant getting
your butt kicked,'' he explained. ``And I'm not as tough as I
thought I was.''
 &HT;    George Clooney volunteered to explain Wahlberg's hardships in
greater detail.
 &HT;    ``Well, the thing is that Mark throws up like a madman. It was
miserable.''
 &HT;    Diane Lane emerged with a water terror of her own.
 &HT;    ``The story invaded my subconscious,'' she said. ``A real
hurricane came to town, and I half expected a huge wave to break
into my room any minute.''
 &HT;    ``I'll never sail again,'' Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio insisted.
``I like to be on terra firma, preferably sitting in a restaurant _
indoors. I don't even like picnics.''
 &HT;    The following night, a crowd came out to toast the premiere of
``The Patriot,'' in which Mel Gibson portrays a reluctant
Revolutionary War hero.
 &HT;    ``Oh,'' Gibson sighed, ``he's just another freak in my little
gallery.''
 &HT;    
 LIFETIME TV FOR BAYOU  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Look out, Martha. Watch your back, B. Smith.
 &HT;    Los Angeles-based designer Bradley Bayou is staking out your
turf with a new how-to style program to air six times a week on
cable's Lifetime network in the fall.
 &HT;    Tentatively called ``Do It with Style,'' each 30-minute episode
will feature Bayou and other style mavens, such as chefs, florists
and interior designers, helping viewers to host parties, stage
weddings or cook romantic dinners.
 &HT;    But unlike Martha Stewart's over-the-top place settings and
extravagant meals, Bayou said his show, which he is also executive
producing, will be more realistic.
 &HT;    ``It's all done within the context of their budget and their
time frame,'' he said. ``We don't go in there, put on the event and
leave; they do it themselves. It's like Martha in reality.''
 &HT;    For the pilot, Bayou, a chef and an interior designer, helped
Mary Lou, a third-grade teacher and mother of three, to prepare a
romantic dinner for her and her husband with a budget of $100. At
the end of program, she had prepared a three-course meal, including
oysters on the half-shell, stuffed shrimp, and asparagus, with corn
bread and a dessert of strawberries dipped in chocolate.
 &HT;    The show premieres Oct. 16 with a 40-show commitment. Production
starts at the end of this month.
 &HT;    But don't expect Bayou to become a television star and forget
about designing his signature gowns, suits and eveningwear.
 &HT;    ``I ain't giving it up,'' he promised. ``I've worked too hard at
it.''
 &HT;    
 NEW A&AMP;F FAN  
 &HT;    These days, you never know where Rudy Giuliani will pop up. The
mayor himself is featured in a Q&AMP;A in the back-to-school edition of
the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch quarterly.
 &HT;    Donning an A&AMP;F baseball cap, Giuliani addresses several topics,
including how it wasn't just him, but his City Hall team, who
helped to make the city safer.
 &HT;    When asked what he'd do if he weren't mayor, Giuliani said,
``I've always wanted to manage the Yankees or perform at the
Metropolitan Opera, but since I'm trained as a lawyer, I guess I'd
do that.''
 &HT;    And if the Giuliani interview isn't enough, there's also one
with former mayor Ed Koch.
 &HT;    ``We almost had Hillary, but there was a scheduling problem,''
said Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co., the ad agency that created
the catalog, which is an homage to New York. The $6 edition went on
sale last week at A&AMP;F stores and was sent to subscribers. It tells
the story of two guys and a girl from Princeton University who
arrive in Manhattan and see all the sights _ but she leaves with a
different guy.
 &HT;    Overall, the catalog is fairly tame by A&AMP;F's standards, except
for a rear-end shot of a hunky guy with dollar bills coming out of
his thong, and a photo of a guy with his shorts pulled down,
frolicking in the lake in Central Park.
 &HT;    The catalog features Bruce Weber photos of such landmarks as
Grand Central Terminal, the Brooklyn Bridge, ``21'' Club, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, the Hudson
River, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lenox Lounge in Harlem. John Scott
shot Giuliani and Koch, among others.
 &HT;    The catalog also includes a fall film guide, a 24-hour jaunt
through the Big Apple and a guide to nighttime hot spots.
 &HT;    A&AMP;F ruffled some Tiger hairs by photographing a building at
Princeton University without permission.
 &HT;    ``We definitely didn't approve it,'' said Marilyn Marks, a
Princeton spokeswoman. ``We have a policy that Nassau Hall isn't
used in promotional photography. Our attorney has been in contact
with their attorney and we expect there will be a settlement.''
 &HT;    An Abercrombie spokeswoman in Columbus, Ohio, said the company
had no comment on its use of the image or a settlement.

 PLEASE NOTE: The word AT in parentheses has been used in the

 &HT;    
 By JESSICA KERWIN 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Too busy to make it to that $1,000-a-plate dinner, mail in a
donation or participate in an all-day walk-a-thon?
 &HT;    Now there's an easier way to save the world: by sitting at home
and shopping. In a rare convergence of corporate marketing and the
common good, a handful of new for-profit Web sites are leading
online shoppers to top Internet retailing sites, such as
amazon.com, cdnow.com and beautyjungle.com, then donating a portion
of each shopper's bill to a favorite charity.
 &HT;    Shoe fanatics will be happy to note that greatergood.com offers
a link to the Neiman Marcus site (among almost 100 e-commerce
sites), which means that there are two ways to buy Manolo Blahniks
without feeling guilty. One involves sitting in the store's shoe
department with your eyes shut while you sign the credit-card slip;
the other is to use greatergood.com's link to snap up a pair of
beaded mules for $545, of which a percentage (the site doesn't say
exactly how much) goes directly to a charity you specify. The
donation isn't tax deductible, but the karmic benefits alone make
it well worthwhile.
 &HT;    Likewise, once you've registered with iGive.com, ordering a new
Palm VII through iGo.com could send $37.43, or 7.5 percent of the
sale, to Habitat for Humanity. The possibilities are endless: Stock
up on Bliss products by linking to ibeauty.com, buy the new Elliot
Smith album at cdnow.com or bid on a vintage Pauline Trigere coat
at sothebys.amazon.com _ all in the name of philanthropy _ while
the retailer and the umbrella site absorb the cost of your
donation. For them, it's all about marketing.
 &HT;    ``We're an extremely effective way of gaining customers for
retailers,'' says Robert Grosshandler, president and founder of
iGive.com. ``An iGive customer tends to buy more often and buy
more, so they like sending us money.''
 &HT;    And it's not only the online marketeers getting in on the act.
Nonprofit organizations are quickly catching on and have begun to
use the Web themselves as a fund-raising tool.
 &HT;    Most major charities, including Doctors Without Borders
(dwb.org), Unicef (unicefusa.org) and the World Wildlife Foundation
(panda.org) have developed their own Web sites and accept online
credit-card tax-deductible donations directly.
 &HT;    Others, such as the National Audubon Society (audubon.org) and
Amnesty International (amnestyusa.org), have taken their
letter-writing campaigns digital. At redcross.org, you can even
download a stock-donation form to submit to your broker, while
helping.org offers lists of volunteer opportunities by zip code.
 &HT;    ``A lot of nonprofits are starting to take advantage of the ease
with which you can do auctions online as well,'' says Andrew
McInnes, director of special projects for amfAR (amfar.org). AmfAR
has used the method by auctioning the chance to attend its
star-studded Cinema Against AIDS benefit in Cannes on yahoo.com.
 &HT;    But to experience the power of Internet marketing at its most
beneficent, try making a contribution through thehungersite.org.
When you click a button, a pack of advertisements for the site's
sponsors pops up on your screen and 2 1/4 cups of rice are promised
to the United Nations World Food Program. Sort of like a
bike-a-thon, but easier.
 &HT;    Tony Hsieh and Alfred Lin, founders of the Internet
venture-capital firm Venture Frogs in San Francisco and of
charityfrogs.com, have taken a similar approach, pledging $1 to the
American Red Cross for each visitor's click of the site's ``ribbit
button'' until the sum totals $1 million.
 &HT;    A generous offer, to be sure, and one that separates the Frogs
from the dot-coms that might invest in a Super Bowl Sunday ad spot
instead.
 &HT;    ``It raises awareness for the Red Cross in a way that writing a
check just wouldn't,'' Hsieh says. ``But it also raises awareness
for our own company.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 NEW WAVE  
 &HT;    ``It really brought out the baby in me,'' Mark Wahlberg
confessed.
 &HT;    Though the bright sunshine outside the premiere of ``The Perfect
Storm'' was a far cry from all those grueling days in the waves,
Wahlberg's expression hinted that the trauma wasn't entirely behind
him.
 &HT;    ``We tried to make it as real as possible _ which meant getting
your butt kicked,'' he explained. ``And I'm not as tough as I
thought I was.''
 &HT;    George Clooney volunteered to explain Wahlberg's hardships in
greater detail.
 &HT;    ``Well, the thing is that Mark throws up like a madman. It was
miserable.''
 &HT;    Diane Lane emerged with a water terror of her own.
 &HT;    ``The story invaded my subconscious,'' she said. ``A real
hurricane came to town, and I half expected a huge wave to break
into my room any minute.''
 &HT;    ``I'll never sail again,'' Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio insisted.
``I like to be on terra firma, preferably sitting in a restaurant _
indoors. I don't even like picnics.''
 &HT;    The following night, a crowd came out to toast the premiere of
``The Patriot,'' in which Mel Gibson portrays a reluctant
Revolutionary War hero.
 &HT;    ``Oh,'' Gibson sighed, ``he's just another freak in my little
gallery.''
 &HT;    
 LIFETIME TV FOR BAYOU  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Look out, Martha. Watch your back, B. Smith.
 &HT;    Los Angeles-based designer Bradley Bayou is staking out your
turf with a new how-to style program to air six times a week on
cable's Lifetime network in the fall.
 &HT;    Tentatively called ``Do It with Style,'' each 30-minute episode
will feature Bayou and other style mavens, such as chefs, florists
and interior designers, helping viewers to host parties, stage
weddings or cook romantic dinners.
 &HT;    But unlike Martha Stewart's over-the-top place settings and
extravagant meals, Bayou said his show, which he is also executive
producing, will be more realistic.
 &HT;    ``It's all done within the context of their budget and their
time frame,'' he said. ``We don't go in there, put on the event and
leave; they do it themselves. It's like Martha in reality.''
 &HT;    For the pilot, Bayou, a chef and an interior designer, helped
Mary Lou, a third-grade teacher and mother of three, to prepare a
romantic dinner for her and her husband with a budget of $100. At
the end of program, she had prepared a three-course meal, including
oysters on the half-shell, stuffed shrimp, and asparagus, with corn
bread and a dessert of strawberries dipped in chocolate.
 &HT;    The show premieres Oct. 16 with a 40-show commitment. Production
starts at the end of this month.
 &HT;    But don't expect Bayou to become a television star and forget
about designing his signature gowns, suits and eveningwear.
 &HT;    ``I ain't giving it up,'' he promised. ``I've worked too hard at
it.''
 &HT;    
 NEW A&AMP;F FAN  
 &HT;    These days, you never know where Rudy Giuliani will pop up. The
mayor himself is featured in a Q&AMP;A in the back-to-school edition of
the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch quarterly.
 &HT;    Donning an A&AMP;F baseball cap, Giuliani addresses several topics,
including how it wasn't just him, but his City Hall team, who
helped to make the city safer.
 &HT;    When asked what he'd do if he weren't mayor, Giuliani said,
``I've always wanted to manage the Yankees or perform at the
Metropolitan Opera, but since I'm trained as a lawyer, I guess I'd
do that.''
 &HT;    And if the Giuliani interview isn't enough, there's also one
with former mayor Ed Koch.
 &HT;    ``We almost had Hillary, but there was a scheduling problem,''
said Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co., the ad agency that created
the catalog, which is an homage to New York. The $6 edition went on
sale last week at A&AMP;F stores and was sent to subscribers. It tells
the story of two guys and a girl from Princeton University who
arrive in Manhattan and see all the sights _ but she leaves with a
different guy.
 &HT;    Overall, the catalog is fairly tame by A&AMP;F's standards, except
for a rear-end shot of a hunky guy with dollar bills coming out of
his thong, and a photo of a guy with his shorts pulled down,
frolicking in the lake in Central Park.
 &HT;    The catalog features Bruce Weber photos of such landmarks as
Grand Central Terminal, the Brooklyn Bridge, ``21'' Club, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, the Hudson
River, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lenox Lounge in Harlem. John Scott
shot Giuliani and Koch, among others.
 &HT;    The catalog also includes a fall film guide, a 24-hour jaunt
through the Big Apple and a guide to nighttime hot spots.
 &HT;    A&AMP;F ruffled some Tiger hairs by photographing a building at
Princeton University without permission.
 &HT;    ``We definitely didn't approve it,'' said Marilyn Marks, a
Princeton spokeswoman. ``We have a policy that Nassau Hall isn't
used in promotional photography. Our attorney has been in contact
with their attorney and we expect there will be a settlement.''
 &HT;    An Abercrombie spokeswoman in Columbus, Ohio, said the company
had no comment on its use of the image or a settlement.

 By MILES SOCHA 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    PARIS _ Designers who have worked at Prada like to describe the
experience as ``school.''
 &HT;    The focus of their studies is a double major in creativity and
commerce, taught with authority and passion by professors Miuccia
Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, respectively.
 &HT;    Their degree? For a growing number of Prada graduates: a plum
job as the head designer of a high-profile European fashion house.
 &HT;    Consider what's happened to Yvan Mispelaere, Stefano Pilati and
Neil Barrett, to name a few. Mispelaere recently assumed the design
reins at Louis Feraud after two years at Miuccia's elbow in Milan.
He showed his first couture collection for the house on July 11 in
Paris.
 &HT;    Pilati, who had worked on the Miu Miu collections in Paris, was
named women's design director for Yves Saint Laurent ready-to-wear
in March. Although Tom Ford is the chief designer of YSL rtw and
creative director of the house, Pilati is assisting in creating one
of the most eagerly anticipated collections of the fall season.
 &HT;    Barrett, since exiting Prada after years as its men's-wear
director, has seen his career catapult. He launched acclaimed men's
and women's signature lines and was tapped last year as designer of
Samsonite's new and popular Travelwear collection.
 &HT;    Other former Prada assistants to have landed well include the
French designer Marc Audibet, now women's rtw designer at
Ferragamo, and Lawrence Steele, who launched a Milan-based designer
business after working for years at Prada and Moschino.
 &HT;    For these graduates of the Prada school, their success in
finding great jobs is testimony to the power of the Prada formula:
a finely tuned balance between creativity and marketing.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, for recruitment experts, it's further proof that
hiring a prominent design assistant, especially from a house as
highly regarded as Prada, is a strategy as sound and solid as
hiring a marquee name.
 &HT;    ``They are not only designers; they have a vision about
fashion,'' said Floriane de Saint Pierre, who runs an executive
search firm in Paris.
 &HT;    She said these designers are increasingly attractive to fashion
houses looking for new talent because of the renowned eye of Prada
and Bertelli.
 &HT;    De Saint Pierre said Bertelli and Prada have a reputation for
selecting individuals who have charisma, strength, a modern design
perspective and a highly sophisticated taste level _ valuable
qualities for a house in need of a dusting or makeover.
 &HT;    Lanvin was among the first venerable French houses to opt for a
design assistant rather than a name designer when it sought a
replacement for couturier Ocimar Versolato in 1997. Its choice:
Christina Ortiz, who had previously been women's design director at
Prada.
 &HT;    ``When we met her, she was more interested in marketing than
many of the creative people we had seen,'' recalled Gerald Asaria,
Lanvin's chief executive officer.
 &HT;    Six seasons later, he said it's easy to measure the impact of
her approach. Sales of the women's collection leaped by 31 percent
for fall, and the collection continues to make inroads in major
stores in North America.
 &HT;    Ortiz declined to be interviewed about her Prada experience, as
did Pilati. Prada and Bertelli also declined to participate in this
story. However, several designers spoke frankly about how their
Prada days altered their approach to the fashion business _ and
added a lot of heat to their resumes.
 &HT;    Mispelaere, interviewed as he prepared for his couture debut,
described over espressos at a cafe here what an eye-opening
experience it was to work at Prada, given that he had earlier
designed at Valentino for a more unabashedly elitist clientele.
 &HT;    At Prada, he said, he had ``the great opportunity to work in a
very merchandising, marketing way, to think about the product and
how the clothes will be received by the customer and displayed in
the store. The most important thing about Prada is thinking through
at the beginning what will happen at the end, controlling the whole
process.''
 &HT;    Although Miuccia Prada's approach to fashion is often described
as intellectual, Mispelaere characterized it as more cultural and
instinctive.
 &HT;    ``She has a really particular eye and knowledge of clothes, the
culture of clothes and the details of clothes,'' he said. ``But we
had a very simple approach, thinking about dresses, skirts,
jackets, concentrating on the way it looks without thinking we are
making special, revolutionary clothes.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bertelli operates as the commercial conscience of the
organization, adamant that what is designed will be appealing to a
great number of people and sell briskly, Mispelaere said.
 &HT;    ``It's very well known that working at Prada is not easy,'' he
said. ``It's a lot of work and involvement. It's really about the
stress of satisfying Bertelli and Miuccia, but it's a good school
for that. It's a way of thinking: being natural in your work about
what you want to do and realizing what is reasonable and what will
be successful. It's playing with the limits of a designer's work.''
 &HT;    French designer Marc Audibet said he worked at Prada just as the
family-owned luggage firm was gaining fame for rtw and setting up
its design teams. The experience served him well. Last year, he was
recruited by Florentine house Ferragamo to work with Nicole
Fischelis and Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo, who oversees rtw.
 &HT;    ``Now, other firms want to hire designers from Prada because
they want to buy a piece of the company's success,'' said Audibet,
who spent six years at Prada in the early '90s.
 &HT;    Audibet started his career at Cerruti, later working at Hermes
and Trussardi. He asserted that Bertelli, not Miuccia Prada, drives
the company's success.
 &HT;    ``If a house really wants to tap Prada's success, they should
hire Bertelli,'' he said.
 &HT;    Neil Barrett did not mince words in recounting the degree of
control Bertelli imposes on his organization, which famously
extends to the number of pencils in employees' pencil holders to
the type of toilet paper installed in the company's restrooms.
 &HT;    ``The Bertelli regime imposes certain standards of precision,
which on a work level I thoroughly enjoyed,'' he said, describing
the company variously as ``precise'' and even ``anal.''
 &HT;    ``One of the most important aspects of the training was seeing
the big picture, which became fundamental when I set up my own
company,'' he said. ``Our work was organized because Bertelli
wanted to be able to walk into a room and in five minutes
understand what you had been working on for the past three weeks.
Our job was to make things legible for him and Miuccia.
 &HT;    ``Everything was thought out in depth because, down to the width
of the stitches, Bertelli was very keyed in with the technical
aspects. What he didn't understand, he wanted to understand.''
 &HT;    Steele, who left Prada to launch is own collection in 1995 after
working on the women's collection for five years, agreed ``it was
great to work in the middle of two brilliant people.
 &HT;    ``Miuccia is very passionate about design. She is an expressive
and poetic person,'' he said. ``Bertelli, on the other hand, is
always so excited and driven. They have a great method of working,
because even though they have different roles, there is a great,
common harmony.
 &HT;    ``Bertelli has a particular way of structuring because he's
involved with the color choices, the clothes and the accessories.
The greatest experience was seeking the big picture with the eyes
of two different people who are so in sync.''
 &HT;    Of course, Prada is not the only house to produce desirable
design assistants who went on to major careers in fashion.
 &HT;    Early examples include Narciso Rodriguez, a prominent assistant
at Calvin Klein who was ultimately hired by Cerruti and Loewe, and
Alber Elbaz, a behind-the-scenes talent at Geoffrey Beene who burst
into prominence when he took over the design reins at Guy Laroche
and, more recently, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche for three
seasons.
 &HT;    Other fashion houses that have prominent former assistants at
the helm include Nathalie Gervais at Nina Ricci, Peter Speliopoulos
at Cerruti and Roberto Menichetti at Burberry. Previously, they
were top assistants at Valentino, Donna Karan and Jil Sander,
respectively.
 &HT;    The strategy of hiring prominent design assistants emerged in
the late '90s as an alternative to the star-making, buzz-generating
but cost-prohibitive ways of LVMH chief Bernard Arnault, who hired
glittering, headline-making talents for Christian Dior, Givenchy,
Louis Vuitton and Celine in the mid-'90s: John Galliano, Alexander
McQueen, Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, respectively.
 &HT;    According to industry sources, some of these designers now earn
annual salaries in the range of $1 million. But LVMH is also said
to pay the salaries of key assistants, and in the cases of
Galliano, Jacobs and Kors, the luxury giant also owns stakes in
their signature businesses.
 &HT;    But healthy salaries aren't the only factor behind the move to
hiring prominent assistants.
 &HT;    De Saint Pierre said one big plus of hiring a prominent
assistant is that editors and buyers have no preconceptions,
positive or negative, about the designer's work. Granted, buyers
may wait several seasons to evaluate the designer's work before
placing an order, but ``they really judge on the product,'' De
Saint Pierre said.
 &HT;    Asaria stressed there are no hard-and-fast rules about which
strategy works best for a fashion house, be it a marquee name, a
prominent assistant or an anonymous team behind the label.
 &HT;    But he acknowledged there are potential complications with the
famous designer route, insofar as these men and women must divide
their energies between their own label and the one they are hired
to revitalize. And once they leave, their customers often follow
them.
 &HT;    ``That makes things a little more complicated,'' he said. ``But
each house has to deal with that in its own way.''
 &HT;    Annie Bingham, a consultant at the executive search firm TMP
Worldwide here, agreed, and said, ``I think it's better when you
have someone who doesn't have their own signature collection and
can devote their entire energies to the house.''
 &HT;    As for when those designers come from Prada, Bingham echoed the
designers precisely, describing it as a school where ``designers
have been trained very well in the style of the house.''

that's the spirit this season at both Chloe and Valentino.
 &HT;    For Chloe, Stella McCartney featured cool denim pants and skirts
paired with studded blouses or sheer tops over tiny bras decorated
with the phrase ``forget me not.''

looks such as long, flowing gowns with daring slits and a duster
coat with a matching skirt.

 By MILES SOCHA 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    PARIS _ Designers who have worked at Prada like to describe the
experience as ``school.''
 &HT;    The focus of their studies is a double major in creativity and
commerce, taught with authority and passion by professors Miuccia
Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, respectively.
 &HT;    Their degree? For a growing number of Prada graduates: a plum
job as the head designer of a high-profile European fashion house.
 &HT;    Consider what's happened to Yvan Mispelaere, Stefano Pilati and
Neil Barrett, to name a few. Mispelaere recently assumed the design
reins at Louis Feraud after two years at Miuccia's elbow in Milan.
He showed his first couture collection for the house on July 11 in
Paris.
 &HT;    Pilati, who had worked on the Miu Miu collections in Paris, was
named women's design director for Yves Saint Laurent ready-to-wear
in March. Although Tom Ford is the chief designer of YSL rtw and
creative director of the house, Pilati is assisting in creating one
of the most eagerly anticipated collections of the fall season.
 &HT;    Barrett, since exiting Prada after years as its men's-wear
director, has seen his career catapult. He launched acclaimed men's
and women's signature lines and was tapped last year as designer of
Samsonite's new and popular Travelwear collection.
 &HT;    Other former Prada assistants to have landed well include the
French designer Marc Audibet, now women's rtw designer at
Ferragamo, and Lawrence Steele, who launched a Milan-based designer
business after working for years at Prada and Moschino.
 &HT;    For these graduates of the Prada school, their success in
finding great jobs is testimony to the power of the Prada formula:
a finely tuned balance between creativity and marketing.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, for recruitment experts, it's further proof that
hiring a prominent design assistant, especially from a house as
highly regarded as Prada, is a strategy as sound and solid as
hiring a marquee name.
 &HT;    ``They are not only designers; they have a vision about
fashion,'' said Floriane de Saint Pierre, who runs an executive
search firm in Paris.
 &HT;    She said these designers are increasingly attractive to fashion
houses looking for new talent because of the renowned eye of Prada
and Bertelli.
 &HT;    De Saint Pierre said Bertelli and Prada have a reputation for
selecting individuals who have charisma, strength, a modern design
perspective and a highly sophisticated taste level _ valuable
qualities for a house in need of a dusting or makeover.
 &HT;    Lanvin was among the first venerable French houses to opt for a
design assistant rather than a name designer when it sought a
replacement for couturier Ocimar Versolato in 1997. Its choice:
Christina Ortiz, who had previously been women's design director at
Prada.
 &HT;    ``When we met her, she was more interested in marketing than
many of the creative people we had seen,'' recalled Gerald Asaria,
Lanvin's chief executive officer.
 &HT;    Six seasons later, he said it's easy to measure the impact of
her approach. Sales of the women's collection leaped by 31 percent
for fall, and the collection continues to make inroads in major
stores in North America.
 &HT;    Ortiz declined to be interviewed about her Prada experience, as
did Pilati. Prada and Bertelli also declined to participate in this
story. However, several designers spoke frankly about how their
Prada days altered their approach to the fashion business _ and
added a lot of heat to their resumes.
 &HT;    Mispelaere, interviewed as he prepared for his couture debut,
described over espressos at a cafe here what an eye-opening
experience it was to work at Prada, given that he had earlier
designed at Valentino for a more unabashedly elitist clientele.
 &HT;    At Prada, he said, he had ``the great opportunity to work in a
very merchandising, marketing way, to think about the product and
how the clothes will be received by the customer and displayed in
the store. The most important thing about Prada is thinking through
at the beginning what will happen at the end, controlling the whole
process.''
 &HT;    Although Miuccia Prada's approach to fashion is often described
as intellectual, Mispelaere characterized it as more cultural and
instinctive.
 &HT;    ``She has a really particular eye and knowledge of clothes, the
culture of clothes and the details of clothes,'' he said. ``But we
had a very simple approach, thinking about dresses, skirts,
jackets, concentrating on the way it looks without thinking we are
making special, revolutionary clothes.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Bertelli operates as the commercial conscience of the
organization, adamant that what is designed will be appealing to a
great number of people and sell briskly, Mispelaere said.
 &HT;    ``It's very well known that working at Prada is not easy,'' he
said. ``It's a lot of work and involvement. It's really about the
stress of satisfying Bertelli and Miuccia, but it's a good school
for that. It's a way of thinking: being natural in your work about
what you want to do and realizing what is reasonable and what will
be successful. It's playing with the limits of a designer's work.''
 &HT;    French designer Marc Audibet said he worked at Prada just as the
family-owned luggage firm was gaining fame for rtw and setting up
its design teams. The experience served him well. Last year, he was
recruited by Florentine house Ferragamo to work with Nicole
Fischelis and Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo, who oversees rtw.
 &HT;    ``Now, other firms want to hire designers from Prada because
they want to buy a piece of the company's success,'' said Audibet,
who spent six years at Prada in the early '90s.
 &HT;    Audibet started his career at Cerruti, later working at Hermes
and Trussardi. He asserted that Bertelli, not Miuccia Prada, drives
the company's success.
 &HT;    ``If a house really wants to tap Prada's success, they should
hire Bertelli,'' he said.
 &HT;    Neil Barrett did not mince words in recounting the degree of
control Bertelli imposes on his organization, which famously
extends to the number of pencils in employees' pencil holders to
the type of toilet paper installed in the company's restrooms.
 &HT;    ``The Bertelli regime imposes certain standards of precision,
which on a work level I thoroughly enjoyed,'' he said, describing
the company variously as ``precise'' and even ``anal.''
 &HT;    ``One of the most important aspects of the training was seeing
the big picture, which became fundamental when I set up my own
company,'' he said. ``Our work was organized because Bertelli
wanted to be able to walk into a room and in five minutes
understand what you had been working on for the past three weeks.
Our job was to make things legible for him and Miuccia.
 &HT;    ``Everything was thought out in depth because, down to the width
of the stitches, Bertelli was very keyed in with the technical
aspects. What he didn't understand, he wanted to understand.''
 &HT;    Steele, who left Prada to launch is own collection in 1995 after
working on the women's collection for five years, agreed ``it was
great to work in the middle of two brilliant people.
 &HT;    ``Miuccia is very passionate about design. She is an expressive
and poetic person,'' he said. ``Bertelli, on the other hand, is
always so excited and driven. They have a great method of working,
because even though they have different roles, there is a great,
common harmony.
 &HT;    ``Bertelli has a particular way of structuring because he's
involved with the color choices, the clothes and the accessories.
The greatest experience was seeking the big picture with the eyes
of two different people who are so in sync.''
 &HT;    Of course, Prada is not the only house to produce desirable
design assistants who went on to major careers in fashion.
 &HT;    Early examples include Narciso Rodriguez, a prominent assistant
at Calvin Klein who was ultimately hired by Cerruti and Loewe, and
Alber Elbaz, a behind-the-scenes talent at Geoffrey Beene who burst
into prominence when he took over the design reins at Guy Laroche
and, more recently, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche for three
seasons.
 &HT;    Other fashion houses that have prominent former assistants at
the helm include Nathalie Gervais at Nina Ricci, Peter Speliopoulos
at Cerruti and Roberto Menichetti at Burberry. Previously, they
were top assistants at Valentino, Donna Karan and Jil Sander,
respectively.
 &HT;    The strategy of hiring prominent design assistants emerged in
the late '90s as an alternative to the star-making, buzz-generating
but cost-prohibitive ways of LVMH chief Bernard Arnault, who hired
glittering, headline-making talents for Christian Dior, Givenchy,
Louis Vuitton and Celine in the mid-'90s: John Galliano, Alexander
McQueen, Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, respectively.
 &HT;    According to industry sources, some of these designers now earn
annual salaries in the range of $1 million. But LVMH is also said
to pay the salaries of key assistants, and in the cases of
Galliano, Jacobs and Kors, the luxury giant also owns stakes in
their signature businesses.
 &HT;    But healthy salaries aren't the only factor behind the move to
hiring prominent assistants.
 &HT;    De Saint Pierre said one big plus of hiring a prominent
assistant is that editors and buyers have no preconceptions,
positive or negative, about the designer's work. Granted, buyers
may wait several seasons to evaluate the designer's work before
placing an order, but ``they really judge on the product,'' De
Saint Pierre said.
 &HT;    Asaria stressed there are no hard-and-fast rules about which
strategy works best for a fashion house, be it a marquee name, a
prominent assistant or an anonymous team behind the label.
 &HT;    But he acknowledged there are potential complications with the
famous designer route, insofar as these men and women must divide
their energies between their own label and the one they are hired
to revitalize. And once they leave, their customers often follow
them.
 &HT;    ``That makes things a little more complicated,'' he said. ``But
each house has to deal with that in its own way.''
 &HT;    Annie Bingham, a consultant at the executive search firm TMP
Worldwide here, agreed, and said, ``I think it's better when you
have someone who doesn't have their own signature collection and
can devote their entire energies to the house.''
 &HT;    As for when those designers come from Prada, Bingham echoed the
designers precisely, describing it as a school where ``designers
have been trained very well in the style of the house.''

LAZIO, LEADER ON HOUSING ISSUES, COLLECTS DONATIONS FROM INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 20 percent of the new single-family homes sold
annually in the United States are made in factories and installed
on site, ready-to-live-in realty born of assembly-line technology.
This industry is governed by an obscure series of regulations that
its lobbyists have long pressed Congress to overhaul. Now, the
industry is close to its goal, in large part because of Rep. Rick
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, took up
the industry's cause in 1998, introducing a bill based on a
proposal that the lobbyists provided, industry executives say. He
has chaperoned the bill and subsequent versions since then,
sometimes over the objections of groups worried that the changes
would weaken consumer protections, and the House and Senate have
approved versions of the measure, with a compromise likely.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Lazio has been pursuing the industry's donations.
</P>
<P>
   He has collected more than $95,000 from industry executives and
political action committees, campaign records show. He began
receiving this money in 1995, soon after he let it be known that he
was considering sponsoring the bill, which would revamp
construction and safety standards for manufactured housing. He has
collected most of the donations since introducing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at manufactured-housing companies across the nation
have responded to his entreaties, from Spirit Homes of Conway,
Ark., to Chateau Communities of Elizabeth, Colo., and Homes of
Merit of Lake City, Fla. Lazio has raised $12,550 alone from
companies in Indiana, a center of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been very aggressive and has had a lot of
fund-raisers,'' said Danny Ghorbani, president of a trade group
promoting the legislation, the Manufactured Housing Association for
Regulatory Reform, which notes that its factories have become
increasingly sophisticated, churning out homes that are sometimes
indistinguishable from those built from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot compare Mr. Lazio to the average congressman,''
Ghorbani said. ``Everybody involved with Congress has probably been
tapped for these aggressive fund-raisers by Mr. Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghorbani added: ``I wouldn't say that it has anything to do with
the legislation. He is not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides said the donations from the industry were
unrelated to his decision to champion the legislation. Lazio
believes that outmoded regulations have hampered the industry,
preventing the creation of more inexpensive housing, the aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that Rick was fighting for affordable
housing, and manufactured homes are more affordable in many
instances than built homes,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the
Lazio campaign. ``Many first homes and homes for senior citizens
are frequently manufactured homes. This is serving populations that
often times find it difficult to afford housing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is perfectly legal to collect money from donors with
legislative interests, as long as there is no explicit promise of
official action for contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions from the manufactured-housing industry help
illustrate why Lazio has been one of the most successful
fund-raisers in Congress: He has excelled at harvesting money from
donors with legislation before him, particularly those involved in
housing issues, according to an examination of his campaign
records.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is well positioned to do so. He is the only member to
serve on the Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee, both of
which are fertile ground for fund raising because they oversee many
wealthy industries. More important, he is chairman of the housing
subcommittee, so builders, real estate agents, mortgage lenders and
other housing interests often need his assent to get bills passed.
</P>
<P>
   Having raised so much money from these donors, Lazio is turning
to them again quickly because he is under considerable pressure to
collect money for his Senate campaign, given his late start in the
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. In fact, soon after becoming a
candidate, Lazio named Lewis S. Ranieri, a pioneer in the mortgage
finance field who is one of his biggest contributors, as his
finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio declined to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   He is by no means alone in raising money from donors with
interests before him, though most members of Congress have
generally not been as successful. As of March, before he entered
the Senate race, Lazio had $3.5 million in his campaign account,
more money than any other House member. From 1995 through March,
Lazio raised an average of slightly more than $1 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick has been successful raising money from individuals across
the board,'' said McLagan, the Lazio campaign spokesman. ``He is a
housing chairman who actually understands the issues, and has a
well-documented passion for affordable housing. The people who
share that goal and share that passion support him. That's
democracy.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Contributions from housing interests have not just flowed to
Lazio's official campaign committee. A political action committee
that he set up in 1995 in New York, which has more lenient donation
restrictions than the federal system, has also benefited.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1998, Lazio waged a fierce battle to defeat a
bill to expand a federal program that helps first-time home buyers
secure mortgages. The bill would have raised the limit on the size
of mortgages that the Federal Housing Administration guarantees by
33 percent to 163 percent, depending on the geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was opposed by private mortgage insurance companies,
which provide a similar service guaranteeing mortgages for people
who make low down payments or have shaky credit. The companies said
that the federal government was taking business away from them by
enlarging the program.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, chairman of the Banking
Committee, wrote a letter to the speaker at the time, Newt
Gingrich, saying that the bill would ``move us toward a
socialization of the financial mortgage markets'' and represented
``perhaps one of the greatest government expansions and intrusions
into the private sector since the Republicans have been in the
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said at the time that they were puzzled by
Lazio's opposition, noting that the increase was intended to make
it easier for people to get FHA loans in expensive areas, including
his district on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, allied with some other Republicans, was able to scale
back the proposal before it passed in October 1998. The loan limit
increased by 16 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, on Nov. 2, just before Election Day,
Lazio's New York committee, Friends of Rick Lazio, received a total
of $23,500 from six of the largest private mortgage insurance
companies. The industry trade group, the Mortgage Insurance
Companies of America, coordinated the donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contribution to him was our way of supporting him in all
the important work that he is doing that directly affects our
industry,'' said Glen Corso, a spokesman for one of the companies,
PMI Mortgage Insurance Co., which donated $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there was a connection between the donations and
the fight over the loan limit, McLagan said, ``No, of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has also collected sizable contributions from donors with
interests before the Commerce Committee, particularly Wall Street
and the broadcasting industry. Since joining the committee in 1997,
he has raised more than $50,000 from executives and PACs connected
to Citigroup, the financial services conglomerate that lobbied
heavily on legislation to modernize the industry, and more than
$43,000 from executives and PACs at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of his fund-raising success has been the
housing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Take manufactured housing. For years, the industry has agitated
about a 1974 federal law that establishes construction and safety
standards. Company executives point out that the industry largely
built mobile homes back then, but these days their products are far
more advanced. ``The law was originally written for trailers and
mobile homes,'' said Edward J. Hussey, a prominent industry
executive who is vice president of Liberty Homes in Goshen, Ind.,
and has given Lazio $5,000 since 1996. ``We are now building homes
that go on foundations and look like any other house. We are
dealing not only with different building materials, but different
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups on all sides of the issue agree that the law is
obsolete, but consumer groups repeatedly complained that the
industry was trying to push through new regulations that would
water down consumer protections and essentially allow the industry
to regulate itself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, after being determinedly lobbied by the industry since
the Republicans gained control of Congress three years earlier,
Lazio introduced his bill, and one of the most influential groups
involved in the issue, AARP, which represents older Americans, said
the bill was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Green, an AARP lobbyist, said the bill would have
established a committee to make regulations that would be dominated
by industry. The bill would have also scaled back the Department of
Housing and Urban Development's oversight of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had major reservations about the bill as it was originally
introduced,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, donations from the industry were pouring in to
Lazio's campaign. In June 1998, Lazio collected nearly $13,000 from
executives of manufactured-housing companies. (AARP does not make
political donations.)
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations with some Democratic lawmakers, AARP and
other advocacy groups, Lazio agreed to modify the legislation,
reducing the industry's ability to control the rule-making
committee, which also includes consumer representatives. The 1998
bill passed the House overwhelmingly, only to stall in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio introduced the legislation again in February 1999, and it
underwent further changes in talks with opponents. In February and
March 1999, Lazio raised a total of nearly $22,000 from the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In later negotiations, Lazio agreed to establish a process to
allow consumers to settle disputes with the manufacturers or the
companies that installed the housing. He wrapped the legislation
into a larger housing bill, and it has now passed the House. The
Senate approved a slightly different bill, which was sponsored by
Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Several opponents of the original Lazio legislation, like AARP,
favor the changes in the House version, and no longer are fighting
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   McLagan, the Lazio campaign spokesman, said the original
legislation had been fair to both the industry and consumers,
explaining that Lazio believed that the federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development had not supervised the industry
properly. Housing agency officials disputed that criticism, saying
that Lazio was making the department a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   As for the donations, Hussey said they had not helped the
industry obtain special treatment. ``He is a very bright young man
and works very, very hard at what he does,'' Hussey said of Lazio.
``I think that he is a rising star, and that is why people are
contributing.''

   SAN ANTONIO _ The Union Underground's promotional photos are
enough to scare your grandma.
</P>
<P>
   With their piercings, tattoos and 2-foot-tall hair, the cats in
the Union Underground might even scare your daddy.
</P>
<P>
   In the flesh, though, in a Greek restaurant in broad daylight
and far away from the rock 'n' roll spotlight, the members of the
Union Underground _ San Antonio's best hope for crunching rock
success _ look just different enough from the civilian population
to make Grandma mutter something about kids these days.
</P>
<P>
   But on this particular late spring day three of the four Union
Underground members, Bryan Scott, 25, vocals, guitar; Patrick
Kennison, 26, guitar; and Josh Memolo, 25, drums (bassist John
Moyer, 24, was stuck in Austin) have larger concerns than
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been almost a year since our last gig,'' Memolo said,
looking like a man who just bit into a lemon. If looks can echo,
Kennison's and Scott's echoed Memolo's.
</P>
<P>
   The Union Underground had a pretty good excuse for being
inactive. The quartet was waiting on the release of its major-label
debut album, the Portrait/Columbia ``An Education in Rebellion,''
and rehearsing for the ensuing near-endless tour of support. The
wait is over. Though the release date changed several times, the
disc finally hit the streets Tuesday. The first single from
``Rebellion,'' ``Turn Me On `Mr. Deadman','' is already making
large waves on rock radio.
</P>
<P>
   So what sets the Union Underground apart from the herd of rock
bands?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't wear (expletive) clown masks,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a DJ,'' Memolo added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a relentless attitude,'' Kennison said. ``It's never
enough and if it's worth doing it's worth overdoing until you can't
lift a finger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of aggressive stuff out there now but a lot of
it is a little too calculated,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the Union Underground go back to a Scott/Kennison
middle school friendship. The band came together in '95. Memolo,
formerly with the band Ghodsonic, joined in '97. Moyer came on
board in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only guys we knew who wanted to do more than
headline the local clubs,'' Kennison said about teaming with Scott.
``We started recording our own tunes. To some people that might
have been backward. But we wanted to headline the local clubs and
the Alamodome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only two guys not just in it to get laid and get
high,'' Scott added.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennison says the Union Underground has a relentless
attitude, he is not talking about some sort of tap dancing on the
rock 'n' roll lifestyle edge. He is talking about the band's
approach to doing business as well as making music.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after UU signed a recording contract, the band busted
its collective hump building a grass-roots following, passing out
handbills, putting together street teams to get the band's music
and stickers out around the country, writing songs, learning about
recording and producing those songs, and putting together an
impressive stage show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find four guys who do not (expletive) around,''
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   The music on ``An Education in Rebellion'' is as straight-ahead
as rock gets in the '00s. There are no traces of rap-rock, no
overblown vocal gimmicks, no samples, no loops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always want to tell people our music is timeless,'' Kennison
said, ``and I know that's bold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has its influences, but we're not metal,'' Scott
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're not alternative,'' Memolo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind if people called us arena rock,'' Kennison
added.
</P>
<P>
   The trio went on to note what it thinks are the best three
albums of the past 15 years _ Metallica's ``Master of Puppets,''
Alice in Chains' ``Dirt'' and Guns N' Roses' ``Appetite for
Destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest compliment anyone could pay us is saying they like
the album top to bottom,'' Kennison said.
</P>
<P>
   So what about that album title, ``An Education in Rebellion''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It means going against the grain of the music business,''
Kennison said. ``It's about doing it yourself and teaching yourself
along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, regardless of the original meaning, people can
make it their own,'' Scott said. ``It's cool to let people get what
they want out of it. It sums up our lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Record labels release enough albums every year to boggle the
minds of even the most rabid music fan. Getting lost in the shuffle
is so common that it's amazing so many bands want to ante up for
the shuffle. Still, UU has expectations for its five-album deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten million copies sold,'' Kennison said with a deadpan
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he added, leaning across the restaurant table, ``we've
never had that attitude in the past. We know what our songs should
be. We know what the show should be. That's the Union filtration
system. That's what we can control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're intent on building this into a long career,'' Memolo
said. ``We're not worried about sales, we're worried about the
second and third albums.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to writing and performing we have full
control,'' Scott said. ``But we don't have control over the disc
jockey in Akron. We can't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest complaints from bands is once they sign a
deal the record label tries to change the sound, or the look, or
the songs. So far, Union Underground hasn't had that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Kennison were the lead producers on the disc. Most of
the recording was done in the quartet's studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had half the record done before we had the deal,'' Scott
said. ``Then we tracked four or five new songs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we get off the first tour we'll have the second
album demoed,'' Memolo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every song we turned in after we signed the contract was
better than the song before,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are no cover songs and no ballads,'' Kennison added
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   While South Texas has long been a hotbed of rock 'n' roll music,
the interest has not translated into a slew of major-label music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about being from San Antonio?'' Scott asked
rhetorically. ``I'm going to be able to wear one of those
(Expletive) You I'm From Texas T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps the image of San Antonio to show people we're
not a bunch of redneck hillbillies,'' Memolo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People actually asked us if we could get to a fax machine,''
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in New York and Los Angeles think image is so
important,'' Memolo added. ``We just do our thing. And we'll never
say we're from Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union Underground is ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident,'' Kennison said. ``The Internet response has
been great. We're getting e-mail from around the world. We've also
distributed 200,000 sampler cassettes in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work hard and success isn't thrust upon you, you're
more ready,'' Memolo said. ``I believe the timing is right for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting signed is just the beginning,'' Kennison added, ``but
we have an album that can be listened to all the way through.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: IT'S PARTY TIME AGAIN
 &HT;    Moving in the Washington (w) and political (p) categories for
release Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first time I attended a major national
political convention turns out also to be the last time the
delegates needed more then one ballot to decide on a nominee.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1956. The Democrats met at the Chicago stockyards,
tapping Adlai Stevenson of Illinois for a futile rematch against
President Dwight Eisenhower. As a copy boy for the old New York
Herald Tribune, I had a great seat as a final drama unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson decided to throw the vice-presidential nomination wide
open. In the ensuing free-for-all, Sen. Estes Kefauver of
Tennessee, Stevenson's bitter rival in 1952, beat an attractive new
political face, Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts, on the
second ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Says Reuven Frank, who produced NBC's pioneering gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the 1956 conventions: ``There are few who can still
recall _ and it is hard for the rest to recognize _ how important
and even exciting the conventions of (those) national political
parties were.''
</P>
<P>
   In their wake have come tightly scripted extravaganzas offering
what Frank calls ``ineffective windbaggery.'' But if these
gatherings have as died as news stories, the press stubbornly
refuses to bury them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the era of Huntley and Brinkley, whom Frank put together
in the NBC skybooth, wraparound convention coverage has been
relegated to the all-news cable channels. To bear witness as the
Republicans perform next week in Philadelphia, CNN alone plans to
send more than 500 people, including a slew of interns and Internet
mavens. Two weeks later, the parallel show opens among the
Democrats in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for such political theater has thinned appreciably
since 1956, when Frank first sought to mine news out the
proceedings by sending four reporters with portable mikes onto the
convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's also being split among a half-dozen cable news outlets.
Coverage plans by the likes of CNN, Fox, MSNBC, PBS and C-SPAN
include perpetual Webcasts. They'll be competing for scarce
eyeballs with their over-the-air siblings and with a dozen or so
online-only outfits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the convention handlers, who have alienated the
networks by depriving them of anything that even remotely smacks of
political warfare, will get into the news game themselves by
producing their own Webcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The old-line networks will make an appearance in both Philly and
L.A., if only a ghostly one.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the NBC peacock, which intends to skip the first two
nights, the Big Eye of ABC and ABC's Alphabet Soup are mounting
token efforts at coverage in the run-up to the sole ``must carry''
event: the major candidates' acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, CBS finds noteworthy the remarks of retired Gen.
Colin Powell. ABC will dispatch Peter Jennings to cover the Monday
sessions of both conventions. On reflection, it scrapped plans to
use the halftime slots at preseason NFL football games and pushed
up their kickoff times by two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive is also in: MSNBC will solicit questions for its
online audience from Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the rear, we in what the TV folks dub ``the pencil
press'' are coming in force as well. A good many will report on the
doings of media celebrities.

 &HT;    WOMEN'S VOTE UP FOR GRABS THIS YEAR, TO GORE'S DISMAY
 &HT;    1100&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories

   VIENNA, Va. _ Shielded by a shade tree from the midday sun,
Nancy Luciani sits in a trim municipal park as her son and a gaggle
of other 6-year-olds chase a ball across a grassy field. Nearby are
all the trappings of life in the 'burbs: the jogging strollers, the
minivans, the fellow parents waiting to ferry their kids to their
next summer activity.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani is a 36-year-old mom watching her kid play soccer. But
do not call her a ``soccer mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The soccer-mom term is so derogatory. It suggests that all
women think and feel the same way,'' says Luciani, a former
corporate systems analyst and now full-time mother of three from
Oakton, Va., a suburb of Washington. ``Women care about a lot of
different things.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas care a lot about women _ and their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, soccer moms gained almost mythical stature among
campaign operatives and political commentators as a coveted swing
voting bloc that would re-elect President Clinton or give
Republican Bob Dole a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, as they had in '92, a majority of women voters handed
Bill Clinton a decisive victory, demonstrating their traditional
preference for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the neck-and-neck 2000 presidential campaign is a
different story. According to polls, Bush is cutting into the
conventional Democratic advantage with women, the very voters Gore
must have if he expects to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real clear that younger women, mothers, married women,
are key battleground groups,'' said pollster Andrew Kohut, director
of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the campaign illustrates just how hard Bush and
Gore are trying to appeal to the bloc _ each touting proposals for
education, children, health care and community values.
</P>
<P>
   But women voters are no monolith.
</P>
<P>
   Working women naturally are interested in the economy,
fair-labor issues and women's rights. Working moms care about those
things too, plus day-care and family leave. Stay-at-home mothers
pay attention to education and family values. For many but not most
women, abortion is a make-or-break issue, depending on which side
of the issue they are on.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms, suburb moms, mall moms _ by any other name, this
target group is mainly young, mainly white and mainly living in
suburbs and small towns. They represent anywhere between 5 and 20
percent of the electorate, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this group of women so important as a voting bloc are
men.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-Republican gender gap exists because men
abandoned the Democratic party during the Reagan era in the 1980s
and, to a greater extent, in the midterm elections of 1994 that
elected a Republican Congress. Since early 1999, surveys show that
Bush has consistently drawn greater support from men compared to
Gore, leading by an average of 20 percentage points in recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the battle for women, the stakes are greatest for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he holds what several recent polls describe as only a
slight lead among all women, and in some surveys he lags among
married women. A Pew Research Group poll in late June found Gore
trailing Bush among mothers, 45 percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, women have been a core constituency for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the presidency from Bush's father in 1992, Clinton
garnered 45 percent of the women's vote, compared to 37 percent for
the elder Bush. In 1996, Clinton doubled his victory margin to 16
percentage points, beating Dole among women voters 54 percent to 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Gore losing some of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is smart. He's talking about issues that women do care
about _ education, chg, a high-school teacher and 41-year-old
mother of three in Vienna, Va., voted for Clinton in 1992 and in
1996 and considers herself a solid Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But she does not like Gore, and cannot bring herself to support
Bush. Instead, she'll vote for third-party candidate and consumer
advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want authenticity. Someone who seems genuine and not
sculpted by some marketing specialist,'' she said. ``I just don't
trust him (Gore) because he seems so contradictory depending on the
audience he's talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaigns for governor in Texas, Bush proved popular with
women voters. Running against a woman, Democratic incumbent Ann
Richards in 1994, Bush split the women's vote. In 1998, Bush won
re-election with 65 percent of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush thus far has
commanded the presidential campaign agenda and prevented Gore from
stressing the kinds of issues most appealing to women, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fashioned himself as ``the low-risk change,'' said
Thomas Mann, a scholar of government and politics at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center.
</P>
<P>
   Voters detect few differences between the candidates on bedrock
issues like health care and education. That has given Bush an edge
in appealing to both women and men as the anti-Washington candidate
by focusing ``on changing the way we conduct politics,'' Mann said
</P>
<P>
   Yet many pollsters and political scholars dismiss the notion
that Gore has been tainted directly by President Clinton and the
scandals that plagued his administration, most notably the affair
with Monica Lewinsky that led to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore and the Democrats may suffer a credibility problem when
campaigning on family values _ issues such as community, parenting
and morals that women in particular rank high among their
priorities, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, Clinton has given the Republicans those issues
and made it difficult for the Democrats to talk about them,''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in March asked women what factor is most important
in their vote this year. They were evenly split, with 47 percent
naming an issue or issues and 47 percent citing character and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani, the soccer mom who detests the label, ranks the
character of the candidate and issues involving the economy,
education and family values high on her list. A self-described
independent voter, she says Gore was never an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't know anything about him, if he were starting from
zero, I would consider him,'' she said. ``But knowing about him and
his connections to the Clinton administration, I'd say 'no.' ``
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican nominating convention, convening July 31 in
Philadelphia, the podium with be filled with ample evidence of the
GOP strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Day One: The candidate's wife, Laura Bush, and former Gen. Colin
Powell will address issues of health care, education and Bush's
``leave no child behind'' theme. Day Two: former presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole and GOP adviser Condoleeza Rice will
emphasize America's place in the world. Day Three: a focus on small
bg in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release

with a more credible voice on these issues than previous Republican
candidates have,'' said Anna Greenberg, a pollster at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for Al Gore to shore up the traditional base,
and the base includes important blocs of Democratic and independent
women voters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some pollsters and political analysts detect a potentially
more troublesome factor for Gore. Many women voters, when gauging
qualities such as character and trust, view him negatively.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show Bush out-polling Gore on character
evaluations and leadership qualities. Gore's poll numbers dipped in
June amid news reports that Justice Department officials had
recommended that an independent counsel probe the vice president's
1996 campaign finance activities.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Browning, a high-school teacher and 41-year-old mother
of three in Vienna, Va., voted for Clinton in 1992 and in 1996 and
considers herself a solid Democrat.

women voters. Running against a woman, Democratic incumbent Ann
Richards in 1994, Bush split the women's vote. In 1998, Bush won
re-election with 65 percent of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush thus far has
commanded the presidential campaign agenda and prevented Gore from
stressing the kinds of issues most appealing to women, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fashioned himself as ``the low-risk change,'' said
Thomas Mann, a scholar of government and politics at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center.
</P>
<P>
   Voters detect few differences between the candidates on bedrock
issues like health care and education. That has given Bush an edge
in appealing to both women and men as the anti-Washington candidate
by focusing ``on changing the way we conduct politics,'' Mann said
</P>
<P>
   Yet many pollsters and political scholars dismiss the notion
that Gore has been tainted directly by President Clinton and the
scandals that plagued his administration, most notably the affair
with Monica Lewinsky that led to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore and the Democrats may suffer a credibility problem when
campaigning on family values _ issues such as community, parenting
and morals that women in particular rank high among their
priorities, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, Clinton has given the Republicans those issues
and made it difficult for the Democrats to talk about them,''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in March asked women what factor is most important
in their vote this year. They were evenly split, with 47 percent
naming an issue or issues and 47 percent citing character and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani, the soccer mom who detests the label, ranks the
character of the candidate and issues involving the economy,
education and family values high on her list. A self-described
independent voter, she says Gore was never an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't know anything about him, if he were starting from
zero, I would consider him,'' she said. ``But knowing about him and
his connections to the Clinton administration, I'd say 'no.' ``
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican nominating convention, convening July 31 in
Philadelphia, the podium with be filled with ample evidence of the
GOP strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Day One: The candidate's wife, Laura Bush, and former Gen. Colin
Powell will address issues of health care, education and Bush's
``leave no child behind'' theme. Day Two: former presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole and GOP adviser Condoleeza Rice will
emphasize America's place in the world. Day Three: a focus on small
business, a traditional Republican theme and one that plays to a
current trend _ about half of all new small businesses are run by
women.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in Los Angeles in mid-August, Gore and the Democrats
will stress the important issues separating him and Bush: gun
control, abortion rights and the party's traditional role as a
defender of equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that, with four months remaining until the
election, much about the character of the race can and probably
will change. Many voters, women and men, have yet to focus on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, women appear much more likely than in the past to
consider the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in '96 the soccer moms, or what that meant, was
baloney,'' said the pollster Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those younger married women or young mothers were always for
Clinton, not for Dole. They thought Dole was out on another planet,
and they couldn't relate to him. But younger women are having a
real hard time choosing between Bush and Gore in a way that they

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: IT'S PARTY TIME AGAIN
 &HT;    Moving in the Washington (w) and political (p) categories for
release Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first time I attended a major national
political convention turns out also to be the last time the
delegates needed more then one ballot to decide on a nominee.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1956. The Democrats met at the Chicago stockyards,
tapping Adlai Stevenson of Illinois for a futile rematch against
President Dwight Eisenhower. As a copy boy for the old New York
Herald Tribune, I had a great seat as a final drama unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson decided to throw the vice-presidential nomination wide
open. In the ensuing free-for-all, Sen. Estes Kefauver of
Tennessee, Stevenson's bitter rival in 1952, beat an attractive new
political face, Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts, on the
second ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Says Reuven Frank, who produced NBC's pioneering gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the 1956 conventions: ``There are few who can still
recall _ and it is hard for the rest to recognize _ how important
and even exciting the conventions of (those) national political
parties were.''
</P>
<P>
   In their wake have come tightly scripted extravaganzas offering
what Frank calls ``ineffective windbaggery.'' But if these
gatherings have as died as news stories, the press stubbornly
refuses to bury them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the era of Huntley and Brinkley, whom Frank put together
in the NBC skybooth, wraparound convention coverage has been
relegated to the all-news cable channels. To bear witness as the
Republicans perform next week in Philadelphia, CNN alone plans to
send more than 500 people, including a slew of interns and Internet
mavens. Two weeks later, the parallel show opens among the
Democrats in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for such political theater has thinned appreciably
since 1956, when Frank first sought to mine news out the
proceedings by sending four reporters with portable mikes onto the
convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's also being split among a half-dozen cable news outlets.
Coverage plans by the likes of CNN, Fox, MSNBC, PBS and C-SPAN
include perpetual Webcasts. They'll be competing for scarce
eyeballs with their over-the-air siblings and with a dozen or so
online-only outfits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the convention handlers, who have alienated the
networks by depriving them of anything that even remotely smacks of
political warfare, will get into the news game themselves by
producing their own Webcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The old-line networks will make an appearance in both Philly and
L.A., if only a ghostly one.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the NBC peacock, which intends to skip the first two
nights, the Big Eye of ABC and ABC's Alphabet Soup are mounting
token efforts at coverage in the run-up to the sole ``must carry''
event: the major candidates' acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, CBS finds noteworthy the remarks of retired Gen.
Colin Powell. ABC will dispatch Peter Jennings to cover the Monday
sessions of both conventions. On reflection, it scrapped plans to
use the halftime slots at preseason NFL football games and pushed
up their kickoff times by two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive is also in: MSNBC will solicit questions for its
online audience from Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the rear, we in what the TV folks dub ``the pencil
press'' are coming in force as well. A good many will report on the
doings of media celebrities.

 &HT;    RESENDING TO MAKE CHANGES IN 8TH GRAF
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Greasing up the old (and new) glove
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 23, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenny went out and bought his eight-year-old grandson a baseball
glove the other day. And now it was time to break it in, which
puzzled the child because most kids today just take their glove off
the store shelf and go straight to the field -- which is why the
ball bounces out of the glove so often.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, Kenny, who treks three miles with me each morning in an
effort to stave off overwhelming weight gain and joint lockup,
asked me if I remembered the kind of oil we used to grease our
gloves when we were kids as he wanted to get some to break in his
grandson's new glove.
</P>
<P>
   This caused a great deal of thought. Even though I still carry a
baseball glove in the trunk of my car (you never know when a
grandson is going to honor you by asking for a game of catch) I
cannot recall the last time I oiled it, or if ever I did.
</P>
<P>
   My glove is a Fred Lynn model and he played in the major leagues
beginning in 1974. I don't believe he played into the '90s. Thus,
you know how long I've had that glove (with a beat-up baseball
jammed into its pocket and a strap wrapped around it to keep it
closed and formed.)
</P>
<P>
   So what was that oil we used to use as kids? Think more!
</P>
<P>
   My first glove was a Goose Goslin model. That ought to give away
my age but it really doesn't. Goslin broke into the major leagues
in 1921 and played into 1935. But I didn't get the glove until the
1940s; it was used when I got it.
</P>
<P>
   Like other boys, I kept a bottle of that whatsit in my closet,
every once in a while taking it out and rubbing it firmly into the
pocket of the glove. Then I would pound it with a baseball until
the color of the pocket turned dark reddish-brown as opposed to the
lighter chestnut look of the rest of the glove.
</P>
<P>
   Don't kids rub oil into their gloves any more I asked Kenny,
unable myself to recall whether either of my two now-adult boys
ever did, or if ever I did it for them? He said he didn't know and
that his eight year old not only didn't know that but didn't know
on which hand to put the glove.
</P>
<P>
   Make him put some oil on it, I told Kenny; maybe something like
WD-40 or Three-In-One oil or even Mazola oil. Soften up that
pocket, make it supple; the better to close your hand around ground
balls.
</P>
<P>
   No, Kenny insisted, he wanted the real McCoy -- whatever it is.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoonists show it as a light bulb flashing on over your
head, that sudden realization of what your brain was searching for.
Suddenly, the bulb over my head flashed on, a full 300 watts.
</P>
<P>
   Neatsfoot oil!
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't heard the word in years, hadn't uttered it. It just
came to me. This is not a sign of brilliance, or even high
intelligence. It's just a knack many of us have for remembering
things old while, conversely, not being able to recall what
happened just five minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neatsfoot oil,'' I shouted to Kenny. ``Yes!,'' he exclaimed in
celebration, ``that's it, neatsfoot oil. Where would I get it?''
</P>
<P>
   So we started thinking again and decided that we used to get it
either from the corner hardware store or the drug store nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But, asked Kenny, what is neatsfoot oil? And so we thought again
but no light bulbs were forthcoming. Is it possible that the term
is in a dictionary? Well, yes it was.
</P>
<P>
   Neat's-foot oil, or neatsfoot oil (either way is ok) is a
``light yellow oil obtained by boiling the feet and shinbones of
cattle, used mainly as a dressing for leather.'' Aaaargh! I'm sorry
I looked it up; I thought it came out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Kenny hustled down to a hardware store and with
authority newly achieved asked for a small bottle of neatsfoot oil.
And they had it!
</P>
<P>
   Did you get some for me, I asked Kenny, thinking that perhaps my
glove drying out in car trunks lo these many years might need some
rejuvenation. No, he hadn't thought of that.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well. Nobody's asked me to play catch for some time
now.

 &HT;    INSPECTION EXPERIMENT FAILED TO CATCH DISEASED BIRDS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An experimental inspection program begun last fall
at an Alabama poultry processing plant passed along thousands of
pounds of chicken with tumors, pus, sores and scabs to unsuspecting
consumers, according to government records obtained by Cox
Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   When problems at the Gold Kist plant in Guntersville, Ala.,
first came to light in February, Clinton administration officials
and the company said food leaving the plant was safe. And as
recently as last week, the Department of Agriculture announced its
experimental inspection program was a huge success.
</P>
<P>
   But inspection records from the plant that the government tried
to keep secret paint a picture of a plant unable to keep diseased
poultry from reaching the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the experimental program, company workers instead of
federal inspectors are supposed to find and remove substandard
poultry. But on some days last winter, the records show, company
workers failed to catch 25 percent of the diseased birds on one of
the plant's two production lines.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS), the agency responsible for the new
program, did not return repeated phone calls over several days.
Atlanta-based Gold Kist Inc. also would not comment on the federal
records.
</P>
<P>
   However, Delmer(cq) Jones, head of the union that represents
federal food safety inspectors, said he sees the experimental
program as an attempt by the government and industry to brainwash
consumers into believing it is OK to eat what he derisively termed
``wholesome diseased product.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unwholesome, adulterated product,'' Jones said, ``and it
is being allowed to go out to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The chickens are not considered a threat to human health because
poultry diseases cannot be transmitted to human beings. But federal
inspectors say diseased birds are supposed to be condemned because
they are not considered wholesome. Under the government's
definition, these include chickens with airsacculitis _ a common
respiratory disease that leaves pus inside the carcass _ or those
with tumors, sores, scabs or infections.
</P>
<P>
   Typically the Guntersville plant processes tens of thousands of
chickens a day. That means meat from thousands of diseased birds
will eventually reach consumers if even a small percentage of
poultry leaving the plant has tumors, infections or other diseases.
Chicken from the plant helps supply, among other customers, nuggets
for school lunch programs in 31 states, including Texas and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Following the company inspection, federal employees take several
samples of 10 birds every day to see how many defective carcasses
slip by. In addition to diseased birds, inspectors look for other
indications the birds are unwholesome, such as sores, bruises or
parts of the digestive tract clinging to the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of reports on these samples obtained by Cox Newspapers
through the Freedom of Information Act show that by the
government's own accounting methods, 40 percent of the samples
taken from October until the following February failed at least one
of these tests. The most common cause of failure was that a bird
was diseased.
</P>
<P>
   Under the experimental program, it is up to the company to
decide how it will improve its performance. But government
inspectors at Guntersville said the company did little, if
anything, to limit the number of diseased birds leaving the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials initially refused to hand over
the test reports, saying that they were ``linked to the
deliberative process'' and if members of the public had access to
the information they might ``interpret the data and prejudge'' what
the government might do with its experimental program. After Cox
Newspapers threatened to take USDA to court, the government
reversed itself and handed over the data.
</P>
<P>
   Problems at the Guntersville plant became public last February
when food safety inspectors told Cox Newspapers that they were
unable to stop defective poultry from being shipped to consumers
because of the experimental inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after their allegations were published, Thomas J.
Billy, the head of FSIS, issued a press release saying, ``We have
no reason to believe product leaving these Gold Kist plants is
anything other than safe and wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, records collected by Billy's staff show that on Dec.
22, 1999, and again on Dec. 28, federal inspectors found, after
taking several samples, that 25 percent of the birds passed by Gold
Kist employees on one of its production lines were diseased. In the
week prior to Billy's statement, the failure rate ranged from 10
percent to 16 percent during the night shift on one of the
processing lines.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Billy was not told about the tests before
he issued his press release or, if he was told, whether he thought
the failure rate was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Food safety officials say even under the old system, in which
inspectors do a carcass-by-carcass inspection of birds after they
are slaughtered, some defective birds slip by. Prior to running the
experimental program, the government did a study that found
government inspectors missed diseased birds 1.3 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Anderson, a research economist for the Research Triangle
Institute (RTI), which conducted the study for the government, said
the figure was based on an analysis of inspections done by federal
employees at 16 plants _ including the Guntersville facility _ over
a 25-day period. Anderson said the institute did not provide the
government with figures on a plant-by-plant basis or the daily
failure rate.
</P>
<P>
   USDA hopes the experimental program will do no worse than the
error rate reported for the federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cox Newspapers analysis of the October-February
inspection reports found the failure rate among company inspectors
at the Guntersville plant was 4.3 percent _ more than triple the
rate of the baseline study.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poor showing at the Guntersville plant detailed in
the federal records, FSIS issued a press release Monday that talked
about the program in glowing terms. Citing a recent RTI study that
monitored the program, Billy said defects in chickens being shipped
had been cut by 92 percent. Billy said, ``What this project is
about is getting closer to perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the RTI study is from only seven of the 30 plants
involved in the experimental program. It could not be determined
from the information released by the government if the Guntersville
plant was among the seven surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   When problems at the Guntersville plant first came to light,
John Bekkers, head of Gold Kist, said the public was being ``misled
by a few union-activist'' USDA officials. However, company
officials later acknowledged to federal investigators that they
were having a problem with diseases ravaging the Gold Kist flocks,
according to a report by the Agriculture Department's Office of
Inspector General.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection reports also appear to confirm the accounts
several inspectors gave Cox Newspapers. They said that periodically
a flock would be delivered to the plant that had a large number of
diseased birds. When that occurred, company inspectors would be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   When Cox Newspapers graphed the number of diseased birds found
in samples taken by federal inspectors, it looked like the chart of
a feverish patient. Every few weeks the number of diseased birds
would spike to between 10 and 25 percent and then come down.
</P>
<P>
   Following the initial story on the Guntersville plant in
February, the OIG launched an investigation to, among other things,
determine if there were any violations of law or threat to public
health. However, the investigation was quickly completed after the
Government Accountability Project (GAP), a Washington-based public
interest group that protects whistle-blowers, questioned the
tactics of the OIG investigators. GAP said government investigators
were questioning federal food safety inspectors about their
contacts with a Cox Newspaper reporter, which GAP said violated the
Whistle-blower Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on Guntersville, the OIG said there was a high
incidence of disease in the Gold Kist flocks being slaughtered at
the plant, but there was no violation of law or direct threat to
public health.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the experimental program was put in doubt earlier
this month when a federal appeals court ruled that the USDA could
not hand over its inspection tasks to company workers.

BYRDS MAN SEES PROMISE OF DIGITAL MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger McGuinn has spent a lifetime watching the evolution of the
music business _ from his days as a kid in Chicago listening to
Elvis on a plastic transistor radio, to his rise to the top of the
charts with the seminal folk-rock band the Byrds, to his quiet, yet
honorable return to his folk roots. And so McGuinn, a former
long-haired icon of '60s counterculture, had something important he
wanted to share with the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing testimony on controversial digital music distribution
programs earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   It was this: Apart from a modest advance, he never made any
money off the albums he recorded for the major labels.
</P>
<P>
   Nada. Zilch. Nothing but the publicity that generated an
audience for his live performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I've recorded over 25 records, I cannot support my
family on record royalties alone,'' he told the committee, which is
headed by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).
</P>
<P>
   That's just something McGuinn felt the senators should know as
they decide whether to intervene in the ongoing battle over the
digital distribution of music. Technology companies downplay the
fact that digital technology facilitates music piracy, while the
major record companies contend that technology upstarts like
Napster and MP3.com are infringing on copyrights and stealing
profits away from artists.
</P>
<P>
   But McGuinn is one artist who doesn't have much sympathy for the
labels. ``They are not the poor victim in all this; they've made a
killing,'' he said during a phone interview from his home in
Orlando, Fla. ``For years, the labels had all the power, and the
artists were pawns. The artists were cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get him wrong. This isn't one of those
old-rocker-goes-broke sob stories _ far from it. McGuinn, who
created a new music style with the Byrds, continues to evolve with
the times. Since 1995, he has been contributing to a folk revival
on the Internet; every month, he posts one newly recorded version
of a traditional tune on the Folk Den section of his Web site,
www.mcguinn.com. He sells the recordings on MP3.com. Ten years ago,
he worked out a new royalty arrangement with Sony for reissues of
the Byrds' recordings, and he continues to perform on the folk
circuit. McGuinn, who turned 58 last week, is doing just fine,
thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   But he also feels compelled to express a sobering point of view
that hasn't been heard much in the great digital debate. Sure, on
the one hand, artists like Metallica and Dr. Dre have sided with
the recording industry against Napster; on the other hand, Chuck D.
has long preached that the Internet is going to provide new
opportunities for all the starving artists of the world. McGuinn
falls between those two extremes and adds a refreshing voice of
reason to the whole brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like the wild and wooly nature of the Internet,'' he
says. The Net, after all, allows musicians instant access to a mass
market; McGuinn knows of many people who discovered his folk tunes
on the Internet and then went out and bought his CDs. The Web
reminds him of the old mom-and-pop record stores he frequented back
in Chicago; back in the day, customers could sit in a listening
booth and sample 45s _ remember 45s? _ before deciding what to buy.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, he admits, Napster is like a giant electronic
listening booth. But, he adds, ``I'm not pro-Napster, which stands
to profit from the illicit distribution of digital media,'' he
said. ``I would like to see artists compensated for their work.''
But the record companies haven't exactly been compensating artists
fairly, he added. At MP3.com, he earns 50 percent of the gross
sales of his records. ``That's a lot better than doing it for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuinn, of course, has scoured Napster to see if any of his
songs are available on the music-swapping service. All the big hits
are there _ songs like ``Mr. Tambourine Man'' and ``Turn, Turn,
Turn'' and ``Eight Miles High'' _ but that doesn't concern him too
much. Unlike technology company executives who spew out hype about
the glory of digital distribution, he admits that the quality of
MP3 files is inferior to CDs. ``It's not that much better than a
good tape,'' says McGuinn, an expert in high fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   McGuinn has always been something of a gadget man, whether it
was tinkering with the 12-string guitar to create the Byrds'
distinct sound or carrying around a ``portable'' phone in a
briefcase back in the '70s. He was an early adapter to the
Internet, accessing bulletin board services via services like
Prodigy and Compuserve, which now seem utterly quaint. And now he's
using new technology to preserve traditional folk songs. In
addition to his work with Folk Den, he's recording an album of folk
tunes with old pals like Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Judy Collins;
he's traveling around the country recording the songs with his
laptop and a top-of-the-line microphone.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, sweet irony in the fact that he's using the
sophisticated technology to continue an ancient folk tradition. But
it makes total sense in a long career that has straddled so many
genres; back in the turbulent '60s, the Byrds merged folk with
British rock, later blending in jazz and country strains to create
a whole new form of music.
</P>
<P>
   But as the music evolved, so did the music industry. ``The
business strayed so far from the music I love,'' he said. But now
technology enables him to bring back the spirit that was lost as
music became corporate. ``It's a great release for my artistic
expression,'' he says of the songs he releases each month on Folk
Den. ``And it goes along with my feeling about the record business:
The only benefit I got from releasing albums was that people would
like them and come to my shows. So with the Internet, I figured,
`Why not do it for free?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, McGuinn already has a following, and he readily
admits that it is easier for established artists to get attention
online than unknown garage bands. He champions the technology, but
he is realistic about its ability to explode the power system in
the music industry. If an artist gets ``discovered'' online, for
instance, they're still likely to sign a record contract and get
sucked up by the system. ``If they want to be on Leno and
Letterman, they have to be with the big guys,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And McGuinn himself has figured out a way to straddle both
worlds. In March, he performed at the South by Southwest Music
Festival in Austin; Sony promoted the show as part of its marketing
of new Byrds reissues. McGuinn also sat on a technology panel,
where he sang the praises of MP3.com, which was sued by the major
labels, including Sony.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he isn't doing is touring in shows for aging boomers.
``I don't want to be an oldie rock artist,'' he said. ``I prefer to
perform solo as a folk singer.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who once changed his middle name from Joseph to Roger
because an Indonesian guru told him it would ``vibrate better with
the universe'' doesn't dwell on his legendary past. At the same
time, he doesn't pretend that the digital distribution of music is
a revolution that's going to bring about sweeping social change.
``It's a novelty,'' he said. ``It's like swallowing goldfish or
getting a bunch of people into a telephone booth. Kids always need
to do something different: We had long hair and bell-bottoms.''
</P>
<P>
   They also had sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. ``When I was in the
Byrds and we were part of the counterculture, I never would have
envisioned myself in a government room,'' he said. But there he
was, capturing the attention of Hatch, the family-values Republican
who chided representatives for the recording industry at the
hearing. Times change. ``I was surprised by Hatch and his knowledge
of the issue,'' said McGuinn. ``I actually thought he was pretty
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same day McGuinn was testifying on Capitol Hill, a new
coalition called Artists Against Piracy placed full-page ads in
several newspapers, including the Washington Post. (Natch.) The ad,
signed by artists ranging from Aimee Mann to Vince Gill, supported
Metallica and Dr. Dre in their lawsuits against Napster and asked
that artists' rights be respected online.
</P>
<P>
   So who do you think is funding this new organization? Think
really hard. Did you say the Recording Industry Association of
America, which represents the major labels? Two points!
</P>
<P>
   The ads didn't note that little fact. The organization, which
was founded by Los Angeles singer-songwriter Noah Stone, is
applying for nonprofit status; when it becomes a nonprofit, it will
have to divulge its source of income. But for now, all Stone will
say is that it received a ``little chunk of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of independent artists launched a lobbying
group called the Coalition for the Future of Music, which aims to
speak up for the rights of artists without aligning itself with
big-business interests like the RIAA. Its cofounder, activist and
musician Jenny Toomey, says she is perfectly happy that the other
group is conducting a high-profile awareness campaign. Stone,
however, thinks there is room for only one group. ``The more groups
we have, the more confused this gets,'' he says, adding that he
hopes the two groups can join forces. As for Toomey, she won't take
money from the industry. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Just curious. Which group do you think McGuinn would join?

<P>
   AUSTIN _ As Vice President Al Gore has struggled this spring and
summer to regain his political stride and as Governor George W.
Bush of Texas has mostly cruised above the fray, one of the settled
principles of American presidential politics has been put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In times of peace and prosperity, history dictates that the
party holding the White House stands to win the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the national party conventions, state-by-state
polling shows the vice president barely holding onto states that
had been expected to be firmly in the Democratic column.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the edge in most of the key battleground states,
including Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Gore,
meanwhile, is making a strong run at Florida, polls suggest,
pulling essentially even in a state where Bush's brother is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a tally of electoral college votes from states where Bush
leads in the polls, would appear to give him more than enough to
win the election if it were being held today, although national
surveys put Bush's lead at just 2 to 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have struggled to explain the electoral trend in the
face of the enduring prosperity of the Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Democrats, the downside of the new economy is the
perception that it's largely independent of the government,'' said
John J. Pitney Jr., a government professor at Claremont McKenna
College in California.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that while Clinton might gain some credit for the
economic boom, the same glow may not extend to his vice president.
And some point to data data suggesting that the American people do
not feel as secure and optimistic about the economy as jobs and
income data suggest they should.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates have responded to the climate by taking
radically different strategic approaches to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials say the race is all about leadership, with issues
almost, but not quite, an afterthought. Gore has sought to take
credit for the economic bloom, and to tar Bush as economically
unsound. And, more generally, advisers to Gore say the issues _
prescription drugs, health care and the right to sue your HMO _ are
paramount, and that a meaningful measure of leadership flows from
the positions a candidate takes and his ability to make his policy
dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush has taken a leisurely approach, with
one public event and one message a day. He avoids reading newspaper
articles about himself or the campaign to stay focused, he says. He
talks about his opponent infrequently and, even then, indirectly.
Finally, he keeps his speeches short and seems annoyed when others
talk at length.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion of foster care and adoption last week in
Michigan, a former lieutenant governor, Connie Binsfeld,
enthusiastically told the governor she could talk about the subject
``for two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he did not think he could listen for that long, then
cut her off, moving the forum along.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, has maintained a frenetic pace, moving
from one issue to another as he skips from state to state. For the
vice president, who relishes full immersion in policy detail, it
was hardly out of the ordinary that a recent question-and-answer
session with undecided voters in Saginaw went on for 3 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   As for the press, Gore keeps close tabs on what is said and
written about him. A central aspect of his campaign is to attack
Bush for his positions and ``the mess in Texas,'' as he puts it,
and to promote his own plan for ``progress and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Long confronted by less-than-stellar polling numbers _ though
surveys this week suggested the race was essentially tied _
officials in the Gore campaign argue that the run of poll numbers
which have found him trailing were misleading, that the methodology
in many of the polls was suspect, and that Bush's large lead in
Texas skews many national surveys.
</P>
<P>
   With conventions and debates still to come, voters basking in
the sizzling economy have yet to focus on the election, said Tad
Devine, the political consultant largely in charge of the Gore
campaign's day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's a lot of misunderstanding, rather than
understanding, of the race out there,'' Devine said. ``It's a close
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides also voice a belief that voters overwhelmingly share
the vice president's _ not Bush's positions on education, health
care, the environment and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those issues are good for Gore,'' said Donnie Fowler, the
national field director. ``Voters generally trust Democrats on
education more than Republicans. They generally trust Democrats
more on health care than Republicans. And credit for the economy,
whether right or wrong, goes to the incumbent party in the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Bush campaign, there is laughter for their
opponents' view of the situation, and considerable confidence about
the governor's performance and position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, we are up, no question about it,'' said Mark
McKinnon, Bush's advertising consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning!'' said Ron Kaufman, an informal adviser who
served as former President Bush's White House political director.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats are questioning the fitness of the Gore
campaign in the face of the Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a gut level I do have some concerns,'' a Democratic
official said. ``There seems to be a heavy dose of action, reaction
and overreaction on the part of the campaign that should have been
able to settle on a message and a plan long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Two national surveys conducted recently by Public Opinion
Strategies found that 72 percent of Republicans say they will
definitely vote for Bush, compared with 49 percent of Democrats who
say they will definitely vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, 11 percent of voters who cast ballots for
President Clinton in 1996 said they would not vote for Gore in
2000, according to a Republican pollster, Bill McInturff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said he's a weak leader,'' McInturff said. ``They said
he's too weak to be president. And second, they are fed up with
Bill Clinton and what went on in the White House and they want to
have a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Bush campaign eager to upend the ``peace and
prosperity'' political axiom, both sides are vigorously picking
through examples to explain the current state of the race.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gore campaign, it's the 1988 election between then-Vice
President George Bush and Massachusetts Governor Michael S.
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the vice president was derided as a wimp and sitting
low in the polls. Nevertheless, he went on to trounce Dukakis on
election day.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, however, points out that during the 1988
election, most people said his father didn't stand a chance because
the previous time a sitting vice president succeeded his boss in an
election was in 1832, when Martin Van Buren followed Andrew
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard much about the Van Buren factor in this
election, have you? That's because every race is different and
every race defies history,'' Bush said. ``Of course they're trying
to say that. But George H.W. and Al Gore are not the same people,
and George W. and Michael Dukakis are not the same people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign manager, Karl Rove, says that the 1988 example
is flawed for another reason. At this point in the election cycle,
prior to the first convention in mid July, he said Vice President
Bush had already surpassed Dukakis in the polls. Actually,
Dukakis's lead had begun to shrink, but he was still ahead of the
vice president, according to news reports from that period.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both sides are aware that campaigns frequently
resemble roller coasters when it comes to polling data.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist, pointed to the past once
again: ``Historically, there is absolutely no relationship between
how the campaign is in June and July and what happens in
November.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Kaufman remembers President Bush's high approval
ratings from the Persian Gulf War that evaporated into the low
numbers of the hard economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know it's a long way from here to there,'' Kaufman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Political advisers in both campaigns do agree on one thing _
that the race will inevitably tighten by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist,
said: ``When you have peace and prosperity, even a bad candidate
can plan on doing reasonably well.''

 BMW'S Z3 IS A VETERAN AMONG RISING TIDE OF DROP-TOPS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL   FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time flies here in the world of autos.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the midst of a resurgence of drop-top sports cars,
touched off by Mazda's Miata well over a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Challengers followed in a trickle and then a torrent, but it
seems hard to believe the BMW Z3 is already a veteran bobbing on
that flood.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are with a 2000 Z3 2.3 roadster. The 2.3 (six cylinders,
2.5 liters) is not as powerful as the 2.8- and 3.2-liter versions _
a docile pup compared to the M Coupe _ but snappy nonetheless. It
is a far superior engine to the 1.9-liter, four-cylinder it
replaces. And, if you can do without the leather package, this is a
quality buy at $31,000. You can do a lot worse than this at that
price.
</P>
<P>
   The Z3 is a better-looking car than it was at introduction. It
still has the jutting-bully's-chin look up front, muscular and long
and humped. But the rear has been redesigned, given a rise and
flare that is far more pleasing to the eye than the chopped, low
box of the original.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the car you take for a comparison test if you are
considering a Porsche Boxster or a Honda S2000. If you want to get
into that league, you'll need the 3.2-liter for fair comparison.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're considering a Toyota MR2, Mazda Miata, or
Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, then stack this up against them. It may
cost a bit more but may be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's as quick as most people want to travel.
</P>
<P>
   From start to 80 miles per hour is a sudden rush accompanied by
the subdued burble of the exhaust. Downshift from fifth to fourth
on the highway and you'll have at your disposal all the torque you
need for quick passing. It moves through traffic with precision.
</P>
<P>
   Take it on twisting back roads and you really get to play. Set
your inside front wheel on any curved line you want to follow and
it will stick to that line just as the M coupe performed _ as if
riding a rail.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.3 did not have the power of the M3 coupe I tested a year
ago, so it is hard to compare the body stiffness of the hardtop
with this roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say that, with this engine, body twist was negligent
and even the tightest turns did not seem to torque the body of the
roadster. Only on sudden bumps at higher speeds _ such as a joint
in the highway _ did I feel a shudder that might be attributed to
the 2.3 being a convertible.
</P>
<P>
   As for the five-speed manual transmission, the 2.3 used it all
and used it well. Dropping into third to set a course through a
corner gave a great sense of touch to the steering. Popping up into
fifth after passing someone and then moving back into the travel
lane was a smooth, gliding exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this, of course, can be attributed to the 2.3's Dynamic
Stability Control. If its control unit senses one of the rear drive
wheels spinning faster than the other, it cuts motor torque and
gently applies the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn this option off and you move back a couple of decades to
when you could take a light, rear-wheel-drive car with some power
under the hood and induce oversteer with a quick jab at the gas
pedal. And that, too, can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   Be assured, however, that this is not a car you'd want to rely
on for ski trips to the north in winter, or even for your main mode
of transportation through snowy months.
</P>
<P>
   It sits too low to the ground and DSC in a rear-wheel-drive car,
I have learned, does not help much when you need to get up a snowy
slope or climb an icy patch. One Mercedes I tested, in fact, worked
better with its stability control system turned off.
</P>
<P>
   So picture this more as a nine-months-a-year car _ a car you
literally wear as you drive it. The fit is that tight once you are
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Its leather seats are slung low and wrap your thighs and
shoulders in support. Two long pockets up front give plenty of room
for the legs, though someone whose legs would fill those pockets
might find his or her head rubbing the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, it remains a bit retro _ silver trim to gauges,
an analog clock at center dash.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space inside is virtually nonexistent with shallow bins
on each door, and a center console with two cupholders and a
narrow, shallow bin that will hold a cellphone or a pair of
sunglasses, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   For trips, the trunk would hold two pieces of luggage of airline
carry-on size, so you would need to pack carefully. From my
experience, you'd expect to get about 20 miles per gallon on your
trip and you'd have to put up with louder than normal wind noise
from the closed convertible top.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the more expensive sports cars at the lower end
of the spectrum, but it is not so expensive that folks looking at
the others should not consider it. Its quality, performance, and
handling are pure BMW and the few extra dollars may well be worth
it to you.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The mesh net zipped between and behind the seats. It does a
great job of cutting airflow from the rear with the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Operation of the convertible top. The button for the optional
automatic top is located at the back of the console and is hard to
find. When you do find it, you have to first unlatch the roof,
depress that button, hold a foot on the brake, and manually raise
the roof's first section a few inches before the automatic kicks
in. Way too complicated.

ALL PLANTS AND NO FUN? TRY THIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people take gardening too seriously. We're afraid of
failure or wedded to a formula. We dig and we sweat and we worry
about the deer eating our shrubs or the borers killing our squash,
but most of all, we fret about how things look.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs we're lightening up, however. Garden catalogs
suddenly are full of funny little ornaments and sculptures, and
gardeners themselves are introducing brightly painted old furniture
and even silly signposts to garden plots once devoted purely to
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep adding more whimsical stuff to the catalog,'' says
Gardener's Supply spokeswoman Maree Gaetani. ``People have made
their gardens and they've reached the stage where they need to
decorate them. And they're willing to take more risks than they are
with interior decor. Also, people who have kids want their gardens
to be fun, child-friendly places. A little whimsy goes a long way
toward getting kids excited about gardening.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an avalanche of humorous garden ornaments for sale these
days, however, writer Tovah Martin and photographer Richard Brown,
creators of the new book ``Garden Whimsy'' (Houghton Mifflin),
believe true whimsy cannot be mass produced.
</P>
<P>
   There is some high-end whimsy in their book, including unique
metal sculptures of a lumbering tortoise and a quartet of giant
frogs playing Dixieland at Les Quatre Vents, the Quebec estate of
Garden Conservancy founder Frank Cabot. There's also the ``ultimate
gazing ball,'' an 8-foot silver sphere that film director Rick
Levine made from polished metal for his garden in Kent, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Martin and Brown feature creatively used found
objects, like the scarecrow on the cover, made from a classical
bust set on a stool in a Vermont vegetable garden, garbed in his
wife's pink chiffon prom dress. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Flamingos are out &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Whimsy can be hard to do because humor is hard to do,'' said
Martin. ``Nothing funny is going to last, and when it stops being
funny to you, it's time for it to go. I wanted to put photos of
lawn flamingos in the book, and Richard said we were too late. And
he was right. They're over. If it's been done before, don't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain colors seem to lend instant whimsy, and they're not the
muted greens dominating Martha Stewart's line of exterior paints
for garden structures. The palette of garden gaiety tends to be
loud, fully saturated, and seldom found in the plant kingdom.
Flamingos may be out, but flamingo pink is in for garden
accessories, as are purple, chartreuse, scarlet, terra cotta, burnt
orange, and fuchsia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is with me and hot pink,'' says Michelle
Billings, who has used the color for lawn chairs and trellises in
her Ely, Vt., garden, where she sells bits of architectural debris
as well as flowers for garden ornamentation. Martin's neighbor
Peter Wooster bought a 1955 pickup truck because he fell in love
with its bright gold ``Velveeta'' hue. He now parks it near the day
lilies where it becomes part of his Roxbury, Conn., garden's color
theme. In New Hampshire, Alice Moir drenches birdhouses and benches
with royal blue paint to add that hard-to-grow color to her garden.
</P>
<P>
   Innovators are finding that structures painted such high
spirited hues help solve a problem well known to lovers of outdoor
color: Most gardens are mostly green most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Robert Dash stimulated the growing interest in bravado
paint jobs at Madoo, his celebrated Long Island garden. Since the
late 1960s, he has been experimenting with painting doors, benches,
gates, arbors, and fences with colors that would make eyeballs
wince indoors, but that can be quite effective outdoors as framing
devices for the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Dash changes his tableaux throughout the year. As he relates in
his new book, ``Notes From Madoo; Making a Garden in the
Hamptons,'' one curved bedroom door opening to a long path gets
repainted according to the shades of the season: yellow in spring
when leaves are bright and new, dark blue as they mature, orange as
they detonate in autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Another artist who has influenced the whimsy trend is beloved
children's book illustrator Tasha Tudor, whose garden was
documented in the best-selling ``Tasha Tudor's Garden'' by Martin
and Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never used things as they were supposed to be used,'' says
Martin. ``For instance, she'd hang old farm implements in such a
way as to frame the view from a porch. That's part of the essence
of whimsy. Most of this stuff is already broken in and on its fifth
life.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wacky signs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moir recycled an outhouse door (with the traditional half-moon
cutout) as a garden gate, says Martin, ``and my garden has old
industrial wheels in it as points of winter interest, and no one
can figure out what they were used for in their first life. These
are not things you're taking out insurance on.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin also likes wacky signs, such as the ones Kit and Marty
Sagendorf use to punctuate their property in Bridgewater, Conn. One
entry sports a sign advising ``Gratuities Appreciated,'' while
Qanother admonishes, ``Please Use Small Gate'' when, in fact, there
is no small gate. Such practical jokes come naturally to Kit, a
former cartoonist for Cosmopolitan magazine, and Marty, a physicist
whose father drew the comic strip ``Popeye.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's favorite, however, is the Sagendorfs' mock signpost to
the weeds in their garden, with arrows pointing toward ``Ground
Elder,'' ``Nettles,'' and the ominous ``Something Very Nasty
Indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The line between kitsch and whimsy is flimsy, warns Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your yard looks like a miniature golf course, you've gone
over the top,'' she says. ``But the whole point is not to worry
what others think and to have fun.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOMPSON, Conn. _ ``I think I'm a professional,'' Phoebe-Lou
Adams says. ``Give me the job, promise me the pay, and I will do it
as best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   For 55 years, Adams has practiced her professionalism at The
Atlantic Monthly, most visibly as the longtime proprietress of the
magazine's Brief Reviews column. The August column is her last: At
81, she's retiring.
</P>
<P>
   They just don't make careers like Adams's anymore _ or, for that
matter, people. ``There's just nobody else like her,'' says
Atlantic editor emeritus William Whitworth. ``She's just so smart
and sophisticated and witty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a complete sense of style,'' adds Atlantic poetry
editor Peter Davison, who likens Adams to Dorothy Parker and the
English novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett. ``She's always, as it were,
in position. She's always on the qui vive.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman taken on her own terms or not at all, Adams is in
appearance elegant, in manner superior, in expression tart. The
model she proposes for magazine journalism _ ``The idea is to get
to the point and don't fool around. Make it as amusing and
interesting as possible and, also, don't blow'' _ would seem to
double as a code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Adams walks a little gingerly, the result of a recent
``collision with a friend's bathtub,'' as she puts it. Otherwise,
she wears her eight decades lightly. Her sparkling eyes and
dancing, slightly devilish brows could belong to one much younger.
She gave up salmon fishing only a little while ago, and her daily
ration of 1 1/2 packs of More Menthols she intends to give up not
at all.
</P>
<P>
   (When a visitor suggests Adams owes her distinctive contralto to
tobacco, she instead credits high school theatricals. ``We were
doing `Midsummer Night's Dream.' I had a helluva fine time playing
Bottom, but shouting through that donkey's head did it to my
voice.'')
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is likely to confuse Adams with a superannuated
Tina Brown. She hails from an almost-vanished world and makes no
bones about it: a world of broad A's (it was a bahth-tub Adams
collided with) and ironclad discretion. When mention is made of her
18-year marriage to Edward Weeks, the editor of the Atlantic from
1938 to 1966, Adams gives a curt nod and says, ``That's nobody's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   By the account of others and on the evidence of the many
portraits of Weeks and memorabilia on display in Adams's house, it
was a deeply happy union for both parties, ended by his death in
1989. Nor was it in any way blemished by scandal (other than the
fact Weeks fell out of their canoe the first time they took it
fishing). She was single, he a widower, and, in Davison's words,
``it was very much a family affair.'' But in Phoebe-Lou Adams's
world some things aren't others' business, and marriage is one of
them, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   It's the world of a Connecticut Yankee, as rectitudinous as that
of a Massachusetts Yankee, but perhaps harder-headed. Asked to
account for the difference, Adams says, ``I suppose what's behind
it is the fact Connecticut split off from Massachusetts because the
people didn't like the way things were done in Massachusetts. . . .
There's a sort of quiet cantankerousness, I think you might call
it, in Connecticut. Also, Massachusetts people are all such lousy
drivers.'' (On the last score, Adams speaks from experience: For 30
years, she made the 75-minute drive from Thompson to Boston, then
back again, each workday.)
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a machine-tool designer, came from around Thompson.
But it was near Hartford that he and his wife, another Connecticut
native, raised Adams and her sister (now deceased), in Warehouse
Point _ ``a farming town with a couple of gin mills,'' as she
fondly describes it.
</P>
<P>
   Adams attended a nearby private school, Chafee School (now
Loomis Chafee), and then majored in English at Radcliffe. Her first
job after graduation was running the library at a private mental
asylum in Hartford. ``We had to call the inmates `guests,' '' she
recalls. ``The place ran pretty heavily to very nice people who
were in there being dried out.'' In a preview of things to come,
her duties included writing book reviews for the asylum newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Adams entered journalism in 1942, at The Hartford Courant, where
she spent three years as the self-described ``stupidest cub
reporter'' in the newsroom. She got to the Atlantic the same way
she got her low voice, via Chafee. A former headmistress had gone
on to become Weeks's secretary (a job change that speaks volumes
about the status back then of both women in general and that
magazine in particular). When the position of managing editor was
created, an assistant was needed. The former headmistress thought
of one of her alums.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd never had a managing editor before,'' Adams explains,
``and I'd never assisted an editor, so we had a fine time figuring
out what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To Adams, the magazine whose staff she joined so long ago
doesn't differ all that much from the one whose staff she has just
departed. The Atlantic ``has changed very little,'' she says. ``It
is the world that has changed: new interests, new questions, more
relaxed tastes in some ways, and a great deal more niggling in
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Her view of the magazine mirrors her view of its home city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston? More tall buildings, more new buildings. Businesses
have shifted around, but the general tone of the place, so far as I
can see, hasn't changed. When I went to Radcliffe, they had
orientation for new students. We were told if you go shopping in
Boston you will get better service if you wear gloves and a hat.
Also, we were told never, on any account, go into Boston Common
alone after dark. Now that hasn't changed! I think it's always been
true: Even in the early days you could probably stumble over a
cow.''
</P>
<P>
   While reviewing has been Adams's best-known activity at the
magazine, her other duties have been extensive. She wrote numerous
travel pieces (a collection was published in 1964, ``A Rough Map of
Greece''). She did a stint as poetry editor (Dylan Thomas was among
the writers whose work she published). Weeks sent her to Havana
once to solicit stories from Hemingway (Adams got him to offer
two).
</P>
<P>
   One of her more unexpected editorial moments came when she
started to read a cover letter from a then-unknown writer
accompanying a short story he'd sent the magazine. ``I intend to _
I will _ become the greatest living American writer of the 20th
century. If you don't publish this story you will live to regret
it.'' Adams rolls her eyes at the memory. ``That's not the way to
win over an editor. Well, I started to read it and, somewhat to my
annoyance, it turned out to be a very fine story and we published
it. Who was he? James Jones, who went on to publish `From Here to
Eternity' and other fine stuff, though he didn't live up to his own
billing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1952 that Adams began writing her brief reviews, five
to 10 per issue, and hasn't missed a month since. Whitworth marvels
at her achievement. ``I don't think many people realize how
difficult it is to write a really short review _ it's sometimes
just two or three sentences _ that manages to be funny and
informative and authoritative. It's a very difficult thing to pull
off, and she does it over and over and has for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams has passed judgment on some 4,000 books _ and that's not
counting all the ones ``I've half-read and ditched.'' Of the former
number, Adams says only a few loom large in memory: Kazantzakis's
``Zorba the Greek,'' Garcia Marquez's ``One Hundred Years of
Solitude,'' Borges's ``Ficciones,'' E. Annie Proulx's ``Accordion
Crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Without any more column deadlines, Adams intends to concentrate
on her garden, her watercolors, and her housemate, a ``surly,
inhospitable'' brindle cat named Spooky. Adams is in no hurry to
catch up on her reading. ``There are things I've never read that
I'd like to have a go at,'' she admits, ``but I have no plans. My
uncle had a full set of the works of Trollope. He had never read a
word of Trollope, and he always accounted for it by saying he was
saving Trollope for his old age. Lucky man, he never lived to
tackle Trollope.''

ROBERTSON STEPHENS BUY A WINNER FOR FLEETBOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN-SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It certainly seemed like a lot of dough at the time.
</P>
<P>
   You could hear and read the grumbling everywhere, including this
space, when BankBoston Corp. agreed to shell out $800 million for
high-tech investment banking firm Robertson Stephens in 1998. That
was nearly 50 percent more than what seller BankAmerica Corp. paid
for the same San Francisco firm just a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Dumb deal? At this point, it's proven to be anything but.
Robertson Stephens has already earned nearly $250 million for its
corporate parent, now FleetBoston Financial, and clearly exceeded
business expecations at the time of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in retrospect, the acquisition has contributed
greatly and the early criticism about the price being paid was
wrong,'' said analyst Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   The price itself is the subject of much corporate massaging.
FleetBoston reports that tax benefits and some staggered payments
reduce the real expense to $560 million. So far, Robertson Stephens
has already returned more than 44 percent on that sum.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions of investment banking firms, which underwrite
intial public offerings and advise clients on mergrers, by big
commercial banking companies like FleetBoston, were in vogue at the
time of the Robertson Stephens purchase.
</P>
<P>
   So far it appears to be one of the best of the bunch, though
Chase Manhattan Corp.'s acquisition of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist is
considered still too fresh for a fair comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts will tell you BankBoston picked a solid company and
managed tricky cultural issues well, at least so far. And then
there's the matter of timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You buy a tech investment boutique just in front of the
biggest tech IPO boom in history,'' said Tom Theurkauf of Keefe,
Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``It doesn't hurt to be a little lucky, too.''
</P>
<P>
   How does luck translate into actual business? At the time of the
purchase FleetBoston executives told analysts it forecast a
break-even year in 1999 based on revenues of $480 million. But
Robertson Stephens earned $99 million on revenues of $932 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were buying a good franchise and good people,
but we did not anticipate we'd have this incredible windfall with
their position in the market,'' said Charles Gifford, the
FleetBoston president who was running BankBoston at the time of the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The first two quarters of this year have shown investors how the
Internet-heavy investment business at Robertson Stephens would
perform in deleriously good times and the darkest of the bad times.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens earned $122 million in the first quarter of
this year, more than all the company's profits of the previous
year, while technology stocks soared even higher and new issues
were hitting the market at a furious pace.
</P>
<P>
   All that action dried up for the next three months and the
company felt the pinch, but still earned $28 million on $293
million of revenues. Robertson Stephens fell down the quarter by
quarter rankings of most active investment bankers, but actual
profitability under dismal market conditions was just slightly
below earnings from the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company's financial performance held up largely because it
gets less of its business from pure investment banking than you
might think.
</P>
<P>
   Just 36 percent of revenues are generated by corporate finance
work. Another 39 percent comes from brokerage activity and the rest
is produced from a list of other services led by merger and
acquisition advisory work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been growing a lot of different products and geographies
at the same time,'' said Robertson Stephens chief Robert Emery.
</P>
<P>
   One big growth area: the company's European operations, which
were launched a few years ago and will account for about $200
million of revenue this year, by Emery's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens also made money by venturing further into the
risky end of high-tech stocks than many other firms. When Divine
InterVentures was advised to delay its IPO plans by Credit Suisse
First Boston, the company fired its bankers and replaced them with
Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   The stock offering hit the market July 12, led by Robertson
Stephens, but had been reduced by 40 percent. It was the investment
banking firm's first IPO since April.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the key for FleetBoston to continue to get the
most of its Robertson Stephens investment is to manage across two
drastically different corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said FleetBoston wants Robertson Stephens to broaden its
areas of expertise to include more industries in the future.
``Sometimes their priorities don't mesh with what we think customer
priorities need to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emery said his investment bankers have done that when it made
sense, extending into health care, real estate and other areas. ``I
would say we're working where it makes the most sense for our
clients and shareholders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making so much money has a way of smoothing over the rough
spots.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BARAMULLA, India _ At the entrance to a breathtaking green vale
that has been the backdrop for countless Indian romance films, a
handpainted sign extends a grandiose welcome: ``From here begins
the Happy Valley, where the World ends and Paradise begins.''
</P>
<P>
   With miles of stately poplars, rolling fields of saffron, and
acres of apple orchards, this does look like a paradise. But for
the past 11 years, India's Jammu and Kashmir state has been
anything but happy.
</P>
<P>
   A violent uprising has killed tens of thousands of Kashmir's
people and claims more lives almost daily. It is a conflict that
the world has seen almost exclusively through the eyes of India and
Pakistan, two nuclear-armed enemies fighting over a strategic swath
of land that straddles their border.
</P>
<P>
   Silenced in the slaughter have been the voice and aspirations of
the Kashmiri people.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years, many in India's only Muslim-majority state have
longed for union with the neighboring Islamic state of Pakistan.
But a decade of death and destruction, wrought by a
Pakistan-supported insurgency, and by Indian forces' harsh efforts
to suppress it, has changed all that. Most Kashmiris are now
alienated from both masters in New Delhi and self-proclaimed
saviors in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Ask almost anyone in the valley how they want to resolve the
53-year tug-of-war over their status _ a struggle that has
intensified since 1989 _ and the answer is the same: to go it
alone. But the central tragedy of the oldest continuous battle in
South Asia is that despite two wars, decades of daily cross-border
gunfire, and even the specter of nuclear armageddon, there is scant
chance that either power will grant the independence that the
majority of Muslim Kashmiris want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kashmir is very beautiful, but we have bad luck. All this
killing and no tourism since 1989,'' said Nisar Ahmad Wani, 43, who
used to drive tourists for a living back in the days when they
came. ``We neither want India nor Pakistan as our rulers, only a
free Kashmir. Everybody here thinks this way, but nobody's
listening to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest example was this month, when India rejected an
autonomy proposal passed by Kashmir's parliament. True, few
Kashmiris were enthusiastic about the plan, which would have
restored to Kashmir its own flag, prime minister, and fiscal
powers, but which would have kept it a part of India. Even so, the
lightning-fast dismissal of the plan reinforced the view that New
Delhi is not serious about resolving a crisis that has made life
miserable for 8.3 million residents of this state.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of autonomy proves that India's leaders are ``not
sincere about solving the Kashmir issue,'' said S. M. Afzal Qadri,
associate professor of law at Kashmir University. ``Nobody is
asking what we want!''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pakistan, which was founded as a religious state, modern
India took form as a secular nation espousing coexistence among its
various religious traditions. So it is not surprising that India is
determined to hold onto its only Muslim-majority state, in part to
show that Muslims can live peacefully in a predominantly Hindu
nation. Moreover, granting autonomy to Kashmir would lend
ammunition to secessionists in the northeast and disgruntled
minorities who want more power in other regions.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir's plight has parallels elsewhere, of course. For
centuries, European empires took turns conquering and dividing up
strategically located Poland, with no regard for the Poles' wishes.
But Kashmiris feel they are not only victims of greedy powers, but
also the stage on which those rivals are fighting an ideological
battle between theocracy and secular democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of New Delhi only cares about Kashmir, not
about Kashmiris,'' said Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, Kashmir's top Muslim
cleric and former chairman of the leading organization of
separatists. ``We know that militarily we cannot win against India.
But why hasn't India been able to win over Kashmiris in the last 52
years?''
</P>
<P>
   When the Indian subcontinent was partitioned in 1947 as colonial
Britain departed, Kashmir's Hindu ruler chose at first to remain
independent in deference to his Muslim majority population. Then
Pakistan invaded, and he hastily joined India for protection. India
promised to hold a plebiscite to let Kashmiris decide their future
_ but only after Pakistan withdrew its troops. Neither has ever
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Today, India controls 45 percent of the original territory,
Pakistan one-third, and China the rest, and the volatile cease-fire
line has been the fault line for countless land grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmiris who live on the Pakistan side of the line proclaim
solidarity with those on the Indian side fighting for a unified,
free Kashmir. When Pakistani officials are within earshot, they
define freedom as union with Pakistan. Privately, it is often
another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to sacrifice all my children for the freedom of
Kashmir. We want it to be free from India,'' said Answar Bibi, 25,
who fled a village at the Pakistani border to a refugee camp far
from cross-border shelling. ``But,'' she confided, ``if Kashmir
became an independent state, we'd be more happy.''
</P>
<P>
   When outsiders say an independent Kashmir is economically or
politically untenable, Farooq, the separatist leader, counters that
if the whole of Jammu and Kashmir gained independence, it would be
larger than 80 states in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the debate is academic. And the bloody uprising
rages on, tearing apart the Himalayan region glorified by
generations of writers.
</P>
<P>
   As they have for over 100 years on the lake at the center of
Kashmir's summer capital of Srinagar, gondoliers peddling rides and
handicrafts glide past graceful wooden houseboats, hoping to spot a
customer ripe for a sale. But today, the waters of Dal Lake are
eerily still, houseboats sit empty, and visitors are scarce. With
them has fled the money that was the lifeblood of the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unofficial dusk-till-dawn curfew, and men, women,
and children are wise to abide by it. After a few stunning suicide
attacks on Indian Army posts this year, hyper-alert, unsmiling
soldiers comb any stray vehicle after dark, and a misplaced glance
can land a driver in custody.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of death and detentions has touched almost every
family. Nearly everyone has lost a relative or an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find any Kashmiri who will frankly praise India or
Pakistan, because both of them have made us suffer so much for
their vested interests,'' said Bilal Ahmad Bhat, a 25-year-old
professional. ``We had achieved a lot economically in the 10 years
before, but it's gone. Everywhere it's just destruction,'' he said,
pointing to a government mulberry orchard and silk factory that the
Indian army destroyed to chase out militants.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian Army spokesman, Colonel R. E. Williams, said 29,000
civilians have lost their lives in the 11-year struggle. Kashmir's
chief minister, Farooq Abdullah, along with human rights and
separatist groups, say 70,000 have died. Either way, the uprising
is no longer popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both the same _ the military and the militants. They
don't spare anyone,'' said Mohammad Ashraf, who is 23 and jobless,
like so many youth affected by the economic paralysis. ``In the
beginning, everyone favored the militancy. Then they started
killing innocent people, and we got fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some trace the insurgency to New Delhi's history of imposing
puppet governments and rigging elections. ``If India had given
democracy a chance in Kashmir, Kashmiris would hever have thought
of Pakistan, would never have supported the militancy,'' said Fayez
Bukhari, deputy editor of the Kashmir Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, campaign workers for the opposition party the Muslim
United Front were arrested and tortured. Many of those youths
crossed to Pakistan and were trained for the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, the first generation of Kashmiri idealists
was killed. Their shoes were filled by mercenaries from Afghanistan
and Pakistan, who transformed the struggle into a transnational
jihad, or holy war, alienating locals in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Rampant allegations of human rights abuses by the Indian
military have fed widespread hatred of India, but the uprising also
has fueled anger at Pakistan for supporting the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People once thought Pakistan was their savior, but now people
have seen the true face of Pakistan,'' said a community leader who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Pakistan trained militants who
then harassed local people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they'll fight till last drop of blood, but whose
blood? Our blood! We are the ones who are dying,'' Bukhari said.
``Pakistanis use the militants as a tool, India uses the state
government as a tool, and it is Kashmiris who are suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people just want peace,'' said Nazir Ahmad, 32, a former
guide. ``We are businessmen and we want business. We want good
sleep, good food, good house, a good job. That is freedom.''

APPLE PRESENTS A TASTY NEW CROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You've probably already seen it on TV _ that vaguely
shocking white cube with a supercomputer inside, the most gorgeous
desktop machine that Apple Computer Inc. has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   When Apple CEO Steve Jobs waved his arm, and the computer was
rolled out onto the stage at MacWorld Expo Wednesday, there was a
sound in thousands of throats _ a cheer, a gasp, a groan of lust,
all mingled.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else makes computers like this, and they waste their time
and money when they try. In the last couple of weeks, both Dell and
Compaq gave up on efforts to make stylish-looking home computers.
They realized that trying to beat Apple at that game is like trying
to out-talk Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs had much more to offer. There were small but necessary
improvements such as full-sized keyboards and a replacement for the
accursed hockey-puck mouse. There was the first dual-processor
Macintosh, allegedly twice as fast as the best Pentium PCs, and a
bunch of new iMacs with faster processors, bigger hard drives and
prettier colors.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jobs was done, you could feel the heat rolling off
the show floor in waves. Gone was the defensiveness and paranoia
sometimes found among Apple users. The people here are stoked with
a confidence I haven't seen at a Macworld in years. The decade of
exile is over, and Apple is once again in a position to take on the
world.
</P>
<P>
   They could be right. But if they are, it won't be due to all
this impressive hardware. As ever, Apple is being driven forward by
software. It's the code for these new Macs that could redefine
Apple's role in the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important product in the Apple stable, apart
from the iMac, is the iMovie video editing software. It turns the
iMac into the first plug-and-play desktop video system, letting
anybody create videos on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   I fell in love with the program last year, after trying the
$1,499 iMac DV Special Edition. But now iMovie has been upgraded
with a host of new features at no extra cost. Meanwhile, you now
can get an iMovie-equipped iMac for $999, about the price of a good
camcorder. So you're in the movie business for $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1980s, when Apple introduced the world to desktop
publishing, laser printers alone cost $3,000, and the same again
for a Mac. Businesses snapped them up, anyway. Apple should have
little trouble persuading people to pay a third as much to make
their own professional-grade movies.
</P>
<P>
   You could do this sort of thing on a high-end Pentium almost as
well as on a Mac. But Apple will dominate this market with its
powerful, intuitive iMovie software.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important to Apple's future is a far more basic piece
of software _ the operating system itself.
</P>
<P>
   For years now, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows has been better than
the Mac OS in several important respects. It's simpler to run
multiple programs on a Windows machine, for one thing. And when one
Windows program goes down, I usually don't have to reboot the
computer altogether. But one bad program usually sends my entire
iMac into limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's new operating system, Mac OS X, is supposed to fix all
this. It's running late; look for it early next year, the company
now says. But Apple has several machines here demonstrating the
beta, and it's hot. Running on one of the new dual-processor Power
Macs, OS X smoothly ran a couple of full-motion videos, some
real-time computer animations and an MP3 all at once _ the sort of
workload that would slow a typical PC to a crawl or crash it
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   I was even more impressed to see a terminal window where you
type text commands instead of clicking icons. And what commands!
Grep, top, kill _ all those old favorites from the arcane world of
Unix. Because the new Mac OS is built around a Unix kernel.
</P>
<P>
   Unix is vastly more stable than today's Mac OS, or Windows, for
that matter. Unix computers routinely run for years without a
reboot. If OS X lives up to that standard, Apple once again will
have a consumer operating system decisively better than
Microsoft's. I can imagine the billboards: ``It only crashes if you
drop it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Unix kernel means that a machine running OS X
will be able to run a great many Unix and Linux programs with
little or no modification. Mac users suddenly will have access to a
universe of new software. And with almost every major computer
company now writing Linux code, that universe is getting bigger by
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Cool hardware matters, of course. I learned that the hard way
when I foolishly predicted that the iMac would flop. I shook Jobs's
hand Wednesday and admitted I'd been wrong. He acknowledged the
apology with a winner's grace, saying the critics had just made his
people work all the harder.
</P>
<P>
   They're not just working on new ways to bend plastics, either.
The programmers are busy cramming value into Apple's multihued
polycarbonate, and their work will sell the next few million Macs.
Pretty packages and fast chips are all very well, but Apple is a
software company.

MEDICAL COMMUNITY SEES DOMESTIC MURDER CASES AS BIZARRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD AND RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One practiced plastic surgery in upscale Andover. The
others were affiliated with two renowned Harvard teaching
hospitals. Each, authorities say, ended his career as a healer in a
burst of deadly violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 48 hours, three Boston-area physicians have appeared
in court facing murder charges, a macabre coincidence that is
prompting some local doctors to ponder their special responsibility
to remain gentle under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dr. James Kartell of Andover received a five- to
eight-year prison term for shooting his wife's estranged lover to
death inside the Methuen hospital where Kartell had long practiced.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the defense continued to present its case in the
trial of Dr. Dirk K. Greineder, who headed the allergy department
at Brigham and Women's Hospital until he was accused last fall of
bludgeoning his wife to death in a Wellesley park.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Dr. Richard Sharpe, a Gloucester dermatologist
affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was arraigned
on charges that he shot his estranged wife to death Friday in her
Wenham home. Greineder and Sharpe have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the state Board of Medicine expressed concern over
the trio of murder cases. They suspended Sharpe's license Wednesday
_ as they did previously with Greineder's and Kartell's _ and said
they would redouble efforts to reach out to troubled physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Board's Physician Health and Compliance Unit works closely
with the (Massachusetts Medical Society) to ensure doctors in need
of support receive assistance and supervision,'' said board member
Dr. Peter Madras.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors interviewed stressed that they see the three killings
mainly as a bizarre coincidence, not as a sign that doctors have
somehow become prone to homicide. But they said that in the days
since the Sharpe case erupted, it has been a hot topic in some
medical circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any colleague that I've seen that I
haven't had the conversation, `Can you believe this?' '' said Dr.
Kenneth Arndt, who until March headed the dermatology department at
Beth Israel Deaconess and was Sharpe's adviser during his Harvard
residency. ``Every place I am, people know him or have known him.''
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, where Sharpe completed a
fellowship, several doctors said Wednesday that they were working
too hard to consider the issue, and some had not heard of the
murders. But one resident wearing blue scrubs, who refused to give
his name, said the news about Sharpe had disturbed him and made him
think about doctors' need to stay calm at the most stressful times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think a doctor could've found another way of
resolving the conflict, which is what we're taught all the time in
dealing with patients,'' the resident, in his mid-30s, said as he
grabbed a snack from a hot dog cart near the hospital. ``You'd like
to think we're . . . maybe better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen J. Bergman has considered himself ``a spokesman for
humane medical training'' since his 1978 novel ``The House of
God,'' based on his residency at Beth Israel, became a cult classic
among medical trainees. He said Wednesday that he pays special
attention to murders by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm especially interested in where we go wrong, how we lose
our humanity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two sensational murders that have become part of popular culture
involved doctors accused of killing their wives _ Sam H. Sheppard
and Jeffrey R. MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman said that while murder accusations are extreme cases,
the recent ones made him feel angry that the medical profession is
not better at quickly detecting emotional and drug abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe may have abused prescription drugs, his wife's lawyer has
said, and Greineder, authorities said, had turned to prostitutes
and online pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a self-centered, achievement-oriented, competitive
perspective, that can be rewarded in destructive ways by medical
schools and medical training programs and the medical profession,''
Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that all of the accused are more than 40 years old, he
said that self-centered view ``can take you only so far in your
life . . . and then something's gotta give.'' Bergman, a
psychiatrist, added that middle-aged doctors have a high incidence
of depression, substance abuse, and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Medical Association, doctors are more
likely to become the victims of homicide than to commit it. There
is no evidence that doctors are more or less prone to commit murder
than people in other professions, says the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, Dr. Virginia
T. Latham, found a different message in the killings: Domestic
violence affects all professions, including doctors, and
``transcends socioeconomic levels.'' She said the society is trying
to stress that point to its membership, and sent guidelines on
detecting domestic abuse to all doctors in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Sharpe had several businesses built around cosmetic
surgery such as liposuction and that Kartell was a plastic surgeon,
area plastic surgeons said that they are under particular pressure
because they work on people's faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like an entertainer who is on stage,'' said Dr.
Joel Feldman, a private-practice plastic surgeon in Cambridge.
``There is the sense that your work is all out there for people to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he added, that is no reason to kill.
</P>
<P>
   The changing nature of medicine with its stress on efficiency is
a burden on many doctors, said Dr. Richard Corlin, a Santa Monica,
Calif.-based gastroenterologist who is president-elect of the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you have in Boston,'' he said, ``is a tragic and
bizarre coincidence.''

EDGING MAKES GARDENS _ AND LIFE _ A LOT EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life, it seems, is one long chore of trimming the edges of our
lawns and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, one used a hand-held edger to trim the rampant
growth. It was hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Later came the power edger, and it was still hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many of us got smart and put in edging that divided
lawn from garden, to prevent weeds and other noxious plants from
invading the lawn, or going in the other direction to invade the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   The edging worked great, for a while, but eventually it worked
itself out of the ground or allowed those traveling plants to go
over or under it.
</P>
<P>
   There are many types of edging on the market today. An early
type was corrugated metal that came in a roll. Unroll it and tap it
into the ground with a mallet. This worked for a while, but
sometimes it would buckle as you hammered it into the ground, then
it rusted, and very often it worked itself out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Then came plastic edging, rolled and flexible like the metal
stuff, but it had to be buried in the ground; it could not be
driven with a mallet. It too tended to work itself out of the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   All of this proves that bricks, concrete blocks, patio blocks,
and other masonry products are the best way to go. And that
includes ceramic and terra cotta edging.
</P>
<P>
   All masonry products must be buried in the ground, so a trench
must be dug, the edging inserted and backfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Such masonry products will last forever, will generally stay in
the ground so your mower doesn't self-destruct on them, and are
deep enough to keep plants from tunneling under them into places
they are not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   And, most masonry items can be set so they are a bit above the
ground, forming a real border.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the masonry items are bricks. Be sure to use a hard
brick such as a paver. Common bricks and antique bricks, especially
the salmon-colored ones, will not last very long.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the bricks are soldier bricks. That's not a type,
but how they are put in the ground, like soldiers: vertical and at
attention. Eight inches long, they will stay put for years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, using bricks on their long ends takes a lot of bricks
to go just a few feet, but it is the best way. If you want to use
bricks horizontally, like a sleeping soldier, that is OK too, but
it is best to back them up with small stones. This combination is
decorative and makes a nice border/barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to use brick is at an angle, with a bit of the
long-lying brick sticking out of the ground, with its neighbor
leaning on it a little lower, like a falling line of dominoes. It
is like a row of drunken soldiers, all at a slant.
</P>
<P>
   Patio blocks also make good edging, and provide plenty of depth
(8 inches) to keep plants from sneaking under.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of pressure-treated wood, resistant to decay for
many years, wood edging is gaining in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a straight board in the ground, or a series of
connected boards that can be flexed along an wavy border.
</P>
<P>
   And, the plastics people never give up. Easy Gardener Inc. of
Waco, Tex., makes a lot of plastic edging, and one of its best
sellers is Emerald Edge, a green plastic barrier that comes in
sections 4 feet long and 5 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   It is driven with a mallet so that it is flush with the ground,
and virtually invisible. It is designed to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   It is flexible so it can be curled around trees and curved along
borders. Each section can be connected to its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular edging from Easy Gardener is its TerraCotta
Tiles, a set of four 9-inch-long polypropylene sections. Each
section looks like a row of five fat clay bricklets butted
together. The four sections, which can be connected to each other,
make an edging 3 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The sections also can be set along a curved line.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic edging, and a lot more, are sold at garden supply,
hardware, and chain stores. Or, call 800-EASY INC.

CREATING A CAR BOOMERS WANT TO BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John E. Keilly, manager of a Ford Motor Company project that is
studying what kinds of vehicles baby boomers will want in the
future, is not a man to pull punches, even when assessing his own
company. Hard and honest assessments come with the job.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising when he stands before members of the New
England Motor Press Association and says that, even as Ford has led
the pack in cutting-edge pickup truck sales, an ominous trend has
lurked in the other big part of what Ford sells: automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In studies, Keilly says, Ford kept hearing, ``Ford trucks are
great, but their cars suck.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Ford's Leading Edge Boomer Project with a background
that included trucks, vans, and SUVs _ all popular with boomers in
recent years in a way that cars have not been.
</P>
<P>
   His task now? Analyze what Ford calls ``The revolution in
maturity.'
</P>
<P>
   The ``leading boomers,'' he says, were born between 1947 and
1955. ``Trailing boomers'' followed through 1965. Selling cars to
these combined groups is not the same as selling to a homogenized,
monolithic block.
</P>
<P>
   There are boomers who are now ``empty-nesters'' _ children gone,
they may not need that minivan or big SUV any longer. Some boomers
are having children late in life. Others are caring for their aging
parents. Others still are what Keilly calls ``boomerang catchers''
whose children, and perhaps grandchildren, have moved back in with
them.
</P>
<P>
   How to sell to this group that makes up 30 percent of the US
population?
</P>
<P>
   Don't just think cars, says Keilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about trucks and cars,'' he says in seeming
contradiction. ``It's things like kitchens.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been a mantra at Ford ever since the day company head
Jac Nasser walked through the design department and told employees
he wanted them to know about American tastes in furniture, in
kitchen utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Keilly expands on this to say designers need to ask themselves
why the Big Bertha golf Club, for instance, sells so well. It is
all about an essence that goes beyond simply utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a product that everyone likes a little bit,''
he says. If you want to sell a car, it needs to attract a devoted
following.
</P>
<P>
   It is a phenomenon that appears to be enveloping the Ford Focus,
the compact yet roomy _ and inexpensive _ new model that is selling
not only to a targeted youth market but also to older buyers with
limited incomes.
</P>
<P>
   But as Keilly points out, a main reason boomers are
revolutionizing ``maturity'' is that they have a lot of money. And
women, in particular, he says, have more money than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor magazines appeal to this daring and enabled generation
in ads that feature adventure vacations. Many may be, he says,
closer to their sixties than The Sixties, but they have not lost
their taste for experimentation, for causes, for daring.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why Ford, as it seeks to boost its car lineup, can
offer as appealing and cutting edge _ though practical _ an auto as
the Focus, and at the same time have on the ramps its reborn
Thunderbird, coming back for the 2002 model year, or a souped-up
version of the Mustang, hot pony car of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the 2000 SVT Mustang Cobra R, with its muscular
looks, 385-horsepower engine, advanced suspension and top speed of
170 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   So as boomers age, and Ford works at one end of the spectrum to
attract new young buyers, it also must attempt to lure to its auto
lineup aging boomers, offering adventure and youthful appeal, even
while considering factors like vision, dexterity, mobility, and
weight.
</P>
<P>
   It is a balancing act, Keilly says, that means Ford designers
and marketers will have to look not just at meeting a budget in
producing a car, but also whether sticking to that budget will
affect customer devotion to any new model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you've met your cost objective'' (in developing
and selling a new model), he says, ``doesn't mean the car has
succeeded.''

AMERICAN PROSPECT REINVENTS ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the June 19 issue about ``Making Work Pay'' illustrates, The
American Prospect can still lapse into what executive editor Scott
Stossel calls ``some classically wonky stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   However noble, the 58-page, 11-article special section on life
in the American workforce was gray, dense, and not exactly reader
friendly. The cover art _ a shadowy depiction of several people
gathered around a computer screen doing nothing in particular _ was
similarly uninviting.
</P>
<P>
   Without referring to ``Making Work Pay'' as a throwback to the
bad old days, cofounder and coeditor (and Boston Globe editorial
page columnist) Robert Kuttner says of the Boston-based American
Prospect: ``I think it's only in the last two or three issues that
it really feels like a magazine rather than a recovering journal.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989 to be what Stossel says is ``a real serious
vehicle for policy ideas'' to counter the intellectual momentum of
the conservative movement, the resolutely liberal American Prospect
was brimming with ideas but often had the sizzle of a plumber's
training manual. The premier spring 1990 issue, for example,
offered a cover featuring such yawn-inspiring headlines as: ``The
Future of Constitutional Politics,'' ``AIDS and the Moral Economy
of Insurance,'' and ``Escaping the Fiscal Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the magazine moved to change that thanks to a $5.5
million grant from Bill Moyers's Schumann Foundation. It underwent
a dramatic redesign and changed its publication schedule from
bimonthly to biweekly. Most significantly, it began to effectively
reinvent itself as a feisty, newsy political journal that,
stylistically, more closely resembles The New Republic than Plato's
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point here is reach a wider audience, to publish
more frequently so that we can be more on the news, to be on the
national radar screen,'' says Kuttner, admitting that the old
version was just ``too much work'' for many potential readers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's American Prospect features stylish graphics, short and
timely political pieces, cartoons from Jules Feiffer, a ``Political
Puzzler,'' a ``Below the Beltway'' Washington column, and most
notably, a revamped ``back of the book'' section with smart
cultural commentary. (Scott Heller reviews the remake of ``Shaft.''
Bill Shoemaker discusses new CD box sets from sax greats John
Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. Joshua Gamson writes on the NBC TV show
that pays homage to the psychic world, ``The Others.'' And Jeff
Danziger dissects Molly Ivins's scathing George. W. Bush bio.)
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging the publication's transformation from
``journal'' to ``magazine,'' Stossel says ``it's been more of a
gradual continuum, more like going around a curve than turning a
corner.'' But he cites the April 24 cover story on Democratic
Senator Robert Torricelli as a symbol of its rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Headlined ``The Amazing Adventures of Money Man,'' the story was
accompanied by an eye-catching illustration of Torricelli stripping
off his clothing to reveal a dollar sign emblazoned underneath. The
story itself is a sharp-elbowed, anecdote-laden tale of a pol who
may save the Democratic Party with his ability to raise cash and
may ruin it with his political amorality. ``It was the sort of
piece we wouldn't have run before,'' says Stossel.
</P>
<P>
   Kuttner is quick to point out, however, that the magazine hasn't
abandoned its core journalistic or political principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a balancing act,'' he says. ``It's a better mix
of short and long. It's a full-service magazine for liberals
without giving up the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly hasn't given up the full-throated,
left-of-the-Democratic-Leadership-Council ideology. The current
issue repeatedly attacks Al Gore from the left, contending that he
and President Clinton went soft on big business. The upcoming
issue, focusing on the perils of a ``leaky economy,'' doesn't
exactly dovetail with Gore's ``progress and prosperity'' theme. And
the July 17 issue includes a piece arguing that every American is
entitled to an $80,000 stake as a ``birthright of citizenship,'' a
classic redistribute-the-wealth proposal that makes LBJ's Great
Society look like Reaganomics.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kuttner, the magazine's circulation is up from a
pre-relaunch high of 17,000-18,000 to about 26,000 with the
ultimate goal of joining The Nation and New Republic in the
95,000-100,000 category. With the ramped-up publication schedule,
he estimates that ad revenues are running about 2 1/2 times higher
than last year with the magazine carrying about eight ad pages per
issue.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers don't exactly replicate People magazine-type
success at the box office, but the Schumann Foundation's initial
grant for the first two years of the relaunch is renewable for the
next three years. And Kuttner hopes to get the deficit under $1
million in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you quite get to break even, but you get within
spitting distance of breaking even,'' he says. ``You become part of
the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   There's evidence that's already happening. Asked if he'd noticed
changes in The American Prospect, Ramesh Ponnuru, senior editor at
the conservative National Review, says, ``I see it a heck of a lot
more often now, and it's a little less daunting in its
presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Faint praise from an ideological foe. But grudging recognition
that the ``recovering journal'' is starting to adapt to its new
life as a magazine.

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ When you consider that Nat Stone is rowing from
the Brooklyn Bridge to Eastport, Maine, consider first that he is
taking the long way _ the (itals)way(unitals) long way.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that he has almost finished ``rowing the circle,'' as
he puts it, meaning a roughly 6,000-mile navigation of the Eastern
United States that stretches northward along the Hudson River from
New York City, makes a westward turn into the New York State Barge
Canal, and then includes such watery biways as Chautauqua Lake, the
Mississippi River, the Louisiana bayous, the Intracoastal Waterway,
the Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, the Atlantic Ocean,
Cape Cod Bay, and _ early next week _ Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Consider especially that the 31-year-old former teacher has not,
despite what you might expect, been overwhelmed by the loneliness
of the long-distance rower. Instead, Stone, who more or less calls
Maine his home, has discovered an affable population of folks
who've not only been willing to offer him such necessities as a hot
shower and a cold beer, but have also invited him briefly into
their lives while trying to satisfy their curiosity about his.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask, `How can you spend so much time alone?' '' Stone
says after hauling his boat ashore for a one-day layover here. ``I
tell them I've been on the water for 240 days, and there's been
only one day that I didn't shake at least one hand.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the hands that Stone shook in Newport Harbor belongs to
David Stookey, editor/publisher of a newsletter called Open-Water
Rowing. Stookey allows that he's impressed by Stone's journey, not
so much as a physical feat _ rowers have crossed the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans, he points out _ but as a slow-moving window on a
variety of watery cultures. ``It's an intelligent traveler's way of
seeing the world,'' Stookey says.
</P>
<P>
   Stone grew up in Marblehead and annually summered with his
family in Maine. As a teenager, he sailed and rowed a small skiff
80 miles along the Maine coast. But it wasn't until shortly after
he graduated from Brown University in 1992, when he read a
biography of Howard Blackburn, a 19th century Gloucester fisherman
and later a long-distance sailor who failed at circumnavigating the
Eastern United States, that he became fascinated by the notion of
``rowing the circle.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of his college classmates were dutifully launching
button-down careers, Stone's adventurous and unconventional spirit
led him to the Zuni Indian Reservation in New Mexico, where he
taught school and founded a small newspaper. Still, he wanted
something more. So two years ago he returned to the Northeast to
begin his journey, despite having no experience or formal training
in sculling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living a life that really didn't seem that memorable,''
he says. ``It's been great to be tested, to deal with changing
circumstances every day. And it's been great to be free of all the
little rules and regulations of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why I like to be on the water so much,''
he muses. ``I just find it an amazing material to be on top of, and
with no median strip or traffic lights. And I'm mesmerized by the
wake of my own boat.''
</P>
<P>
   True, you could walk 6,000 miles and see the planet at about the
same leisurely speed, if from a slightly different perspective. But
when you're traveling in a 17-foot scull that's obviously outfitted
for something more than day fishing, people tend to become curious
about what you're doing. When they find out, they tend to become
excited. Like the jogger whom Stone encountered on April 24, 1999,
the very first day of his trip:
</P>
<P>
   ``What street is this?'' the rower hollered from the Harlem
River.
</P>
<P>
   ``110th Street! How far'r you going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bourbon Street!''
</P>
<P>
   Silence _ then a broad smile from the man on the riverbank,
accompanied by a fist punching the air.
</P>
<P>
   Such elicitations of amazement and encouragement have been
common. ``A rowboat is just unusual enough to surprise people,''
says Stone, his long suntanned face and dark eyes shaded by a white
canvas hat. ``They don't take it for granted. So it facilitates
conversation. It spurs curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone is an easy and charming conversationalist, a man who his
father, Boston lawyer John Stone, says ``has a facility to strike
up acquaintances.'' The two address books he has compiled during
his journey bulge with over 500 names. ``But I was expecting to
find camaraderie,'' he says. ``I mean, a major purpose of the trip
was to meet people along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks whom Stone has met on the waterways have provided more
than opportunities for schmoozing. Whether it was handing over a
carton of powdered milk in Barataria, La., or offering a two-day
job as a caterer's assistant in New Orleans, strangers just seem to
want to help him. A couple in Mayville, N.Y., drove him in their
truck to a hot breakfast. A group of rowers near Pittsburgh gave
him the pair of lightweight oars he still uses. A couple in Cedar
Key, Fla., offered him their home to sleep in despite the fact they
would be away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been constantly trusting,'' Stone says. ``I'll
find myself taking a shower in the home of someone whom I met only
a hour before. Or sitting at someone's dinner table, hearing his
life story and telling him mine. Despite the fact they're
constantly told to keep our doors locked, people are fundementally
trusting of other people. It's very heartening.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's been a disheartening side, too. Stone has seldom
been far enough from the engines of civilization to hear only the
sounds of birds overhead and water lapping against his boat. ``Even
in the most remote areas, I've rarely come across mechanical
silence,'' he says. ``Usually, if I've listened for it, I can hear
in the distance an airplane, or the engines of a towboat, or some
loudly accelerating car asking for attention.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking 100 days to row from the Brooklyn Bridge to the
Gulf of Mexico, Stone flew to Maine to work in his brother's
T-shirt screening business for six months and thereby earn more
money for the trip. (Total expenses excluding boats: about $1,500.)
He also purchased, for $2,200, a heftier craft for the ocean waters
ahead. He left Mississippi on Jan. 31 and hopes to reach the
northern coastal tip of Maine by Aug. 10. ``The circle'' was
officially closed when he rowed beneath the Brooklyn Bridge on June
29, but he kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just become so content in this lifestyle,'' he says.
``It's so simple. The worst things that can happen to me are that
it's raining, I'm hungry, or I have no clean clothes. And it's
usually easy to solve those problems. Basically, my needs are food,
water, safety and good health. All the normal aspirations and
temptations of our culture have been removed. They have no weight
for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the trip hasn't made me feel that I don't want to
participate. It's provided perspective on what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Some facts about Stone's stripped-down life:
</P>
<P>
   He carries about 70 pounds of gear. When not relying on the
kindness of strangers, he has either camped on islands or sandbars
or slept in his boat. When dining on board, he has lived largely on
peanut butter, jam, jelly, honey, saltines, and sardines. His
average speed on a calm day is about four-and-a-half statute miles
per hour. The longest distance he has covered in a single day is 78
miles, aided by the Mississippi's current. Usually he has been no
more than a mile from land. ``I'm on my third radio,'' he says.
``Two have been victims of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous? Stone has not capsized or been swamped, not even by
5-foot waves off the coast of Mississippi. People told him the
Mississippi River would be a high-powered caldron of runaway
barges, poisonous snakes, and oversized mosquitoes. It wasn't. He
was warned that if he came ashore at Cairo, Ill., he would likely
be shot dead. On the contary, the captain of a tugboat docked at
the gritty river town invited him aboard to watch the Women's World
Cup soccer final on TV and to spend the night on a fold-out bed
(with washer and dryer!).
</P>
<P>
   To help pay his bills, Stone sold about four dozen $20
subscriptions to a carefully crafted if irregularly published
journal he has e-mailed from computers in public libraries. He also
uploaded photos to the Web (www.hometown.aol.com/rowingthecircle).
He talks enthusiastically of turning his journal into a book, and
warily of a possible trans-Atlantic row in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not quite home yet. Boston, Cape Ann, and the craggy
coast of Maine lie ahead. As Stone rows diligently northward and
remembers the hundreds of people he's encountered, he'll probably
recall one Freddy Fisher, a lean rower and bicyle rider in his 70s
whom he met in Toronto, Ohio, about a year ago. Stone spent a few
hours with Fisher, talking about boats and travel and the older
man's experiences in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher also passed judgement on Stone's journey, telling him
what he already knew: ``You're doing the right thing.''

CLAY MASTER ERIC O'LEARY: MOLDED BY FAMILY TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDEN, N.H. _ Eric O'Leary grew up in Old Sturbridge Village,
the famed central Massachusetts re-creation of early American life.
Between the ages of 5 and 10, he dressed in period costume and
lived with his parents and siblings over the potter's shop, where
his father worked as the resident ceramist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like living in a time warp,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Sturbridge Village episode only confirms what he calls a
``destiny'' established at birth: a career in clay. His work is now
known nationally: a garden in Weston, Mass., another in Ohio, a
hospital in Pennsylvania, and, of course, the Museum of Fine Arts
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, now 50, was born in Alfred, N.Y., where his father was
attending Alfred University, which was and remains ``clay heaven,''
O'Leary says, ``whether it's for sculptural work or high-tech
industrial ceramics.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office in the ramshackle complex of
middle-of-nowhere buildings where he works (an erstwhile New
Hampshire chicken farm his father bought in 1960) O'Leary opens a
box and pulls out a pot he made when he was 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole childhood was a process of three-dimensional drawing
in this wonderful plastic medium called clay.'' The vessel is
utterly of its era, the somber, brown-pot period of American clay.
Bulbous and striped in earth tones, the piece is also astonishingly
accomplished for a second-grader. On the other hand, O'Leary had
been throwing pots since the age of 5.
</P>
<P>
   In the four decades since, his pottery has taken on a timeless
quality and glazes so richly colored you want to eat them. Those
glazes drip down the sides of his signature garden benches and
planters, made of slabs of stoneware that can stay outside
year-round. The feathery strokes and torrents of color resemble
both abstract expressionist painting and Japanese calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the benches have gotten longer, up to 4 feet, which has
given them an attenuated grace as well as increased seating
capacity. Two of the long benches are now parked in a gallery at
the MFA, a room otherwise filled with American modernist
masterpieces by the likes of Georgia O'Keeffe and Arthur Dove.
Museum director Malcolm Rogers had seen and was smitten by the
benches, and says he loves the ``interplay between two- and
three-dimensional forms now in that gallery.'' O'Leary also
recently added a playful egg cup, or hourglass-shaped, seat to his
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   He works on an architectural scale as well, in projects
residential, public, and corporate. In partnership with landscape
architect Shinichiro Abe of ZEN Associates in Sudbury, Mass. (donor
of the MFA benches), he's done a Weston garden where his benches,
singly or in pairs, line up with an almost mystical precision along
a terrace of rectangular slates. This suburban haven mingles the
man-made and the natural, the grid and the meandering forms of
trees and rocks, in perfect, Japanese-inspired balance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary has done mythic, figurative totems, including a ``Music
Tower'' that includes an entire orchestra among its population of
200 little clay people; remarkably comfortable ceramic chairs and
tables that clients use both indoors and out; an 18-foot-high
gateway that defines an Ohio garden; chunky ceramic and steel
benches for Donna Karan boutiques; fountains and lanterns that use
water and light to give the glazes extra sparkle and movement and
make them respond to changes in weather and season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's father, Jack, gave his New Hampshire studio the name
it still bears, Tariki, a Zen term his son translates as
``enlightenment through grace.'' It was not only clay techniques
but clay's spirit that Eric O'Leary inherited from his father. Jack
O'Leary died in 1982, but his philosophy still pervades the 8-acre
Meriden plot he bought because of its proximity to Dartmouth
College, where he taught in the 1960s after his Sturbridge Village
stint.
</P>
<P>
   The elder O'Leary was studying geochemical engineering at the
University of Michigan when he met one of Gandhi's associates and
made the decision to practice pacifism. He and his wife, Alice,
were working with troubled children in Philadelphia when World War
II broke out. A conscientious objector, he spent 6 1/2 years in
prison for his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He practiced total noncooperation in his prison service,'' his
son says, a mixture of pride and awe in his voice. ``My father felt
that pacifism was an act of complete love. If you come to it with
less than that, you're part of the problem, not the solution.''
Eric O'Leary and his four siblings all became pacifists, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's approach to life empowered his approach to clay,''
O'Leary says. ``I saw that on a daily basis. I didn't come to this
career casually. My parents struggled greatly to support five
children while my father worked as an artist. My commitment to a
creative life was eyes-wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, when his father was starting out as a ceramist,
``the American craft scene as we now know it didn't exist,''
O'Leary says. ``It was just pockets of people around the country
trying to reestablish traditions of design and working by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The League of New Hampshire Craftsmen, with its promise of
marketing help and a support system, helped lure his father to that
state; O'Leary, too, has been active in the league.
</P>
<P>
   When his father started teaching at Dartmouth, O'Leary met other
artists on campus including such celebrated sculptors as Donald
Judd and George Rickey. The most influential encounter, though, was
with a Japanese living national treasure, the great ceramist
Fujiwara Yu, who came to Dartmouth for a residency, disapproved of
the college's primitive clay facilities, and ended up spending his
days working side by side with Jack O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job in high school was prepping clay for Mr. Fujiwara,''
O'Leary recalls, opening a large tome on the artist that includes
photographs of works labeled ``from his American period.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year at Vermont's Goddard College, a hotbed of education
innovation in the late '60s, O'Leary did what so many college
students did in that decade: He went to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father called one day and said, `If you're not too stoned,
get over to Peter Voulkos's studio,' which I did,'' he says.
Voulkos is one of the gods of American ceramics, famed for his
rugged vessels that look as if they erupted out of the earth.
``After I left his studio,'' O'Leary says, ``I thought, my own
family's studio is where I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   The prodigal returned to a lengthy father-son apprenticeship.
Both before and after his six-month California adventure, ``I spent
years doing traditional, functional, wheel-thrown ceramics with my
father,'' O'Leary says. ``I'd go to craft shows with him. It was
station wagons in fields then. There weren't galleries. Seeing it
all become so sophisticated over time has been astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been part of that growing sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my father died, I decided to get out of the craft-show
world and see what I could do with furniture,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He'd already developed his now-classic benches, which made their
debut in 1971 when the American Dairy Association used them at a
convention for a most unsophisticated purpose: as milking stools.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People's first thought on encountering O'Leary's ceramics is
often ``Japan.'' He's never been there, although that country's
ceramic traditions have profoundly influenced his work, in the
merging of functional and sculptural, indoors and out, in
simplicity of shape and spontaneity of surface design.
</P>
<P>
   He has also studied Japanese calligraphy, which piqued his
interest in two-dimensional work. He's made a series of wall tiles
akin to the lyrical abstract painting of Hans Hofmann or Helen
Frankenthaler.
</P>
<P>
   Other family members are also carrying on _ and extending _ the
clay tradition. Working with one of his brothers, Kevin, O'Leary
has developed a way to turn tiles into prints, by computer-scanning
them. O'Leary and his wife, Constance, have three children, the
youngest of whom, 10-year-old Kelly, is interested in carrying on
the family art form and actually helped with the figures in the
``Music Tower.''
</P>
<P>
   All along, he's continued the political work that ``has always
been an important aspect of my life,'' he says, ``whether it's
working against the Vietnam War or organizing organic-food
co-ops.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd been looking for a way to combine his expertise in clay and
his political work when he encounted the Connecticut-based Aid to
Artisans. Last year, he served as part of an ATA delegation to
Mexico, its mission to help local potters to stop using the
lead-based glazes that were, in effect, slowly killing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mind-blowing,'' he says. ``Whole families are exposed
daily to lead. I talked to potter after potter who said, `I love
the sweet taste of lead.' They (itals)eat(unitals) it.''
</P>
<P>
   On one of his several trips to Mexico, a country he's fallen in
love with, in a particularly remote part of the north central
region, he found a vast, four-chambered wood-fired kiln the
Japanese had built 18 years ago. Part of a Japanese government
community development initiative, it had been long since abandoned.
He wants to get it going again.
</P>
<P>
   On his most recent visit to Mexico, earlier this year, he had to
walk three days to reach the traditional pottery village of Pio
Gordo, which, he says, ``is so isolated there's been little damage
from the drug wars. I went to another village where nearly all the
women potters' husbands had been killed by the drug cartels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How, as this outsider, do you help out?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   One of his plans involves making a documentary video of a Pino
Gordo woman teaching her daughter to make the traditional coiled
pottery, and use the video to perpetuate and propagate the age-old
skill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's been hard at work on his biggest-ever
commission, for the main entrance of the Pinnacle Health System
hospital in Harrisburg, Pa. He's making what amounts to a mountain
range, a series of seven craggy stoneware peaks, up to 9 1/2 feet
tall, rising up from a reflecting pool. Their luminous colors
suggest semiprecious gems lurking in some complex geological
fantasy. Water will cascade through them. When the water is turned
off for winter, the pieces will be lit at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the unforgiving `hardscape' of the hospital
buildings and the parking lot, I want to offer a place of respite
where patients' families can come and find a quiet bit of `wow!'
like you feel in nature,'' he says. ``Water is healing, both
visually and aurally. It flows to the lowest level and then
recycles into the air. That cyclical nature is like our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title of the piece,'' he says, ``is `Journey.' ''

TEN THOUSAND ISLANDS 
By Randy Wayne White 
Putnam, 320 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Originality is almost impossible to achieve in crime fiction. By
its nature these days, the genre is self-referential, a kind of
endless _ and to fans, endlessly interesting _ variation on
predecessors. The trick for the good crime writer, then, is to
choose his or her models well and not be enslaved by them.
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts were provoked by Randy Wayne White's new
Florida-based novel, ``Ten Thousand Islands.'' It's the seventh in
his series featuring hard-boiled Doc Ford, a marine biologist and
sometime sleuth with a fast boat, quick hands, and a nose for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Once the exposition is laid out, the story about a long-dead
teenager and some ancient indigenous relics she uncovered is taut
and engrossing. Beautiful Dorothy Copeland was drawn to artifacts
fashioned by the Calusa people four centuries back, and among the
objects she found was a coveted gold medallion. Then Dorothy
herself was found dead, at 15, and her apparent suicide seemed
related to the mystical powers of the palm-sized chaguala. Now her
grave on Marco Island has been disturbed and her mother, Della, who
still owns a few of Dorothy's treasures, is in peril.
</P>
<P>
   White's a skilled writer and an especially gifted choreographer
of complicatedly violent action. The last 50 or so pages of ``Ten
Thousand Islands'' are as kinetically hair-raising as an Indiana
Jones spectacle. Technically, Doc's underwater contortions and his
climactic pursuit of the villains at 70 miles per hour in his
seagoing skiff are improbable. But White's clean, crackling prose
delivers the exciting, watery acrobatics with polished finesse.
</P>
<P>
   And the novel has some other, subtler virtues, notably its
interest in the history and anthropology of South Florida's
pre-Columbian Indians. The whole yarn is loosely based on a true
story, and White has sketched in some fascinating lore about a
sophisticated civilization that forcefully resisted the
Christianizing Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The primary mouthpiece for this information is nubile Nora
Chung, a precocious academic whom Doc allows to seduce him. Bear in
mind that he's given to dictums such as ``There is no such thing as
casual sex'' and other bits of terse and manly philosophy. ``In an
emergency situation,'' he pronounces, ``a man wants two things
covered: his testicles and his toes.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's pleasures far outweigh this macho silliness. But for
all his gifts, it's hard not to be distracted by White's conscious
debt to the late John D. MacDonald and his deservedly popular
Travis McGee novels. This is not the place to review the MacDonald
oeuvre, only to draw a few comparisons between his and White's
fictional world.
</P>
<P>
   McGee is a boat bum who lives on a houseboat he won in a card
game. He jogs to shake off hangovers and tone his tanned torso. His
best buddy is an eccentric intellectual named Meyer. The
investigations McGee and Meyer are drawn into often permit
MacDonald to reflect on Florida's environmental exploitation. Doc
Ford is a boat bum, too, and a marina habitue, though he lives on
Sanibel Island in a house on stilts. He jogs as a form of penance.
His sidekick, the brilliant and often chemically fueled Tomlinson,
is part Timothy Leary, part Columbo. And through his hero, White
too comments plaintively on the greedy destruction of Florida's
natural bounty.
</P>
<P>
   White would probably claim that these obvious parallels pay
homage to MacDonald without compromising his fictional voice or
cramping his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the charm of much American crime fiction is the
configuration of serial characters. Think of Robert Parker's trio
of Spenser, Hawk, and Susan, and of the particular chemistry of
their interactions. It's one way to stamp some individuality on a
crime series.
</P>
<P>
   White's book, the only one in the series I've read, feels boxed
in by its identification with MacDonald's McGee novels. One of the
least welcome results, which may ironically stem from White's
effort to set Doc Ford apart from McGee, is a protagonist who seems
like a parody of his fictional forebear. Doc's laconic, tough-guy
worldliness borders on comedy _ unintentionally, as far as I can
tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten Thousand Islands'' left me wondering why White didn't
chart a more independent course to serve his obvious talent.

TV TURNS TO THE SISTERHOOD OF CAMELOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Another TV season, another network miniseries
about the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   The producers and stars of the newest one, NBC's ``Jackie,
Ethel, Joan: Women of Camelot,'' insisted Wednesday it will not be
exploitive _ a refrain that has become almost as familiar as the
subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   As the title suggests, the four-hour miniseries will differ from
films that have focused on the brothers: President John F. Kennedy,
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. Instead, it
will be built around an aspect of the Kennedy story that executive
producer Sheri Singer says has been slighted, namely, the
``camaraderie and sisterhood that formed'' among the late
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Ethel Kennedy, and Joan Bennett
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Singer indicated the miniseries, which is slated to air in the
election (and sweeps) month of November, will be an admiring
portrait of ``these three women who were so incredibly different
and would never have known each other under any other circumstances
and (were) thrown together in the most public way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women of Camelot,'' based on the book of the same name by J.
Randy Taraborrelli, will show ``how incredibly difficult it was for
these women to be married to these men at that point in time,''
said Singer. It will also, she said, chronicle ``how they were
there for each other'' during the ``unbelievable string of
tragedies'' they endured.
</P>
<P>
   Those tragedies, of course, included the assassinations of John
and Robert Kennedy. The miniseries, set from 1960 to 1980, will
apparently also touch on the Kennedys' marital troubles, along with
such events as the 1969 accident at Chappaquiddick that claimed the
life of Mary Jo Kopechne, a passenger in a car driven by Edward
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   It is territory that has been covered ad infinitum, but, Singer
said, ``There seems to be an endless curiosity in this country
about this family.'' The miniseries is being filmed in Toronto.
``We are building Hyannis Port on an empty strip of beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Hennessy, best known for her role in ``Law &AMP; Order'' from
1993 to 1996, plays Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Hennessy said
Wednesday that to prepare for the role, she watched hours of
documentary footage of Onassis, especially during the White House
years, 1960 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Holly, best known for the film ``Dumb and Dumber,'' plays
Ethel Kennedy. Holly said she was impressed by her character's
``moxie'': ``She was incredibly spirited, a little brash,
ambitious, and so dedicated to that family.'' The actress said she
has not met Ethel Kennedy, called the prospect ``sort of
frightening.'' Leslie Stefanson, who will portray Joan Bennett
Kennedy, was not present as the other stars addressed TV critics
here.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Joan Bennett Kennedy nor Ethel Kennedy have any
involvement with the film, and producers have no plans to screen it
for them before it airs.
</P>
<P>
   Singer said, ``I hope they'll be pleased'' by the latest TV
treatment of their lives. But, she added, ``It's possible they wish
there would never be another thing done on them.''

TEENS ARE THE TARGET IN FORMULAIC, FUN `IN CROWD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE IN CROWD 
Directed by: Mary Lambert 
Screenplay by: Mark Gibson and Philip Halprin 
Starring: Susan Ward, Lori Heuringcq, Matthew Settle, Nathan
Bexton, Tess Harper 
Running Time: 100 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 
2 1/2 stars 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A far cry from zombie-strewn ``Pet Sematary,'' director Mary
Lambert's claim to fame, ``The In Crowd'' is a J. Crew ad gone
very, very wrong. The clothes are terrific, the beach is a gas, but
there's something sinister afoot that even a perfect tan can't
conceal.
</P>
<P>
   As formulaic, teen-targeted thrillers go, ``The In Crowd'' is
entirely harmless and, on occasion, genuinely amusing. All the key
features of the genre are intact: first and foremost, the cast
numbers many beautiful and scantily clad young people. Archetypal
characters abound, such as the evil clique leader, her passive
sidekick, a clueless hunk, and the innocent victim. The arc of the
story is nothing if not reliable _ the characters meet, greet, and
drop clues that all might not be as well as it seems; tension
builds; chaos quickly ensues; and justice, finally, is done.
</P>
<P>
   What this films shares with ``Pet Sematary'' is a dearth of
suspense, which normally would be a strike against a thriller.
There will be no gripping of armrests or peeking through fingers.
But in an era where raunchy, violent films are routinely earning
PG-13 ratings to allow the lucrative teen market in the theater
door, the mild-mannered nature of this movie is actually
refreshing. And although it isn't a nail-biter, the film generates
enough interest in discovering the truth that one dutifully follows
the trail of crumbs to the shallow grave.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly distinguishing themselves as stars-in-the-making,
Lori Heuring as Adrien Williams and Susan Ward as Brittany Foster
bring a natural ease to their roles. Gorgeous blonde Adrien,
recently released from psychiatric lock-up, is reentering society
via a service job at a posh country club. (In the effort to
approximate a normal life, this is her first big mistake.) Gorgeous
brunette Brittany is the highest-ranking brat among the club's
trust-fund kids, whose parents buy them Hummers as a reward for
making it through rehab. Under the auspices of filling her endless
summer days with something other than sunbathing and cocktails,
Brittany befriends Adrien.
</P>
<P>
   Things start to go south when tennis pro Matt Curtis (Matthew
Steele), the object of Brittany's affection, takes an interest in
Adrien. As the film's slogan goes _ ``sometimes being popular can
be murder'' _ the bodies begin stacking up. The film's other slogan
_ ``what would you do to get in?'' _ becomes, needless to say,
extravagently ironic as the focus quickly becomes what Adrien can
possibly do to get out. Several lethal plot twists, evil frame
jobs, and impossible escapes later . . . well, we can't really say
what happens. Rest assured, the moral universe remains unsullied in
this lite, lo-cal thriller _ the cinematic equivalent of a fizzy
summer drink.

VACATION'S BEST DISCOVERIES CAN BE OUR KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever gone on a family vacation expecting to make
discoveries about the place you're going, only to return home full
of discoveries about your children?
</P>
<P>
   When we're away together as families, we tend to see aspects of
our children we hadn't before. The question is, are children
different on vacation or does our perception of them alter?
</P>
<P>
   Intrinsic personality traits, theirs or yours, don't change.
Interpersonal dynamics, on the other hand, do. ``When we're not
distracted by responsibilities, our focus on our kids is sharper,''
says parent educator Linda Braun, executive director of Families
First Parenting Education Programs of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that we're paying more attention as it is a
different kind of attention. Kids feel that, and they thrive on
it,'' she says. ``It's why vacation is a relationship-building
time. It can be transforming.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfettered time is so vital to family life that Braun urges
parents who can't go away to take a vacation at home. ``It doesn't
matter what you do,'' she says. ``The point is to change the
pattern of your daily life. Turn off the phone and e-mail and do
fun things together. Things you don't normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   What this time together changes is a child's sense of security,
says psychologist Christine Wekerle. Not that your children are
necessarily normally insecure, she's quick to add. Rather, she
says, ``There's a different level of safety for them, knowing you
are available whenever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   That translates to an unconscious, heightened sense of freedom,
which often leads a child to a developmental milestone, such as
taking a first step or mastering toileting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic on vacation breaks up the stuck place he was in at
home,'' says Braun. ``It could be emotional _ you're more relaxed
so he is, too _ or situational: He isn't afraid to sleep in a
big-boy bed because, in the beach house, your bedroom is right next
to his, or in a motel, you're all in one room.''
</P>
<P>
   On their family vacation last year, Wekerle's middle son, Colin,
then 7, conquered his fear of the ocean, going body surfing and
deep-sea fishing, where land wasn't even in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible blossoming,'' says Wekerle, who was
pleasantly surprised to see such determination in her son. It
didn't go disappear with vacation, either. She's convinced the
increase in initiative that teachers saw in him in September was
spill-over from how good he felt about himself for mastering his
fear.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics could argue it was a matter of timing: Colin was simply
ready to make a developmenal leap. That's part of it, sure, but
psychologist Sanford Portnoy tells parents not to underestimate the
magic of family vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a kid's perspective, you're not just more available,
you're also more fun,'' he says. ``Plus, when you're on vacation
together, you're all sharing the same new experiences.'' That not
only strengthens your connections to each other as a unit, but also
provides the peephole to see your children in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be open to it, though,'' Portnoy cautions.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the Lincoln Memorial in Washington when children Katie
and Dave, now 26 and 24, were 4 and 2, Portnoy read aloud from the
Gettysburg Address on the wall. The kids weren't paying any
attention, however: The pigeon they spotted on Lincoln's head was
far more interesting. In another city when they were older, Portnoy
and wife, Joan, marveled aloud at the architecture. That, too, was
lost on Katie and Dave. Their eyes were on the ground. They had
spotted some bugs they had never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   In situations like this, it's easy to be frustrated or angry
that children aren't paying attention to your would-be lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Get over it, advises Portnoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't see the same thing we do, even when we're looking
at the same thing. That's delightful in its own way,'' he says.
Portnoy is president of the Massachusetts Psychological Association
and coauthor, with his wife, of ``How to Take Great Trips With Your
Kids, Revised Edition'' (Harvard Common Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice is to let them experience things in their own
way,'' he says. Indeed, the less we push children to be on our
agenda, the more fun everyone will have.
</P>
<P>
   Another scene flashes before Portnoy's eyes. They are in Cork,
Ireland, and Dave is 5. They have just had apple pie for dessert,
except in Ireland, it's called apple tart. When they get back to
their room, Dave picks up a coloring book. The instructions on one
page are to circle the apple pie. ``You mean apple tart,'' Dave
says aloud to the book.

<P>
   ``It's a small thing,'' muses Portnoy, ``but I remember it still
because it was a moment of discovery for me about my son.'' His
5-year-old, he realized, was very adaptable and very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Being on your children's agenda doesn't mean abdicating to their
every whim; that will leave you feeling cheated. It does mean,
however, that you anticipate their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Younger children as well as older ones who are sensitive to
change can suffer from lack of familiar routines, says parent
educator Deb Kratz, coauthor of ``The Field Guide to Parenting''
(Chandler House).
</P>
<P>
   Her advice is to work around the youngest child's schedule. ``If
he's cranky because he doesn't nap or because it's two hours past
his dinnertime, everyone else will be miserable, too. What's the
point?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a young child is excited to go and even if he's traveled
before, there's still stress involved. ``Kids who whine, `I want to
go home,' are either telling you, `I'm having a hard time making
this transition,' or they're wondering, `Will I ever get home
again?' '' says Wekerle. She recommends validating and labeling
feelings _ ``I bet you're missing your very own bed, huh?'' _ and
answering the unspoken question: ``You know, we will go home again,
but not for five more days.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as adults have expectations for vacation, so do children, a
point Braun says parents tend to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get everyone's hopes and wishes out on the table before you
go,'' she says. To avoid having a cranky adult along (and let's
face it, a cranky adult can run a vacation as quickly as a cranky
child!), share expectations with your spouse first, including
clarifying whether either of you expects to spend time on work,
then solicit your children's. In Wekerle's family, there are five
children, so lists can get long. She tells the four who are old
enough to write to star their top two items with the promise that
she and her husband will do all they can to accommodate those,
especially if the same wish is on more than one list. That often
leads to sibling collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   For children of any age, including most teenagers, the most
common expectation is for uninterrupted time with you. ``Let them
know beforehand if/how much adult-only time there will be, so they
won't be disappointed,'' suggests Wekerle.
</P>
<P>
   When vacation involves a reunion with extended family,
sociologist Larry Basirico of Elon College in North Carolina urges
negotiating beforehand with your siblings and parents how you will
all handle a range of issues, from children's bedtimes to
between-meal snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There tends to be more tension for parents on reunion
vacations, because each adult sibling is caught between the culture
of the family of origin and the culture of the new family you've
created, and that tension gets translated to the kids,'' he says.
Planning ahead may be a pain, he admits, but it reduces stress on
the vacation.
</P>
<P>
   More that where you are and what you do, it's your mellow affect
and spontaneity that children remember about vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're taking a walk on the beach and you tell a story about
how you used to paint shells when you were young, and the next
thing you know, you're going with the idea, picking shells and
buying paint. How often at home do you just drop everything and go
with an idea?'' asks Braun. ``That's what vacation is all about:
Less shoulds and more coulds.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of that is when you'll make discoveries about
your children, and when your children will make discoveries about
you.
</P>

VACATION TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Young children are prone to accidents when they are in new and
unfamiliar places, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Be even more vigilant than you are at home about child-proofing and
safety precautions.
</P>
<P>
   --Before going away, talk about what will stay the same and what
will change: ``Bedtime will be later, but you still have to brush
your teeth; you can have snacks between meals, but ice cream only
once a day.'' Also be clear about vacation rules that differ from
rules at home. Two good ones: ``Always tell an adult if you want to
leave our group'' (for instance, on the beach); ``We have to hold
hands at the airport and in any crowded place.''
</P>
<P>
   --Parent educator Linda Braun thinks of the beach as therapeutic
for kids: The wide-open expanse and natural boundaries give them a
sense of independence because they don't feel under constant adult
scrutiny. Sand and water play allows for large and small motor
development, and they get to try out new social skills if they make
new playmates.
</P>
<P>
   --When a child brings a friend along, it changes family
dynamics. Allow for some time alone, just the family.
</P>
<P>
   --Build time into every day for physical activity. If you're
traveling by car, don't just make pit stops for the restroom, but
also to do jumping jacks together or play a game of tag.
</P>
<P>
   --A child who melts down over something really small, especially
an older child for whom such behavior is out of character, is
telling you, ``I can't take this new routine.'' When he's calm,
talk about it: ``Even though we're having fun, sometimes I miss the
way our house feels, even the way it smells. Do you?'' That alone
can make him feel less out of control.
</P>

 &HT;    Roadside advisories that once entertained now go splat
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMEWHERE IN THE WEST _ ``But it was a blue spruce.''
</P>
<P>
   This was my wife, pining to no one in particular. I was
listening but my ear was of no comfort to her.
</P>
<P>
   We'd just driven by a gorgeous stand of mountain evergreens. Her
entreaty to the back-seat boys to observe it in wonder had met
towering indifference.
</P>
<P>
   As had ``look _ Pike's Peak.'' As had ``look at Denver's
skyline.'' If the advisories were met with looks at all, that was a
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout our trip, only rare appeals succeeded in drawing
attention: ``Look, a volcanic cone'' (our middle-schooler looked,
apparently thinking he'd see lava spewing); ``Look, Britney
Spears.'' (He didn't appreciate being tricked.)
</P>
<P>
   Ah, for the days when Mom and Dad were merry tour guides and two
young passengers clung to our every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cow on Daddy's side,'' would evoke a robust confirmation, and
echo, from an attentive 8-year-old and 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil wells on Mommy's side,'' we'd say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil wells on Mommy's side,'' they'd say. ``Choo-choo on
Daddy's side,'' we'd say, followed by the back-seat repeat.
</P>
<P>
   They were seasoned travelers from the start, and robust. The
oldest, for instance, was known to joyously count the white dashes
rocketing under our wheels. Now, that's a dedicated and attentive
traveler. And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil well on Daddy's side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, yes, we've seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Choo-choo train on Mommy's side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. That would be a vehicle to transport goods, commonly on a
track parallel to many highways.''
</P>
<P>
   KNOW-IT-ALLS IN GEOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when multiple oil wells spotted up ahead could
be embellished into a herd of two-legged cooties on the high
plains. Now for passengers ages 17 and almost 13, oil wells are
just _ things that pump oil.
</P>
<P>
   This matter-of-factness was most frustrating a year ago when we
went on a long trip through Big Bend and the stunning canyonlands
of Arizona and Utah. Repeatedly, seeking to elicit ``oohs'' and
``ahhs,'' I was rebuffed. Indeed, I was mocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look over there,'' I'd say to the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, Dad? Have you spotted another `precipitous geologic
formation'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look over there,'' I'd say a few miles down the road at
another red-rock wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, that's `precipitous,' `` someone in braces would crack.
</P>
<P>
   THRILL IS GONE?
</P>
<P>
   I know the boys will look back fondly at these rides on endless
highway, the sights and family exchanges. Right now it appears all
they appreciate is the next convenience store, where one will shop
for a magazine to help blot out any vistas down the road and the
other will seek to numb his mind with mood-altering bubble gum.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll get back in the car and ignore everything we say.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until they have kids of their own. Wait until a cow
wallowing in mud and horseflies along the road becomes a slow-down
family event. And it will, for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, their parents can only plead to acts of reflex when
announcing, ``Cows on Dad's side,'' knowing full well the
announcement likely will be ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   After being ignored at several scenic junctures trying to stir
up interest one day on the road, my wife spotted a herd of exotic
animals that would have caused a stir on vacations past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Llamas on mommy's side, if anyone gives a flip.''
</P>
<P>
   To which from the back came, ``That would be possible only if we
had a flip to give.''

NEXABIT FOUNDER LEAVES LUCENT TO CREATE NEW STARTUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barely one year after selling his start-up Internet router
company to Lucent Technologies for $900 million, the founder of
Nexabit Networks has bailed out of Lucent _ and started a new
company directly across the street from the one he sold in
Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   With former Nexabit Networks employees seeing their Lucent stock
options mature this week, some industry insiders are predicting a
mass defection of employees to the new company, Axiowave Networks
Inc., set up by Nexabit founder Mukesh Chatter.
</P>
<P>
   To many people outside the telecommunications industry, the
situation could look like a case of ingratitude or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's world of Internet and telecom start-ups, it is
almost standard practice for entrepreneurial company founders and
executives to leave soon after they sell their small companies for
big money. The key is not to go into such a similar line of
business they can get sued.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks in Chelmsford, Sonus Networks in Westford, and
Convergent Networks in Lowell are three examples of Massachusetts
start-ups founded or led by people who had already sold telecom
start-ups for lavish sums to Lucent or Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company gets acquired, if you have someone who was the
CEO, and now they're general manager of an operating group, it's
hard to expect them to stay on longer than they have agreed to,''
said Chris Baldwin, a partner with Charles River Ventures who knows
several people involved in the Nexabit-Axiowave situation.
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear is whether Chatter's setting up his new company
right across Nickerson Road from Nexabit was a provocative swipe at
Lucent _ or, as some people familiar with the story speculate _
merely a case of finding office space in the superheated Interstate
495 realty market near his home.
</P>
<P>
   Chatter did not return phone calls Wednesday, and a company
receptionist would not identify the name of a spokesman to talk to.
Axiowave has taken enough space to hire several dozen employees but
has only a handful now.
</P>
<P>
   Axiowave's other founder, Raymond Stata, the legendary former
chief executive officer of Analog Devices, who was also founder and
chairman of Nexabit Networks, was out of the office and unreachable
by phone Wednesday, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said there were reports of friction between
Chatter and Lucent officials over the merits of Internet protocol
versus so-called ATM routing for moving data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish Mukesh a lot of luck in his new endeavor,'' said Lucy
Graziano, a Lucent spokeswoman. She said officials there were
unfamiliar with what Axiowave plans to do, and thus had no comment
on whether Chatter might face any legal action or efforts to block
him from hiring Lucent employees.
</P>
<P>
   One wrinkle to the story, elements of which were first reported
Wednesday by online networking newsletter Light Reading, is that
many Lucent employees have been frequent visitors to Axiowave over
the last several weeks _ to use its showers after games of
parking-lot basketball.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of newly stock-option-enriched Nexabit employees
fleeing Lucent, Graziano said, ``We have a very, very competitive
compensation package. We'll do the right things by our key
employees to keep them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because some employee is vested on a Monday doesn't mean
they leave on a Tuesday,'' Graziano said.
</P>
<P>
   Axiowave is in what is called ``stealth mode,'' refusing to say
what it plans to make or do or, beyond some top names, who works
there.
</P>
<P>
   Two people familiar with the company said Axiowave appears to be
pursuing an all-optical switching device that would use light,
rather than pulses of electricity, to move huge piles of data at
blazing speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Even in advanced fiber-optic networks, light pulses today are
generally converted back to electricity and then back to light to
move data from point to point, which can create bottlenecks in
thousand-lane data highways.
</P>
<P>
   In the most basic terms Axiowave might produce a box that does
the same thing as a Nexabit router, just potentially much faster.
But the difference in the technologies probably means Axiowave may
not directly compete with Lucent's Nexabit products, industry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits filed by companies against departing employees who
start new businesses are common, including a bitter fight between
Web consulting firm Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. against
founder James K. Sims, who set up Gen3 Partners Inc. in Boston
after leaving Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Lucent made its $900 million bid for Nexabit last
June, the company was developing _ but had yet to sell _ what is
called a terabit router, a device that can move a trillion bits of
data per second. Nexabit was one of six Bay State start-ups Lucent
bought last year for a total $24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been persistent chatter in the industry that the
device does not work as well as billed, Lucent last November
reported a Nexabit router had moved data in normal network usage at
a then-record speed of 10 gigabits per second.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Lucent announced its first customer for the
Nexabit-originated NX64000 device, VCities of Dallas, which is
using the terabit routers to help Internet companies and phone
companies sell new high-speed services. Graziano said several other
companies are testing the device.
</P>
<P>
   Other founders of Axiowave include Subhash C. Agrawal, a
software industry veteran, and Dan Vitti, a former Lucent vice
president of manufacturing planning.

NEW ASPHALT DRIVEWAY HAS STARTED TO FLAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I own a driveway with my neighbor. We had the old concrete
taken up and replaced with asphalt. After not too long, the surface
started flaking where tires turn on it. The contractor said,
``Don't turn your tires on the surface,'' and that he will heat the
asphalt and reroll it, then seal it. Is this the thing to do?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE CATALDO, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is, more or less, but the contractor's admonition, not to
turn your tires like that, reminds me of an old Punch cartoon in
which a British sailor complains to the ship's doctor, ``Doc, my
arm hurts when I go like that.'' ``Then don't go like that,'' said
the wily doctor. OK, so it's an old joke. It does make a certain
amount of sense, though. Power steering has made it easy to turn
your tires while standing still, which is pretty hard on fresh
asphalt. Maybe you should have stuck with concrete, but since it is
done, heating and rerolling is a good idea and will probably cure
the problem. But do not seal it; that is 90 percent cosmetic and
might be liable to wrinkling and pulling off if you move your tires
again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I got three bids, ranging from $600 to $1,200, to put down
mosaic ceramic tile on a kitchen floor. I noticed that some of the
3/8-inch plywood underlayment is rotting out. How can I prepare the
floor for the new tile?
</P>
<P>
   ROGER BUSSWELL, Rowley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your best bet is to take up all the 3/8-inch plywood, and
install Durarock, WonderBoard, or other kind of 1/2-inch-thick
concrete board. This will give a firm foundaton for the tile and
will keep the floor on the original plane. You could do this part
yourself or let the tiler do it.
</P>
<P>
   Another method is to apply mortar to the old floor, bringing it
up to the proper height, then apply the mosaic tile.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The plastic sleeves holding bolts for a toilet paper bar and
towel rack bracket are losing their strength, and the units are
sagging. I cannot move the holes, which are 1/2 inch in diameter,
so how can I make the brackets hold properly when I remount them?
</P>
<P>
   AL COOLEY, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if the holes were enlarged by the flexing of the
bolt, since the towel bar and paper holder receive a certain amount
of handling. Ergo, the fixtures come loose.
</P>
<P>
   What you need is a sturdier wall. The plasterboard or plaster
wall is not thick enough to hold the bolt properly. You could fill
that hole with joint compound, let it set, and redrill a hole for
the plastic sleeve, but it would work loose again.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest this rather drastic move: Remove enough of the
plasterboard or plaster to allow insertion of a horizontal 2 x 4
between two vertical studs to be toenailed to each stud. Replace
the plasterboard and finish off. Now you can mount the fixtures
directly on the wall with screws going into the 2 x 4.
</P>
<P>
   Drastic? Yes, but permanent and safe.
</P>
<P>
   Another technique, perhaps not quite as drastic but still a
pain, is to cut out the plasterboard or plaster and insert 1/2-inch
plywood in its place, nailed or screwed to the studs. Finish this
off, and you can mount the fixtures directly on the plywood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My garage is detached from a Victorian house, and has sliding
doors. When I opened it recently, one of the pulleys, dated 1907,
failed. Where can I find a replacement part
</P>
<P>
   TRACKLESS, in Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If it is only one pulley, you might be able to have a
metalworker make a new one. Check the Yellow Pages under
``metalworking'' and other related work. Or, try the Stanley Works
in New Britain, Conn., which has a catalog of hardware that
includes sliding barn-door tracks, which, if not exactly like
yours, could be adapted to your garage. The handyman used a Stanley
barn-door rack on his garage in Connecticut many years ago. Call
860-225-5111 for locations. You may have to get the whole track,
not just a pulley.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My concrete stairs have no railing, which I think is a
hazard. Can I put a wrought-iron railing on one side of those
steps? Trouble is, the concrete is finished. Can I drill into
finished concrete?
</P>
<P>
   JULIE MARTIN, Stow, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can do the work yourself, with wrought iron or aluminun
post and rails, drilling into the concrete and setting the posts
into the holes, then filling the holes with hydraulic cement. Yes,
you can drill holes in concrete. It is not easy, but possible.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, however, you are better off having it done for
you. Some years ago, the handyman had two rails, one on each side
of the steps, installed for about $600. That may seem high to the
average person, but as a high-quality job, it is not.
</P>

UNOFFICIAL RULES GOVERN TOUR TIMEOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ On paper, the Tour de France waits for
no one.
</P>
<P>
   Every July, almost 200 cyclists bolt around the countryside in a
separate race each day to try and accumulate the lowest time in
three weeks of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour does wait sometimes, though. The group has to stop for
barricaded railroad crossings, the cyclists skid to a stop for
crashes, and they are forced to pause when a local group is staging
a protest.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the most necessary, albeit unspoken, break _ the
bathroom break?
</P>
<P>
   It might seem appalling that a cyclist who is counting seconds
would sacrifice minutes for the so-called natural break. But after
a morning of coffee, cereal, pasta, omelettes, and several bottles
of water on top of six hours on a bike, what break could be any
more natural?
</P>
<P>
   It was brought to the forefront last week when Laurent Jalabert
said he was miffed when he was wearing the leaders' yellow jersey,
pulled off the road for a ``natural break,'' and the group kept
going at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   Tour courtesy, after all, says that the racers don't take
advantage of a fellow rider taking a break, said Paul Sherwen, a
veteran of seven Tours who now does commentary for European
television, ESPN, and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwen explained that some riders take the break while they're
still on their bike _ the racing suit is usually one piece and made
of Spandex, so we'll leave that to the imagination. Others dismount
their bike and go to the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The former is supposed to be done out of public view, or away
from a town according to the international cycling union, which can
be difficult in a race like the Tour where virtually every mile of
roadside is lined with people.
</P>
<P>
   It is definitely problematic, Sherwen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys can take a natural break on their bike, but I never
could. I had to stop,'' he said. ``Normally, you see a guy go up to
the front, so everybody knows the guy is leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   So the group doesn't speed away, unless they're looking for
payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a guy, 11 or 12 years ago, who was a real pig,''
Sherwen said, saying that the rider would attack when the group
slowed down for a crash or at the feeding area, where the riders
are handed sacks of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``So once he stopped at the side of the road to go to the
toilet, and he put his bike down, and a guy rode along, picked up
his bike, and dumped it in a ditch. I can't remember his name, but
it was hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   C'est le Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other rules that are not listed in the official race book:
</P>
<P>
   One is to let a rider move to the front of the pack when the
race goes through his hometown. Usually it's someone who's way down
in the overall standings, so he has a chance to look like a hero
when he rides by his cheering relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But again, some riders take advantage of the courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, once a rider rode in front, went to the side of the
road to hug his parents, then got back on his bike and stayed in
front, where he bolted ahead of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do something like that, if you go out to greet the
family, and you don't sit up (to slow down) when you get back, you
get a bad name for yourself overnight, and you always have a black
mark against you,'' Sherwen said. ``And you'll never be able to do
it ever again, nobody would ever let you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are rules that the regulation book spells out:
</P>
<P>
   Taking water from fans is OK, taking glass bottles is not.
</P>
<P>
   Being sprayed by the spectators is all right; bring sprayed by
the manager in your team car is not.
</P>
<P>
   Getting pats on the back is OK; getting pushed uphill is not. It
might be unwanted, but if a Tour referee sees it, he can issue a
time penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Racers can _ and do gladly _ accept newpapers from fans on the
top of a mountain as the cyclists get ready for the cold descent,
when they reach speeds of 50 to 60 miles per hour. The cyclists
stuff the papers under their jerseys, then toss them aside when
they reach the bottom of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, perhaps the most unspoken part of the Tour can be the
power that one rider holds over the pack. Fans may not see it, but
the riders feel it. The Tour hasn't seen one in recent years, but
the event used to be so dominated by a racer that he was considered
the official leader. It's someone who controls the pack as much as
a Larry Bird or Michael Jordan could be in charge of their
basketball team. But how can that be, if there are almost 200
cyclists, all riding for different teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I rode in all the Tours Bernard Hinault rode, and
he was the patron, he was the boss,'' said Sherwen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wanted the stage to go slow, the stage went slow. Not
because he had a bad day, but he though about the whole peleton, he
thought about everyone finishing the race. But he did it
forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherwen recalled that Hinault was in a crash during 1985 and
broke his nose. He managed to finish the race, but word got around
that he was injured, so the pack tried to take advantage of it the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when we got to the first climb, all these Colombians and
Spaniards were hammering and attacking up the road,'' Sherwen said.
``Hinualt got all his team to the front, and he rode hard the whole
rest of the race. It was like saying, `OK, boys, I might have a
broken nose, but I'm still the boss.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hinault won his fifth Tour that year.

BISHOP HAS PLENTY TO OFFER IN RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He wants to become at least the Patriots No.
2 quarterback, backup vice president of Patriots quarterbacks, a
heartbeat away from the presidency. His expectations are now more
realistic than they were last year at this time when he had visions
of stepping onto the field and never leaving it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bishop knows he will not unseat Drew Bledsoe, but he
wants to be in position to be active every Sunday, a step up from
his role of emergency third quarterback last season.
</P>
<P>
   With veteran John Friesz starting the season in Bill Belichick's
doghouse and with Friesz's contract kicking in for another season
if he plays this year, there's a distinct possibility Bishop could
at least be the relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely put myself in that situation by improving
everyday in practice and making the right reads. I have no control
over it, but I'm making strides toward doing that. I can step up
and be that extra player,''said Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop always seems to garner a lot of attention. Quarterback's
do in general, but on a team that has a superstar quarterback who's
a pocket passer, the opposite of that is often appealing especially
in times when Bledsoe is struggling or in times when the offensive
line is protecting well. Afterall, here's a guy who can run, squirm
out of harms way and make something big happen in the process with
his legs and his arm. There's still that image of last pre-season
when Bishop captured the imagination of his fans with a few
extraordinary athletic feats on the field, dodging would-be
tacklers and making something positive out of something negative.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, he wasn't the second coming of Brett Favre, completing
17 of 34 passes for 299 yards and three touchdowns including a
47-yard pass to Sean Morey, but theyt were a very exciting 34
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the season started, Bishop never saw the football field
except for practice.
</P>
<P>
   In an 8-8 season, that didn't seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect season, Bishop would never see the playing field
because it would mean Bledsoe was being an All-Pro and leading the
Patriots to the playoffs. But after a 6-2 start, it crumbled all
around Bledsoe. The talk shows were heating up with impassioned
pleas to play Bishop. Pete Carroll's staff would never let it
happen. The staff was already on thin ice, it would certainly never
want to be responsible for giving a rookie quarterback a chance to
play over the established Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   So Bishop sat and sat and sat. For a kid who had always been the
center of attention it was difficult. He began talking of going to
the Cleveland Indians' training site in Winter Haven, Fla. and
resuming his baseball career. he balked at going to NFL Europe to
get playing experience in a place like Barcelona where he would
have been an instant star.
</P>
<P>
   When the new regime took over, offensive coordinator Charlie
Weis met with Bishop and thought it best he stay with the team in
the offseason to learn a new system feeling it might be too
confusing for Bishop to work the system in Barcelona and then have
to learn another one in New England.
</P>
<P>
   There's always been talk of getting Bishop's athleticism into a
game in a ``Slash'' role, but evidently that won't materialize.
Weis said that Bishop would learn to play quarterback, comparing
him a lot to former Patriot Ray Lucas, who emerged as a good
quarterback for the Jets last season after being used as a
defensive back, a receiver and a special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Lucas and Bishop is that Bishop has
always been a quarterback while Lucas played quarterback at Rutgers
and then was switched to defensive back by the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the Patriots have told Bishop that if Bledsoe
hits a wall during a game or in a certain situation, Bishop may be
called upon to run a play or two. In practice he's looked
especially good in goal line situations where he has the option to
run. But Wednesday he also showed off his arm strength nailing
Shockmain Davis, a free-agent rookie receiver from Angelo State
down the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new offensive coordinator has some things we've worked on
in practice where I could help the team out. If Drew's winning I'm
going to be happy but if we're losing it could be a different story
and I have to be ready to get my chance,'' Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Always confident, it appears now that Bishop is showing he can
be more than just an athlete playing quarterback. Now he feels like
a quarterback who can do athletic things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I have a better understanding of the offense. I know
what's going on. I'm getting the ball to the right receiver at the
right time. I use practice as a game situation. I envision myself
in the game and I try to carry out the play like it is a game
situation. I think that's helped me. That's why I think it was a
good move to stay here rather than go to Europe. If I had gone to
Europe I'd be a few days behind, days that I wouldn't have been
here learning everything about the offense,'' Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of him, however, would have liked to try the ``Slash''
routine for a while and see if it could work, but ``I'm not
disappointed. I feel I can play quarterback in this league. If they
tried to experiment with something I'd give 110 percent. Right now
just I'll just stick as a quarterback. If I can help the team later
in the season I'll do what ever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is never far away from Bishop's thoughts, either.
Recently, a major league scout who watched Bishop play at Blinn
(Texas) Jr. College a few years ago said Bishop has superb athletic
tools in terms of speed, arm strength and potential power given
he's 6-2, 215 pounds. But the scout said, ``He's so raw it would
take him four or five years to get out of the minors. He'd have to
show he could hit consistently and it seems he had trouble hitting
a curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bishop still plays catch with teammates and plays
in pickup softball games. Last summer he used to take rips in the
batting cage. He has a few teammates who played college baseball
including Kevin Faulk, Patrick Pass, and Tom Brady so it's always
the subject of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if could get established in this league, I'd think about
pursuing baseball again. I haven't ruled it out completely, but now
I'm just concentrating on playing football and being a
quarterback,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun of watching Bishop is imagining what he could
become. So many times in sports great athletes get into the wrong
situation and never live up to their dreams or their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop doesn't want to be one of those which is why when he
steps on the field in Canton, Ohio on July 31st against the 49ers,
Bishop wants to show a nationally televised audience why he was
24-0 in two seasons at Blinn and 22-3 in two seasons at Kansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   And why all Michael Bishop ever does is win.

KARRIE WEBB FEELS PATIENCE CAN BRING A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. _ Hundreds of boys and girls, not to mention men
and women, pulled their shirts and sweaters _ yes, sweaters in July
_ tight against the chill wind blowing from the north, waiting for
The Merit Club's most famous member to finish his duty inside the
press tent.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Michael Jordan wound up his conference before a packed
media horde and rushed out, being led to safety with a quick ride
on a golf cart. Behind him, much as the Pied Piper, hundreds of
youths snaked after Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, perhaps the world's best woman golfer,
Australia's Karrie Webb, sat in the same seat Jordan had vacated
only moments earlier. This time, there were only a handful of media
people and, when Webb was done, a smaller handful of fans was
waiting outside for Webb's autograph.
</P>
<P>
   The small media crowd is easily, if frustratingly, explained. In
sheer idiocy of scheduling, the United States Golf Association
scheduled its 55th US Women's Open Championship the same week as
the men's British Open and virtually all of America's golf media
are across the Atlantic in Scotland, waiting for Tiger Woods to
attack St. Andrews, the birthplace of golf. Few are here in the far
northern (and very affluent) suburbs of Chicago to watch the women.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, like many of the other women, was irked that the spotlight
on the women has been dimmed by the conflict of the Women's Open
with the British Open. ``Obviously,'' said the Aussie, ``we'd all
prefer to have the week all to ourselves as far as the attention
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the spotlight, dim as it is, once again clearly is on Webb
who, despite her brillance, has yet to win a US Open. Lack of
patience, said the Aussie, has led to her downfall in four tries at
the women's biggest tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the spotlight, dim as it is, also is clearly on women's
golf. It is still Nancy Lopez, who played three holes with Jordan
on Tuesday, drawing the crowds although Lopez is a decade past her
prime, just as it still is American Juli Inkster, the 40-year-old
mother of two and defending US Open champion who, even Inkster
concedes, is the heroine of ``working moms'' throughout America.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, as likable and accomplished as any golfer, pointedly
pined for an American girl to step forward and seize women's golf
much as Woods did the same on the men's side three years ago. ``I'd
like to see a good young American come up and play well,'' said
Inkster.
</P>
<P>
   Only then perhaps, Inkster went on, would the average American
sports fan catch on to the excellent golf played by the women. ``A
lot of people out there,'' Inkster wryly noted, ``still think we
hit it 210 yards off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   That up-and-coming American golfer, except perhaps for
23-year-old Kelli Kuehne, is still not visible on the horizon. And,
even with the fiery rivalry between Webb and the 29-year-old Swede,
Annika Sorenstam, that should _ but doesn't _ catch many eyes,
average sports fans aren't soon going to catch on that the women
indeed hit it much farther than 210 yards off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there will be a drama building among the three women
given the best chance to win this Open, Inkster, the red-hot
Sorenstam, who twice has won the Open and has won four of her last
six tournaments and Webb, who won four of the first five
tournaments on the 2000 Women's Tour but hasn't won since taking
the Nabisco Dinah Shore (by 10 strokes) seven tournaments ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam's victory last weekend in the Japan Airlines Big Apple
Classic in New York increased her earnings for the year to
$985,580, nudging by the $963,742 earned by Webb. The two women are
that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I can't do anything with the way Annika has been
playing,'' said Webb, when asked about the rivalry. ``She has
played great, especially in the last couple of months. But I've
just got to keep doing my own thing and just concentrate on my own
game, which is what I've done for 4 1/2 years now. I can't do
anything more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Well . . . except for winning an Open.
</P>
<P>
   Webb has done virtually everything but win the US Open. In her
rookie year of 1996, she won $1,002,000, the most ever won by a
rookie. Twice she has boasted the lowest scoring average on the
LPGA Tour, and last year whe won the Rolex Player of the Year
trophy. Yet, she has been able to finish in the US Open top five
only once (fourth in 1997), and she finished seventh last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eluded me four times now,'' Webb said, playing on the
word ``eluded.'' And the reason why the Open has ``eluded'' her,
she went on, has been her impatience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can lose my patience,'' said the Australian, whose hometown
in Queensland is the same as Greg Norman's. ``Not necessarily on
the first day, or on the second day, and last time, I got to my
third day before losing my patience. I think when I first played in
the US Open, I lost it on my first day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to define ``patience,'' Webb replied with a golfer's true
lament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just get very . . . I go so long with holding things in,''
Webb explained. ``And then just one bad break, one bad swing and I
just . . . I just lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb believes that her ``patience'' is improving, but she notes
a fine distinction between having patience in a regular tour event
and having patience in a major. ``And that's what you have to work
on,'' she said, ``and just try and make the best of it you know,
especially in a major. But I feel as every year goes by, I'm a
little less hard on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally has learned, she said, that in an Open with its deep
rough and slick greens ``that birdies are not going to come as
often as they do on other courses.'' Even more, she said, she has
learned that after a bogey she can't follow her natural instincts
``and say on the next tee, `Alright, I'm going to get it straight
back.' That's because at a US Open you can't always get it straight
back, but you might get it on the next hole, two holes later or six
holes later.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the season, Webb did everything right, winning
four of her first five tournaments. And when asked to explain the
difference between her golf game then and her game now, Webb gave
an indirect compliment to Woods while saying it is impossible to
win week after week in tournament golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know myself that you just can't continue, although there is
one person out there who proves my theory wrong right now,'' said
Webb. ``But you just can't continue to win week in and week out.
You know, it's tiring.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jordan handicapped which of the women would do
better on the golf course he knows so well. In between ducking
question after question about the sad plight of his old team, the
Bulls, Jordan said The Merit Course will be a tough test. His best
score here ``was a 69, but that was three years ago when I didn't
have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan narrowed his selections to two _ ``Webb, but I would not
rule out Juli Inskter. This is a putter's course; if she can get
that putter straight, then she can shoot some low numbers. I would
pick Juli right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But this course ``is what drives me nuts about golf,'' Jordan
went on, paraphrasing Webb's lack of patience. ``When you think
you've got your game, you don't have your game,'' said the
basketball great. Jordan recalled his baseball days ``when one of
the players told me about golf. You've got to play your foul balls
in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   As Karrie Webb now knows too well.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``foul balls'' must be played.
</P>
<P>
   But patiently.

 BMW'S Z3 IS A VETERAN AMONG RISING TIDE OF DROP-TOPS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL   FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time flies here in the world of autos.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the midst of a resurgence of drop-top sports cars,
touched off by Mazda's Miata well over a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Challengers followed in a trickle and then a torrent, but it
seems hard to believe the BMW Z3 is already a veteran bobbing on
that flood.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are with a 2000 Z3 2.3 roadster. The 2.3 (six cylinders,
2.5 liters) is not as powerful as the 2.8- and 3.2-liter versions _
a docile pup compared to the M Coupe _ but snappy nonetheless. It
is a far superior engine to the 1.9-liter, four-cylinder it
replaces. And, if you can do without the leather package, this is a
quality buy at $31,000. You can do a lot worse than this at that
price.
</P>
<P>
   The Z3 is a better-looking car than it was at introduction. It
still has the jutting-bully's-chin look up front, muscular and long
and humped. But the rear has been redesigned, given a rise and
flare that is far more pleasing to the eye than the chopped, low
box of the original.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the car you take for a comparison test if you are
considering a Porsche Boxster or a Honda S2000. If you want to get
into that league, you'll need the 3.2-liter for fair comparison.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're considering a Toyota MR2, Mazda Miata, or
Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, then stack this up against them. It may
cost a bit more but may be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's as quick as most people want to travel.
</P>
<P>
   From start to 80 miles per hour is a sudden rush accompanied by
the subdued burble of the exhaust. Downshift from fifth to fourth
on the highway and you'll have at your disposal all the torque you
need for quick passing. It moves through traffic with precision.
</P>
<P>
   Take it on twisting back roads and you really get to play. Set
your inside front wheel on any curved line you want to follow and
it will stick to that line just as the M coupe performed _ as if
riding a rail.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.3 did not have the power of the M3 coupe I tested a year
ago, so it is hard to compare the body stiffness of the hardtop
with this roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say that, with this engine, body twist was negligent
and even the tightest turns did not seem to torque the body of the
roadster. Only on sudden bumps at higher speeds _ such as a joint
in the highway _ did I feel a shudder that might be attributed to
the 2.3 being a convertible.
</P>
<P>
   As for the five-speed manual transmission, the 2.3 used it all
and used it well. Dropping into third to set a course through a
corner gave a great sense of touch to the steering. Popping up into
fifth after passing someone and then moving back into the travel
lane was a smooth, gliding exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this, of course, can be attributed to the 2.3's Dynamic
Stability Control. If its control unit senses one of the rear drive
wheels spinning faster than the other, it cuts motor torque and
gently applies the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn this option off and you move back a couple of decades to
when you could take a light, rear-wheel-drive car with some power
under the hood and induce oversteer with a quick jab at the gas
pedal. And that, too, can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   Be assured, however, that this is not a car you'd want to rely
on for ski trips to the north in winter, or even for your main mode
of transportation through snowy months.
</P>
<P>
   It sits too low to the ground and DSC in a rear-wheel-drive car,
I have learned, does not help much when you need to get up a snowy
slope or climb an icy patch. One Mercedes I tested, in fact, worked
better with its stability control system turned off.
</P>
<P>
   So picture this more as a nine-months-a-year car _ a car you
literally wear as you drive it. The fit is that tight once you are
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Its leather seats are slung low and wrap your thighs and
shoulders in support. Two long pockets up front give plenty of room
for the legs, though someone whose legs would fill those pockets
might find his or her head rubbing the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, it remains a bit retro _ silver trim to gauges,
an analog clock at center dash.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space inside is virtually nonexistent with shallow bins
on each door, and a center console with two cupholders and a
narrow, shallow bin that will hold a cellphone or a pair of
sunglasses, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   For trips, the trunk would hold two pieces of luggage of airline
carry-on size, so you would need to pack carefully. From my
experience, you'd expect to get about 20 miles per gallon on your
trip and you'd have to put up with louder than normal wind noise
from the closed convertible top.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the more expensive sports cars at the lower end
of the spectrum, but it is not so expensive that folks looking at
the others should not consider it. Its quality, performance, and
handling are pure BMW and the few extra dollars may well be worth
it to you.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The mesh net zipped between and behind the seats. It does a
great job of cutting airflow from the rear with the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Operation of the convertible top. The button for the optional
automatic top is located at the back of the console and is hard to
find. When you do find it, you have to first unlatch the roof,
depress that button, hold a foot on the brake, and manually raise
the roof's first section a few inches before the automatic kicks
in. Way too complicated.

CREATING A CAR BOOMERS WANT TO BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John E. Keilly, manager of a Ford Motor Company project that is
studying what kinds of vehicles baby boomers will want in the
future, is not a man to pull punches, even when assessing his own
company. Hard and honest assessments come with the job.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising when he stands before members of the New
England Motor Press Association and says that, even as Ford has led
the pack in cutting-edge pickup truck sales, an ominous trend has
lurked in the other big part of what Ford sells: automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In studies, Keilly says, Ford kept hearing, ``Ford trucks are
great, but their cars suck.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Ford's Leading Edge Boomer Project with a background
that included trucks, vans, and SUVs _ all popular with boomers in
recent years in a way that cars have not been.
</P>
<P>
   His task now? Analyze what Ford calls ``The revolution in
maturity.'
</P>
<P>
   The ``leading boomers,'' he says, were born between 1947 and
1955. ``Trailing boomers'' followed through 1965. Selling cars to
these combined groups is not the same as selling to a homogenized,
monolithic block.
</P>
<P>
   There are boomers who are now ``empty-nesters'' _ children gone,
they may not need that minivan or big SUV any longer. Some boomers
are having children late in life. Others are caring for their aging
parents. Others still are what Keilly calls ``boomerang catchers''
whose children, and perhaps grandchildren, have moved back in with
them.
</P>
<P>
   How to sell to this group that makes up 30 percent of the US
population?
</P>
<P>
   Don't just think cars, says Keilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about trucks and cars,'' he says in seeming
contradiction. ``It's things like kitchens.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been a mantra at Ford ever since the day company head
Jac Nasser walked through the design department and told employees
he wanted them to know about American tastes in furniture, in
kitchen utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Keilly expands on this to say designers need to ask themselves
why the Big Bertha golf Club, for instance, sells so well. It is
all about an essence that goes beyond simply utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a product that everyone likes a little bit,''
he says. If you want to sell a car, it needs to attract a devoted
following.
</P>
<P>
   It is a phenomenon that appears to be enveloping the Ford Focus,
the compact yet roomy _ and inexpensive _ new model that is selling
not only to a targeted youth market but also to older buyers with
limited incomes.
</P>
<P>
   But as Keilly points out, a main reason boomers are
revolutionizing ``maturity'' is that they have a lot of money. And
women, in particular, he says, have more money than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor magazines appeal to this daring and enabled generation
in ads that feature adventure vacations. Many may be, he says,
closer to their sixties than The Sixties, but they have not lost
their taste for experimentation, for causes, for daring.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be why Ford, as it seeks to boost its car lineup, can
offer as appealing and cutting edge _ though practical _ an auto as
the Focus, and at the same time have on the ramps its reborn
Thunderbird, coming back for the 2002 model year, or a souped-up
version of the Mustang, hot pony car of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the 2000 SVT Mustang Cobra R, with its muscular
looks, 385-horsepower engine, advanced suspension and top speed of
170 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   So as boomers age, and Ford works at one end of the spectrum to
attract new young buyers, it also must attempt to lure to its auto
lineup aging boomers, offering adventure and youthful appeal, even
while considering factors like vision, dexterity, mobility, and
weight.
</P>
<P>
   It is a balancing act, Keilly says, that means Ford designers
and marketers will have to look not just at meeting a budget in
producing a car, but also whether sticking to that budget will
affect customer devotion to any new model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you've met your cost objective'' (in developing
and selling a new model), he says, ``doesn't mean the car has
succeeded.''

&HT;     SBC TO OFFER MOVIES OVER HIGH-SPEED INTERNET LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SANFORD NOWLIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ SBC Communications Inc. is gearing up to give its
DSL subscribers fast access not just to the Internet but to movies
and games.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, the San Antonio-based parent of the Southwestern Bell
telephone company, said it would test a new service unveiled
Wednesday by entertainment giant Blockbuster Inc. and Enron Corp.,
an energy company, that allows customers to order movies, games and
other entertainment via high-speed Internet lines known as DSL, or
digital subscriber lines.
</P>
<P>
   The service, called video-on-demand, will allow customers to
order a movie to view on their television or computer, but unlike a
conventional pay-per-view movie, they can start it when they want
and pause or rewind as they would a videocassette.
</P>
<P>
   SBC will offer the service over its DSL lines to about 5,000
customers in two or three cities by year's end, officials said. The
company wants ultimately to be able to offer it to all its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of SBC's aggressive efforts to bring broadband to
the masses,'' said Jason Few, SBC's vice president of broadband
services. ``There's no question that video-on-demand and other
services we plan to offer will expand our DSL market beyond just
computer users.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC has not yet selected its test markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Blockbuster, the top video rental chain, will
provide programming for the new service, and Houston-based Enron
will deliver it via a nationwide fiber-optic network it has
developed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to SBC, the two companies have signed up other DSL
providers, including Verizon (the company formed by the merger of
Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp.) and Qwest Communications, to
participate in the test.
</P>
<P>
   They need the help of carriers such as SBC and Verizon to
deliver their service from Enron's network into homes. DSL lines,
which allow access to the Internet at blazing speeds, are needed to
handle the large amount of data necessary to transmit video.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster and Enron, which agreed to work together for 20
years on the video-on-demand project, want to make their service
available across the United States and internationally some time
next year.
</P>
<P>
   SBC increasingly gets its revenue from data and Internet
services rather than traditional phone service. The company
recently earmarked $6 billion to roll out DSL to 80 percent of its
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Like other major telecom carriers, SBC wants to provide
customers a full range of phone, Internet and video services on one
monthly bill. It last year added another video component to the mix
when it agreed to resell DirecTV satellite service.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television companies are gearing up to offer their own
video-on-demand services. Time Warner, for example, is testing such
a service in Austin and expects to roll it out here next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Blockbuster-Enron venture, however, is the first major
attempt to offer such a service over DSL lines.
</P>
<P>
   The technical difficulties of such a large project may prove
daunting for the two companies, both of which are newcomers to the
broadcasting business, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's done this before on the scale they're talking
about,'' said Jim Penhune, an analyst with Yankee Group in Boston.
``It will be a significant challenge to get the number of customers
installed that they're talking about.''

<P>
   VIENNA, Va. _ Shielded by a shade tree from the midday sun,
Nancy Luciani sits in a trim municipal park as her son and a gaggle
of other 6-year-olds chase a ball across a grassy field. Nearby are
all the trappings of life in the 'burbs: the jogging strollers, the
minivans, the fellow parents waiting to ferry their kids to their
next summer activity.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani is a 36-year-old mom watching her kid play soccer. But
do not call her a ``soccer mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The soccer-mom term is so derogatory. It suggests that all
women think and feel the same way,'' says Luciani, a former
corporate systems analyst and now full-time mother of three from
Oakton, Va., a suburb of Washington. ``Women care about a lot of
different things.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas care a lot about women _ and their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, soccer moms gained almost mythical stature among
campaign operatives and political commentators as a coveted swing
voting bloc that would re-elect President Clinton or give
Republican Bob Dole a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, as they had in '92, a majority of women voters handed
Bill Clinton a decisive victory, demonstrating their traditional
preference for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the neck-and-neck 2000 presidential campaign is a
different story. According to polls, Bush is cutting into the
conventional Democratic advantage with women, the very voters Gore
must have if he expects to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real clear that younger women, mothers, married women,
are key battleground groups,'' said pollster Andrew Kohut, director
of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the campaign illustrates just how hard Bush and
Gore are trying to appeal to the bloc _ each touting proposals for
education, children, health care and community values.
</P>
<P>
   But women voters are no monolith.
</P>
<P>
   Working women naturally are interested in the economy,
fair-labor issues and women's rights. Working moms care about those
things too, plus day-care and family leave. Stay-at-home mothers
pay attention to education and family values. For many but not most
women, abortion is a make-or-break issue, depending on which side
of the issue they are on.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms, suburb moms, mall moms _ by any other name, this
target group is mainly young, mainly white and mainly living in
suburbs and small towns. They represent anywhere between 5 and 20
percent of the electorate, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this group of women so important as a voting bloc are
men.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-Republican gender gap exists because men
abandoned the Democratic party during the Reagan era in the 1980s
and, to a greater extent, in the midterm elections of 1994 that
elected a Republican Congress. Since early 1999, surveys show that
Bush has consistently drawn greater support from men compared to
Gore, leading by an average of 20 percentage points in recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the battle for women, the stakes are greatest for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he holds what several recent polls describe as only a
slight lead among all women, and in some surveys he lags among
married women. A Pew Research Center poll in late June found Gore
trailing Bush among mothers, 45 percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, women have been a core constituency for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the presidency from Bush's father in 1992, Clinton
garnered 45 percent of the women's vote, compared to 37 percent for
the elder Bush. In 1996, Clinton doubled his victory margin to 16
percentage points, beating Dole among women voters 54 percent to 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Gore losing some of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is smart. He's talking about issues that women do care
about _ education, children's health, Social Security. He speaks
with a more credible voice on these issues than previous Republican
candidates have,'' said Anna Greenberg, a pollster at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for Al Gore to shore up the traditional base,
and the base includes important blocs of Democratic and independent
women voters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some pollsters and political analysts detect a potentially
more troublesome factor for Gore. Many women voters, when gauging
qualities such as character and trust, view him negatively.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show Bush out-polling Gore on character
evaluations and leadership qualities. Gore's poll numbers dipped in
June amid news reports that Justice Department officials had
recommended that an independent counsel probe the vice president's
1996 campaign finance activities.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Browning, a high-school teacher and 41-year-old mother
of three in Vienna, Va., voted for Clinton in 1992 and in 1996 and
considers herself a solid Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But she does not like Gore, and cannot bring herself to support
Bush. Instead, she'll vote for third-party candidate and consumer
advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want authenticity. Someone who seems genuine and not
sculpted by some marketing specialist,'' she said. ``I just don't
trust him (Gore) because he seems so contradictory depending on the
audience he's talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaigns for governor in Texas, Bush proved popular with
women voters. Running against a woman, Democratic incumbent Ann
Richards in 1994, Bush split the women's vote. In 1998, Bush won
re-election with 65 percent of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush thus far has
commanded the presidential campaign agenda and prevented Gore from
stressing the kinds of issues most appealing to women, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fashioned himself as ``the low-risk change,'' said
Thomas Mann, a scholar of government and politics at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center.
</P>
<P>
   Voters detect few differences between the candidates on bedrock
issues like health care and education. That has given Bush an edge
in appealing to both women and men as the anti-Washington candidate
by focusing ``on changing the way we conduct politics,'' Mann said
</P>
<P>
   Yet many pollsters and political scholars dismiss the notion
that Gore has been tainted directly by President Clinton and the
scandals that plagued his administration, most notably the affair
with Monica Lewinsky that led to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore and the Democrats may suffer a credibility problem when
campaigning on family values _ issues such as community, parenting
and morals that women in particular rank high among their
priorities, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, Clinton has given the Republicans those issues
and made it difficult for the Democrats to talk about them,''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in March asked women what factor is most important
in their vote this year. They were evenly split, with 47 percent
naming an issue or issues and 47 percent citing character and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani, the soccer mom who detests the label, ranks the
character of the candidate and issues involving the economy,
education and family values high on her list. A self-described
independent voter, she says Gore was nsaid the pollster Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those younger married women or young mothers were always for
Clinton, not for Dole. They thought Dole was out on another planet,
and they couldn't relate to him. But younger women are having a
real hard time choosing between Bush and Gore in a way that they
didn't have four years ago.''

 &HT;    WOMEN'S VOTE UP FOR GRABS THIS YEAR, TO GORE'S DISMAY
 &HT;    1100&AMP;add. With VOTERS-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories for release Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Va. _ Shielded by a shade tree from the midday sun,
Nancy Luciani sits in a trim municipal park as her son and a gaggle
of other 6-year-olds chase a ball across a grassy field. Nearby are
all the trappings of life in the 'burbs: the jogging strollers, the
minivans, the fellow parents waiting to ferry their kids to their
next summer activity.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani is a 36-year-old mom watching her kid play soccer. But
do not call her a ``soccer mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The soccer-mom term is so derogatory. It suggests that all
women think and feel the same way,'' says Luciani, a former
corporate systems analyst and now full-time mother of three from
Oakton, Va., a suburb of Washington. ``Women care about a lot of
different things.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas care a lot about women _ and their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, soccer moms gained almost mythical stature among
campaign operatives and political commentators as a coveted swing
voting bloc that would re-elect President Clinton or give
Republican Bob Dole a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, as they had in '92, a majority of women voters handed
Bill Clinton a decisive victory, demonstrating their traditional
preference for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the neck-and-neck 2000 presidential campaign is a
different story. According to polls, Bush is cutting into the
conventional Democratic advantage with women, the very voters Gore
must have if he expects to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real clear that younger women, mothers, married women,
are key battleground groups,'' said pollster Andrew Kohut, director
of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the campaign illustrates just how hard Bush and
Gore are trying to appeal to the bloc _ each touting proposals for
education, children, health care and community values.
</P>
<P>
   But women voters are no monolith.
</P>
<P>
   Working women naturally are interested in the economy,
fair-labor issues and women's rights. Working moms care about those
things too, plus day-care and family leave. Stay-at-home mothers
pay attention to education and family values. For many but not most
women, abortion is a make-or-break issue, depending on which side
of the issue they are on.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms, suburb moms, mall moms _ by any other name, this
target group is mainly young, mainly white and mainly living in
suburbs and small towns. They represent anywhere between 5 and 20
percent of the electorate, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this group of women so important as a voting bloc are
men.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-Republican gender gap exists because men
abandoned the Democratic party during the Reagan era in the 1980s
and, to a greater extent, in the midterm elections of 1994 that
elected a Republican Congress. Since early 1999, surveys show that
Bush has consistently drawn greater support from men compared to
Gore, leading by an average of 20 percentage points in recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the battle for women, the stakes are greatest for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he holds what several recent polls describe as only a
slight lead among all women, and in some surveys he lags among
married women. A Pew Research Center poll in late June found Gore
trailing Bush among mothers, 45 percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, women have been a core constituency for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the presidency from Bush's father in 1992, Clinton
garnered 45 percent of the women's vote, compared to 37 percent for
the elder Bush. In 1996, Clinton doubled his victory margin to 16
percentage points, beating Dole among women voters 54 percent to 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Gore losing some of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is smart. He's talking about issues that women do care
about _ education, children's health, Social Security. He speaks
with a more credible voice on these issues than previous Republican
candidates have,'' said Anna Greenberg, a pollster at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for Al Gore to shore up the traditional base,
and the base includes important blocs of Democratic and independent
women voters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some pollsters and political analysts detect a potentially
more troublesome factor for Gore. Many women voters, when gauging
qualities such as character and trust, view him negatively.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show Bush out-polling Gore on character
evaluations and leadership qualities. Gore's poll numbers dipped in
June amid news reports that Justice Department officials had

</P>

<P>
   ``If I didn't know anything about him, if he were starting from
zero, I would consider him,'' she said. ``But knowing about him and
his connections to the Clinton administration, I'd say 'no.' ``
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican nominating convention, convening July 31 in
Philadelphia, the podium with be filled with ample evidence of the
GOP strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Day One: The candidate's wife, Laura Bush, and former Gen. Colin
Powell will address issues of health care, education and Bush's
``leave no child behind'' theme. Day Two: former presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole and GOP adviser Condoleeza Rice will
emphasize America's place in the world. Day Three: a focus on small
business, a traditional Republican theme and one that plays to a
current trend _ about half of all new small businesses are run by
women.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in Los Angeles in mid-August, Gore and the Democrats
will stress the important issues separating him and Bush: gun
control, abortion rights and the party's traditional role as a
defender of equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that, with four months remaining until the
election, much about the character of the race can and probably
will change. Many voters, women and men, have yet to focus on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, women appear much more likely than in the past to
consider the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in '96 the soccer moms, or what that meant, was
baloney,'' said the pollster Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those younger married women or young mothers were always for
Clinton, not for Dole. They thought Dole was out on another planet,
and they couldn't relate to him. But younger women are having a
real hard time choosing between Bush and Gore in a way that they
didn't have four years ago.''

&HT;     MONET FANS HAVE ANOTHER MUSEUM TO VISIT IN PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANTONIA KAPLAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Admirers of Claude Monet have a new mecca to visit here,
a jewel of a museum showcasing the world's largest collection of
the master's work.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant building, now called the Marmottan-Claude Monet
Museum, is one of Paris' best-kept secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in a residential neighborhood on the city's west
side near the Bois de Boulogne, it used to be called the Marmottan
Museum. But after extensive renovation, it reopened in April with
its new name, its greatly expanded gallery space and its entire
Monet collection on display.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it had held much of the Impressionist painter's art
in storage.
</P>
<P>
   The Monet collection boasts 100 oils and 37 other works _
pastels, caricatures and pen and ink drawings. It includes some of
the artist's most famous paintings: ``Impression of Sunrise,''
``Houses of Parliament,'' a ``Rouen Cathedral'' and many of the
``Water Lilies'' that he painted in his gardens during the 43 years
that he lived in Giverny, north of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Monet, who died in 1926 at the age of 86, is perhaps the best
known of the Impressionists. A water lily painting recently sold
for about $21 million at a Christie's auction.
</P>
<P>
   Monet inadvertently gave the Impressionist movement its name. He
included his ``Impression of Sunrise,'' with its ball of red rising
out of the blue mist at the port of Le Havre, France, in an exhibit
here in 1874. It stood out among paintings by such artists as
Pierre Auguste Renoir, Paul Cezanne, Camille Pissaro, Edgar Degas,
Alfred Sisley and Berthe Morisot.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Leroy, a leading critic at the time, looked around and
decided that the artists there _ the whole lot of them _ were
incompetent. He spotted Monet's title with the word ``impression''
and ridiculed the group's idea of using the play of light and color
to capture momentary scenes. Monet and the others, Leroy wrote,
were capable only of giving impressions and not of painting real
pictures. He entitled his scornful critique ``The Impressionists.''
</P>
<P>
   In its three-year renovation, the museum scooped out space under
its garden to create additional viewing areas. One is a magnificent
circular gallery where, hung all around it, are fine
representatives of the collection's 45 water-lily paintings,
donated by Monet's son Michel.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was originally a hunting lodge, purchased in 1882 by
Jules Marmottan and turned into a private residence by his son, art
collector Paul Marmottan. When he died in 1932, he bequeathed the
residence and its collections, including one of 19th century
furniture and sculpture, to the French Academy of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The mansion also displays works of other artists including
Monet's friends Renoir, Pissaro, Morisot, Sisley, Edouard Manet and
Paul Gauguin.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing the renovation was Arnaud d'Hauterives, a 67-year-old
painter who was the museum's director for 12 years before he
retired this spring to concentrate on his work as permanent
secretary of the prestigious fine arts academy.
</P>
<P>
   D'Hauterives, who for years had an apartment at the museum,
said, ``I will miss having breakfast with Monet, but my job here is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, located at No. 2 rue Louis-Boilly, is open every day
except Monday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Individual tickets cost 40
francs, about $7.

   EAST HORSLEY, England _ My 6-year-old son made an American flag
for the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it had a dozen or so stars and not exactly the right number
of stripes _ but he drew it from a faint memory distorted by the
cartoonish American flags we see on everything here from blue jeans
to popcorn bags. We're talking about a little boy who probably has
never heard the ``Star Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he wanted to display his paper flag in front of our house.
I was touched, but I couldn't bring myself to stick it outside. I
placed it on another place of honor: the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because it was gray, rainy and about 55 degrees
on the Fourth here, which would have made short work of the paper
flag. But it was more than that.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't want to draw attention to the fact that this very
English house in this very English neighborhood was full of
Americans. I think they all already know our secret because we
smile at strangers and leave at our curb 10 bags of garbage each
week to their two (wasteful American consumerism, packaged food,
disposable everything, etc.). Then there's the steady scent of
charring meat drifting from our backyard, clear evidence of
Americans trying to simulate summer in this country of eternal
February.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm no Anglophile. I'm proud of being an
American. In fact, I'm not sure I knew I was an American until I
moved to England. I had always thought myself a Texan or Atlantan
or at least a Southerner _ but never a nationality. You almost have
to be set among other people to see how they see you before you
feel part of a distinct tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that stupid Mel Gibson movie. Even before it
opened here last weekend, the British press had been apoplectic
about The Patriot, which depicts the English _ or at least a few
English soldiers _ as pathological, murdering fops.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie starring Australians directed by a German depicting
events that never happened in America.
</P>
<P>
   This follows of a series of American-inspired insults, including
Dan Rather's boorish proclamation that beneath the charming green
English facade lurks a violence-ridden society with crime rates on
par with the United States. (I think they were most offended that
this wasn't Dan's lead item.)
</P>
<P>
   While it's troubling that crime is on the rise in England, the
comparison is absurd. If you live in America, the odds that you
will be shot to death are 60 times higher than in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood remains the worst offender. First, there was Saving
Private Ryan, which, in the hyper-sensitive minds of some British
commentators, neglected to note that anybody but Americans and
Germans showed up on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the movie U-571 has Americans _ not Brits _
capturing the Enigma machine from the Germans, thus allowing the
Allies to decode enemy communications. And even the quasi-British
production Chicken Run, has a bunch of silly British hens
overshadowed by the suave, if roguish American rooster. (Mel Gibson
again. Is this a trend?)
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling among Britons that American films are
stealing their history _ which is pretty much all they have left.
They are proud that they resisted tyrants such as Napoleon and
Hitler. (I'm waiting for Hollywood to produce a movie with Mel
Gibson as a revenge-minded American kicking butt at Waterloo.)
</P>
<P>
   You look around here and cannot escape that this was once the
center of a vast empire. But there is no British Empire anymore. In
fact, there's barely a Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So, I feel for the Brits, and I'm mortified by the noisy and
never-ending success story that is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other night my wife Melinda and I watched a dazzling display
of fireworks with some friends, both English and American. At the
end of the splendid show, the American woman piped in, ``You think
that was fireworks? You should see the Fourth of July back home.''
Our English friends _ who love America _ smiled politely, but I
cringed. As a Southerner, I've heard enough ``you should see''
comments from Yankees for a lifetime and know better than to
inflict this obnoxiousness on others.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Melinda and I finally went to see the
dreaded movie.
</P>
<P>
   It was worse than I could have imagined. Mel Gibson and two
little boys armed with flintlocks dropped 20 British troops _
apparently not trained to find cover _ with less effort than I
expended as a youth blasting confused and unarmed quail.
</P>
<P>
   In the climactic scene, Gibson's character finds a wooden
flagpole, lethal weapon enough to whack a few of the king's
soldiers armed only with muskets, swords and bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, many Brits seem to take this in stride. Some
writers even said they wouldn't mind that their ancestors are cast
as ``baddies,'' so long as the film is entertaining. They are
offended more by the movie's shoddiness than by its insults to
their national pride.
</P>
<P>
   After the agony of watching the movie, I asked a nice older
couple from Farnham, a village outside London, what they thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very powerful film,'' said the husband, Mike Wheeler,
with a laugh. ``I ducked when that cannon ball went rolling across
the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor his wife Jackie was troubled by the depiction of
the English soldiers. They dismiss the sociopathic behavior of the
really bad English officer as predictable behavior by the
upper-classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were aristocrats, weren't they,'' Jackie Wheeler
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were as bad as anybody else in war,'' said her husband.
``Who can argue with history?''

most offended that this wasn't Dan's lead item.)
</P>
<P>
   While it's troubling that crime is on the rise in England, the
comparison is absurd. If you live in America, the odds that you
will be shot to death are 60 times higher than in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood remains the worst offender. First, there was Saving
Private Ryan, which, in the hyper-sensitive minds of some British
commentators, neglected to note that anybody but Americans and
Germans showed up on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the movie U-571 has Americans _ not Brits _
capturing the Enigma machine from the Germans, thus allowing the
Allies to decode enemy communications. And even the quasi-British
production Chicken Run, has a bunch of silly British hens
overshadowed by the suave, if roguish American rooster. (Mel Gibson
again. Is this a trend?)
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling among Britons that American films are
stealing their history _ which is pretty much all they have left.
They are proud that they resisted tyrants such as Napoleon and
Hitler. (I'm waiting for Hollywood to produce a movie with Mel
Gibson as a revenge-minded American kicking butt at Waterloo.)
</P>
<P>
   You look around here and cannot escape that this was once the
center of a vast empire. But there is no British Empire anymore. In
fact, there's barely a Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So, I feel for the Brits, and I'm mortified by the noisy and
never-ending success story that is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The other night my wife Melinda and I watched a dazzling display
of fireworks with some friends, both English and American. At the
end of the splendid show, the American woman piped in, ``You think
that was fireworks? You should see the Fourth of July back home.''
Our English friends _ who love America _ smiled politely, but I
cringed. As a Southerner, I've heard enough ``you should see''
comments from Yankees for a lifetime and know better than to
inflict this obnoxiousness on others.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Melinda and I finally went to see the
dreaded movie.
</P>
<P>
   It was worse than I could have imagined. Mel Gibson and two
little boys armed with flintlocks dropped 20 British troops _
apparently not trained to find cover _ with less effort than I
expended as a youth blasting confused and unarmed quail.
</P>
<P>
   In the climactic scene, Gibson's character finds a wooden
flagpole, lethal weapon enough to whack a few of the king's
soldiers armed only with muskets, swords and bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, many Brits seem to take this in stride. Some
writers even said they wouldn't mind that their ancestors are cast
as ``baddies,'' so long as the film is entertaining. They are
offended more by the movie's shoddiness than by its insults to
their national pride.
</P>
<P>
   After the agony of watching the movie, I asked a nice older
couple from Farnham, a village outside London, what they thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very powerful film,'' said the husband, Mike Wheeler,
with a laugh. ``I ducked when that cannon ball went rolling across
the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor his wife Jackie was troubled by the depiction of
the English soldiers. They dismiss the sociopathic behavior of the
really bad English officer as predictable behavior by the
upper-classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were aristocrats, weren't they,'' Jackie Wheeler
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were as bad as anybody else in war,'' said her husband.
``Who can argue with history?''

 &HT;    Rowling rules Times' kids best sellers
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times launches its children's best-seller list
Sunday, and to no one's surprise, the top four spots are occupied
by J.K. Rowling novels, including the just-released ``Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire'' at No. 1. Following in No. 5 and 6 are
``Backstreet Boys: The Official Book'' by Andre Csillag and ``Oh,
the Places You'll Go!'' by Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' book review editor, Charles McGrath, says the new
list was created to clear some room on the adult list. But if the
Times editors thought that kicking Harry Potter off the adult
fiction list would make room for more literary works, they were
mistaken. Only one, ``The Bluest Eye'' by Toni Morrison, crept into
the top 10. Others making the list were ``Omerta'' by Mario Puzo
(No. 5) and ``The Fighting Agents'' by W.E.B. Griffin (No. 7).
Instead of Potter, the top three books on the adult list are ``The
House on Hope Street'' by Danielle Steel, ``Cradle and All'' by
James Patterson and ``Heartbreaker'' by Julie Garwood.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scary stuff: Get out your pruning shears. The first shoots of
Stephen King's online novel-in-progress, ``The Plant,'' will begin
climbing through the Web (www.stephenking.com) Monday. The
epistolary novel is set in the early 1980s and is ``sort of funny
and at the same time pretty gruesome (think `Christine'),'' King
notes on his Web site. The novel will be presented in segments
ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 words at $1 each on the honor system.
King says he doesn't mind if readers make copies of the
installments after they pay, but if they don't pay, he will stop
offering chapters. If it works, he adds, ``My friends, we have a
chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  After the storm: What does a 35-year-old free-lance writer
tackle next when his first book, ``The Perfect Storm,'' sells more
than 1.5 million copies? Apparently, anything he wants. Sebastian
Junger tells National Geographic Adventure magazine that some
publishers have even offered him blank contracts. ``I just told my
agent I won't be interested for years.'' Meanwhile, he has opened
the Half King, a restaurant and bar on Tenth Avenue and 23rd Street
in Manhattan where literary readings will be held. And this
September he's going to Afghanistan to report on the extremist
Taliban government.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the works: Winston Groom (``Forrest Gump'') returns to
print this fall with ``The Crimson Tide: An Illustrated History of
Football at the University of Alabama'' (Alabama Press, $39.95).
Other contributors include announcer Keith Jackson and authors Gay
Talese, Willie Morris and Howell Raines. The press is also
reissuing Raines' debut novel, ``Whiskey Man,'' about a boy in
Depression-era Alabama. ... Salon.com has sold a collection of its
pieces to Villard for a book to be published in October. ``Salon's
Wanderlust: Real-Life Tales of Adventure and Romance'' will include
essays by Isabel Allende and Jan Morris.

&HT;     WHITE HOUSE PRIVACY ADVISER IS A COMPUTER WIZZARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For Release Sunday, July 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The trail that led Peter Swire to the White House
as President Clinton's chief adviser on privacy matters began when
he worked the computers at his family's furniture stores in Albany,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   There amid the dining room and living room sets, he was inspired
when his father, Bill Swire, charged headlong into the computer era
in the 1970s. The elder Swire, whom his son described as a
``pioneer'' in the business uses of computers, developed a system
for tracking furniture inventory, sales and accounts that he
marketed nationwide through IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``By today's standards (computers) were primitive, but they
could keep customer records much more accurately, and create
reports so management could make better decisions,'' said Swire,
42, in an interview at his office in the ornate Old Executive
Office Building next to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   From such modest roots flowered a lifelong interest in the
social policy implications of the age of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton University, where he graduated in 1980, his
undergraduate thesis was on information technology and how it
affected legal and economic thought.
</P>
<P>
   As a law student at Yale and then as a judicial clerk, legal
practitioner and law school professor, Swire formulated the issue
as a series of questions. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   __ How do you maintain privacy in an era where computer
technology makes it increasingly easy for prying eyes _ including
those of the government _ to keep tabs on what you buy, your
health, and who you talk to?
</P>
<P>
   __ Where do you draw the line between the legitimate needs of
business and government, and the Constitution's guarantee that
people shall ``be secure in their persons, houses, papers and
effects''?
</P>
<P>
   Swire has brought such questions into the White House as the
government's overall coordinator on privacy issues. Since becoming
Clinton's chief counselor for privacy in March 1999, he has tackled
a host of thorny privacy issues, most of them relating to computers
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He's worked on these issues:
</P>
<P>
   __ Privacy of personal health information. Rules promulgated by
President Clinton last year will limit the release of sensitive
health records for non-medical purposes unless patients give their
consent. Such information would no longer be forwarded to lenders
or employers who might use it for credit or job-related decisions.
The rules are expected to be finalized later this summer and put
into effect two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   __ Genetic discrimination. Clinton issued an executive order
last February barring the federal government from using genetic
information in hiring and promotion decisions. Such information at
times has been used to analyze a worker's likelihood of contracting
diseases or passing on birth defects. Clinton is supporting
legislation to outlaw genetic discrimination in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   __ Financial privacy. Clinton last year signed legislation
allowing banks to get involved with the insurance and securities
industries, but not before lawmakers beefed up the law's privacy
guarantees. Under this law, banks and other financial institutions
are not permitted to divulge personal information to outside
entities without a customer's consent.
</P>
<P>
   It takes effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the thorniest problem on Swire's plate is the effort of
federal law enforcement to beef up its ability to monitor private
computer transactions, including e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have effective law enforcement tools to stop cyber
crime, but you also want to strongly protect privacy and civil
liberties on the Internet,'' he said. ``So the job is to come up
with proposals that do both of those.''
</P>
<P>
   The task is not a simple one. News reports this month about the
FBI's Carnivore system _ an electronic eavesdropping device used to
ferret out the investigative ``meat'' in vast quantities of data _
have drawn heated complaints from privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Swire said the White House was not aware of Carnivore prior to
news accounts this month detailing it. But, he added, the
administration's answer to privacy concerns about Carnivore is to
push legislation that would require agents to obtain warrants for
monitoring the content of e-mails and other computer
communications. It would elevate computers to the level of
telephones in terms of access by law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, agents investigating who a suspect is
e-mailing or instant-messaging need only certify to a judge that
the information is necessary for a criminal investigation. It's the
same standard that applies to agents seeking a telephone ``pen
register'' _ a record of who a suspect is calling and getting calls
from.
</P>
<P>
   But the new White House proposal would elevate this standard for
so-called ``trap-and-trace'' orders significantly, for both
telephones and computers. Under the White House proposal, a judge
would issue such an order only after making an independent factual
finding of whether the agent had shown sufficient justification to
approve the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two ways in which our proposal would, in fact, set
standards for how Carnivore would operate,'' he said, adding that
the FBI system technically complies with all current law. Privacy
advocates criticized the proposal as too little, too late, adding
that its chances of passing Congress are virtually nil with only
six months left to go in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, overall, the administration's privacy goal is ``to get
the information age right,'' Swire said. ``There are all these
fantastic possibilities for the information age, but not every
possible flow of information is a good flow. So while it might be
technically feasible for my neighbor or my boss to know every
detail of my medical file or every purchase I make, that doesn't
mean we want it to happen in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Swire plays a coordinating role, making sure
government agencies such as the Justice Department and the Health
and Human Services Department are on the same page when it comes to
privacy. His office staff consists of another lawyer, a staff
assistant and an intern. As part of the Clinton administration,
Swire's personal views take a back seat to defending the
president's policies. Because he does not have Senate confirmation,
the White House does not permit him to testify before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those constraints, he has been a remarkably effective
voice on privacy,'' said James X. Dempsey, senior counsel for the
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology, which
monitors privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Although some privacy advocates have suggested Swire occupies a
figurehead position, ``that's not accurate,'' said Janlori Goldman,
director of the Health Privacy Project at Georgetown University
Medical Center. ``He's helped the agencies _ Health and Human
Services, the Justice Department, the Labor Department _ to come
together and talk to each other. He brings a lot of substance to
help people find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Swire got in on the ground floor of computer privacy. He first
wrote about the Internet in 1992, ``which is pretty early by most
standards,'' he said. ``In the first paragraph, I had to define the
word `cyberspace.'''
</P>
<P>
   His writings on privacy, including co-authorship of a book
``None of Your Business: World Data Flows, Electronic Commerce and
the European Privacy Directive,'' led to a job feeler from Esther
Dyson, a prominent figure in the Internet world with close ties to
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Swire took leave from his post as law professor at Ohio State
University in Columbus, Ohio, to take the White House job. After
Clinton leaves office next year, he expects to return with his
wife, Anne, and their two sons, Nathan and Jesse, to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Swire grew up in Menands, N.Y., outside Albany and graduated
from Albany Academy in 1976. His mother, Stephanie, was a radio
personality in Albany in the 1970s, hosting the Stevi Swire Show, a
local talk show on WQBK-AM.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were involved in ``reform politics'' in Albany, but
were not hardcore Democratic Party activists. Swire's road to the
White House was less one of political connections than policy
convictions, born of his days in the furniture store computer room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people want the administration to be
balanced in its approach to privacy,'' Swire said. ``We want a
strong economy, but we also want strong protection of privacy. It
would be a shame if either of those values got left by the
wayside.''

   EAST HORSLEY, England _ My 6-year-old son made an American flag
for the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it had a dozen or so stars and not exactly the right number
of stripes _ but he drew it from a faint memory distorted by the
cartoonish American flags we see on everything here from blue jeans
to popcorn bags. We're talking about a little boy who probably has
never heard the ``Star Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he wanted to display his paper flag in front of our house.
I was touched, but I couldn't bring myself to stick it outside. I
placed it on another place of honor: the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because it was gray, rainy and about 55 degrees
on the Fourth here, which would have made short work of the paper
flag. But it was more than that.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't want to draw attention to the fact that this very
English house in this very English neighborhood was full of
Americans. I think they all already know our secret because we
smile at strangers and leave at our curb 10 bags of garbage each
week to their two (wasteful American consumerism, packaged food,
disposable everything, etc.). Then there's the steady scent of
charring meat drifting from our backyard, clear evidence of
Americans trying to simulate summer in this country of eternal
February.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm no Anglophile. I'm proud of being an
American. In fact, I'm not sure I knew I was an American until I
moved to England. I had always thought myself a Texan or Atlantan
or at least a Southerner _ but never a nationality. You almost have
to be set among other people to see how they see you before you
feel part of a distinct tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that stupid Mel Gibson movie. Even before it
opened here last weekend, the British press had been apoplectic
about The Patriot, which depicts the English _ or at least a few
English soldiers _ as pathological, murdering fops.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie starring Australians directed by a German depicting
events that never happened in America.
</P>
<P>
   This follows of a series of American-inspired insults, including
Dan Rather's boorish proclamation that beneath the charming green
English facade lurks a violence-ridden society with crime rates on
par with the United States. (I think they were most offended that
this wasn't Dan's lead item.)
</P>
<P>
   While it's troubling that crime is on the rise in England, the
comparison is absurd. If you live in America, the odds that you
will be shot to death are 60 times higher than in Britain.

little boys armed with flintlocks dropped 20 British troops _
apparently not trained to find cover _ with less effort than I
expended as a youth blasting confused and unarmed quail.
</P>

 &HT;    VOTING RECORDS SHOW GRAHAM, KERRY COMPATIBLE WITH GORE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the time they served together in the Senate,
Bob Graham and John Kerry _ both on the short list of Democratic
vice-presidential candidates _ had voting records very similar to
Al Gore's on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the three men were perceived differently by groups rating
their votes, and they differed in the degree to which they adhered
to the party line on issues that divided Democrats from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators reportedly being considered are Richard Durbin of
Illinois and Evan Bayh of Indiana. Both were elected after Gore
left the Senate. Also under consideration is House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt of Missouri. His votes were not analyzed because the
House motions were not identical to those in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, of Florida, was elected to the Senate in 1986, and
Kerry, of Massachusetts, was elected in 1984, as was Gore. The
three served together until Gore was elected vice president in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of key votes, as identified by the Almanac of
American Politics, shows that of the 29 votes in which Gore, Graham
and Kerry all participated, they agreed on 20 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues were: raising the minimum wage; the Supreme
Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas; the 1990
Civil Rights Act related to job discrimination; limits on death row
appeals, and a ``gag rule'' to prohibit federally financed clinics
from counseling pregnant women about abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Graham differed with Gore and Kerry on six issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. Graham voted yes; Gore
and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Military aid to the government of El Salvador. Graham voted
yes; Gore and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing the share of income that elderly must pay for
federally subsidized rental housing. Graham voted no; Gore and
Kerry voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tabling an amendment limiting money for the Strategic Defense
Initiative in 1987. A yes vote supported SDI; a no vote opposed it.
Graham voted yes; Gore and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing benefits to miners who lost jobs because of new acid
rain controls. Graham voted no; Gore and Kerry voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adopting a constitutional amendment banning physical
desecration of the American flag. Graham voted yes; Gore and Kerry
voted no.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry differed with Gore and Graham on three issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tabling an amendment cutting money for SDI in 1989. A yes vote
supported SDI; a no vote opposed it. Kerry voted no; Graham and
Gore voted yes. The positions taken by Kerry and Graham were the
same as they took two years earlier. Gore's position changed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canceling money for two additional B-2 bombers. Kerry voted
yes; Graham and Gore voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authorizing the involvement of American troops in the Persian
Gulf war. Kerry voted no; Graham and Gore voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Kerry did not agree on any key issue on which they
both disagreed with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In their rankings by leading liberal and conservative groups,
Kerry was the most liberal of the three, Graham the most
conservative, and Gore was in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action said
Kerry supported its issues 85 percent to 100 percent of the time
between 1987 and 1992. Graham's ADA scores ranged from 50 percent
to 75 percent, while Gore's scores ranged from 55 percent to 78
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The American Conservative Union, meanwhile, said Graham's
support ranged from 15 percent to 36 percent. Kerry's ACU scores
ranged from 0 percent to 11 percent, while Gore scored between 6
percent and 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Graham tended to be more of a maverick on issues that pitted a
majority of Democratic senators against a majority of Republican
senators.
</P>
<P>
   According to annual analyses by the independent magazine
Congressional Quarterly, Graham's support on party unity issues
ranged from 68 percent to 84 percent. Kerry's support ranged from
85 percent to 96 percent, while Gore's ranged from 79 to 95
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those votes will shape Gore's thinking in choosing a
running mate is a matter of conjecture. Analysts said the votes
show strong philosophical compatibility between Gore and either
Graham or Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings also highlight the symbolism attached to Gore's
choice of running mates. Does he need more help solidifying his
Democratic base, or should he make a serious effort to win Florida
and its 25 electoral votes?
</P>
<P>
   While analysts agree that the selection of a vice presidential
candidate is unlikely to sway a sizable number of voters, it does
send a message to those who are politically astute and may affect
some voters on the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution, and Norman Ornstein
of the American Enterprise Institute, both non-partisan
Washington-based research centers, agreed that if Gore wants to
solidify his base and appeal to Democrats who may be considering a
vote for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, his choice would be
Kerry over Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Graham is not going to help him mobilize the Democratic
base in the Midwest,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Picking Graham would signify that Gore wants to continue
pursuing ``new Democrats,'' moderates, upscale swing voters and
seniors, Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein suggested that picking Graham ``would send a signal
that a Gore administration, in many ways like the Clinton-Gore
administration, is going to be very much in the center.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be a lingering _ though minor _ impact to Graham from
the case of Elian Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   While Graham and Gore both suggested a family court should
decide whether the young Cuban boy should have been allowed to
return to Cuba with his father, Graham was far more outspoken in
his criticism of the administration's handling of the raid that
took the boy from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said Gore's differences with Clinton over the issue ``was
one of his non-shining moments'' whose memory ``some Democrats
would prefer go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein suggested that although Graham and Gore differed in the
intensity of their objections to the Elian case, ``that issue is
past. That's not going to make a difference.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A recent survey by Hewitt Associates underlines
just how clueless a lot of workers are about money, and how little
Generation Xers have learned from the mistakes of baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's survey found that more than two-thirds of people who
changed jobs in 1999 cashed out their 401(k) plans, rather than
either trying to stay in the plan or roll the money over into an
individual retirement account. Among those under 30, the cash-out
rate was 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These are not people who were starving. Only about one out of
six of them was even using the money to pay bills. But a lot of
people just don't learn the nuances of money and investing until
it's too late _ if they ever learn them at all.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to pick one skill that all workers should develop, it
would be money management. You don't have to sell out or become
obsessed with every dollar, but you ought to understand how to get
the most out of your paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Money lets people in their late 30s and 40s think about starting
their own businesses or taking wonderful vacations or retiring
early, while those who don't handle it well are looking at another
30 years on the same treadmill. If you have money, you can put your
energy into pursuing a dream; if you don't have money, you can put
too much energy into avoiding a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk a little cash:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nothing is certain except debt and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst habits young workers get into is to spend more
than they earn, somehow hoping that the credit card fairy will make
all their debts vanish. It's almost always a sucker bet, one that
can leave you in a financial hole for years.
</P>
<P>
   If you're young and any kind of a decent worker, you ought to be
getting steady raises. Take the extra money and pay down the debt
until it disappears. Otherwise, you're building your career and
financial future on quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   Good workplace habits have a way of paying huge dividends later
in life. Learning to live within your means is one of the best
habits you can get into.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start saving early.
</P>
<P>
   If you put $50,000 in a retirement account by the time you're 30
and earn 10 percent a year on it, your account will be worth more
than $1.5 million by the time you're 65 _ even if you never save
another penny. But if you wait until you're 40 to save that
$50,000, it won't even be worth $600,000 by age 65.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. That 10 years of waiting could cost you more than
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ A penny saved is worth more than a penny earned.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you have to pay $115 a month for parking, but then your
employer gives you a free parking place. That's like a $115 a month
raise, right?
</P>
<P>
   No. It's a lot better. It's more like a $200 raise. Remember: If
you get a $200 raise, you'll probably lose about $85 of it to
federal and state income taxes, Social Security and Medicare,
leaving you with that $115 to pay for parking.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of ways you can get more money to spend
without actually getting a raise. Programs allow employers to pay
pretax dollars for things like parking, mass transit, health care
and child care. Before you push for a raise, think about whether
things like health club memberships or expense-account meals would
be more valuable to you.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget telecommuting, too. Or, if you're truly a
cash-oriented soul, an employer match to your 401(k) contribution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take stock.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you decide that you're not suited for it, you owe it to
yourself to learn how to invest in the stock market. The Internet
has made a lot more information available to individual investors
than there used to be.
</P>
<P>
   What a lot of those people in the Hewitt survey probably never
learned is that having money in retirement accounts gives you a
great opportunity to buy and sell stocks, because you don't have to
pay taxes each time you make a capital gain. The money isn't taxed
until you start withdrawing it _ if it's ever taxed at all (certain
IRAs have tax-free distributions).
</P>
<P>
   But they took it out early, meaning not only that they are no
longer investors, but that they will have to pay a 10 percent
penalty to the Internal Revenue Service for withdrawing the cash
before they reached retirement age. Maybe someday they'll realize
that their penalty has turned out to be a lot more than 10 percent,
but by then it will be too late.

 &HT;    VOTING RECORDS SHOW GRAHAM, KERRY COMPATIBLE WITH GORE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, July 23.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the time they served together in the Senate,
Bob Graham and John Kerry _ both on the short list of Democratic
vice-presidential candidates _ had voting records very similar to
Al Gore's on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the three men were perceived differently by groups rating
their votes, and they differed in the degree to which they adhered
to the party line on issues that divided Democrats from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators reportedly being considered are Richard Durbin of
Illinois and Evan Bayh of Indiana. Both were elected after Gore
left the Senate. Also under consideration is House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt of Missouri. His votes were not analyzed because the
House motions were not identical to those in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, of Florida, was elected to the Senate in 1986, and
Kerry, of Massachusetts, was elected in 1984, as was Gore. The
three served together until Gore was elected vice president in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of key votes, as identified by the Almanac of
American Politics, shows that of the 29 votes in which Gore, Graham
and Kerry all participated, they agreed on 20 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues were: raising the minimum wage; the Supreme
Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas; the 1990
Civil Rights Act related to job discrimination; limits on death row
appeals, and a ``gag rule'' to prohibit federally financed clinics
from counseling pregnant women about abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Graham differed with Gore and Kerry on six issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. Graham voted yes; Gore
and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Military aid to the government of El Salvador. Graham voted
yes; Gore and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing the share of income that elderly must pay for
federally subsidized rental housing. Graham voted no; Gore and
Kerry voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tabling an amendment limiting money for the Strategic Defense
Initiative in 1987. A yes vote supported SDI; a no vote opposed it.
Graham voted yes; Gore and Kerry voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing benefits to miners who lost jobs because of new acid
rain controls. Graham voted no; Gore and Kerry voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adopting a constitutional amendment banning physical
desecration of the American flag. Graham voted yes; Gore and Kerry
voted no.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry differed with Gore and Graham on three issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tabling an amendment cutting money for SDI in 1989. A yes vote
supported SDI; a no vote opposed it. Kerry voted no; Graham and
Gore voted yes. The positions taken by Kerry and Graham were the
same as they took two years earlier. Gore's position changed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canceling money for two additional B-2 bombers. Kerry voted
yes; Graham and Gore voted no.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authorizing the involvement of American troops in the Persian
Gulf war. Kerry voted no; Graham and Gore voted yes.

both disagreed with Gore.

ranged from 68 percent to 84 percent. Kerry's support ranged from
85 percent to 96 percent, while Gore's ranged from 79 to 95

place where they can ride on buses and eat in restaurants 10 years
after enactment of a law aimed at helping them. But advocates say
the fight to change attitudes continues. We look at the progress
and the remaining problems since the Americans with Disabilities
Act was signed into law July 26, 1990, by President George Bush. By

&HT;     COWBOYS' JACKIE HARRIS IS SLIMMED DOWN AND ANXIOUS TO PLAY AT
TIGHT END

   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ In a sea _ really, more like a mirage in
the 100-degree heat _ of dropped passes in the Cowboys' morning
practice, No. 88 stepped in and saved the moment, or at least more
hand-wringing from the Dallas coaching staff on the second day of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   No. 88 being new tight end Jackie Harris, who snagged the number
in the wake of Michael Irvin's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some skills to get himself open,'' Cowboys coach Dave
Campo said. ``You saw it today as an outside receiver when he
caught a fade on one of our linebackers. We feel like we have a
special guy there.''
</P>
<P>
   One who can shed weight if needed. Harris dropped from 260 to
247 pounds in the off-season at the coaches' request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him thin, but not too thin,'' offensive coordinator
Jack Reilly said. ``We wanted him thinner for the receiving-type
things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The fade route being one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed Harris from Tennessee as 272-pound David
LaFleur's backup, but Harris may see more playing time because of
his increased mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the starter; he's the bigger body,'' said Harris of
LaFleur, downplaying such a suggestion. ``I've trimmed up a little
bit to become more of a `movement guy. From here, I've just got to
find a way to make the coach decide that he needs to get me in the
game as often as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur's numbers have gradually increased over three seasons _
18, 20 and 35 catches _ but the coaches are hopeful Harris can
provide a quicker threat across the middle, an area lacking since
Jay Novacek's 1996 retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be able to go out and really work the safeties,
and beat the linebackers if you get the matchups you like,'' said
Harris, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is in his 11th NFL season. He spent the past two years
with Tennessee, where he collected 26 catches for 297 yards on the
Titans' march to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his first four seasons with Green Bay and his next four
in Tampa Bay before signing with Tennessee. His most productive
season came in '95, when he caught 62 passes for 751 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Harris also offers the young guys on the team more than a
decade's worth of training camp experience: ``It can't get any
worse than this,'' he said of playing football in triple digits on
the thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   He said a nice respite is catching passes from Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in some offenses where you get open and the guy
doesn't see you, but I was running down the sidelines at one of the
mini-camps, and all of the sudden the ball was right on top of
me,'' Harris said. ``The guy sees the field so well, if you get
open, you better be prepared to catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris dropped the weight for just such an opportunity _ to move
faster and jump higher in catching passes _ but he said he wouldn't
want to get any lighter, because of matchup problems with defensive
ends.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates seem to admire the slimmed-down Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie is moving nicely and he's seizing the opportunity,''
fellow receiver James McKnight said. ``And I think he knows, OK,
we've got a chance to go all the way here, too.''

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LISA FUGARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If birders go birding then those who seek out wildflowers surely
go flowering; the term botanizing doesn't begin to capture the
sweet delight I experienced on discovering the profusion of
wildflowers growing in the Burren in County Clare on Ireland's west
coast.
 &HT;    My romance with bird's-foot trefoil, mountain avens and herb
Robert came about by accident. When I flew into Shannon last July
and met my mother, Sheila, for a 10-day holiday, it was with the
intention of viewing shore birds and, with luck, a few seals.
 &HT;    Bleak and harsh are the adjectives often used to describe the
Burren, a roughly 100-square-mile limestone landscape of cliffs,
stony hills and broad stretches of rock resembling pavement. I have
an affinity for such landscapes, as does my mother, and the
boireann, the Irish word for rocky place, did not disappoint us.
 &HT;    Two and a half hours after leaving the airport in a
sardine-can-sized rental car, well suited to skinny country roads,
we crested a hill just above a stretch of coastline called Pol
Salach and saw a stunning panorama of fierce Ireland _ shattered
terraces of stark limestone spilling into a sea that was gray as
elephant skin.
 &HT;    We followed the coast road through the lonely village of Fanore
where horses grazed in rock-strewn pastures next to the beach, past
Black Head where the limestone cliffs plunged into the sea. Masses
of oxeye daisies and fuchsias blooming on the side of the road
softened the austere beauty of the rock.
 &HT;    By the time we reached Ballyvaughan, a tiny village sitting on a
tranquil corner of Galway Bay, we were enamored of the Burren.
Smoked salmon and mussels at Monk's Bar on the quay and two elegant
bedrooms in Rusheen Lodge, a four-star guest house, only added to
our satisfaction.
 &HT;    The next morning we drove into the hills behind Ballyvaughan
where flinty stone walls divided the land into pastures. I was
itching to walk among the rocks, but in planning the trip I had
promised my mother a ruin a day. My passion for the natural world
is matched by her passion for mosques, temples, tombs and ruined
churches. Such churches abound in the Burren, as do ring forts and
Neolithic tombs.
 &HT;    Our first visit was to the village of Kilfenora where the
tiniest medieval cathedral awaited us. The nave or front section is
still used for church services while the roofless chancel radiates
stillness and mystery. Two identical stone carvings _ apparently
the head of a bishop _ have a vaguely Egyptian air about them.
 &HT;    A delicate trefoil sedilia _ three seats crowned with a
beautifully carved pinnacle _ is recessed into one wall, while on
the adjacent wall are two naively incised 13th- and 14th-century
stone carvings.
 &HT;    One of them, supposedly of a cleric, had us perplexed. What did
the oval head and elongated neck remind us of? Where had we seen
that serene, otherworldly demeanor?
 &HT;    My mother, who is half Irish and has a streak of sly Irish wit
about her, solved that mystery when she exclaimed ``The Holy
Alien!''
 &HT;    Pelting rain and sudden squalls, rain that drizzles and mizzles
_ Ireland is one of the few countries where such weather is
shrugged off, hardly a deterrent to wildflower adventures.
 &HT;    After lunch I dropped my mother back at the B&AMP;B and, armed with
``Wild Plants of the Burren and the Aran Islands,'' bought at the
Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfenora, and a large umbrella
(which immediately marked me as a foreigner and a sissy), I drove
40 minutes along the coast road to rocky Pol Salach for my first
afternoon of flowering.
 &HT;    The great mystique of the flora of the Burren lies in its
diversity and its growing habits _ Mediterranean and arctic-alpine
plants thrive side by side. None of the species are unique to the
Burren, but many grow in the limestone landscape in greater
abundance than anywhere else in Ireland or Britain.
 &HT;    I parked the car, climbed over a low stone wall and crouched on
the ground. Crushing wild thyme between my fingers, I breathed
deep. I'd identified my first wildflower. And what were the tiny
white flowers intertwined with the thyme? I thumbed through my
flower book.
 &HT;    Yes! It was squinancy wort. After half an hour of literally
crawling through a cow pasture so ablaze with flowers it seemed as
though a beneficent fairy artist had dipped her paintbrush in
magenta, blue, yellow, cream and periwinkle blue and flicked it
over the ground, I reached the limestone pavement.
 &HT;    Smooth, relatively flat, rectangular chunks of limestone called
clints are separated from one another by fissures that range in
depth from one foot to 20. It's in these fissures, or grikes, that
the pluckiest of plants flourish. The magenta flowers of bloody
cranesbill swayed brightly against the bone-colored rock, and I saw
honeysuck le plants twisted into bonsais by the strong winds.
 &HT;    Closer to the sea cliffs I found those plants that thrive in the
salty spray gusting off Galway Bay _ bobbing heads of pink thrift
and sea campion and thick seaweedy-looking ferns that glistened in
the grikes. Of course, there were plants that I couldn't identify.
 &HT;    There are over 600 species recorded in the Burren. The book I
carried listed 120. I was momentarily frustrated. Then smiled. My
naming them didn't bring the flowers into being. Why not simply
enjoy them?
 &HT;    Our love affair with the Burren was now well under way, and the
following day while driving to Corcomroe, a Cistercian abbey that
lies five miles east of Ballyvaughan, my mother fantasized about
buying property. We parked at the end of a country lane and
immediately registered an eerie sound that seemed to be rising from
the ruined abbey. A ham-fisted ghost stumbling over the bass keys
of an organ?
 &HT;    After some investigation the Organist of Corcomroe, as he is now
affectionately remembered by my mother and me, turned out to be a
most handsome blond bull lowing to several docile black-and-white
cows cloistered in a field on the opposite side of the road.
 &HT;    While Kilfenora's chancel is exquisitely intimate, Corcomroe,
with the wind gusting through it, feels lonely and desolate. It
also has a stunning roof, as do most of the churches we visited,
with a wide swath of changeable Irish sky through which the rooks
wheeled and cawed. On some of the pillars the traces of carvings of
flowers can be found, a stony reminder of the abbey's other name,
Our Lady of the Fertile Rocks.
 &HT;    In one corner there is a recumbent effigy said to be that of an
O'Brien king killed nearby in 1267. Above it is an unfinished
14th-century carving, presumably of the abbot of Corcomroe. With a
hint of a smile on his face and rather puffy attire, he looks as
though he's levitating up the ruined chancel.
 &HT;    ``Three days is not enough time to explore the Burren,'' I
lamented over dinner that night in the superb Whitethorn
restaurant.
 &HT;    Reservations in Connemara awaited us, so the following day we
left for County Galway. On our way we stopped at Thoor Ballylee
near the town of Gort _ less than an hour's drive from Ballyvaughan
_ where Yeats summered from 1917 to 1929. The recorded commentary
issuing from speakers in his dining room, study and bedroom didn't
interest me so I climbed higher.
 &HT;    Close to the top of the stone tower I found what was surely the
true spirit of Yeats _ a soft-feathered, fierce-eyed kestrel
guarding her chick on a nest of sticks.
 &HT;    After two days in Connemara, during which time the sun blazed 16
hours a day and I swam in the stillest, bluest bay I'd ever seen,
gray clouds rolled in from the ocean. Rain spattered on the window
of our hotel. ``Only one place to be in such moody weather,'' I
said to my mother. Back to the Burren we raced.
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge had been lovely, but I always feel as though I'm
staying in my grandparents' house when I visit a B &AMP; B. That
evening we checked into the Ballinalacken Castle Hotel, a sprawling
country house sitting on a hill just below a 15th-century O'Brien
tower house. The ruin is now roped off because too many visitors
were leaving with chunks of genuine Irish castle in their pockets.
 &HT;    We felt like Burren old-timers, and our remaining days took on
an easy routine. In the mornings we visited churches, castles and
towers. There was Dysert O'Dea, where a bizarre array of
Romanesque-style animal and human heads arches over the south
doorway of the church.
 &HT;    Lemaneagh Castle, worthy of at least a few ghosts, stands proud
in a stretch of windswept farmland (equally creepy was the electric
fence surrounding the field and the old Irish codger who scowled at
the few cars parked just beyond his land).
 &HT;    In Killinaboy we came across a humble ruined church with a
simple carving of the Crucifixion and the weathered Sheila na gig,
an ancient fertility symbol, above the entrance.
 &HT;    Each afternoon I went flowering. A walk up the Kyber Pass, a
road in Fanore that follows the Caher River _ the only surface
river in the Burren, as most of the rainwater seeps into the
underground waterways _ will be remembered as the afternoon I
discovered orchids.
 &HT;    Except for the exquisite bee orchid, the terrestrial species of
the Burren are not as showy as tropical orchids that cling to
trees. Still, I was captivated by their demure beauty.
 &HT;    On another day I went mad for ferns. I kept meaning to hike one
of the ancient green roads that lace the Burren; they're noted for
the wildflowers but I was smitten with rock, with the way a
saucer-sized depression on a boulder could hold an array of small
flowers brilliant as jewels, the way the wind gusting off Galway
Bay tossed the tousled pink flowers of hemp agrimony, a species
that grew en masse in the limestone fissures.
 &HT;    And then there was the food _ lobsters, crabs, black sole,
salmon, mussels. We feasted every evening at local restaurants and
returned to our hotel _ my mother had renamed it Fawlty Castle in
honor of the quirky yet utterly charming staff _ in time for sunset
tea, which, in early July, was at about 9 p.m.
 &HT;    On our last morning in the Burren I wandered the pavement at Pol
Salach, saying goodbye to yet another part of the world I'd fallen
in love with. My evening reading had been from a chapter in ``The
Burren: A Companion to the Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone
Wilderness'' that touched on the historical use of many of the
plants Id been rhapsodizing over, and as I whispered the names of
the flowers surrounding me, I felt as though I were floating back
in time.
 &HT;    Lady's bedstraw _ makes good bedding and can be used as a rennet
plant for curdling milk; squinancy wort _ useful if I ever get an
attack of quinsy; carline thistle _ preserve the buds with honey
and sugar for a tasty sweetmeat; Burnet rose _ I'll drink a syrup
made from the rosehips if I'm coughing, spitting blood or stricken
with scurvy.
 &HT;    The monks of Corcomroe must have put many of these plants to
medicinal use. Perhaps the levitating abbot secretly snacked on
carline thistles.
 &HT;    As for the Holy Alien? That otherworldly, rather blissful
demeanor might have come about from one too many afternoons spent
flowering.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: REVELING IN BIRD'S-FOOT TREFOIL, SQUINANCY WORT AND
THRIFT  
 LODGING  
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge. Just outside the village of Ballyvaughan, this
four-star guest house has six lovely, spacious rooms with private
bathrooms, and two suites. Doubles are $72; the suites $108, full
breakfast included, calculated at $1.21 to the Irish pound.
Telephone (353-65) 70 77092, fax (353-65) 70 77152.
 &HT;    Ballinalacken Castle Hotel. We loved this creaky yet elegant
hotel on the outskirts of Lisdoonvarna. Drinking tea in the sitting
room and sprawling about our spacious, rather oddly but grandly
decorated room made us feel like fading aristocrats. Some rooms
have splendid views of the Aran Islands, while others (nos. 5, 6,
10 and 11) do not. Doubles are $48 to $54, with full Irish
breakfast. For reservations, telephone or fax (353-65) 70 74025.
 DINING  
 &HT;    Sheedy's Hotel and Restaurant. What this restaurant in
Lisdoonvarna lacks in decor it makes up for with superb food. I had
an entree of black sole so exquisite I wonder if I'll ever eat fish
that fresh again. A three-course dinner for two, excluding drinks,
averages $60. Sheedy's bar has a seafood menu. Telephone (353-65)
70 74026.
 &HT;    The Whitethorn. Situated a half mile east of Ballyvaughan on the
coast road to Galway, this elegant restaurant has a stunning view
of Galway Bay. Dinner for two averages $70 and is served Friday and
Saturday nights only in July and August. Weekends and weekdays the
lunch service is buffet style and the food is just as delicious.
 &HT;    Attached is a shop crammed with good clothing, Irish crafts and
all the guidebooks needed to explore the Burren. Telephone (353-5)
70 77044.
 INFORMATION  
 &HT;    The Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfe nora, the first such
center in Ireland, has models and exhibits explaining the geology,
flora and fauna of the Burren, as well as an audiovisual lecture of
the area. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. through September (to 5
p.m. October to May). Telephone (353-65) 70 88030. Admission $3.
 &HT;    Recommended reading: ``The Burren: a Companion to the
Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone Wilderness'' (Collins Press), by
E. Charles Nelson, who is utterly bewitched by the Burren. For help
in identifying flowers, pick up a copy of ``Wild Plants of the
Burren and the Aran Islands,'' also by E. Charles Nelson. Both
books are available at the Whitethorn and the Burren Interpretive
Center at Kilfenora.

SHOPPING AROUND: APRIL IN PARIS? WHY NOT?

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Autumn may be the most delightful time to visit Paris, Rome and
many other European destinations. After all, most of the tourists
have gone home, museums have shorter lines and the weather can be
the best of the year.
 &HT;    Hotel prices, however, may not be that much lower than they are
in July and August because September and October are becoming
increasingly popular months to travel. But come late October,
prices do indeed fall.
 &HT;    For those considering a European getaway this autumn, here are
some planning tools.
 AIRFARES &AMP; PACKAGES  
 &HT;    Those who simply want a good, cheap airfare should look to
Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), Travelocity.com
(www.travelocity.com) and LowestFare.com (www.lowestfare.com),
which offer fare finders for thrifty travelers.
 &HT;    Another way to save money is with package deals that include
round-trip airfare, accommodations and transfers _ all for a single
price. Major American and European air carriers offer various
packages to Europe, but two carriers with extensive offerings are
British Airways (Holiday Desk, 75-20 Astoria Blvd., Jackson
Heights, NY 11370; 877-428-2228; www.britishairways.com) and
American Airlines (P.O. Box 619688, DFW Airport, Texas 75261;
800-882-8880; www.aa.com).
 &HT;    Package prices are fixed, and they're frequently available with
as little as seven days' advance notice. The best ones offer a
range of hotel choices, satisfying both budget-minded travelers and
those who want to splash out a little.
 ESCORTED TOURS  
 &HT;    For a single price, escorted tours provide airfare, hotel
accommodations, transfers, transportation as well as most meals,
sightseeing, baggage handling and taxes.
 &HT;    Fortunately, most tour companies no longer try to cram seven
countries into seven days. The smarter ones are tailoring their
trips to people who were brought up traveling independently.
 &HT;    The price can be right, because an escorted tour almost always
costs less than pricing components separately and it comes with the
added benefit of service.
 &HT;    Dozens of companies offer such tours to France, Spain and
virtually every country in Western and Eastern Europe. Travelers
can narrow their search by contacting the United States Tour
Operator Association (342 Madison Ave., Suite 1522, New York, NY
10173; 212-599-6599; www.ustoa.com).
 TRAINS  
 &HT;    Getting around Europe by train is easy. And the easiest way to
research European rail schedules and prices is to contact Rail
Europe (44 South Broadway, White Plains, NY 10601; 800-4-EURAIL;
www.raileurope.com), which also includes Brit Rail.
 &HT;    With a little work, smart travelers can determine whether it's
cheaper to buy point-to-point tickets or to go for a railpass _ or
perhaps decide that a rental car might be even cheaper if there are
enough people traveling together.
 &HT;    A basic Eurailpass costs $554 and provides 15 consecutive days
of unlimited first-class travel in the 17 member countries:
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
 &HT;    But Rail Europe offers an array of regional and national passes,
in both first- and second-class versions. Many passes also come in
flexi-pass versions, since many travelers won't travel on every day
of their vacation.
 &HT;    A German Flexipass, for example, permits four days of travel in
a one-month period, for $252 in first class and $174 in second.
 &HT;    There are also passes that save two travelers money, like the
Swiss Saver Flexipass. It's $198 in first class and $132 in second
class, per person, for two travelers. They get three days of travel
within one month. Single travelers pay $234 and $156, respectively,
for these same passes.
 &HT;    Regional passes, such as the Europass, link France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Rail Europe also offers a variety of
Eurostar tickets, for travel on the high-speed train between
Brussels, London and Paris.
 RENTALS  
 &HT;    Renting a European house or apartment for a week or more is
often an affordable way to go. That's true for a London apartment,
a Swiss chalet or a French villa.
 &HT;    Most renters will find that they get more space for their money,
even in a studio apartment, than at a comparable hotel.
 &HT;    Small homes and larger villas are suitable for families or
couples traveling together. In fact, when families or couples pool
their finances, renting can be a true cost-saver.
 &HT;    When looking for a rental, choose a property by location as well
as size and amenities. These companies offer a wide range of
European rentals:
 &HT;     The French Experience  (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New
York, NY 10017; 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.com) has long
specialized in ``gites,'' rural vacation homes throughout the
French countryside.
 &HT;     Homes Away  (34 Park Road, Toronto M4W 2N4, Ontario, Canada;
800-374-6637; www.homesaway.com) has a handful of upscale rentals
in the most desirable areas of France and Italy.
 &HT;     The Landmark Trust  (707 Kipling Road, Dummerston, VT 05301;
802-254-6868; www.landmarktrust.co.uk) has a selection of unusual
rentals in period buildings throughout the British Isles.
 &HT;     Paris Sejours Reservations  (875 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 3214,
Chicago, IL 60611; 312-587-7707; www.PSRyourhomeinParis.com)
focuses on Paris apartments, from studios on up.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (Seaport Landing, 152 Lynnway, Lynn, MA
01902; 800-280-2811; www.parkercompany.com) specializes in Italy.
 &HT;     WIMCO  (P.O. Box 1461, Newport, RI 02840; 800-932-3222;
www.wimcovillas.com) offers rentals in England, France, Ireland,
Italy and Scotland.

WHAT'S DOING IN PHILADELPHIA  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LAURA MANSNERUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Philadelphia has done everything it could think of for the
45,000 visitors expected at the Republican National Convention: its
landmark architecture is polished, its streetscapes groomed, its
hotels gleaming with restored marble and brass and stocked with
concierges.
 &HT;    But the convention is brief (July 31 through Aug. 3) and the
summer is long, making for many more weeks of prime tourism in the
nation's original convention city.
 &HT;    When you're inviting the whole country, it's good to have a city
full of walking opportunities. While the convention site, the First
Union Center, is in deep South Philadelphia, the restaurants,
shopping and historic sites are clustered in mercifully compact
Center City, a 15-minute subway or cab ride away.
 &HT;    There, in the two-mile stretch between rivers, the spines of
skyscrapers give way quickly to narrow, leafy residential streets
that make life easy for walkers, if not for traffic. A tourist
could spend a day just inspecting the courtyards and mews,
especially plentiful in the old neighborhoods east of Broad Street.
 &HT;    Philadelphia in summer is still the hot, placid city where
street life means corner taverns with open doors and row-house
stoops occupied by supervising grandparents. But with the dizzying
revival of Center City, another public life _ the kind involving
theater tickets and cell phones _ brings people out.
 &HT;    High summer is also the time to set sandals to the streets
around Independence Hall and see where the delegates to the First
and Second Continental Congresses sweltered. Or to explore the cool
halls of museums that have given their all to this summer's
exhibitions. Or to visit the rivers: the Delaware, with its night
life on the piers, and the more sedate Schuylkill, where the grassy
banks invite picnics and jogging.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The city will greet the convention on its eve, July 30, with a
parade of 59 lighted boats at 9 p.m. and fireworks along the
Delaware. Penn's Landing and the New Jersey State Aquarium in
Camden are prime viewing spots. Information: (800) 770-5883.
 &HT;    You don't have to be a GOP delegate to get into PoliticalFest,
described as a world's fair of politics. It will have historical
and interactive (want to read from a teleprompter?) exhibits at the
Pennsylvania Convention Center, 12th and Arch Streets, July 26
through Aug. 3. Admission: $10 and $5 for students, ages 4 to 11
and 65 and older; (215) 686-0350.
 &HT;    And at the Atwater Kent Museum, 15 South Seventh St., the
exhibit ``Vote: Campaign Choices/Presidential Voices'' is showing
two centuries of campaign memorabilia until Nov. 26. Admission to
the Atwater Kent, Philadelphia's history museum, is $3, $2 for ages
55 and older and $1.50 for children 3 to 12. Information: (215)
922-3031.
 &HT;    The African American Museum in Philadelphia, 701 Arch St., (215)
574-0380, is celebrating the blues all summer. In addition to a
photography exhibition, through Sept. 3, the museum plans outdoor
lunch concerts on Wednesdays in July and August, with hip-hop,
zydeco and classical music represented, too. A second exhibit,
through Sept. 17, celebrates Paul Robeson. Admission: $6, $4 for
students, those aged 55 and older and the handicapped.
 &HT;    ``Andy Warhol: Social Observer'' is at the museum of the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Broad and Cherry Streets, (215)
972-7600, through Sept. 21. The show, including paintings of
Presidents Reagan and Nixon, Chairman Mao and Lenin, is the first
major exhibition of Warhol's work since 1988. Admission is $8, $7
for students and ages 60 and up, and $5 for ages 5 to 18.
 &HT;    On the streets or in the galleries, plastic cups of wine in
hand, people gather in Old City, just northeast of the Liberty
Bell, on First Fridays. This month, an extra Friday, July 28, will
accommodate convention visitors at the sprawling open house. About
40 art galleries, on Second and Third Streets, will open from 5
till 9 p.m. For information, call (215) 625-9200 or (800) 555-5191.
 &HT;    It's not Wrigley Field, but Veterans Stadium does have real
baseball, and it's next to the First Union Center. No matter what
they say about Philadelphia fans, the Vet is a friendly place. The
Phillies are home July 25 to July 30 (Chicago and Los Angeles),
Aug. 7 to Aug. 16 (San Diego, Houston and Arizona) and Aug. 25 to
Aug. 30 (San Francisco and Colorado). Tickets, $7 to $22.50;
information, (215) 463-1000.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In a city that never runs out of material, the Foundation for
Architecture leads walking tours of about two hours five days a
week _ Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m., and Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings at 6.
 &HT;    A dozen offerings during the convention include ``20th Century
Unlimited,'' around Center Square, and ``Littlest Streets,'' along
the old, once-bohemian residential alleys of Washington Square
West. Adults $7, students $6; (215) 569-3187.
 &HT;    A different thread of history is on view at the hulking Eastern
State Penitentiary, 22nd Street and Fairmount Avenue. Eastern
State, one of the nation's first penitentiaries, opened in 1829 and
was home to Al Capone and Willie Sutton. The gothic stone monster
was only recently rescued from decades of decay and opened for
tours of Capone's specially furnished cell and other exhibits on
Wednesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in summer. The
fee is $7, $5 for students and ages 55 and up, and $3 for under 17.
Information, (215) 236-3300.
 &HT;    Walkers naturally seek out Society Hill, the core of
Philadelphia's original civic life and of its downtown revival 30
years ago. It's a genteel quarter, red brick from the sidewalks up,
encompassing Independence National Historic Park and dotted with
courtyards and churchyards, with many Georgian and Federal
buildings. But at its southern edge, South Street booms at night
with bars and quirky shops.
 &HT;    Across Society Hill's northern boundary, Market Street, is Old
City, which 20 years ago was a disused quarter of small, abandoned
garment factories with a few luncheonettes and a string of
restaurant-supply stores. The area is now packed with galleries,
coffeehouses, restaurants and clubs.
 &HT;    Runners can always put on shorts and head up the Benjamin
Franklin Parkway from Center City to the Philadelphia Museum of
Art. A jogging and bike path continues another four miles along the
Schuylkill, where the sights _ bridges, scullers, masses of willows
_ are pretty much as Thomas Eakins painted them more than 100 years
ago.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Philadelphia is booked for convention week, but the building
binge has ensured a tourists' market for most other weeks of the
summer and fall. To find out about hotel packages, including
tickets to cultural events, call a visitors' information number:
(888) 467-4452.
 &HT;    The Sheraton Society Hill, Second and Walnut Streets, has a
quiet, established niche in the historic district. Like its
surroundings, the low-rise red-brick hotel is Colonial (except for
the swimming pool) and sedate. The 365 traditional rooms and suites
range from $155 to $270 for a double. Reservations, (215) 238-6000,
fax (215) 238-6652.
 &HT;    A block from the convention center, Loews, 1200 Market St.,
(215) 627-1200, fax (215) 231-7305, is an Art Deco creation in an
old bank building (check out the vault doors). The 583 rooms are
pure 1930s luxe. A standard double is $175 to $240.
 &HT;    Just off Rittenhouse Square, the Sofitel, a part of the French
hotel chain, recently opened at 120 South 17th St., on a pleasingly
unreconstructed lock of tiny shops. The hotel, by contrast, is all
modern and smooth, its 306 rooms furnished in gleaming woods and
geometric prints. Doubles, $189; (215) 569-8300, fax (215)
569-1492.
 &HT;    Budget: The Hawthorn Suites, 1100 Vine St., (215) 829-8300, fax
(215) 829-8104, is crisp and new, if a bit spare. Each of the 294
suites, at $149 to $159 (sometimes less on weekends), has
refrigerator, microwave and wet bar, making life easier for
families. At the northern edge of Center City, the hotel towers
over the convention center and Chinatown.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue, Broad and
Walnut Streets, is rich in detail and history, a match for the
Academy of Music on the next corner of the theater district. With
just 172 rooms, including suites, it has a ballroom, a
conservatory, a rooftop rose garden and such amenities as a day
spa. Doubles start at $275; (215) 893-1234, fax (215) 732-8518.
 &HT;    Rittenhouse Bed and Breakfast, 1715 Rittenhouse Square, (215)
545-1755, fax (215) 545-1750, is as elegant as the neighboring
square, formal from its facade to its nightly shoeshine service.
Some of the 10 individually decorated rooms, all with baths, have
fireplaces and whirlpools. Rates are $220 to $340 and include full
breakfast.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    An anchor of Center City's restaurant row, Susanna Foo, 1512
Walnut St., (215) 545-2666, has done Asian fusion elegantly for
years. Under silk lanterns, diners can make their way from Chinese
soups and delicate dumplings to emphatically French desserts
(apricot tart with almond ice cream, for one). Dinner for two
people with wine, about $125.
 &HT;    Fishmarket, 122 South 18th St., (215) 569-9080, offers seafood
in a town house with just enough painted wood to feel like a crab
house. In fact, for the summer, the Fishmarket is making a big
production of crabs. Take a stool at the glistening raw bar at
happy hour and enjoy oysters for $1 each. Dinner for two, with a
bottle of wine, about $120. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    Le Bar Lyonnais, 1523 Walnut St., (215) 567-1000, is the
downstairs wing of Le Bec-Fin, the French restaurant that has been
on national best-of lists for years. The bar offers many lighter
Bec-Fin standards like the galette de crabe and vichyssoise au
caviar at considerably lower prices. The atmosphere is rich, dark
and close -- it seats about 30. No reservations. Dinner for two
with drinks, about $100. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    On the other side of Rittenhouse Square, Audrey Claire, (215)
731-1222, opens its wide windows at the corner of 20th and Spruce
Streets to a neighborhood of brownstones and small shops. The fare
is Mediterranean _ Audrey Claire is known for its grilled
flatbreads _ and simple. Outdoor tables available. No reservations
on Friday and Saturday. Bring your own wine. Dinner for two, about
$60. Closed Monday.
 &HT;    Effie's, at 1127 Pine St. on Antique Row, (215) 592-8333, is a
tiny Greek restaurant in a row house with a tiny, inviting garden.
Effie's has fresh fish every day, usually served whole, brushed
with lemon and olive oil and grilled. Bring your own wine. Dinner
for two, under $40.
 &HT;    For those who cannot leave town without a cheesesteak, the pure
South Philadelphia version is available at Pat's King of Steaks,
(215) 468-1546, or Geno's, (215) 389-0659, competing cholesterol
palaces at the intersection of Passyunk, South Ninth and Wharton
Streets.
 &HT;    And for South Philly pizza, try Marra's, 1734 East Passyunk
Ave., (215) 463-9249, now in its third generation. Wear a tank top
and bring $5 to $10 a person (that includes the beer).
 &HT;    A note about Pennsylvania dining: Most restaurants have liquor
licenses, but if you must bring your own, plan. Wine and liquor are
sold only in state stores, which are sparse, poorly stocked and
expensive. They are also not open late or on Sunday.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARY-LOU WEISMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    My husband, Larry, and I like to go house hunting on vacation.
One minute we are behaving like proper tourists in Provence, Sydney
or Prague, and the next we're making plans to live there. It's not
enough to be seeing the sites, enjoying the culture, eating the
food and drinking the wine; we have to own the place.
 &HT;    We travel the way Caesar's army conquered Gaul; we come, we see,
we acquire real estate _ at least in our dreams.
 &HT;    When in Rome, Larry imagines himself sitting all day outside his
apartment in the Piazza Navona. He is sipping cappuccino, reading a
book on architecture and smoking. (Larry resumes smoking on all of
his fantasy vacations.)
 &HT;    Larry does not have a job in Rome. I don't either, unless diving
for coins in the Trevi Fountain counts. In order to keep our
fantasy aloft, we have learned to avoid the little pinpricks of
reality such as how we're going to make a living, what we'll do for
friends, where to redeem our empty soda cans or what to do with our
children.
 &HT;    Not every vacation destination is good fantasy material. It may
be a nice place to visit, but even inveterate dreamers wouldn't
want to live there. Some places are too hot; some too cold. I'd be
cutting sod in Ireland right now if it weren't for the bloody rain.
 &HT;    We don't have many third-world real-estate fantasies. I hate to
think we could be so shallow, but it may be that our ability to
have a good fantasy is linked to the life expectancy and gross
national product of the country involved.
 &HT;    We once went on a ``trek'' in the Himalayas. I passed scores of
women who were also trekking, but they were doing it all day every
day, up and down the mountain carrying plastic buckets of water on
their heads.
 &HT;    The Nepalese fantasy outlook was a little more promising for
Larry. The men spent their days sitting cross-legged, playing
cards, smoking and growing stubble. Sure, I yearned to breathe that
pure mountain air on a permanent basis, and to see day break
gloriously each morning over Mount Everest _ but not with a bucket
on my head.
 &HT;    Paris is our favorite place in which to pretend to live. We've
almost bought real estate there several times. We don't care if the
French aren't friendly. When we are French, we won't be friendly
either.
 &HT;    I love to imagine who I'd be if I were French. I walk the
streets, giving the women the once-over, especially the femmes d'un
certain age, my age, middle age, to be precise.
 &HT;    Would I dare to slip into the skin of that flamboyantly hennaed
woman carrying the baguette, the one with the cheekbones, the
purple frock and the green kid heels that do not hurt her feet?
 &HT;    I imagine her on her way to the open-air market where she will
buy an armload of flowers and, on a whim, a canary in a cage. (I
don't like birds and have never wished to own one, but in Paris I
will.)
 &HT;    Larry the lawyer thinks he's that insouciant guy over there,
leaning against the archway rolling a Gauloise around between his
lips, letting the ash fall. Larry's fantasy involves frequent
visits to the Louvre, reading in the Tuileries, eating sweetbreads
and, in the summers, sailing off the coast of Normandy. (Larry
doesn't sail and we have lived for 30 years on Long Island Sound.)
 &HT;    After a few days of imagining ourselves French, we find we are
speaking French. That is to say, we are speaking our very own
spontaneous patois _ using French words when we can remember them,
and when we can't, speaking English with a French accent, like
Charles Boyer. But of course.
 &HT;    We eat a lot of sandwichs jambon. We return to the same cafe at
dusk. We discuss which of our favorite reds should be our house
wine. Thus Frenchified, we feel that the time is right to find our
fantasy home.
 &HT;    Invariably, on one of our many delightfully aimless walks, we
find ourselves in front of a real-estate office. We examine the
photographs on display in the window. Do we want a house or an
apartment? Should we louer or acheter? The Left Bank, of course,
but quelle arrondissement?
 &HT;    Larry, whose favorite opera is ``La Boheme,'' would like
something in the way of a garret, with a dormer window and chimney
pots. And a sink in the corner. I'm not fussy, as long as there's a
place for my canary.
 &HT;    But can we afford it? Larry converts the various asking prices
from francs into dollars. These conversions are followed by a
pause, which is long and weighty enough to indicate that we are
giving sober consideration to the matter.
 &HT;    Then he speaks the words that let me know we've got a
full-fledged fantasy on our hands: ``I wonder how much we could get
for our house?'' We've got lift-off.
 &HT;    It is embarrassing to think about the trail of aborted rental
and purchase agreements we have left in our wake. In St.-Remy it
was ``Small house in town with irises and cyprus trees''; in
Katmandu ``Renovated monastery cell''; in Jackson Hole ``Log cabin,
Teton backdrop''; in the Cotswolds ``One-bedroom cottage,
thatched.''
 &HT;    How easily we betray our real lives in our dreams! How heedless
of the time and energy we put into home, community and friends,
never mind love of country. Vacation fantasizing is a lot like a
midlife crisis. You want to dump your old life and marry some place
new.
 &HT;    We are not the innocent, faithful children we once were. We
don't call out a fond, ``Goodbye house, goodbye door, goodbye
steps, goodbye lawn'' as we back down the driveway. Instead, it's
``Lemme outa here'' as we make our escape, pursued by a swarm of
stress: Did I change the message on the answering machine? Do I
have my passport? Did I hold the mail, pay the bills, call off the
newspaper, program the VCR, turn down the thermostat, straighten my
sock drawer, review my will, forget the tickets, remember the
Xanax? Who wouldn't want to live somewhere else?
 &HT;    Most of the time we're pretty good at keeping fantasy in its
place. Of course we're not going to live in a garret in Paris.
We're just playing house. We've learned our lesson the hard way.
Whenever we have tried to mix fantasy with reality, the gods have
exacted their price. It can be paid in either cash or humiliation.
 &HT;    After a particularly pleasant vacation in London a few years
ago, we resisted the temptation to buy a flat and settled for
buying a London cab. At the time, cabs that had been retired from
service were sold at a garage near Elephant and Castle. Ours had
over 300,000 miles on it. It had a running board. It was full of
quaint advertisements. The seat flipped down. The meter worked. We
 &HT;    imagined what fun we'd have picking up our friends for dinner
and the movies.
 &HT;    Once home, we waited eagerly for the word from Hoboken that our
taxi had arrived. When Larry claimed it at the dock, he and three
guys with tattoos had to push it to get it started. Then the wheels
fell off. The customs inspector felt so sorry for Larry he refused
to charge him any duty.
 &HT;    On yet another occasion we trespassed the threshold between
fantasy and reality big time. It was the '70s, and we were young
and idealistic. We moved from Connecticut to Big Sur, Calif., on
the strength of a two-week stay at the Esalen Institute, where I
was convinced that I could actualize my human potential by pounding
on a pillow and hugging strangers.
 &HT;    It's not as if our friends didn't try to warn us. One of them
did his best to stop us, but we stubbornly refused to get the
point.
 &HT;    ``Haven't you ever had a fantasy about living a better life in
another place?'' I challenged him.
 &HT;    ``Of course I have. I even have a favorite fantasy. I want to
move to London and hire out as a butler in a well-appointed home.''
 &HT;    ``Well then why don't you do it?'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Because then I wouldn't have it as a fantasy any more.''
 &HT;    For an entire year I was a California mountain woman. I
earnestly eschewed brassieres in favor of black leotards. I wore
long paisley skirts that could double as tablecloths, tied at the
waist. I grew all my hair. I made my own granola. I said ``far
out.'' But no matter what I did or how hard I pounded, I was still
from the Northeast.
 &HT;    Larry, who is better than I am at making the best of a bad deal,
smoked a lot and volunteered as a model for the massage class. When
we finally got home and slipped back into reality we vowed we'd
never, ever again lose our grip on fantasy.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Many travel companies now offer their budget-conscious and
entrepreneurial customers a way to save money on their trips _
sometimes as much as the full price of an airline ticket or the
entire cost of a tour.
 &HT;    The secret? Become a group travel leader. As the name implies,
group travel leaders earn their savings by recruiting friends,
neighbors or people they know from church groups or service clubs
to travel together.
 &HT;    Some mature travelers are so adept at organizing groups that it
becomes something of a part-time business in which they develop
various travel clubs and produce newsletters.
 &HT;    Robert Rogers of Eureka Springs, Ark., started out hoping to
earn travel credits as a ``vacation ambassador'' for Grand Circle
Travel, (800) 597-2452. GCT ambassadors earn a $100 credit for each
of the first four travelers he or she recruits in a calendar year.
Starting with the fifth traveler, credits accumulate at a rate of
$150 per person. The credits can be cashed in for any future trip
offered by GCT.
 &HT;    Rogers' first encounter with Grand Circle occurred two years ago
when he took an all-inclusive trip to the Costa Del Sol. Rogers was
so impressed with the itinerary on that particular tour that he
recommended it to some of his friends, describing it as a ``totally
relaxing'' experience. His anecdotes about the days he spent on the
Mediterranean coast were enough to convince his friends to sign up.
He then made bookings for them.
 &HT;    Rogers was so successful with his inaugural referrals that when
the list grew to 12 friends, GCT designated him a group leader _ a
notch up from vacation ambassador _ earning him a complimentary
trip.
 &HT;    Like Rogers, Bob Jones of Coldchester, Conn., was able to
stretch his travel dollar by also becoming a group leader. After
retiring in 1994 from his job as branch manager of the American
Automobile Association, Jones refused to slow down. ``I am just too
active to do nothing,'' he said. That's when he began asking
friends if they wanted to start a travel club.
 &HT;    After about 75 percent of those he asked said, ``Yes,'' Jones
started organizing cruises for a local travel agency. It wasn't
long before he branched out, coordinating groups for GCT. His first
trip for GCT was to Mexico's Copper Canyon.
 &HT;    
 THE MORE, THE MERRIER  
 &HT;    The larger groups help pay Jones' travel expenses and provide a
way for him to include extras, such as renting a motor coach for
the group to ride together to the New York airport.
 &HT;    ``But once we were in New York, I didn't have to do a thing,''
he says. ``We had our own coach and guide. He handled every
detail.''
 &HT;    Jones says that organizing a travel group can incur some costs,
depending on the amount of energy one wishes to invest in
recruiting participants. For example, Jones opted to personally
mail out brochures. He also took care of receiving each traveler's
deposit and forwarding it to GCT. But, he says, ``After that, Grand
Circle took over ... I didn't even have to count the luggage or the
people _ not once.''
 &HT;    As Jones points out, ``Anyone who is outgoing should be able to
do this.'' He has even gone so far as to hold social gatherings at
his home, where he shows a travel film describing an upcoming
destination and serves coffee and snacks. ``Then it all seems to
happen by itself,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jones has also been a group leader with other travel companies,
including Brendan Tours, Holland America and TWA.
 &HT;    Marion Lothian of Lakehurst, N.J., thinks it's her attention to
detail that makes her trips extra special. In fact, she admits that
her desire for everything to ``be just right'' is the main reason
why she chooses to serve as the intermediary for each participant.
That means getting each deposit, collecting the rest of the
payment, organizing a bus to the airport and allocating tips for
baggage handlers and guides.
 &HT;    ``I want to take care of everything so they don't have to stick
their hands in their pockets for anything,'' she says.
 &HT;    Just before each trip, Lothian briefs her travelers so they know
what to wear, how to handle the money in the country they will
visit and what to do with their passports and visas. When the trip
is concluded, Lothian does her book work and IRS paperwork.
 &HT;    Lothian has worked with Vantage Deluxe World Travel, (800)
634-2180; Collette, (888) 344-5578; and GCT. She even developed her
own travel club in her community of 3,500 and serves as club
president. This past spring she organized tours to Scandinavia and
Spain.
 &HT;    
 WITH THE PERKS COMES WORK  
 &HT;    Lothian suggests that anyone who is thinking about becoming a
group travel leader should have a nice personality as well as ``a
strong sense of right and wrong and how to handle situations while
keeping their cool.
 &HT;    ``If they don't want to do the preparation or book work, they
shouldn't get involved because it is work and responsibility,'' she
adds.
 &HT;    Many travel brochures now spell out the details of group-travel
credits or comps. For example, Vantage Deluxe World Travel provides
a free trip, double occupancy, to group leaders for each group of
10 they recruit _ even if the leader doesn't travel with the group.
 &HT;    Immersia Travel, (800) 207-5454, offers a $1,000 savings for a
``group travel planner'' who gathers five travelers for a trip. A
complimentary trip is earned when the planner gathers 10 people.
For groups of 14 or more, the planner gets both a complimentary
trip and a $100-per-person rebate.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions and comments to Adele
Malott, c/o The New York Times Syndicate, 122 East 42nd St., 14th
Floor, New York, N.Y. 10168. Send Adele a postcard from your trip
with ideas, questions and information on the bargains you find for
seniors.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARAH LYALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most
regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still
delightfully long, but it is also the month for the Edinburgh
International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and
theater.
 &HT;    Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as
international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm,
take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor
thoroughly spoiled for choice.
 &HT;    It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic
experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost
300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to
things such as education and health.
 &HT;    The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made
building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old
City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the
legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new
political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV
Bridge.
 &HT;    One caveat: it is normal, while visiting Edinburgh, to become
unduly obsessed with the vicissitudes of Scottish weather. It can
be cold; it can be hot; rain is generally lurking somewhere on the
horizon. The best course is to plan for the worst, but hope for the
best.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    From Aug. 13 to Sept. 2, Edinburgh will feast on the dizzyingly
eclectic smorgasbord that is the Edinburgh International Festival.
For tickets and a full list of events, call the festival office at
(44-131) 473-2000 (www.eif.co.uk) or Globaltickets at (800)
223-6108 in the United States.
 &HT;    Tickets can also be purchased at the Hub, the festival's
handsome new headquarters _ a prime spot for eating and shopping,
too _ on the Royal Mile in the Old City. Here are some highlights:
 &HT;    On Sept. 1, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra will be performing
Janacek's Sinfonietta and Mahler's ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' a
lyrical meditation on death and nature. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at
Usher Hall on Lothian Road. Tickets from $7.50 to $58.50
(calculated at $1.50 to the pound).
 &HT;    The pianist Christian Zacharias will direct and accompany the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra in a rendering of the complete cycle of
Mozart's piano concertos, over seven nights between Aug. 14 and 27
at Usher Hall. Tickets $7.50 to $46.50.
 &HT;    Another of the festival's delights is seeing a play in a foreign
language. This year's possibilities include a German ``Hamlet'' and
a Spanish play called ``One thousand five hundred meters above the
level of Jack,'' about a deep-sea diver teetering on the edge of
madness. All have English supertitles. On various dates; tickets
from $9 to $33.75.
 &HT;    The Netherlands Dance Theater _ really three companies in one,
with each made up of dancers at different points in their careers _
is presenting a program of bold, sexy dancing over five nights,
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. And on Aug. 30 and 31, dancers from NDT1,
the main company, will dance to music played by the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras conducting.
Performances are at 7:30 p.m. at various sites; tickets, $7.50 to
$55.50.
 &HT;    There also is the well-known but much less formalized Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, which features stand-up comedy, theater, skits,
dance, music and mime in halls, parks, clubs and on the streets.
Performances run Aug. 6 to 28; (44-131) 226-5138; www.edfringe.com.
Admission to some performances is free; tickets range up to $22.50.
 &HT;    From Aug. 4 to 26, Edinburgh is also celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an extravaganza of
pipes and drums and well-turned calves peeking out from beneath
kilts. It takes place at night, beside Edinburgh Castle, which adds
to the pageantry; (44-131) 225-1188, www.edintattoo.co.uk. Shows
are Monday to Friday at 9 p.m., and Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets: $12.75 to $36.75.
 &HT;    Devoted to Dadaists and Surrealists such as Ernst, Magritte and
Man Ray, the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road, is a beautifully
organized new museum in a grand, neo-Classical former orphanage in
north Edinburgh. An exhibition from Saturday through Oct. 1 will
feature Salvador Dali. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.; (44-131) 624-6200. The regular collection is
free; the Dali exhibition is $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    If the day is spectacularly sunny (it happens sometimes),
celebrate at the Royal Botanic Garden, 70 acres of beautiful
gardens and greenhouses that feature a display of herbaceous
borders during August. Tucked amid all the greenery are a cafe and
shop. The Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, (44-131) 552-7171, is open
daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in September). Free admission.
 &HT;    The former royal yacht Britannia is docked on Ocean Drive in
Leith, and you can pay $11.55 ($8.95 ages 60 and older, $5.60 ages
5 to 17) to stride its four decks in a monarchical manner. Open
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and until 7:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday; (44-131) 555-5566. Reservations are advised.
 &HT;    It cost hundreds of millions of dollars less than the Millennium
Dome in Greenwich, but Dynamic Earth, a new museum not far from the
royal Palace of Holyroodhouse, is far more successful. This
minidome offers nothing less than the story of Earth in all its
diversity.
 &HT;    Visitors can experience icebergs, volcanoes and tropical rain
forests, among other things, in 11 galleries with stunning special
effects. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer, with last entry at
4:45. Information: (44-131) 550-7800; admission is $10.40, $5.90
ages 5 to 15.
 &HT;    The Museum of Scotland, on Chambers Street, presents a whirlwind
tour of Scottish history. Attractions include an authentic
18th-century guillotine. The top floor is a crazy quilt of objects
_ from golf balls and hairdryers to a Saab convertible to the Queen
song ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' _ that ordinary Scots have identified as
essential to their very being. Open daily. Admission (which also
gets you into the Royal Museum next door) is $4.50, $2.25 for
students and those 60 and older. Free for people under 19, and on
Tuesdays after 4:30 p.m.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Rooms are scarce during the festival. For 11th-hour help, try
www.edinburgh.org, which has a listing of hotels, or (44-131)
473-3800. For rooms in private homes at festival time, call
(44-131) 225-1101.
 &HT;    Just 10 minutes by car from the center of town and easily
reachable by bus, the Malmaison stands in modern splendor in Leith,
a lively and much-revived waterfront neighborhood east of central
Edinburgh.
 &HT;    The hotel, one in an admired British chain, is decorated in cool
earth tones, with clean lines and geometric motifs. The 60 rooms
include five suites. Doubles from $165, with tax. One Tower Place,
Leith; (44-131) 468-5000, fax (44-131) 468-5002.
 &HT;    The recently refurbished Edinburgh Royal Circus Hotel, 19-21

major attractions. Doubles are $144, tax and breakfast included;
(44-131) 220-5000, fax (44-131) 220-2020.
 &HT;    Budget: The Ashlyn Guest House, 42 Inverleith Row near the
Botanic Garden, is one of scores of small family-run hotels that
offer all the comforts of someone else's home at reasonable prices.
Five of the eight bedrooms have private baths. No smoking. Doubles

 &HT;    Luxury: The Bonham, 35 Drumsleugh Gardens, Edinburgh's newest
hip hotel, epitomizes the city's seemingly effortless ability to

 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Tucked away off the Royal Mile, Dubh Prais, 123B High Street,
offers Scottish dishes lovingly prepared with traditional recipes.
Try collops in the pan, steak medallions in a
port-and-pickled-walnut sauce; for dessert, there's atholl brose
parfait, an unusually tasty ice cream made with toasted oatmeal,
honey and Drambuie. A typical dinner for two, plus wine, costs
about $90. Reservations are essential _ there are only nine tables;
(44-131) 557-5732.
 &HT;    The Tower, at the top of the Museum of Scotland on Chambers
Street, is one of Edinburgh's hottest new restaurants. Appetizers
include sauteed mushrooms with spinach, poached egg and toasted
brioche; for the main course, portions of steak and roast beef come
in three sizes: 8, 12, and 16 ounces. Dinner for two, with wine,
generally comes to about $150. A two-course pre-theater dinner for
$18 is available from 4 to 6 p.m.; (44-131) 225-3003.
 &HT;    Most of Scotland's art galleries and museums feature smart cafes
with tasty dishes. One that stands out is Cafe Newton in the Dean
Gallery, 73 Belford Road. It is open the same hours as the gallery
and offers a small selection of light entrees, like smoked salmon
with creme fraiche, and an eggplant, feta, pesto and olive sandwich
on a choice of bread. A sculpture of Isaac Newton looks down from
the center of the room. Sandwiches average $6.35; daily hot
specials range from $6.75 to $8.25; brownies and other treats cost
from $1.20 to $4.35; no alcohol served.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner of Hunter Square, not far from the bustle
of the Royal Mile, Bann's vegetarian cafe provides healthful food.
At dinner, appetizers include Thai phyllo parcels with stir-fried
vegetables on wilted bok choy, with a sweet sesame-seed oil
dressing; main courses include tarte tatin made of
 &HT;    layers of roasted sweet pepper, zucchini and cheddar cheese, and
an all-vegetable haggis _ no animal innards to speak of. Dinner for
two, with wine, costs about $60. Open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.;
(44-131) 226-1112.
 &HT;    In the last few years, George Street has overtaken the
increasingly tacky Princes Street nearby as the city's choice
shopping and eating street. One of the nicest restaurants here is
the Dome, in a vast, high-ceilinged building that used to be a
mortuary, then a bank.
 &HT;    At the outside Garden Cafe, enjoy pizza and pasta (weather
permitting) for about $24 for two, wine included; in the Grill
Room, expect to pay from $60 to $75 for two, including wine, at
dinner for dishes that include pheasant and apricot terrine with
red currant dressing. They can both be found under one dome at 14
George Street; (44-131) 624-8624.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LISA FUGARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If birders go birding then those who seek out wildflowers surely
go flowering; the term botanizing doesn't begin to capture the
sweet delight I experienced on discovering the profusion of
wildflowers growing in the Burren in County Clare on Ireland's west
coast.
 &HT;    My romance with bird's-foot trefoil, mountain avens and herb
Robert came about by accident. When I flew into Shannon last July
and met my mother, Sheila, for a 10-day holiday, it was with the
intention of viewing shore birds and, with luck, a few seals.
 &HT;    Bleak and harsh are the adjectives often used to describe the
Burren, a roughly 100-square-mile limestone landscape of cliffs,
stony hills and broad stretches of rock resembling pavement. I have
an affinity for such landscapes, as does my mother, and the
boireann, the Irish word for rocky place, did not disappoint us.
 &HT;    Two and a half hours after leaving the airport in a
sardine-can-sized rental car, well suited to skinny country roads,
we crested a hill just above a stretch of coastline called Pol
Salach and saw a stunning panorama of fierce Ireland _ shattered
terraces of stark limestone spilling into a sea that was gray as
elephant skin.
 &HT;    We followed the coast road through the lonely village of Fanore
where horses grazed in rock-strewn pastures next to the beach, past
Black Head where the limestone cliffs plunged into the sea. Masses
of oxeye daisies and fuchsias blooming on the side of the road
softened the austere beauty of the rock.
 &HT;    By the time we reached Ballyvaughan, a tiny village sitting on a
tranquil corner of Galway Bay, we were enamored of the Burren.
Smoked salmon and mussels at Monk's Bar on the quay and two elegant
bedrooms in Rusheen Lodge, a four-star guest house, only added to
our satisfaction.
 &HT;    The next morning we drove into the hills behind Ballyvaughan
where flinty stone walls divided the land into pastures. I was
itching to walk among the rocks, but in planning the trip I had
promised my mother a ruin a day. My passion for the natural world
is matched by her passion for mosques, temples, tombs and ruined
churches. Such churches abound in the Burren, as do ring forts and
Neolithic tombs.
 &HT;    Our first visit was to the village of Kilfenora where the
tiniest medieval cathedral awaited us. The nave or front section is
still used for church services while the roofless chancel radiates
stillness and mystery. Two identical stone carvings _ apparently
the head of a bishop _ have a vaguely Egyptian air about them.
 &HT;    A delicate trefoil sedilia _ three seats crowned with a
beautifully carved pinnacle _ is recessed into one wall, while on
the adjacent wall are two naively incised 13th- and 14th-century
stone carvings.
 &HT;    One of them, supposedly of a cleric, had us perplexed. What did
the oval head and elongated neck remind us of? Where had we seen
that serene, otherworldly demeanor?
 &HT;    My mother, who is half Irish and has a streak of sly Irish wit
about her, solved that mystery when she exclaimed ``The Holy
Alien!''
 &HT;    Pelting rain and sudden squalls, rain that drizzles and mizzles
_ Ireland is one of the few countries where such weather is
shrugged off, hardly a deterrent to wildflower adventures.
 &HT;    After lunch I dropped my mother back at the B&AMP;B and, armed with
``Wild Plants of the Burren and the Aran Islands,'' bought at the
Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfenora, and a large umbrella
(which immediately marked me as a foreigner and a sissy), I drove
40 minutes along the coast road to rocky Pol Salach for my first
afternoon of flowering.
 &HT;    The great mystique of the flora of the Burren lies in its
diversity and its growing habits _ Mediterranean and arctic-alpine
plants thrive side by side. None of the species are unique to the
Burren, but many grow in the limestone landscape in greater
abundance than anywhere else in Ireland or Britain.
 &HT;    I parked the car, climbed over a low stone wall and crouched on
the ground. Crushing wild thyme between my fingers, I breathed
deep. I'd identified my first wildflower. And what were the tiny
white flowers intertwined with the thyme? I thumbed through my
flower book.
 &HT;    Yes! It was squinancy wort. After half an hour of literally
crawling through a cow pasture so ablaze with flowers it seemed as
though a beneficent fairy artist had dipped her paintbrush in
magenta, blue, yellow, cream and periwinkle blue and flicked it
over the ground, I reached the limestone pavement.
 &HT;    Smooth, relatively flat, rectangular chunks of limestone called
clints are separated from one another by fissures that range in
depth from one foot to 20. It's in these fissures, or grikes, that
the pluckiest of plants flourish. The magenta flowers of bloody
cranesbill swayed brightly against the bone-colored rock, and I saw
honeysuck le plants twisted into bonsais by the strong winds.
 &HT;    Closer to the sea cliffs I found those plants that thrive in the
salty spray gusting off Galway Bay _ bobbing heads of pink thrift
and sea campion and thick seaweedy-looking ferns that glistened in
the grikes. Of course, there were plants that I couldn't identify.
 &HT;    There are over 600 species recorded in the Burren. The book I
carried listed 120. I was momentarily frustrated. Then smiled. My
naming them didn't bring the flowers into being. Why not simply
enjoy them?
 &HT;    Our love affair with the Burren was now well under way, and the
following day while driving to Corcomroe, a Cistercian abbey that
lies five miles east of Ballyvaughan, my mother fantasized about
buying property. We parked at the end of a country lane and
immediately registered an eerie sound that seemed to be rising from
the ruined abbey. A ham-fisted ghost stumbling over the bass keys
of an organ?
 &HT;    After some investigation the Organist of Corcomroe, as he is now
affectionately remembered by my mother and me, turned out to be a
most handsome blond bull lowing to several docile black-and-white
cows cloistered in a field on the opposite side of the road.
 &HT;    While Kilfenora's chancel is exquisitely intimate, Corcomroe,
with the wind gusting through it, feels lonely and desolate. It
also has a stunning roof, as do most of the churches we visited,
with a wide swath of changeable Irish sky through which the rooks
wheeled and cawed. On some of the pillars the traces of carvings of
flowers can be found, a stony reminder of the abbey's other name,
Our Lady of the Fertile Rocks.
 &HT;    In one corner there is a recumbent effigy said to be that of an
O'Brien king killed nearby in 1267. Above it is an unfinished
14th-century carving, presumably of the abbot of Corcomroe. With a
hint of a smile on his face and rather puffy attire, he looks as
though he's levitating up the ruined chancel.
 &HT;    ``Three days is not enough time to explore the Burren,'' I
lamented over dinner that night in the superb Whitethorn
restaurant.
 &HT;    Reservations in Connemara awaited us, so the following day we
left for County Galway. On our way we stopped at Thoor Ballylee
near the town of Gort _ less than an hour's drive from Ballyvaughan
_ where Yeats summered from 1917 to 1929. The recorded commentary
issuing from speakers in his dining room, study and bedroom didn't
interest me so I climbed higher.
 &HT;    Close to the top of the stone tower I found what was surely the
true spirit of Yeats _ a soft-feathered, fierce-eyed kestrel
guarding her chick on a nest of sticks.
 &HT;    After two days in Connemara, during which time the sun blazed 16
hours a day and I swam in the stillest, bluest bay I'd ever seen,
gray clouds rolled in from the ocean. Rain spattered on the window
of our hotel. ``Only one place to be in such moody weather,'' I
said to my mother. Back to the Burren we raced.
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge had been lovely, but I always feel as though I'm
staying in my grandparents' house when I visit a B &AMP; B. That
evening we checked into the Ballinalacken Castle Hotel, a sprawling
country house sitting on a hill just below a 15th-century O'Brien
tower house. The ruin is now roped off because too many visitors
were leaving with chunks of genuine Irish castle in their pockets.
 &HT;    We felt like Burren old-timers, and our remaining days took on
an easy routine. In the mornings we visited churches, castles and
towers. There was Dysert O'Dea, where a bizarre array of
Romanesque-style animal and human heads arches over the south
doorway of the church.
 &HT;    Lemaneagh Castle, worthy of at least a few ghosts, stands proud
in a stretch of windswept farmland (equally creepy was the electric
fence surrounding the field and the old Irish codger who scowled at
the few cars parked just beyond his land).
 &HT;    In Killinaboy we came across a humble ruined church with a
simple carving of the Crucifixion and the weathered Sheila na gig,
an ancient fertility symbol, above the entrance.
 &HT;    Each afternoon I went flowering. A walk up the Kyber Pass, a
road in Fanore that follows the Caher River _ the only surface
river in the Burren, as most of the rainwater seeps into the
underground waterways _ will be remembered as the afternoon I
discovered orchids.
 &HT;    Except for the exquisite bee orchid, the terrestrial species of
the Burren are not as showy as tropical orchids that cling to
trees. Still, I was captivated by their demure beauty.
 &HT;    On another day I went mad for ferns. I kept meaning to hike one
of the ancient green roads that lace the Burren; they're noted for
the wildflowers but I was smitten with rock, with the way a
saucer-sized depression on a boulder could hold an array of small
flowers brilliant as jewels, the way the wind gusting off Galway
Bay tossed the tousled pink flowers of hemp agrimony, a species
that grew en masse in the limestone fissures.
 &HT;    And then there was the food _ lobsters, crabs, black sole,
salmon, mussels. We feasted every evening at local restaurants and
returned to our hotel _ my mother had renamed it Fawlty Castle in
honor of the quirky yet utterly charming staff _ in time for sunset
tea, which, in early July, was at about 9 p.m.
 &HT;    On our last morning in the Burren I wandered the pavement at Pol
Salach, saying goodbye to yet another part of the world I'd fallen
in love with. My evening reading had been from a chapter in ``The
Burren: A Companion to the Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone
Wilderness'' that touched on the historical use of many of the
plants Id been rhapsodizing over, and as I whispered the names of
the flowers surrounding me, I felt as though I were floating back
in time.
 &HT;    Lady's bedstraw _ makes good bedding and can be used as a rennet
plant for curdling milk; squinancy wort _ useful if I ever get an
attack of quinsy; carline thistle _ preserve the buds with honey
and sugar for a tasty sweetmeat; Burnet rose _ I'll drink a syrup
made from the rosehips if I'm coughing, spitting blood or stricken
with scurvy.
 &HT;    The monks of Corcomroe must have put many of these plants to
medicinal use. Perhaps the levitating abbot secretly snacked on
carline thistles.
 &HT;    As for the Holy Alien? That otherworldly, rather blissful
demeanor might have come about from one too many afternoons spent
flowering.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: REVELING IN BIRD'S-FOOT TREFOIL, SQUINANCY WORT AND
THRIFT  
 LODGING  
 &HT;    Rusheen Lodge. Just outside the village of Ballyvaughan, this
four-star guest house has six lovely, spacious rooms with private
bathrooms, and two suites. Doubles are $72; the suites $108, full
breakfast included, calculated at $1.21 to the Irish pound.
Telephone (353-65) 70 77092, fax (353-65) 70 77152.
 &HT;    Ballinalacken Castle Hotel. We loved this creaky yet elegant
hotel on the outskirts of Lisdoonvarna. Drinking tea in the sitting
room and sprawling about our spacious, rather oddly but grandly
decorated room made us feel like fading aristocrats. Some rooms
have splendid views of the Aran Islands, while others (nos. 5, 6,
10 and 11) do not. Doubles are $48 to $54, with full Irish
breakfast. For reservations, telephone or fax (353-65) 70 74025.
 DINING  
 &HT;    Sheedy's Hotel and Restaurant. What this restaurant in
Lisdoonvarna lacks in decor it makes up for with superb food. I had
an entree of black sole so exquisite I wonder if I'll ever eat fish
that fresh again. A three-course dinner for two, excluding drinks,
averages $60. Sheedy's bar has a seafood menu. Telephone (353-65)
70 74026.
 &HT;    The Whitethorn. Situated a half mile east of Ballyvaughan on the
coast road to Galway, this elegant restaurant has a stunning view
of Galway Bay. Dinner for two averages $70 and is served Friday and
Saturday nights only in July and August. Weekends and weekdays the
lunch service is buffet style and the food is just as delicious.
 &HT;    Attached is a shop crammed with good clothing, Irish crafts and
all the guidebooks needed to explore the Burren. Telephone (353-5)
70 77044.
 INFORMATION  
 &HT;    The Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfe nora, the first such
center in Ireland, has models and exhibits explaining the geology,
flora and fauna of the Burren, as well as an audiovisual lecture of
the area. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. through September (to 5
p.m. October to May). Telephone (353-65) 70 88030. Admission $3.
 &HT;    Recommended reading: ``The Burren: a Companion to the
Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone Wilderness'' (Collins Press), by
E. Charles Nelson, who is utterly bewitched by the Burren. For help
in identifying flowers, pick up a copy of ``Wild Plants of the
Burren and the Aran Islands,'' also by E. Charles Nelson. Both
books are available at the Whitethorn and the Burren Interpretive
Center at Kilfenora.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Autumn may be the most delightful time to visit Paris, Rome and
many other European destinations. After all, most of the tourists
have gone home, museums have shorter lines and the weather can be
the best of the year.
 &HT;    Hotel prices, however, may not be that much lower than they are
in July and August because September and October are becoming
increasingly popular months to travel. But come late October,
prices do indeed fall.
 &HT;    For those considering a European getaway this autumn, here are
some planning tools.
 AIRFARES &AMP; PACKAGES  
 &HT;    Those who simply want a good, cheap airfare should look to
Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), Travelocity.com
(www.travelocity.com) and LowestFare.com (www.lowestfare.com),
which offer fare finders for thrifty travelers.
 &HT;    Another way to save money is with package deals that include
round-trip airfare, accommodations and transfers _ all for a single
price. Major American and European air carriers offer various
packages to Europe, but two carriers with extensive offerings are
British Airways (Holiday Desk, 75-20 Astoria Blvd., Jackson
Heights, NY 11370; 877-428-2228; www.britishairways.com) and
American Airlines (P.O. Box 619688, DFW Airport, Texas 75261;
800-882-8880; www.aa.com).
 &HT;    Package prices are fixed, and they're frequently available with
as little as seven days' advance notice. The best ones offer a
range of hotel choices, satisfying both budget-minded travelers and
those who want to splash out a little.
 ESCORTED TOURS  
 &HT;    For a single price, escorted tours provide airfare, hotel
accommodations, transfers, transportation as well as most meals,
sightseeing, baggage handling and taxes.
 &HT;    Fortunately, most tour companies no longer try to cram seven
countries into seven days. The smarter ones are tailoring their
trips to people who were brought up traveling independently.
 &HT;    The price can be right, because an escorted tour almost always
costs less than pricing components separately and it comes with the
added benefit of service.
 &HT;    Dozens of companies offer such tours to France, Spain and
virtually every country in Western and Eastern Europe. Travelers
can narrow their search by contacting the United States Tour
Operator Association (342 Madison Ave., Suite 1522, New York, NY
10173; 212-599-6599; www.ustoa.com).
 TRAINS  
 &HT;    Getting around Europe by train is easy. And the easiest way to
research European rail schedules and prices is to contact Rail
Europe (44 South Broadway, White Plains, NY 10601; 800-4-EURAIL;
www.raileurope.com), which also includes Brit Rail.
 &HT;    With a little work, smart travelers can determine whether it's
cheaper to buy point-to-point tickets or to go for a railpass _ or
perhaps decide that a rental car might be even cheaper if there are
enough people traveling together.
 &HT;    A basic Eurailpass costs $554 and provides 15 consecutive days
of unlimited first-class travel in the 17 member countries:
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
 &HT;    But Rail Europe offers an array of regional and national passes,
in both first- and second-class versions. Many passes also come in
flexi-pass versions, since many travelers won't travel on every day
of their vacation.
 &HT;    A German Flexipass, for example, permits four days of travel in
a one-month period, for $252 in first class and $174 in second.
 &HT;    There are also passes that save two travelers money, like the
Swiss Saver Flexipass. It's $198 in first class and $132 in second
class, per person, for two travelers. They get three days of travel
within one month. Single travelers pay $234 and $156, respectively,
for these same passes.
 &HT;    Regional passes, such as the Europass, link France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Rail Europe also offers a variety of
Eurostar tickets, for travel on the high-speed train between
Brussels, London and Paris.
 RENTALS  
 &HT;    Renting a European house or apartment for a week or more is
often an affordable way to go. That's true for a London apartment,
a Swiss chalet or a French villa.
 &HT;    Most renters will find that they get more space for their money,
even in a studio apartment, than at a comparable hotel.
 &HT;    Small homes and larger villas are suitable for families or
couples traveling together. In fact, when families or couples pool
their finances, renting can be a true cost-saver.
 &HT;    When looking for a rental, choose a property by location as well
as size and amenities. These companies offer a wide range of
European rentals:
 &HT;     The French Experience  (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New
York, NY 10017; 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.com) has long
specialized in ``gites,'' rural vacation homes throughout the
French countryside.
 &HT;     Homes Away  (34 Park Road, Toronto M4W 2N4, Ontario, Canada;
800-374-6637; www.homesaway.com) has a handful of upscale rentals

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LAURA MANSNERUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Philadelphia has done everything it could think of for the
45,000 visitors expected at the Republican National Convention: its
landmark architecture is polished, its streetscapes groomed, its
hotels gleaming with restored marble and brass and stocked with
concierges.
 &HT;    But the convention is brief (July 31 through Aug. 3) and the
summer is long, making for many more weeks of prime tourism in the
nation's original convention city.
 &HT;    When you're inviting the whole country, it's good to have a city
full of walking opportunities. While the convention site, the First
Union Center, is in deep South Philadelphia, the restaurants,
shopping and historic sites are clustered in mercifully compact
Center City, a 15-minute subway or cab ride away.
 &HT;    There, in the two-mile stretch between rivers, the spines of
skyscrapers give way quickly to narrow, leafy residential streets
that make life easy for walkers, if not for traffic. A tourist
could spend a day just inspecting the courtyards and mews,
especially plentiful in the old neighborhoods east of Broad Street.
 &HT;    Philadelphia in summer is still the hot, placid city where
street life means corner taverns with open doors and row-house
stoops occupied by supervising grandparents. But with the dizzying
revival of Center City, another public life _ the kind involving
theater tickets and cell phones _ brings people out.
 &HT;    High summer is also the time to set sandals to the streets
around Independence Hall and see where the delegates to the First
and Second Continental Congresses sweltered. Or to explore the cool
halls of museums that have given their all to this summer's
exhibitions. Or to visit the rivers: the Delaware, with its night
life on the piers, and the more sedate Schuylkill, where the grassy
banks invite picnics and jogging.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The city will greet the convention on its eve, July 30, with a
parade of 59 lighted boats at 9 p.m. and fireworks along the
Delaware. Penn's Landing and the New Jersey State Aquarium in
Camden are prime viewing spots. Information: (800) 770-5883.
 &HT;    You don't have to be a GOP delegate to get into PoliticalFest,
described as a world's fair of politics. It will have historical
and interactive (want to read from a teleprompter?) exhibits at the
Pennsylvania Convention Center, 12th and Arch Streets, July 26
through Aug. 3. Admission: $10 and $5 for students, ages 4 to 11
and 65 and older; (215) 686-0350.
 &HT;    And at the Atwater Kent Museum, 15 South Seventh St., the
exhibit ``Vote: Campaign Choices/Presidential Voices'' is showing
two centuries of campaign memorabilia until Nov. 26. Admission to
the Atwater Kent, Philadelphia's history museum, is $3, $2 for ages
55 and older and $1.50 for children 3 to 12. Information: (215)
922-3031.
 &HT;    The African American Museum in Philadelphia, 701 Arch St., (215)
574-0380, is celebrating the blues all summer. In addition to a
photography exhibition, through Sept. 3, the museum plans outdoor
lunch concerts on Wednesdays in July and August, with hip-hop,
zydeco and classical music represented, too. A second exhibit,
through Sept. 17, celebrates Paul Robeson. Admission: $6, $4 for
students, those aged 55 and older and the handicapped.
 &HT;    ``Andy Warhol: Social Observer'' is at the museum of the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Broad and Cherry Streets, (215)
972-7600, through Sept. 21. The show, including paintings of
Presidents Reagan and Nixon, Chairman Mao and Lenin, is the first
major exhibition of Warhol's work since 1988. Admission is $8, $7
for students and ages 60 and up, and $5 for ages 5 to 18.
 &HT;    On the streets or in the galleries, plastic cups of wine in
hand, people gather in Old City, just northeast of the Liberty
Bell, on First Fridays. This month, an extra Friday, July 28, will
accommodate convention visitors at the sprawling open house. About
40 art galleries, on Second and Third Streets, will open from 5
till 9 p.m. For information, call (215) 625-9200 or (800) 555-5191.
 &HT;    It's not Wrigley Field, but Veterans Stadium does have real
baseball, and it's next to the First Union Center. No matter what
they say about Philadelphia fans, the Vet is a friendly place. The
Phillies are home July 25 to July 30 (Chicago and Los Angeles),
Aug. 7 to Aug. 16 (San Diego, Houston and Arizona) and Aug. 25 to
Aug. 30 (San Francisco and Colorado). Tickets, $7 to $22.50;
information, (215) 463-1000.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    In a city that never runs out of material, the Foundation for
Architecture leads walking tours of about two hours five days a
week _ Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m., and Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings at 6.
 &HT;    A dozen offerings during the convention include ``20th Century
Unlimited,'' around Center Square, and ``Littlest Streets,'' along
the old, once-bohemian residential alleys of Washington Square
West. Adults $7, students $6; (215) 569-3187.
 &HT;    A different thread of history is on view at the hulking Eastern
State Penitentiary, 22nd Street and Fairmount Avenue. Eastern
State, one of the nation's first penitentiaries, opened in 1829 and
was home to Al Capone and Willie Sutton. The gothic stone monster
was only recently rescued from decades of decay and opened for
tours of Capone's specially furnished cell and other exhibits on
Wednesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in summer. The
fee is $7, $5 for students and ages 55 and up, and $3 for under 17.
Information, (215) 236-3300.
 &HT;    Walkers naturally seek out Society Hill, the core of
Philadelphia's original civic life and of its downtown revival 30
years ago. It's a genteel quarter, red brick from the sidewalks up,
encompassing Independence National Historic Park and dotted with
courtyards and churchyards, with many Georgian and Federal
buildings. But at its southern edge, South Street booms at night
with bars and quirky shops.
 &HT;    Across Society Hill's northern boundary, Market Street, is Old
City, which 20 years ago was a disused quarter of small, abandoned
garment factories with a few luncheonettes and a string of
restaurant-supply stores. The area is now packed with galleries,
coffeehouses, restaurants and clubs.
 &HT;    Runners can always put on shorts and head up the Benjamin
Franklin Parkway from Center City to the Philadelphia Museum of
Art. A jogging and bike path continues another four miles along the
Schuylkill, where the sights _ bridges, scullers, masses of willows
_ are pretty much as Thomas Eakins painted them more than 100 years
ago.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Philadelphia is booked for convention week, but the building
binge has ensured a tourists' market for most other weeks of the
summer and fall. To find out about hotel packages, including
tickets to cultural events, call a visitors' information number:
(888) 467-4452.
 &HT;    The Sheraton Society Hill, Second and Walnut Streets, has a
quiet, established niche in the historic district. Like its
surroundings, the low-rise red-brick hotel is Colonial (except for
the swimming pool) and sedate. The 365 traditional rooms and suites
range from $155 to $270 for a double. Reservations, (215) 238-6000,
fax (215) 238-6652.
 &HT;    A block from the convention center, Loews, 1200 Market St.,
(215) 627-1200, fax (215) 231-7305, is an Art Deco creation in an
old bank building (check out the vault doors). The 583 rooms are
pure 1930s luxe. A standard double is $175 to $240.
 &HT;    Just off Rittenhouse Square, the Sofitel, a part of the French
hotel chain, recently opened at 120 South 17th St., on a pleasingly
unreconstructed block of tiny shops. The hotel, by contrast, is all
modern and smooth, its 306 rooms furnished in gleaming woods and
geometric prints. Doubles, $189; (215) 569-8300, fax (215)
569-1492.
 &HT;    Budget: The Hawthorn Suites, 1100 Vine St., (215) 829-8300, fax
(215) 829-8104, is crisp and new, if a bit spare. Each of the 294
suites, at $149 to $159 (sometimes less on weekends), has
refrigerator, microwave and wet bar, making life easier for
families. At the northern edge of Center City, the hotel towers
over the convention center and Chinatown.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue, Broad and
Walnut Streets, is rich in detail and history, a match for the
Academy of Music on the next corner of the theater district. With
just 172 rooms, including suites, it has a ballroom, a
conservatory, a rooftop rose garden and such amenities as a day
spa. Doubles start at $275; (215) 893-1234, fax (215) 732-8518.
 &HT;    Rittenhouse Bed and Breakfast, 1715 Rittenhouse Square, (215)
545-1755, fax (215) 545-1750, is as elegant as the neighboring
square, formal from its facade to its nightly shoeshine service.
Some of the 10 individually decorated rooms, all with baths, have
fireplaces and whirlpools. Rates are $220 to $340 and include full
breakfast.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    An anchor of Center City's restaurant row, Susanna Foo, 1512
Walnut St., (215) 545-2666, has done Asian fusion elegantly for
years. Under silk lanterns, diners can make their way from Chinese
soups and delicate dumplings to emphatically French desserts
(apricot tart with almond ice cream, for one). Dinner for two
people with wine, about $125.
 &HT;    Fishmarket, 122 South 18th St., (215) 569-9080, offers seafood
in a town house with just enough painted wood to feel like a crab
house. In fact, for the summer, the Fishmarket is making a big
production of crabs. Take a stool at the glistening raw bar at
happy hour and enjoy oysters for $1 each. Dinner for two, with a
bottle of wine, about $120. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    Le Bar Lyonnais, 1523 Walnut St., (215) 567-1000, is the
downstairs wing of Le Bec-Fin, the French restaurant that has been
on national best-of lists for years. The bar offers many lighter
Bec-Fin standards like the galette de crabe and vichyssoise au
caviar at considerably lower prices. The atmosphere is rich, dark
and close -- it seats about 30. No reservations. Dinner for two
with drinks, about $100. Closed Sunday.
 &HT;    On the other side of Rittenhouse Square, Audrey Claire, (215)
731-1222, opens its wide windows at the corner of 20th and Spruce
Streets to a neighborhood of brownstones and small shops. The fare
is Mediterranean _ Audrey Claire is known for its grilled
flatbreads _ and simple. Outdoor tables available. No reservations
on Friday and Saturday. Bring your own wine. Dinner for two, about
$60. Closed Monday.
 &HT;    Effie's, at 1127 Pine St. on Antique Row, (215) 592-8333, is a
tiny Greek restaurant in a row house with a tiny, inviting garden.
Effie's has fresh fish every day, usually served whole, brushed
with lemon and olive oil and grilled. Bring your own wine. Dinner
for two, under $40.
 &HT;    For those who cannot leave town without a cheesesteak, the pure
South Philadelphia version is available at Pat's King of Steaks,
(215) 468-1546, or Geno's, (215) 389-0659, competing cholesterol
palaces at the intersection of Passyunk, South Ninth and Wharton
Streets.
 &HT;    And for South Philly pizza, try Marra's, 1734 East Passyunk
Ave., (215) 463-9249, now in its third generation. Wear a tank top
and bring $5 to $10 a person (that includes the beer).
 &HT;    A note about Pennsylvania dining: Most restaurants have liquor
licenses, but if you must bring your own, plan. Wine and liquor are
sold only in state stores, which are sparse, poorly stocked and
expensive. They are also not open late or on Sunday.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MARY-LOU WEISMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    My husband, Larry, and I like to go house hunting on vacation.
One minute we are behaving like proper tourists in Provence, Sydney
or Prague, and the next we're making plans to live there. It's not
enough to be seeing the sites, enjoying the culture, eating the
food and drinking the wine; we have to own the place.
 &HT;    We travel the way Caesar's army conquered Gaul; we come, we see,
we acquire real estate _ at least in our dreams.
 &HT;    When in Rome, Larry imagines himself sitting all day outside his
apartment in the Piazza Navona. He is sipping cappuccino, reading a
book on architecture and smoking. (Larry resumes smoking on all of
his fantasy vacations.)
 &HT;    Larry does not have a job in Rome. I don't either, unless diving
for coins in the Trevi Fountain counts. In order to keep our
fantasy aloft, we have learned to avoid the little pinpricks of
reality such as how we're going to make a living, what we'll do for
friends, where to redeem our empty soda cans or what to do with our
children.
 &HT;    Not every vacation destination is good fantasy material. It may
be a nice place to visit, but even inveterate dreamers wouldn't
want to live there. Some places are too hot; some too cold. I'd be
cutting sod in Ireland right now if it weren't for the bloody rain.
 &HT;    We don't have many third-world real-estate fantasies. I hate to
think we could be so shallow, but it may be that our ability to
have a good fantasy is linked to the life expectancy and gross
national product of the country involved.
 &HT;    We once went on a ``trek'' in the Himalayas. I passed scores of
women who were also trekking, but they were doing it all day every
day, up and down the mountain carrying plastic buckets of water on
their heads.
 &HT;    The Nepalese fantasy outlook was a little more promising for
Larry. The men spent their days sitting cross-legged, playing
cards, smoking and growing stubble. Sure, I yearned to breathe that
pure mountain air on a permanent basis, and to see day break
gloriously each morning over Mount Everest _ but not with a bucket
on my head.
 &HT;    Paris is our favorite place in which to pretend to live. We've
almost bought real estate there several times. We don't care if the
French aren't friendly. When we are French, we won't be friendly
either.
 &HT;    I love to imagine who I'd be if I were French. I walk the
streets, giving the women the once-over, especially the femmes d'un
certain age, my age, middle age, to be precise.
 &HT;    Would I dare to slip into the skin of that flamboyantly hennaed
woman carrying the baguette, the one with the cheekbones, the
purple frock and the green kid heels that do not hurt her feet?
 &HT;    I imagine her on her way to the open-air market where she will
buy an armload of flowers and, on a whim, a canary in a cage. (I
don't like birds and have never wished to own one, but in Paris I
will.)
 &HT;    Larry the lawyer thinks he's that insouciant guy over there,
leaning against the archway rolling a Gauloise around between his
lips, letting the ash fall. Larry's fantasy involves frequent
visits to the Louvre, reading in the Tuileries, eating sweetbreads
and, in the summers, sailing off the coast of Normandy. (Larry
doesn't sail and we have lived for 30 years on Long Island Sound.)
 &HT;    After a few days of imagining ourselves French, we find we are
speaking French. That is to say, we are speaking our very own
spontaneous patois _ using French words when we can remember them,
and when we can't, speaking English with a French accent, like
Charles Boyer. But of course.
 &HT;    We eat a lot of sandwichs jambon. We return to the same cafe at
dusk. We discuss which of our favorite reds should be our house
wine. Thus Frenchified, we feel that the time is right to find our
fantasy home.
 &HT;    Invariably, on one of our many delightfully aimless walks, we
find ourselves in front of a real-estate office. We examine the
photographs on display in the window. Do we want a house or an
apartment? Should we louer or acheter? The Left Bank, of course,
but quelle arrondissement?
 &HT;    Larry, whose favorite opera is ``La Boheme,'' would like
something in the way of a garret, with a dormer window and chimney
pots. And a sink in the corner. I'm not fussy, as long as there's a
place for my canary.
 &HT;    But can we afford it? Larry converts the various asking prices
from francs into dollars. These conversions are followed by a
pause, which is long and weighty enough to indicate that we are
giving sober consideration to the matter.
 &HT;    Then he speaks the words that let me know we've got a
full-fledged fantasy on our hands: ``I wonder how much we could get
for our house?'' We've got lift-off.
 &HT;    It is embarrassing to think about the trail of aborted rental
and purchase agreements we have left in our wake. In St.-Remy it
was ``Small house in town with irises and cyprus trees''; in
Katmandu ``Renovated monastery cell''; in Jackson Hole ``Log cabin,
Teton backdrop''; in the Cotswolds ``One-bedroom cottage,
thatched.''
 &HT;    How easily we betray our real lives in our dreams! How heedless
of the time and energy we put into home, community and friends,
never mind love of country. Vacation fantasizing is a lot like a
midlife crisis. You want to dump your old life and marry some place
new.
 &HT;    We are not the innocent, faithful children we once were. We
don't call out a fond, ``Goodbye house, goodbye door, goodbye
steps, goodbye lawn'' as we back down the driveway. Instead, it's
``Lemme outa here'' as we make our escape, pursued by a swarm of
stress: Did I change the message on the answering machine? Do I
have my passport? Did I hold the mail, pay the bills, call off the
newspaper, program the VCR, turn down the thermostat, straighten my
sock drawer, review my will, forget the tickets, remember the
Xanax? Who wouldn't want to live somewhere else?
 &HT;    Most of the time we're pretty good at keeping fantasy in its
place. Of course we're not going to live in a garret in Paris.
We're just playing house. We've learned our lesson the hard way.
Whenever we have tried to mix fantasy with reality, the gods have
exacted their price. It can be paid in either cash or humiliation.
 &HT;    After a particularly pleasant vacation in London a few years
ago, we resisted the temptation to buy a flat and settled for
buying a London cab. At the time, cabs that had been retired from
service were sold at a garage near Elephant and Castle. Ours had
over 300,000 miles on it. It had a running board. It was full of
quaint advertisements. The seat flipped down. The meter worked. We
 &HT;    imagined what fun we'd have picking up our friends for dinner
and the movies.
 &HT;    Once home, we waited eagerly for the word from Hoboken that our
taxi had arrived. When Larry claimed it at the dock, he and three
guys with tattoos had to push it to get it started. Then the wheels
fell off. The customs inspector felt so sorry for Larry he refused
to charge him any duty.
 &HT;    On yet another occasion we trespassed the threshold between
fantasy and reality big time. It was the '70s, and we were young
and idealistic. We moved from Connecticut to Big Sur, Calif., on
the strength of a two-week stay at the Esalen Institute, where I
was convinced that I could actualize my human potential by pounding
on a pillow and hugging strangers.
 &HT;    It's not as if our friends didn't try to warn us. One of them
did his best to stop us, but we stubbornly refused to get the
point.
 &HT;    ``Haven't you ever had a fantasy about living a better life in
another place?'' I challenged him.
 &HT;    ``Of course I have. I even have a favorite fantasy. I want to
move to London and hire out as a butler in a well-appointed home.''
 &HT;    ``Well then why don't you do it?'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Because then I wouldn't have it as a fantasy any more.''
 &HT;    For an entire year I was a California mountain woman. I
earnestly eschewed brassieres in favor of black leotards. I wore
long paisley skirts that could double as tablecloths, tied at the
waist. I grew all my hair. I made my own granola. I said ``far
out.'' But no matter what I did or how hard I pounded, I was still
from the Northeast.
 &HT;    Larry, who is better than I am at making the best of a bad deal,
smoked a lot and volunteered as a model for the massage class. When
we finally got home and slipped back into reality we vowed we'd
never, ever again lose our grip on fantasy.

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Many travel companies now offer their budget-conscious and
entrepreneurial customers a way to save money on their trips _
sometimes as much as the full price of an airline ticket or the
entire cost of a tour.
 &HT;    The secret? Become a group travel leader. As the name implies,
group travel leaders earn their savings by recruiting friends,
neighbors or people they know from church groups or service clubs
to travel together.
 &HT;    Some mature travelers are so adept at organizing groups that it
becomes something of a part-time business in which they develop
various travel clubs and produce newsletters.
 &HT;    Robert Rogers of Eureka Springs, Ark., started out hoping to
earn travel credits as a ``vacation ambassador'' for Grand Circle
Travel, (800) 597-2452. GCT ambassadors earn a $100 credit for each
of the first four travelers he or she recruits in a calendar year.
Starting with the fifth traveler, credits accumulate at a rate of
$150 per person. The credits can be cashed in for any future trip
offered by GCT.
 &HT;    Rogers' first encounter with Grand Circle occurred two years ago
when he took an all-inclusive trip to the Costa Del Sol. Rogers was
so impressed with the itinerary on that particular tour that he
recommended it to some of his friends, describing it as a ``totally
relaxing'' experience. His anecdotes about the days he spent on the
Mediterranean coast were enough to convince his friends to sign up.
He then made bookings for them.
 &HT;    Rogers was so successful with his inaugural referrals that when
the list grew to 12 friends, GCT designated him a group leader _ a
notch up from vacation ambassador _ earning him a complimentary
trip.
 &HT;    Like Rogers, Bob Jones of Coldchester, Conn., was able to
stretch his travel dollar by also becoming a group leader. After
retiring in 1994 from his job as branch manager of the American
Automobile Association, Jones refused to slow down. ``I am just too
active to do nothing,'' he said. That's when he began asking
friends if they wanted to start a travel club.
 &HT;    After about 75 percent of those he asked said, ``Yes,'' Jones
started organizing cruises for a local travel agency. It wasn't
long before he branched out, coordinating groups for GCT. His first
trip for GCT was to Mexico's Copper Canyon.
 &HT;    
 THE MORE, THE MERRIER  
 &HT;    The larger groups help pay Jones' travel expenses and provide a
way for him to include extras, such as renting a motor coach for
the group to ride together to the New York airport.
 &HT;    ``But once we were in New York, I didn't have to do a thing,''
he says. ``We had our own coach and guide. He handled every
detail.''
 &HT;    Jones says that organizing a travel group can incur some costs,
depending on the amount of energy one wishes to invest in
recruiting participants. For example, Jones opted to personally
mail out brochures. He also took care of receiving each traveler's
deposit and forwarding it to GCT. But, he says, ``After that, Grand
Circle took over ... I didn't even have to count the luggage or the
people _ not once.''
 &HT;    As Jones points out, ``Anyone who is outgoing should be able to
do this.'' He has even gone so far as to hold social gatherings at
his home, where he shows a travel film describing an upcoming
destination and serves coffee and snacks. ``Then it all seems to
happen by itself,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jones has also been a group leader with other travel companies,
including Brendan Tours, Holland America and TWA.
 &HT;    Marion Lothian of Lakehurst, N.J., thinks it's her attention to
detail that makes her trips extra special. In fact, she admits that
her desire for everything to ``be just right'' is the main reason
why she chooses to serve as the intermediary for each participant.
That means getting each deposit, collecting the rest of the
payment, organizing a bus to the airport and allocating tips for
baggage handlers and guides.
 &HT;    ``I want to take care of everything so they don't have to stick
their hands in their pockets for anything,'' she says.
 &HT;    Just before each trip, Lothian briefs her travelers so they know
what to wear, how to handle the money in the country they will
visit and what to do with their passports and visas. When the trip
is concluded, Lothian does her book work and IRS paperwork.
 &HT;    Lothian has worked with Vantage Deluxe World Travel, (800)
634-2180; Collette, (888) 344-5578; and GCT. She even developed her
own travel club in her community of 3,500 and serves as club
president. This past spring she organized tours to Scandinavia and
Spain.
 &HT;    
 WITH THE PERKS COMES WORK  
 &HT;    Lothian suggests that anyone who is thinking about becoming a
group travel leader should have a nice personality as well as ``a
strong sense of right and wrong and how to handle situations while
keeping their cool.
 &HT;    ``If they don't want to do the preparation or book work, they
shouldn't get involved because it is work and responsibility,'' she
adds.
 &HT;    Many travel brochures now spell out the details of group-travel
credits or comps. For example, Vantage Deluxe World Travel provides
a free trip, double occupancy, to group leaders for each group of
10 they recruit _ even if the leader doesn't travel with the group.
 &HT;    Immersia Travel, (800) 207-5454, offers a $1,000 savings for a
``group travel planner'' who gathers five travelers for a trip. A
complimentary trip is earned when the planner gathers 10 people.
For groups of 14 or more, the planner gets both a complimentary
trip and a $100-per-person rebate.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARAH LYALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most
regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still
delightfully long, but it is also the month for the Edinburgh
International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and
theater.
 &HT;    Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as
international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm,
take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor
thoroughly spoiled for choice.
 &HT;    It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic
experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost
300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to
things such as education and health.
 &HT;    The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made
building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old
City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the
legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new
political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV
Bridge.
 &HT;    One caveat: it is normal, while visiting Edinburgh, to become
unduly obsessed with the vicissitudes of Scottish weather. It can
be cold; it can be hot; rain is generally lurking somewhere on the
horizon. The best course is to plan for the worst, but hope for the
best.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    From Aug. 13 to Sept. 2, Edinburgh will feast on the dizzyingly
eclectic smorgasbord that is the Edinburgh International Festival.
For tickets and a full list of events, call the festival office at
(44-131) 473-2000 (www.eif.co.uk) or Globaltickets at (800)
223-6108 in the United States.
 &HT;    Tickets can also be purchased at the Hub, the festival's
handsome new headquarters _ a prime spot for eating and shopping,
too _ on the Royal Mile in the Old City. Here are some highlights:
 &HT;    On Sept. 1, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra will be performing
Janacek's Sinfonietta and Mahler's ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' a
lyrical meditation on death and nature. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at
Usher Hall on Lothian Road. Tickets from $7.50 to $58.50
(calculated at $1.50 to the pound).
 &HT;    The pianist Christian Zacharias will direct and accompany the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra in a rendering of the complete cycle of
Mozart's piano concertos, over seven nights between Aug. 14 and 27
at Usher Hall. Tickets $7.50 to $46.50.
 &HT;    Another of the festival's delights is seeing a play in a foreign
language. This year's possibilities include a German ``Hamlet'' and
a Spanish play called ``One thousand five hundred meters above the
level of Jack,'' about a deep-sea diver teetering on the edge of
madness. All have English supertitles. On various dates; tickets
from $9 to $33.75.
 &HT;    The Netherlands Dance Theater _ really three companies in one,
with each made up of dancers at different points in their careers _
is presenting a program of bold, sexy dancing over five nights,
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. And on Aug. 30 and 31, dancers from NDT1,
the main company, will dance to music played by the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras conducting.
Performances are at 7:30 p.m. at various sites; tickets, $7.50 to
$55.50.
 &HT;    There also is the well-known but much less formalized Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, which features stand-up comedy, theater, skits,
dance, music and mime in halls, parks, clubs and on the streets.
Performances run Aug. 6 to 28; (44-131) 226-5138; www.edfringe.com.
Admission to some performances is free; tickets range up to $22.50.
 &HT;    From Aug. 4 to 26, Edinburgh is also celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an extravaganza of
pipes and drums and well-turned calves peeking out from beneath
kilts. It takes place at night, beside Edinburgh Castle, which adds
to the pageantry; (44-131) 225-1188, www.edintattoo.co.uk. Shows
are Monday to Friday at 9 p.m., and Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets: $12.75 to $36.75.
 &HT;    Devoted to Dadaists and Surrealists such as Ernst, Magritte and
Man Ray, the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road, is a beautifully
organized new museum in a grand, neo-Classical former orphanage in
north Edinburgh. An exhibition from Saturday through Oct. 1 will
feature Salvador Dali. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.; (44-131) 624-6200. The regular collection is
free; the Dali exhibition is $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    If the day is spectacularly sunny (it happens sometimes),
celebrate at the Royal Botanic Garden, 70 acres of beautiful
gardens and greenhouses that feature a display of herbaceous
borders during August. Tucked amid all the greenery are a cafe and
shop. The Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, (44-131) 552-7171, is open
daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in September). Free admission.
 &HT;    The former royal yacht Britannia is docked on Ocean Drive in
Leith, and you can pay $11.55 ($8.95 ages 60 and older, $5.60 ages
5 to 17) to stride its four decks in a monarchical manner. Open
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and until 7:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday; (44-131) 555-5566. Reservations are advised.
 &HT;    It cost hundreds of millions of dollars less than the Millennium
Dome in Greenwich, but Dynamic Earth, a new museum not far from the
royal Palace of Holyroodhouse, is far more successful. This
minidome offers nothing less than the story of Earth in all its
diversity.
 &HT;    Visitors can experience icebergs, volcanoes and tropical rain
forests, among other things, in 11 galleries with stunning special
effects. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer, with last entry at
4:45. Information: (44-131) 550-7800; admission is $10.40, $5.90
ages 5 to 15.
 &HT;    The Museum of Scotland, on Chambers Street, presents a whirlwind
tour of Scottish history. Attractions include an authentic
18th-century guillotine. The top floor is a crazy quilt of objects
_ from golf balls and hairdryers to a Saab convertible to the Queen
song ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' _ that ordinary Scots have identified as
essential to their very being. Open daily. Admission (which also
gets you into the Royal Museum next door) is $4.50, $2.25 for
students and those 60 and older. Free for people under 19, and on
Tuesdays after 4:30 p.m.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Rooms are scarce during the festival. For 11th-hour help, try
www.edinburgh.org, which has a listing of hotels, or (44-131)
473-3800. For rooms in private homes at festival time, call
(44-131) 225-1101.
 &HT;    Just 10 minutes by car from the center of town and easily
reachable by bus, the Malmaison stands in modern splendor in Leith,
a lively and much-revived waterfront neighborhood east of central
Edinburgh.
 &HT;    The hotel, one in an admired British chain, is decorated in cool
earth tones, with clean lines and geometric motifs. The 60 rooms
include five suites. Doubles from $165, with tax. One Tower Place,
Leith; (44-131) 468-5000, fax (44-131) 468-5002.
 &HT;    The recently refurbished Edinburgh Royal Circus Hotel, 19-21
Royal Circus, in a handsome Georgian building in central Edinburgh,
offers 30 rooms, friendly service, garden views and easy access to
major attractions. Doubles are $144, tax and breakfast included;
(44-131) 220-5000, fax (44-131) 220-2020.
 &HT;    Budget: The Ashlyn Guest House, 42 Inverleith Row near the
Botanic Garden, is one of scores of small family-run hotels that
offer all the comforts of someone else's home at reasonable prices.
Five of the eight bedrooms have private baths. No smoking. Doubles
start at $45 a person, breakfast included. Telephone and fax
(44-131) 552-2954.
 &HT;    The Borthwick Guest House, at 23 Mayfield Gardens on the city's
south side, offers 11 bedrooms, all with private baths. Doubles
from $45 per person, breakfast included; (44-131) 667-8475, fax
(44-131) 667-6763.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Bonham, 35 Drumsleugh Gardens, Edinburgh's newest
hip hotel, epitomizes the city's seemingly effortless ability to
combine the old and the new. Constructed from three adjoining town
houses, the hotel has a stately Victorian facade that belies a
thoroughly modern interior, with brash contemporary furniture and
modern art. There are 48 rooms; doubles from $247.50, with tax and
breakfast. If the Bonham is full, its owners will gladly recommend
their other two hotels, the Howard and Channings, which are cozy
and Old World; (800) 323-5463 from the United States, fax (44-131)
226-6080.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Tucked away off the Royal Mile, Dubh Prais, 123B High Street,
offers Scottish dishes lovingly prepared with traditional recipes.
Try collops in the pan, steak medallions in a
port-and-pickled-walnut sauce; for dessert, there's atholl brose
parfait, an unusually tasty ice cream made with toasted oatmeal,
honey and Drambuie. A typical dinner for two, plus wine, costs
about $90. Reservations are essential _ there are only nine tables;
(44-131) 557-5732.
 &HT;    The Tower, at the top of the Museum of Scotland on Chambers
Street, is one of Edinburgh's hottest new restaurants. Appetizers
include sauteed mushrooms with spinach, poached egg and toasted
brioche; for the main course, portions of steak and roast beef come
in three sizes: 8, 12, and 16 ounces. Dinner for two, with wine,
generally comes to about $150. A two-course pre-theater dinner for
$18 is available from 4 to 6 p.m.; (44-131) 225-3003.
 &HT;    Most of Scotland's art galleries and museums feature smart cafes
with tasty dishes. One that stands out is Cafe Newton in the Dean
Gallery, 73 Belford Road. It is open the same hours as the gallery
and offers a small selection of light entrees, like smoked salmon
with creme fraiche, and an eggplant, feta, pesto and olive sandwich
on a choice of bread. A sculpture of Isaac Newton looks down from
the center of the room. Sandwiches average $6.35; daily hot
specials range from $6.75 to $8.25; brownies and other treats cost
from $1.20 to $4.35; no alcohol served.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner of Hunter Square, not far from the bustle
of the Royal Mile, Bann's vegetarian cafe provides healthful food.
At dinner, appetizers include Thai phyllo parcels with stir-fried
vegetables on wilted bok choy, with a sweet sesame-seed oil
dressing; main courses include tarte tatin made of
 &HT;    layers of roasted sweet pepper, zucchini and cheddar cheese, and
an all-vegetable haggis _ no animal innards to speak of. Dinner for
two, with wine, costs about $60. Open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.;
(44-131) 226-1112.
 &HT;    In the last few years, George Street has overtaken the
increasingly tacky Princes Street nearby as the city's choice
shopping and eating street. One of the nicest restaurants here is
the Dome, in a vast, high-ceilinged building that used to be a
mortuary, then a bank.
 &HT;    At the outside Garden Cafe, enjoy pizza and pasta (weather
permitting) for about $24 for two, wine included; in the Grill
Room, expect to pay from $60 to $75 for two, including wine, at
dinner for dishes that include pheasant and apricot terrine with
red currant dressing. They can both be found under one dome at 14
George Street; (44-131) 624-8624.

&HT;     APPLE THINKS OUTSIDE THE CUBE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Steve Jobs has a new toy, and it looks like a
toaster.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's triumphant chief executive, addressing the faithful at
the Macworld conference in New York on Wednesday, introduced a bevy
of new products, but it was the 8-inch Power Mac G4 Cube that
captured everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The G4 Cube is basically a small computer with a crystal-clear
enclosure. It is less than one-fourth the size of most computers,
yet houses a 450 MHz PowerPC G4 processor that can make more than 1
billion calculations per second, according to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The G4 Cube is simply the coolest computer ever,'' Jobs said.
``An entirely new class of computer, it marries the
Pentium-crushing performance of the Power Mac G4 with the
miniaturization, silent operation and elegant desktop design of the
iMac. It is an amazing engineering and design feat, and we're
thrilled to finally unveil it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its other specs, the Cube includes 64 MB of memory,
expandable to 1.5 GB; 20 GB of storage, configurable up to 40 GB; a
slot-loading DVD drive; two FireWire ports; two USB ports; and a
56K V.90 modem.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with Apple's new optical mouse, which works on any
surface, and a pair of Apple designed Harman Kardon speakers.
</P>
<P>
   All for the not-so-low price of $1,799, not including a monitor.
A 500 MHz Cube will also go on sale in August priced at $2,299.
</P>
<P>
   Among other announcements, Jobs unveiled a new line of
PowerMacs, the business version of the popular iMac computer that
has revitalized Apple's once-sagging fortunes. Since its
introduction three years ago, Apple has sold 3.7 million iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to keep that momentum going, Jobs unveiled four new iMacs
in four new colors: dark blue, emerald, deep red and white. The new
price points are $799, $999, $1,299 and $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also gave an update on Apple's new operating system, called
OS X. It will be available to consumers in 2001, he said, although
he didn't get much more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's new PowerMacs are the first to run on two computer
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first personal computer in history to come with a
dual processing standard,'' Jobs told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Gore, editor in chief of Macworld magazine, was impressed
with the scope of Apple's announcements, but said the depth left a
little to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cube is the big news,'' Gore said. ``There was a lot of
fire-eating and so-forth on stage, and it was the largest number of
products ever introduced at one show. They were all interesting,
but they're not the kind of products that will change the way we
live.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Cube, Gore marveled at its engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing about the Cube is something they
didn't talk about,'' he said. ``This is the world's first totally
digital computer. There's not a single analog switch on the whole
thing. Essentially, it's the poster child for digital
convergence.''

 &HT;    Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer generate chills the classic
way: slowly, suspensefully
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What lies beneath ``What Lies Beneath'' is a script that could
have come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but
boosted by star performances and suspenseful direction, it's a
lovingly crafted throwback to haunted-house movies that relied more
on suggestion and slowly building creepiness than over-the-top
effects.
</P>
<P>
   It's what last summer's god-awful remake of ``The Haunting''
might have been if it hadn't confused computer-imagery overkill
with spooky storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneath'' could have been one of this summer's sneakier
pleasures. It still might be to anybody who hasn't seen the
trailers, in which DreamWorks gives away crucial plot points. You
could call this the anti-``Sixth Sense,'' in the ways the studio
has sabotaged the surprise factor of its own movie.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially disappointing when you watch ``Beneath.''
Clark Gregg's script kicks off with a sneaky story line that would
have been ripe for use in the commercials: In scenes that borrow
heavily from ``Rear Window,'' middle-aged wife and mother Claire
(Michelle Pfeiffer) spies on the volatile new neighbors next door,
convinced something terrible is going on there.
</P>
<P>
   This turns out to be a decoy plot. But it could have gotten
people into the theater without blowing all the twists of the main
story that follows.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford plays Norman, Claire's work-
</P>
<P>
   aholic professor husband, whose late father was himself an
academic star. Trying to move out of Dad's shadow, Norman works
late at the lab most nights, leaving Claire home alone. Only, she
starts to suspect she isn't alone at all.
</P>
<P>
   Doors open by themselves. Computers and radios switch on and
off. The old, claw-foot bathtub upstairs fills to the rim when no
one is around, and Claire sees _ or thinks she sees _ an eerie
reflection on the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Though DreamWorks has already done a bang-up job of spoiling its
own flick, let's stop here with plot details. Even if you've seen
the commercials, ``Beneath'' is still highly watchable (if about 10
minutes too long).
</P>
<P>
   The script encourages us to second-guess what's going on in the
house, and in Claire's mind. Is the place really haunted, or is
Claire responding to empty-nest syndrome (her daughter has just
gone off to college), and maybe long-delayed resentment at Norman
for the sacrifices she made when they married? Come to think of it,
is Norman really at the lab every night? And what was that car
crash Claire had a year ago all about?
</P>
<P>
   The film has more emotional subtlety and behavioral observation
than your typical screamer. In one amusing scene, Claire delays
telling a therapist (the sympathetic Joe Morton) the real reason
people want her to get her head examined. And at dinner with
another couple, director Robert Zemeckis captures the way men talk
to each other, and women do the same simultaneously, dividing the
table by gender.
</P>
<P>
   But to succeed ``Beneath'' has to build suspense, and here
Zemeckis shows a good deal of skill. Instead of speeding things up
at the film's climax, he slows things down almost to excruciating
effect, following Claire through a series of tense predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is top-billed, but it's Pfeiffer's movie, and she's very
good. The camera rarely leaves her, tracking her for minutes at a
time as she tiptoes through the house. (Some of these scenes recall
the great, nerve-racking finale of ``Diabolique''; the movie also
throws in echoes of ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Psycho'' and Ingmar
Bergman's ``Hour of the Wolf.'')
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``Beneath'' relies too much on tired old ``boo'' cliches:
Too many times somebody turns around and _ gasp _ someone else has
snuck up behind them. Or that sudden movement is merely the family
pet. But after the computer-generated tricks of ``Forrest Gump''
and ``Contact,'' you can almost feel Zemeckis savoring the
cheesiness of these devices. He knows we're onto him but that we
want him to keep goosing us.
</P>
<P>
   What's most fun about the movie isn't the movie itself, but the
audience's ``Scream''-wise reaction _ laughing nervously in advance
at an obvious setup, but yelping anyway when it plays through as
expected (or sometimes, not). There's nothing new about ``What Lies
Beneath.'' It doesn't surprise like ``The Sixth Sense'' or shake up
the genre like ``The Blair Witch Project.'' But sometimes, an
old-fashioned ghost story is good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Rated PG-13 for
terror/violence, sensuality and brief profanity. At metro theaters.
2 hours, 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A decent, old-fashioned ghost story.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Bullwinkle'' PG (brief mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Rene Russo
</P>
<P>
   and Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action and animated comedy drags the heroic squirrel
and moose into the 21st century, and into three dimensions. The
movie front-loads its clever bits, and its second half offers
diminishing returns. It keeps you awake with its throwaway sight
gags, retro tone recalling ``Austin Powers'' and its pop culture
japes. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls'' PG-13 (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Claire Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiarly old-fashioned romantic comedy trapped in college
clothing, the movie throws in one innovative switch by reversing
gender roles. Here it's the girl (Claire Forlani) who's the casual
one-night stander and the guy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who's the
near-virginal ingenue nattering on about having ``to work at love
if you want it to last.'' (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoon Noir'' Unrated (contains mature
</P>
<P>
   images and themes)
</P>
<P>
   An animation anthology.
</P>
<P>
   There's no unifying thread connecting the six animated shorts
from four countries in ``Cartoon Noir,'' except for an artful
moodiness. They also share an adult perspective that is not merely
about filling the screen with two-dimensional, Ralph Bakshi-style
nudity or gross-out humor. It's a dark and satisfying collection.
(SM) 1 hour, 21 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' R (sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike White,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weitz and Lupe Ontiveros.
</P>
<P>
   Goes from whimsical to wince-inducing early on and never
recovers. Written by and starring Mike White as an emotionally
arrested 27-year-old, the movie starts off as an off-kilter
character study. With its wry tone and candy-pop soundtrack, it's
like something by Todd Solondz (``Happiness''). Then it becomes
insufferable. (SM) 1 hour, 35 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise'' PG (thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   In Persian with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani
</P>
<P>
   and Hossein Mahjub.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a young sightless boy, it's a gorgeous meditation on
blindness, both physical and spiritual. Filled with dread and
beauty, director Majid Majidi's film summons the power of a fable,
suggesting that those with sight can be the blindest of all.
Stunningly shot by Mohammad Davudi, the film puts an emphasis on
the boy's hands stretching out into the natural world. (SM) 1 hour,
30 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen
</P>
<P>
   and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a job at a
casino running a roulette wheel to look for wrtiting inspiration.
Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme. ``Croupier'' has more
on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's a fascinating,
hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't gamble. (SM) 1
hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney,
</P>
<P>
   Della Reese and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' R (some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,
</P>
<P>
   Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Venora
</P>
<P>
   and Bill Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In its bare outline, a modern-day, Manhattan-based version of
Shakespeare's tragedy sounds like the bad thesis project of a New
York University film student. True enough, Michael Almereyda's
update flirts with the ludicrous in every reel. But it's ultimately
a compelling and streamlined vision that lives surprisingly well in
the city's hard-edged, chilly streets and penthouses. (SM) 1 hour,
51 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanite'' Unrated (there is implied
</P>
<P>
   violence and explicit sex and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emmanuel Schotte
</P>
<P>
   and Severine Caneele. Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   A multiple prizewinner at Cannes last year, Bruno Dumont's
relentless and demanding film may be the most melancholy movie
you'll see all year. Ostensibly, it's about a sad-sack cop
(Emmanuel Schotte) investigating the rape-murder of a young girl in
a small French village. It's a maddening near-masterwork, the sort
of thing Beckett might've written on a moody day. (ERG) 2 hours, 28
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' R (profanity, sexual and
</P>
<P>
   drug content, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup
</P>
<P>
   and Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book of Denis Johnson's vivid short stories that it's
based on, the movie mirrors its protagonist's sense of dislocation
as it woozily tours a few years in the life of a boozing,
pill-popping young man (Billy Crudup). The film is like
``Trainspotting'' or ``Drugstore Cowboy'' played out on the
suicidally prosaic Midwest plains. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Loser'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs
</P>
<P>
   and Mena Suvari.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a bore. Jason Biggs is Paul, a scholarship student
fresh from a small Midwestern town who arrives in New York City
with full-blown naivete. He meets Dora (Mena Suvari), a bright,
Gothic-styled American beauty who's sleeping with the college's
uppity, self-absorbed English lit professor (Greg Kinnear). Paul
and Dora getting together is no surprise, but it takes an eternity
to happen. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Those impish filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
prove yet again that, no matter how foul and nasty their humor,
they understand very clearly how to set up the joke and when to
fire the over-the-top punch. This movie, starring Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger, is bound to make you laugh. Too bad it's clueless
when it comes to constructing a plot with which to thread the
powerful jokes. (Bob Longino) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
Ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing the Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM) 2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich takes
the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it to a
feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye and
crafted with great care. It relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him. (SM) 2 hours, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13 (profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so does
the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen.
Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates the
collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and the
battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) at sea, trying to survive the monstrous
sea. (SM) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B+

   ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film featuring the

   and Unsho Ishizuka.

<P>
   The new Pokemon movie is a lot better than last year's first
flick. And slightly better than a poke in the eye. ``Pokemon the
Movie 2000'' has more accomplished animation, more drama and a
decent-enough sprinkling of jokes, all adding up to something
barely watchable. Still, it's mostly cheaply made, barely
interesting and focused on niche marketing. (Bob Longino) 1 hour,
24 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' R (strong crude sexual humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drug use and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anna Faris,
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen (writer/director),
Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor) _ ``Scary Movie'' is
a parody of teen horror flicks. The ``Scream'' trilogy, ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and, just
because it was popular, ``The Matrix,'' all get skewered in a
thousand jokes that are either hilarious, funny, not funny or
simply crude. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson,
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning theme song,
the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one bad
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a trumped-up
trifle involving both a suspected racist killer (Christian Bale)
and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the movie clicks
because of the performances. Wright steals the picture, directed by
John Singleton. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine'' R (nudity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Though overlong (three hours) and not a very smiley-face story
(the title is ironic), this bleak, sweeping epic is still worth
your time and effort. Oscar-winning director Istvan Szabo
(``Mephisto'') examines the first half of the 20th century through
the painful prism of three generations of a Jewish family in
Hungary. Ralph Fiennes plays the central male in each passage along
with a fine supporting cast. (ERG) 3 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie'' R (some profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Nick Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see many movies these days that slow down to let their
characters just talk. At least, not movies without subtitles. The
characters in ``Trixie,'' with Emily Watson as an eccentric,
gum-chewing would-be detective, spend a lot of time talking. The
problem is, they open their mouths and out comes garbage. (SM) 1
hour, 57 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer
</P>
<P>
   and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What lies beneath ``What Lies Beneath'' is a script that could
have come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but
boosted by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford and suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback
to haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than over-the-top effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman,
</P>
<P>
   Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best movie to
work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly entertaining
``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his collaborators
treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and respect (unlike
other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn'' and ``Blade'').
It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's littered with
duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

 &HT;    `Chuck &AMP; Buck' stalks laughs, but trips up in an insufferable
tale
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' goes from whimsical to wince-inducing early on
and never recovers. Written by and starring Mike White as an
emotionally arrested 27-year-old, the movie starts off as an
off-kilter character study. With its wry tone and candy-pop
soundtrack, it's like something by Todd Solondz (``Happiness'').
Then it becomes insufferable.
</P>
<P>
   In this would-be comedy of discomfort, White plays Buck, still
living at home with his mother, his bedroom cluttered with toys.
When Mom dies, Buck's best childhood pal, Chuck, flies in from the
West Coast for the funeral. Only now he goes by Charlie (played by
the handsome but wooden Chris Weitz), he works as a music industry
executive and he's engaged to Carlyn (Beth Colt).
</P>
<P>
   Buck barely seems to notice these changes, or chooses to ignore
them. He invites the couple to spend the night. When they decline,
he withdraws some of his inheritance from the bank, packs his toys
into the Mercedes station wagon and moves to Los Angeles to stalk
his old pal.
</P>
<P>
   He stakes out Charlie's office building, hoping for a glimpse of
him. He calls at all hours. He swings by unannounced at the home
Charlie and Carlyn share.
</P>
<P>
   As Buck becomes more intrusive, Carlyn offers to give him her
therapist's number. You can't help thinking she'd be wiser dialing
the police and getting a restraining order. It's a little hard to
understand writer-actor White's fascination with this character.
He's the childishly creepy kind of guy whose cellar you
instinctively don't want to visit, more serial-killer-in-training
than unlikely romantic hero.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's voice of reason belongs to Beverly (the
scene-stealing Lupe Ontiveros), a community theater manager who
takes Buck under her wing, agreeing to direct the naive play he's
written about his friendship with Chuck. Reading the script,
Beverly says, ``I think you have something weird about women. I
think you have something weird about men.'' Yep.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't figured out the cause of Buck's attraction to
Charlie and don't want to know, stop reading here. Watching the
movie, it becomes obvious pretty early that Buck's motivation is
sexual; he's fixated on the experimental sex games he and Chuck
played together as kids. In its blithely oblivious way, the movie
winds up equating homosexuality with emotional immaturity. Here's a
movie Dr. Laura would like.
</P>
<P>
   As Beverly puts it, describing Buck's play, ``It's like a
homoerotic misogynist love story.'' That sums up the movie pretty
well, too. But it winds up with an implausible ending that
simultaneously feels both too pat and unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buzzed-about movies at this year's Sundance Film
Festival, ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' has its fans and defenders. But to me, a
stalker just isn't funny, even if he acts harmless and sucks on
Tootsie Pops all the time. Actually, that makes him even scarier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck &AMP; Buck''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike White, Chris Weitz and Lupe Ontiveros. Rated R for
sexuality and profanity. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A would-be comedy about an emotionally immature
stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Murrits for hours doing nothing. ``Club'' has a creepiness
that plays like a Kafka story told in the stop-motion animation
style of Jan Svankmajer (``Alice'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoon Noir'' begins with Pedro Serrazina's lovely ``The
Story of the Cat and the Moon'' (Portugal, five minutes), the
simply illustrated, black-and-white tale of a feline who lives on
rooftops to be close to his changeable lover.
</P>
<P>
   The second-shortest entry, Julie Zammarchi's ``Ape'' (USA, six
minutes) is an energetic, quasi-sick joke about a husband and wife
who bicker over their nightly meal, a freshly killed and cooked
simian. Piotr Dumala's ``Gentle Spirit'' (Poland, 10 minutes) is a
visually impressive, gloomy meditation about another troubled
couple. They're portrayed in shadowed tableaux, the images infused
with a hallucinatory, macabre style like a visual equivalent of
Edgar Allan Poe.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vester's ``Abductees'' (United Kingdom, 12 minutes) is a
fascinating blend of myriad types of animation and film clips,
accompanying the recorded testimony of people who claim to have
been abducted by aliens, describing their experience. The short
manages to fluctuate from comic to creepy all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoon Noir'' ends with Suzan Pitt's truly unpredictable
``Joy Street'' (USA, 24 minutes). An anxious woman waiting for some
unknown thing or person in her apartment sinks deeper toward
despair, until she is rescued by an ashtray ornament, a sort of
mouse-monkey figure, come to life. The exuberance (and occasional
eeriness) of the animation complements a story line that's as
inventive as it is inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoon Noir''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   An animation anthology. Unrated but contains mature images and
themes. 1 hour, 21 minutes. Through Thursday. $3, $5 after 6 p.m.
Cinefest (Georgia State University).
</P>
<P>
   404-651-2463.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A dark, moody and satisfying collection.

 &HT;    Sharing, caring the Pokemon way
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Pokemon movie is a lot better than last year's first
flick. And slightly better than a poke in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon the Movie 2000: The Power of One'' has more
accomplished animation, more drama and a decent enough sprinkling
of jokes, all adding up to something barely watchable. Kids who
loved the first film _ ``Pokemon: The First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes
Back'' _ will love this one even more.
</P>
<P>
   Bring lots of cash.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a ton of dough to be a fan of Pokemon. There are those
character cards to buy, videos to purchase (22 in fact; the latest
being ``Hang Ten Pikachu'') and Nintendo games to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   So it's nice that the Japanese, inventors of this animated
franchise of lovable and ornery mini-monsters kept in little balls
in kids' pockets, appear to have taken some of the $155.7 million
the first film earned worldwide and put it into making a better
second movie.

 &HT;    Quirky folks need to be silenced in `Trixie'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't see many movies these days that slow down to let their
characters just talk. At least, not movies without subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Trixie'' spend a lot of time talking. The
problem is, they open their mouths and out comes garbage. You wish
they'd just shut up. Or, as somebody in the movie might say, ``Zip
your lid on it and shut your pie plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine actress Emily Watson plays the title role. Though she's
personified a slow-witted sex kitten (``Breaking the Waves''), an
unhinged musician (``Hilary and Jackie'') and a suffering Irish mum
(``Angela's Ashes''), she has her biggest challenge here. That's
because it's not a character she's playing, it's a quirk.
</P>
<P>
   Trixie is an eccentric, gum-chewing would-be detective who takes
an undercover job as a casino security guard, looking for
pickpockets but hoping to stumble on a real criminal case. Produced
by Robert Altman and set in the laid-back lushness of Vancouver,
``Trixie'' primes us for an oddball spin on the detective genre,
something like Altman's own revisionist version of Raymond
Chandler's ``The Long Goodbye.'' So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Trixie speaks.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Alan Rudolph (``Afterglow'') fills her mouth
with malapropisms that are meant to be adorable. When Trixie gets a
hunch, she says she's relying on her ``institution.'' She tells a
new friend, ``You can't just sit there like a sore thumb.'' And
when a character says, ``C'est la vie,'' Trixie replies, ``Lah
vee.''
</P>
<P>
   There are -- lot more where those came from. Trixie never
becomes a believable character, because she's stuck being the
literal mouthpiece of useless wordplay. It's like somebody at a
cocktail party telling the same bad joke over and over, thinking it
will be funny the 30th or 40th time.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. Rudolph surrounds Watson with quirky folk who
become infected by her speech. Nathan Lane plays a casino lounge
singer who, between celebrity impressions, tells her, ``We're all
tap dancers in the canoe of life.'' Nick Nolte turns up as a
crooked senator who rambles on in impenetrable doublespeak. His
bogs of dialogue are reportedly culled from transcripts of real
smoke-blowing politicos, but knowing the in-joke doesn't make his
scenes endurable.
</P>
<P>
   The ramshackle central mystery concerns a scheming developer
(Will Patton), Nolte, a curvy, aging-girly chanteuse (Lesley Ann
Warren, still vamping after all these years) and the sleazy-sexy
womanizer (Dermot Mulroney) who tries to seduce Trixie. When a
murder occurs, ol' Trix takes the case.
</P>
<P>
   Watson works overtime trying to turn the role's tics into a
three-dimensional portrait, and she succeeds in investing the role
with a mix of pluck and lonely vulnerability. Rudolph stages a
raucous restaurant scene between Nolte and a too-obliging would-be
starlet (Brittany Murphy), and there's a gunfight sequence that has
both the shock and comic clumsiness of something that could happen
in reality. But the grace notes aren't enough to salva quips,
``Nobody's human.'' Well, not in this movie, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson and Nick Nolte. Rated R for some
profanity, sexuality and violence. 1 hour, 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>

`THE DEAD' COMES ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Practically all of the news about ``James Joyce's The Dead'' is
good, and that is surely a relief.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the notices out of New York have been glowing, but it's
nevertheless impossible to approach this audaciously conceived
production _ the nerve, after all, of turning the greatest short
story in the English language into a Broadway musical _ without the
bias that it had better prove its worthiness every stomping Irish
step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there is a stumble or two, primarily in the
misplacement of a few key story elements, the musical achieves such
lyrical warmth and touching sentiment that even the most
indoctrinated Joyceans will have to admit sheer enjoyment can be a
fine substitute for literary rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the stage ``Dead'' is even on the same dimensional
Emerald Isle as something like ``Riverdance.'' To be blunt, it
radiates authenticity. Director Richard Nelson's musical is
scrupulously faithful to the story's concerns with universality and
isolation, constancy and change, camaraderie and the impossibility
of truly knowing the most loved of intimates.
</P>
<P>
   The songs, which were composed by Shaun Davey with lyrics by him
and Nelson, share a common delicate beauty though each is inspired
by a wide range of distinct influences, from regional airs to grand
opera, lullabies, music hall romps, Joyce's own prose and, in the
case of the defiantly energetic showstopper ``Wake the Dead,''
Celtic rhythms primordial enough to scare any Lord of the Dance
right out of his sequins.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the show's greatest triumph is the way it brings the
story's take on melancholy tinged Irish hospitality to glowing
life. For the longest time, we feel like honored guests at the
music-loving Morkan ladies' annual Christmastime party, somewhere
around 100 years ago. On a simple, utile stage that converts
effortlessly from Edwardian parlor to dining, bed and hotel rooms,
the elderly sisters Julia (Sally Ann Howe, who pivots from losing
to grasping at life with exquisite timing) and Kate (Marni Nixon,
who sang for Audrey Hepburn in the ``My Fair Lady'' movie) and
their niece Mary Jane (Donna Lynne Champlin) host a cheerful
evening of singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's staging enhances the participatory illusion by
literally having his players turn their backs on the audience and
sing to their fellow actors. And a cordial lot they are: lovable
lush Freddy Malins (the remarkably elastic Stephen Spinella) and
his disapproving old mum (Patricia Kilgarriff); provocative,
patriotic young Molly Ivers (Alice Ripley); the teasingly reluctant
tenor Bartell D'Arcy (John Kelly), who when he finally gives full
voice reveals what it takes to make angels cry; and others, all
well met.
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly, there's that happily complacent couple,
Gabriel and Gretta Conroy. He is played by Stephen Bogardus, she by
Faith Prince, both delightful singers and actors of arresting
presence. Bogardus serves as an occasional narrator as well as
Gabriel, which is fine since his inner life is ``The Dead's''
beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   But lost in the translation from story to stage is the
foreshadowing of Gabriel's self-doubt, and this noticeably takes
away from the devastating impact when he realizes that the party in
his head is as irretrievably over as the one recently concluded at
his aunts'.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an epiphany as sad and transcendent as Gabriel's can
only have its greatest effect in literature, where readers can
invest the words with the imaginative weight of their
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   However, what cannot be done in print that ``James Joyce's The
Dead'' does magnificently is transport us to a place where shared
song expresses all that needs to be considered for those gossamer
moments until the music ends. &QL;

 &HT;    Comptrollers play politics with budget
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Wait. You actually think the Texas comptroller _
a partisan elected official _ would trot out revenue statistics
with an eye to politics? Next you'll say Santa Claus is my mom and
dad.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not to suggest the recent revenue estimate by Republican
Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander isn't accurate. But suffice it
to say that Rylander and her Democratic predecessors know how to
use the revenue estimate as a political tool.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop:
</P>
<P>
   Legislative budget officials recently estimated that the cost to
run Texas government for the two years ending Aug. 31, 2001, will
be $610 million more than the Legislature budgeted last year.
</P>
<P>
   The political problem is that Gov. George W. Bush, who is the
GOP nominee for president, pressed for and got a $1.7 billion tax
cut last year when the Legislature was writing the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore, says this is
proof that Bush's plans to have a huge national tax cut if elected
could spend away a projected surplus that might then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   So up steps Republican Rylander, with an early estimate of a
minimum of a $1.1 billion budget surplus for the biennium. That's
more than enough to cover the $610 million projected budget
overrun.
</P>
<P>
   With a straight face, Rylander said the unscheduled revenue
estimate wasn't to help Bush's presidential hopes, but because she
was nervous Gore's ``misleading and incorrect'' charge that Texas
had a budget shortfall could hurt the state's financial standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the state of Texas to have the best possible bond
ratings, therefore the lowest interest rates, and therefore saving
Texans millions of dollars,'' Rylander said. ``There is no deficit
in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   That $1.1 billion is a ``conservative'' estimate, Rylander said.
Numbers were being crunched for a more specific figure she unveiled
at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So, is it politics? Or is it economics? Or both?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it gives Rylander a chance to help the governor's
presidential race. Also obviously, it gives Rylander _ who some
think has ambitions beyond the comptroller's office _ opportunities
to get her name in the paper and her face on television.
</P>
<P>
   But this ain't strange. The comptroller's using the
revenue-estimating power as a tool for a variety of purposes is
about as regular as the moon influencing the tides.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, almost to the day, then-Comptroller John Sharp _
a Democrat who was running for lieutenant governor _ disclosed in
an early revenue estimate a projected surplus of $3.7 billion for
the current biennium. Coincidentally, Sharp also dropped a few
hints on how the surplus might be spent, including a teacher pay
raise and a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller was given the power to estimate the state's
projected revenue to keep the Legislature from overspending. Under
the state's balanced-budget approach, the Legislature's budget in
its regular legislative session is limited to what the comptroller
estimates will come in.
</P>
<P>
   Comptrollers usually are conservative at the start of the
budgeting cycle _ partly because if they have to change the
estimate later, they'd rather raise it than lower it. But certainly
the past three comptrollers _ Rylander, Sharp and the late Democrat
Bob Bullock _ also kept back a little swag for bargaining leverage
late in the legislative session. And for a chance to be Santa
Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always held back about $400 million,'' said a former
Bullock aide, for ``trade bait'' for computers, extra auditors,
even airplanes. Interestingly, when the comptroller's projected
budget went up, so did the revenue estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's last revenue estimate, which totaled $6.3 billion
surplus when the surplus for the next biennium was included in the
count, actually low-balled by about $300 million to leave successor
Rylander a little leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough, she quickly decided, and dropped the estimate by
$700 million shortly after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of May, the last month of the legislative session,
steely eyed House Public Education Committee Chairman Paul Sadler,
D-Henderson, said he'd wait for Rylander's revenue estimate before
finalizing the amounts of a teacher pay raise and a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander, who'd said she needed more time, finally caved in and,
with fanfare, put the $700 million back _ plus a little.
</P>
<P>
   Politics? Naah. Santa Claus? You decide.

 &HT;    Collegiate `Loser' barely makes the grade
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Loser'' had all the makings of being a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Amy Heckerling had already strutted her comedic
stuff with the high school spoofs ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High''
and ``Clueless.'' Her latest, a college relationship comedy, stars
Jason Biggs (fresh off last year's boisterous high school sexual
romp ``American Pie''), Mena Suvari (part of the ``Pie'' ensemble
who scored big as Kevin Spacey's object of desire in the
Oscar-winning ``American Beauty'') and Greg Kinnear (an Oscar
nominee for ``As Good as It Gets'').
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that going for it, ``Loser'' turns out to be a
fairly apt title.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a bore.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs plays Paul, a full-scholarship student fresh from a small
Midwestern town who arrives in New York with full-blown naivete.
Stumbling about campus (there are plenty of pratfalls to secure
this guy's place as a hapless outsider), he meets Dora (Suvari), a
bright, Gothic-style American beauty who's doing one stupid thing:
She's sleeping with the college's uppity, self-absorbed English lit
professor (Kinnear).
</P>
<P>
   Will Paul and Dora ever get together? Sure, but it'll sometimes
feel like an eternity getting there.
</P>
<P>
   First, Paul's got to be mistreated by his roommates, a trio of
slobs whose main activity is drugging the drinks of unsuspecting
females. And Dora's got to have her self-esteem shredded to bits by
the professor.
</P>
<P>
   These two are indeed clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Heckerling's film has enough decent jokes and subtlety. As
Paul's dad, Dan Aykroyd delivers in deadpan manner advice to make
it in the big, big world: ``Interested is interesting.'' And Paul's
throwaway clothes to wear when he's run out of clean things
includes a Sarah McLachlan T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the film's cuteness lingers way too long. When a
little kitty is saved, for instance, Suvari is allowed to purr
``aw'' to the point of viewer frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Biggs nor Suvari kick this thing into gear like Sean
Penn did ``Fast Times'' and Alicia Silverstone did ``Clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors don't get much help from Heckerling, either. She's
too busy throwing in musical interludes, showing her actors
shoppnding Biggs i a park (to Simon and Garfunkel's ``Scarborough
Fair,'' no less).
</P>
<P>
   No way is this ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Loser''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari. Directed by Amy
Heckerling. Rated PG-13 for sexual relationships, drug use and some
profanity. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's a bust.
</P>

`THE DEAD' COMES ALIVE

Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Practically all of the news about ``James Joyce's The Dead'' is
good, and that is surely a relief.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the notices out of New York have been glowing, but it's
nevertheless impossible to approach this audaciously conceived
production _ the nerve, after all, of turning the greatest short
story in the English language into a Broadway musical _ without the
bias that it had better prove its worthiness every stomping Irish
step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there is a stumble or two, primarily in the
misplacement of a few key story elements, the musical achieves such
lyrical warmth and touching sentiment that even the most
indoctrinated Joyceans will have to admit sheer enjoyment can be a
fine substitute for literary rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the stage ``Dead'' is even on the same dimensional
Emerald Isle as something like ``Riverdance.'' To be blunt, it
radiates authenticity. Director Richard Nelson's musical is
scrupulously faithful to the story's concerns with universality and
isolation, constancy and change, camaraderie and the impossibility
of truly knowing the most loved of intimates.
</P>
<P>
   The songs, which were composed by Shaun Davey with lyrics by him
and Nelson, share a common delicate beauty though each is inspired
by a wide range of distinct influences, from regional airs to grand
opera, lullabies, music hall romps, Joyce's own prose and, in the
case of the defiantly energetic showstopper ``Wake the Dead,''
Celtic rhythms primordial enough to scare any Lord of the Dance
right out of his sequins.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the show's greatest triumph is the way it brings the
story's take on melancholy tinged Irish hospitality to glowing
life. For the longest time, we feel like honored guests at the
music-loving Morkan ladies' annual Christmastime party, somewhere
around 100 years ago. On a simple, utile stage that converts
effortlessly from Edwardian parlor to dining, bed and hotel rooms,
the elderly sisters Julia (Sally Ann Howe, who pivots from losing
to grasping at life with exquisite timing) and Kate (Marni Nixon,
who sang for Audrey Hepburn in the ``My Fair Lady'' movie) and
their niece Mary Jane (Donna Lynne Champlin) host a cheerful
evening of singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's staging enhances the participatory illusion by
literally having his players turn their backs on the audience and
sing to their fellow actors. And a cordial lot they are: lovable
lush Freddy Malins (the remarkably elastic Stephen Spinella) and
his disapproving old mum (Patricia Kilgarriff); provocative,
patriotic young Molly Ivers (Alice Ripley); the teasingly reluctant
tenor Bartell D'Arcy (John Kelly), who when he finally gives full
voice reveals what it takes to make angels cry; and others, all
well met.
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly, there's that happily complacent couple,
Gabriel and Gretta Conroy. He is played by Stephen Bogardus, she by
Faith Prince, both delightful singers and actors of arresting
presence. Bogardus serves as an occasional narrator as well as
Gabriel, which is fine since his inner life is ``The Dead's''
beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   But lost in the translation from story to stage is the
foreshadowing of Gabriel's self-doubt, and this noticeably takes
away from the devastating impact when he realizes that the party in
his head is as irretrievably over as the one recently concluded at
his aunts'.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an epiphany as sad and transcendent as Gabriel's can
only have its greatest effect in literature, where readers can
invest the words with the imaginative weight of their
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   However, what cannot be done in print that ``James Joyce's The
Dead'' does magnificently is transport us to a place where shared
song expresses all that needs to be considered for those gossamer
moments until the music ends. &QL;

 &HT;    Roadside advisories that once entertained now go splat
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMEWHERE IN THE WEST _ ``But it was a blue spruce.''
</P>
<P>
   This was my wife, pining to no one in particular. I was
listening but my ear was of no comfort to her.
</P>
<P>
   We'd just driven by a gorgeous stand of mountain evergreens. Her
entreaty to the back-seat boys to observe it in wonder had met
towering indifference.
</P>
<P>
   As had ``look _ Pike's Peak.'' As had ``look at Denver's
skyline.'' If the advisories were met with looks at all, that was a
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout our trip, only rare appeals succeeded in drawing
attention: ``Look, a volcanic cone'' (our middle-schooler looked,
apparently thinking he'd see lava spewing); ``Look, Britney
Spears.'' (He didn't appreciate being tricked.)
</P>
<P>
   Ah, for the days when Mom and Dad were merry tour guides and two
young passengers clung to our every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cow on Daddy's side,'' would evoke a robust confirmation, and
echo, from an attentive 8-year-old and 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil wells on Mommy's side,'' we'd say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil wells on Mommy's side,'' they'd say. ``Choo-choo on
Daddy's side,'' we'd say, followed by the back-seat repeat.
</P>
<P>
   They were seasoned travelers from the start, and robust. The
oldest, for instance, was known to joyously count the white dashes
rocketing under our wheels. Now, that's a dedicated and attentive
traveler. And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil well on Daddy's side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, yes, we've seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Choo-choo train on Mommy's side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. That would be a vehicle to transport goods, commonly on a
track parallel to many highways.''
</P>
<P>
   KNOW-IT-ALLS IN GEOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when multiple oil wells spotted up ahead could
be embellished into a herd of two-legged cooties on the high
plains. Now for passengers ages 17 and almost 13, oil wells are
just _ things that pump oil.
</P>
<P>
   This matter-of-factness was most frustrating a year ago when we
went on a long trip through Big Bend and the stunning canyonlands
of Arizona and Utah. Repeatedly, seeking to elicit ``oohs'' and
``ahhs,'' I was rebuffed. Indeed, I was mocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look over there,'' I'd say to the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, Dad? Have you spotted another `precipitous geologic
formation'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look over there,'' I'd say a few miles down the road at
another red-rock wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, that's `precipitous,' `` someone in braces would crack.
</P>
<P>
   THRILL IS GONE?
</P>
<P>
   I know the boys will look back fondly at these rides on endless
highway, the sights and family exchanges. Right now it appears all
they appreciate is the next convenience store, where one will shop
for a magazine to help blot out any vistas down the road and the
other will seek to numb his mind with mood-altering bubble gum.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll get back in the car and ignore everything we say.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until they have kids of their own. Wait until a cow
wallowing in mud and horseflies along the road becomes a slow-down
family event. And it will, for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, their parents can only plead to acts of reflex when
announcing, ``Cows on Dad's side,'' knowing full well the
announcement likely will be ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   After being ignored at several scenic junctures trying to stir
up interest one day on the road, my wife spotted a herd of exotic
animals that would have caused a stir on vacations past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Llamas on mommy's side, if anyone gives a flip.''
</P>
<P>
   To which from the back came, ``That would be possible only if we
had a flip to give.''

   PROVIDENCE-REVIVAL (Providence, R.I.) _ It was only a few years
ago that Providence regained its rivers by rescuing the Providence
River from under generations of road decking and relocating its
confluence with the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket that flow into
it at a strategic juncture near a new inner harbor at the cove
called Waterplace Park. So now, in place of polluted waters and a
dead ``downcity,'' as the business district is called, Providence
has become more like those vibrant European cities with rivers
running through them and picturesque bridges joining the two banks.

&HT;     49ERS' NORTON SAYS HIS TEAM DOESN'T INTIMIDATE FOES LIKE THE
OLD DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Ken Norton Jr. is quick to put a handle on
this year's 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bitter team,'' he said, referring to ``the
embarrassment'' of last year's 4-12 record and the preseason
predictions the team could do even worse this year. ``We're not
accepting all the talk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norton was speaking Wednesday after the first full-squad
practice at training camp at the University of Pacific. He is in
his 14th camp, and this one really is different.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he's been with the 49ers, the defense
will undergo more than just a tune-up. There will be changes
throughout the lineup _ moves that will probably involve a number
of rookies. The defense, after being ranked worst in the league
last year, is one of the biggest issues in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's a matter of truly coaching, truly learning and coming
together as a team,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Norton has always been a vocal leader on defense. This year
he'll be doing even more on the field. He is moving to the ``Mike``
linebacker spot, a position where he'll be expected to do more in
the way of disrupting blockers and be in line to make more tackles
_ even though he's led his team in tackles eight years in a row.
Winfred Tubbs will move to Norton's old ``plugger'' position, where
he'll line up behind one of the inside defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The move will put Norton closer to rookie Julian Peterson, the
49ers' unsigned first-round pick expected to start at Lee Woodall's
old spot on the outside. Norton will serve as an on-field coach for
the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be more of an influence to the entire team,'' he
said of his new spot. ``Now it's a matter of understanding both
sides of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the heralded Peterson, Norton said, ``Obviously we wanted
a guy in there who didn't have a drop-off (from Woodall).''
</P>
<P>
   He also is anxious for Peterson to get in camp. ``I'm hoping
they really take care of business with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson should be joined by other inexperienced players in the
secondary, and at times along the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real challenge to help these young guys,'' Norton said.
``It's not very often you have a chance to come to a pro team and
play so early.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled his own rookie season with the Dallas Cowboys. ``I
was lucky enough to come to a veteran team and learn the ways of
the game,'' he said. ``I'm not going to mention any names because
it will show my age.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton is 33 and one of the few remaining veterans on the 49ers.
He says he doesn't dwell on his own longevity, even though more and
more of his old teammates are gone. ``I really don't think about
that much,'' he said. ``I enjoy playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That enjoyment is apparent. Norton is perhaps the most
demonstrative player on the team. That won't change even though
he's taking on the role of elder.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, my outlook doesn't change,'' he said. ``I'm going to
be as vocal as I've always been. It always comes naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton was jovial after practice until someone asked how it felt
going into a camp when the 49ers were not going to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never come to training camp without that expectation,`` he
said, putting a face on his image of the 49ers as a bitter team.
``I still have that expectation. . . . That's why they play the
game in this league. No one knows. It doesn't look good, but . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton did acknowledge that it will be a tough season, noting
that the 49ers would no longer be winning many games by
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately enough, for the son of a former heavyweight boxing
champion, he compared the old 49ers to the old Mike Tyson _ both,
he noted, often won by intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you win before you fight the game,'' he said. ``It's
not like that anymore.''

&HT;     MORMONS DROP CASE AGAINST GAY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CAROL NESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Mormon Church had dropped its plan to
discipline a gay San Francisco man who sought to resign his
membership.
</P>
<P>
   A disciplinary hearing scheduled for Sunday has been canceled,
and Owen Edwards' request to have his name stricken from church
rolls has been granted, according to Jay Pimentel, an Alameda-based
spokesman for the Church of Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a done deal. There will be no hearings or proceedings or
discipline of any sort,'' Pimentel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a 28-year-old masseur and beauty school student who was
born into the church, said, ``I got what I wanted. It's over, it's
done, we won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Utah native, who moved to San Francisco three years ago, has
not attended church since he was a teen-ager. But he did not take
steps to quit until he was angered by the church's support for
Proposition 22, the California ballot initiative outlawing gay
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Edwards sent a letter to his bishop asking that his
name be taken off the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   More than four months later, on July 8, he received a letter
from Mormon Bishop Bryan Earl of San Francisco. Edwards was told
that his request had triggered a July 23 ``bishop's court''
disciplinary hearing, with excommunication a possible result.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was one of many Mormons, not all of them homosexual, who
have run into problems trying to leave the church. Three gay
members in Utah were excommunicated after they sought to quit, and
lost contact with friends and family as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Pimentel said the decision to cancel any discipline had come
after the local bishop consulted with higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The church's decision appears to foil hopes by former Mormons
here and in Utah that Edwards' case would lead to a lawsuit against
the Mormon Church over the tactics they say it employs when members
seek to resign.

 &HT;    Tourism's prosperity a memory among Kashmiris
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the time of year when Kashmir should be teeming with
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, they flocked to the lush Himalayan valley of apple
orchards and majestic poplar trees and skied the snow-tipped peaks
surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   Indians came here to escape much of the subcontinent's stifling
summer heat; foreigners traveled for miles to marvel at the beauty
of land and history. They stayed in hotels lining The Boulevard,
Srinagar's wide avenue circling the legendary Dal Lake, or in the
thousands of intricately carved wooden houseboats bearing such
names as Young Monalisa, Blue Moon or Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But paradise in Kashmir has since been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kashmir was India's No. 1 tourist spot until 1989, when urban
terrorism started rearing its ugly head,'' said Ronjon Lahiri,
assistant director for the Government of India Tourist Office in
New York. ``Suddenly, Kashmir was wiped off the map. Just like
that, it was devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   South Asia's top tourist destination is now one of its most
violent battlegrounds: The 11-year-old Islamic insurgency in
India's northernmost state, known as Jammu and Kashmir, has left
50,000 dead. The militants say they are fighting for ``azadi,'' or
freedom, from predominantly Hindu India, under whose thumb they
feel persecuted. Some even want to become a part of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In response, India has deployed massive numbers of troops in
Kashmir to protect territory it has fought to keep in three armed
conflicts with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   There are few Kashmiris who have not felt the economic impact of
the war on a region dependent on tourist money _ almost 20 percent
of the state's gross domestic product originates in tourism. So for
the staffs at the 366 hotels and guesthouses, the owners of 1,089
houseboats, the agents at 147 travel outlets and the operators of
2,350 shikaras (boat-taxis) as well as the countless handicraft
artisans and pashmina shawl weavers, the decline in tourism has
been difficult to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business used to be so good that even in the middle of winter,
when it is so cold here, we had tourists in our houseboats,'' said
Mohammad Shera, whose family has owned a Dal Lake houseboat for
generations. ``Now it is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Shera spends his days waiting with other houseboat owners at the
owners' union in central Srinagar, opposite the Tourist Reception
Center, hoping to lure a visitor or two.
</P>
<P>
   Mazoor Mahmood Ghasi is in the same predicament. Out of
desperation, the 32-year-old college graduate abandoned the family
houseboat business when there was no food left in his kitchen. His
father-in-law sold his houseboat and Ghasi purchased instead an
auto-rickshaw, an open three-wheeled vehicle that is a common and
cheap mode of transport in Srinagar, as it is in most Indian
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to wear good clothes. We had clean faces,'' Ghasi
said. ``Now look at us. We look like beggars on the street. Our
families are starving. I have studied economics in college and now
I am driving an auto.''
</P>
<P>
   For people like Ghasi and Shera, there was a glimmer of hope
last year after a government-sponsored campaign to revive tourism
attracted a decent number of visitors. But their hopes were quickly
dashed when a two-month conflict between India and Pakistan broke
out in May atop the peaks in Kargil. An airline hijacking last
December involving Kashmiri separatists caused a further scare.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the start of this year's tourist season _ which
typically runs from April to October _ the government tried once
again to jump-start things by offering 30 percent discounts on
travel and lodging and by launching several marketing campaigns.
Optimistic state tourism officials said they hoped to attract
270,000 tourists to Kashmir this year. That is far less than half
of the record 700,000 tourists who set foot in Kashmir in 1988, the
year before the insurgency began.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, the violence appears to be surging again as a
variety of factors continues to diminish prospects for a peaceful
compromise to ``the Kashmir problem.'' Among them is the Indian
government's rejection of the Kashmiri legislature's request for
political autonomy and a reported increase in deaths of Kashmiris
detained by the Indian army.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a militant hurled a grenade at a military bunker in
Srinagar, injuring a dozen people. The day before, two people were
killed near the Tourist Reception Center. A few weeks ago, a
terrorist bomb hidden in a fruit cart exploded along the banks of
Dal Lake and shattered all the windows of the Welcome Hotel, one of
Srinagar's most popular tourist residences. Many of the other
hotels have long been occupied by special units of the Indian army.
And just this week, police reported the killings of three Buddhist
monks and the abduction of a German tourist.
</P>
<P>
   These are only some of the violent incidents that have marred
the 2000 tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows what will happen here,'' said Bashir Ahmed, who
transports people across Dal Lake on his shikara. Ahmed said he
recalls having as many as three to four customers a day. ``Now I am
lucky to have five customers who will ride my shikara in a whole
month. There is nothing left here.''

 &HT;    Tourism's prosperity a memory among Kashmiris
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the time of year when Kashmir should be teeming with
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, they flocked to the lush Himalayan valley of apple
orchards and majestic poplar trees and skied the snow-tipped peaks
surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   Indians came here to escape much of the subcontinent's stifling
summer heat; foreigners traveled for miles to marvel at the beauty
of land and history. They stayed in hotels lining The Boulevard,
Srinagar's wide avenue circling the legendary Dal Lake, or in the
thousands of intricately carved wooden houseboats bearing such
names as Young Monalisa, Blue Moon or Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But paradise in Kashmir has since been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kashmir was India's No. 1 tourist spot until 1989, when urban
terrorism started rearing its ugly head,'' said Ronjon Lahiri,
assistant director for the Government of India Tourist Office in
New York. ``Suddenly, Kashmir was wiped off the map. Just like
that, it was devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   South Asia's top tourist destination is now one of its most
violent battlegrounds: The 11-year-old Islamic insurgency in
India's northernmost state, known as Jammu and Kashmir, has left
50,000 dead. The militants say they are fighting for ``azadi,'' or
freedom, from predominantly Hindu India, under whose thumb they
feel persecuted. Some even want to become a part of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In response, India has deployed massive numbers of troops in
Kashmir to protect territory it has fought to keep in three armed
conflicts with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   There are few Kashmiris who have not felt the economic impact of
the war on a region dependent on tourist money _ almost 20 percent
of the state's gross domestic product originates in tourism. So for
the staffs at the 366 hotels and guesthouses, the owners of 1,089
houseboats, the agents at 147 travel outlets and the operators of
2,350 shikaras (boat-taxis) as well as the countless handicraft
artisans and pashmina shawl weavers, the decline in tourism has
been difficult to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business used to be so good that even in the middle of winter,
when it is so cold here, we had tourists in our houseboats,'' said
Mohammad Shera, whose family has owned a Dal Lake houseboat for
generations. ``Now it is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Shera spends his days waiting with other houseboat owners at the
owners' union in central Srinagar, opposite the Tourist Reception
Center, hoping to lure a visitor or two.
</P>
<P>
   Mazoor Mahmood Ghasi is in the same predicament. Out of
desperation, the 32-year-old college graduate abandoned the family
houseboat business when there was no food left in his kitchen. His
father-in-law sold his houseboat and Ghasi purchased instead an
auto-rickshaw, an open three-wheeled vehicle that is a common and
cheap mode of transport in Srinagar, as it is in most Indian
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to wear good clothes. We had clean faces,'' Ghasi
said. ``Now look at us. We look like beggars on the street. Our
families are starving. I have studied economics in college and now
I am driving an auto.''
</P>
<P>
   For people like Ghasi and Shera, there was a glimmer of hope
last year after a government-sponsored campaign to revive tourism
attracted a decent number of visitors. But their hopes were quickly
dashed when a two-month conflict between India and Pakistan broke
out in May atop the peaks in Kargil. An airline hijacking last
December involving Kashmiri separatists caused a further scare.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the start of this year's tourist season _ which
typically runs from April to October _ the government tried once
again to jump-start things by offering 30 percent discounts on
travel and lodging and by launching several marketing campaigns.
Optimistic state tourism officials said they hoped to attract
270,000 tourists to Kashmir this year. That is far less than half
of the record 700,000 tourists who set foot in Kashmir in 1988, the
year before the insurgency began.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, the violence appears to be surging again as a
variety of factors continues to diminish prospects for a peaceful
compromise to ``the Kashmir problem.'' Among them is the Indian
government's rejection of the Kashmiri legislature's request for
political autonomy and a reported increase in deaths of Kashmiris
detained by the Indian army.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a militant hurled a grenade at a military bunker in
Srinagar, injuring a dozen people. The day before, two people were
killed near the Tourist Reception Center. A few weeks ago, a
terrorist bomb hidden in a fruit cart exploded along the banks of
Dal Lake and shattered all the windows of the Welcome Hotel, one of
Srinagar's most popular tourist residences. Many of the other
hotels have long been occupied by special units of the Indian army.
And just this week, police reported the killings of three Buddhist
monks and the abduction of a German tourist.
</P>
<P>
   These are only some of the violent incidents that have marred
the 2000 tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows what will happen here,'' said Bashir Ahmed, who
transports people across Dal Lake on his shikara. Ahmed said he
recalls having as many as three to four customers a day. ``Now I am
lucky to have five customers who will ride my shikara in a whole
month. There is nothing left here.''

&HT;     PRIESTLY VIEWS OF ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Priests for Life, a group of Catholic clerics,
has launched a countrywide ad campaign to convince voters to
support candidates solely on the basis of their position on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The national director of the group, the Rev. Frank A. Pavone,
says the campaign is aimed not only at anti-abortion voters but at
pro-choice voters and candidates who might change their mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the public to understand abortion as it is, as an act
of violence,'' Pavone told the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect, the public might think twice about
accepting 6,000 Roman Catholic priests' version of ``abortion as it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests for Life reflects the Catholic hierarchy's dug-in,
intractable stance on abortion, which is an extension of its
dug-in, intractable stance on birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Both have root systems that run deep into _ and feed off of _
ancient (and not-so ancient) church misogyny, superstition and
contradictory reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   In his superb new book, ``Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit,''
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Gary Wills provides a detailed (and
depressing) look at that root system.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the system is a perpetual disconnect between
church leaders and the whole of female reality. When it comes to
women _ be it their sexuality, reproductive capabilities or their
general value as human beings _ the authoritative Catholic Church
often has been the worst place to go for a valid account of the
subject ``as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, as Wills describes, this is the same church that
taught and made policy for centuries on Aristotle's notion of
``natural'' male superiority. As St. Thomas Aquinas argued in the
13th century:
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of nature's own operation, a woman is inferior and a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Females were considered inferior for a variety of reasons,
ranging from Eve's role in the allegory of The Fall to women's
``unclean'' menstrual cycles and their supposed sexual
insatiability.
</P>
<P>
   Albert the Great, who as Aquinas' teacher helped sow
intellectual seeds in the future saint's brain, posited an
imaginative theory of female inferiority:
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman contains more liquid than the man, and it is a
property of liquid to take things up easily and to hold onto them
poorly. Liquids are easily moved, hence women are inconstant . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   So impressively argued were these and other bizarre ideas of
``natural'' law, that the Catholic hierarchy developed its truly
perverse _ but long-standing _ position on sex itself: That it was
a sin unless its aim was procreation.
</P>
<P>
   How perverse did things get?
</P>
<P>
   Aquinas (again) believed that any position of sexual intercourse
other than the man on top was ``unnatural'' and thus a sin. Worse,
he wrote that INCEST was less of a sin than contraception because,
with incest, there was an unimpeded opportunity for procreation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the 13th century anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic hierarchy STILL teaches and preaches that it is
against God's natural law to prevent procreation while engaging in
sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Wills observes:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vatican has some of the same problems with abortion that
it has with contraception. Neither is mentioned in either Jewish
scripture or the New Testament _ you would think it might have been
condemned if it held such a high place on the list of crimes as
modern religious leaders give it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there is no revealed teaching on the matter, the
argument against abortion must be made from natural reason, and
that brings it within the Vatican conception of natural law that
has been discredited with regard to contraception.''
</P>
<P>
   A practicing Catholic who is devoted to his church, not its
hierarchy, Wills spends an entire chapter examining the Vatican's
unenlightened, hypocritical and theologically unsound position on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a fetus is ``a person'' or _ ``as the Vatican
teaches, every fertilized human ovum contains a human soul . . .
and baptism is needed for a soul freed from original sin to enter
heaven'' _ why doesn't the church insist on baptizing fetuses?
</P>
<P>
   And if abortion is ``murder,'' why make an exception because the
mother's life is in danger?
</P>
<P>
   If one takes this popular anti-abortion argument to its logical
end, Wills notes, there can be no exception:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fetus and the mother have equal status as persons, the
natural and not the inflicted death should be preferred.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that Gary Wills presumes to tell the
public how to ``understand abortion as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It is merely to say that abortion is a profound issue, and _
especially for women _ much more complex than ``an act of
violence.'' Even Catholic voters need to know there are
perspectives on the issue that reflect its complexity more
accurately than the view of 6,000 men who have vowed to toe the
company line.

TELEVISION GETS BULLISH ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Tom Everett
Scott in a scene from ``The $treet'' and George Newbern in a scene
from ``Bull.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Back in l987, Michael Douglas clinched a Best Actor Oscar when,
in Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street,'' he assumed the role of rapacious
financier Gordon Gekko and told the movie-going world that ``Greed
is good.''
 &HT;    Now, 13 years later, television finally seems to have gotten the
message.
 &HT;    In the next few weeks two cable networks _ Turner Network
Television and the FX network _ will launch new, hour-long dramas
set in the adrenaline-fueled world of high finance.
 &HT;    Turner's ``Bull,'' debuting at 10 p.m. on Aug. 15, is about a
bunch of young hotshots from Wall Street who break away from their
long-established company to set up a new enterprise. It stars an
ensemble cast of mostly unknown young actors, plus a few familiar
faces _ Stanley Tucci as a financial shark and Donald Moffatt as
the patriarch of their old firm, known as ``The Kaiser.''
 &HT;    Fox's ``The $treet'' _ penned by writer/producer Darren Star,
who created ``Melrose Place,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Sex
and the City'' _ has an ensemble cast seemingly more concerned with
the bedroom than the boardroom.
 &HT;    Again, the show is cast primarily with unknowns playing a group
of ``boy's club'' stock traders who run the offices of the
venerable Balmont Stevens Inc.
 &HT;    On the big screen, of course, Hollywood has flirted with high
finance as far back as the 1950s, with films such as ``Executive
Suite'' (l954) and ``The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit'' (l956).
``Wall Street'' offered an intriguing insider's look into the world
of mergers-and-acquisitions, while HBO's ``Barbarians at the Gate''
(l993) was a harsh but hilarious look at the takeover practices of
blue-chip American companies.
 &HT;    Other big-business-themed movies include ``Bonfire of the
Vanities'' (l990), ``The Hudsucker Proxy'' (l994) and this year's
``Boiler Room,'' which chronicled the life of a broker (Giovanni
Ribisi) peddling his investment wares from a back-room telephone.
 &HT;    This year's ``American Psycho'' hits some kind of new high in
having Christian Bale blend 1980s decadence with good,
old-fashioned gore, while the updated ``Hamlet'' sets the dirty
deeds at Elsinore in New York, with the no-longer-prince (Ethan
Hawke) vying with his uncle for control of the Denmark Corporation.
 &HT;    Now you can have all the vicious, no-holds-barred tumult of Wall
Street in your own living room. But in ``The $treet,'' which will
air Wednesdays at 9 p.m., the real action isn't on the trading
floor _ it starts only after the closing bell sounds, as we get an
intimate peek into the private lives of these dealers and the women
and men they love.
 &HT;    For example, the opening scene finds one of the young traders,
looking more like a male model than a financial wizard, rolling
around in bed with his nubile fiancee, his attention torn between
her and the stock-exchange figures flashing on their bedroom
television screen.
 &HT;    Star is unapologetic about his show's emphasis on copulation
over capitalization.
 &HT;    ``Sex and money are both powerful motivators,'' he says.
 &HT;    Showing a visitor around the cavernous Stage 29 at the Warner
Bros. studios in Burbank, Calif. _ remade into the high-tech,
razzle-dazzle offices of HSD Capital, headquarters for ``Bull's''
young entrepreneurs _ writer/producer/creator Michael Chernuchin,
best known for ``L.A. Law,'' says he spent more than a decade
peddling his idea to the major television networks, without
success.
 &HT;    ``Every time I pitched the idea,'' he recalls, ``the networks
told me that nobody cares about people that make money, because
it's too elite a world. But something has happened in the last
couple of years _ the stock market has become a national pastime
and, thanks to the Internet, everybody is in the market. Nearly 60
percent of all Americans own stock.
 &HT;    ``It's no longer just for the Gordon Gekkos of the world who
understand the street,'' Chernuchin says. ``It's an open book _
anybody can get involved.''
 &HT;    The dialogue in ``Bull'' is so jammed with financial jargon that
Turner has provided the media with a four-page ``cheat sheet'' of
financial lingo, from ``bull market'' and ``blue chip'' _ no prizes
for knowing those _ to esoterica such as ``churning'' (excessive
trading of a client's account in order to increase the broker's
commissions) and ``fallen angel'' (bonds that are heavily
downgraded).
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Chernuchin doesn't think that ``Bull'' risks being
too sophisticated for its audience.
 &HT;    ``In the early days of `NYPD Blue,' when David Caruso and Dennis
Franz were talking about `DD5s,' nobody knew what they were,'' he
says. ``But by episode 5, everyone knew. The same with `E.R.' _
they still use phrases I haven't a clue about.
 &HT;    ``On `Law and Order' I think I helped explain the law to
America,'' he concludes, ``and we're going try and do that in
`Bull,' using real terms and real business deals.
 &HT;    ``I give people credit _ they'll catch on.''
 &HT;    Chernuchin, who wrote more than 100 scripts for ``L.A. Law'' and
is himself a lawyer, says he's following the news in The Wall
Street Journal and won't hesitate to take advantage of
up-to-the-minute plot lines such as Mafia involvement in
overinflating penny stocks or stock-market crashes.
 &HT;    It may seem risky to have two Wall Street-themed shows launching
simultaneously, but Chernuchin laughs off the idea of any challenge
from ``The $treet.''
 &HT;    ``I think the shows are very different,'' he says. ``We're going
for a more sophisticated audience. Darren Star is a great writer,
and he does what he does _ it's the `Beverly Hills 90210'/`Melrose
Place,' who's-sleeping-with-whom type of show. And we're not doing
that. With this stuff, you can also learn.''
 &HT;    The current stock-market boom make both shows very timely, but
Chernuchin insists that his is more than simply an opportunistic
tie-in to the new world of stock options, IPOs and overnight
millionaires.
 &HT;    ``It's about the entrepreneurial spirit in America that made the
country great,'' he says. ``We're trying to do the history of
America through the eyes of these six young people. So I hope that
even people who don't like Wall Street will tune in to our show.''
 &HT;    In the pilot episode of ``Bull,'' Tucci appears as Hunter Lasky,
a coldhearted financial wizard who tells the new bucks: ``I learned
a long time ago that America is not about Mom, baseball or apple
pie _ America's about ownership.''
 &HT;    Chernuchin agrees.
 &HT;    ``I'm from a family of entrepreneurs,'' he says, ``and I think
that theme comes across in my writing and the way I look at the
world. The premise of our show is these people leaving a big firm
and starting on their own. It happens all the time, in every
field.''

WHEN HORSES COULD ROAM THE HEAVENS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., France, China)  By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Scythians, the fierce nomadic tribes of Central Asia that
swept as far west as the Danube from the eighth to the fourth
century B.C., did not limit themselves to plundering Europe.
Skilled horsemen, they rampaged across ancient Eurasia as far east
as China. ``Their country is the back of a horse,'' Herodotus
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese did not like what was happening. ``The Chinese
finally realized that those who controlled the cavalry controlled
the world,'' said Jim Lally, a Manhattan dealer in Chinese art.
``It was a whole new technology.'' So they formed their own mounted
cavalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important Chinese appropriation from its nomadic
neighbors was horseback riding and mounted warfare,'' said Bill
Cooke, director of the International Museum of the Horse at the
Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Ky. So, Cooke said, ``to explore
the significance of the horse in the unification of China and in
the exchange of culture with the Western world along the Silk
Road,'' he organized ``Imperial China: The Art of the Horse in
Chinese History.'' The exhibition runs through Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Four years in the planning, it is one of the largest shows of
Chinese artifacts ever seen in the United States. It includes more
than 350 artifacts valued at $100 million, with terra cotta tomb
sculptures, a reconstructed chariot with its original bronze
fittings from about 200 B.C., horses in carved jade, gilded bronze
and porcelain, and colorful scroll paintings.
</P>
<P>
   By 307 BC, Bill Cooke said, King Wu Ling of the state of Zhao,
near the present-day northern border of China, issued an imperial
decree that soldiers stop wearing their long robes and adopt
nomadic dress so they could ride astride in battle just like their
enemies. The soldiers protected their homeland, and before long the
horse became an object of great affection in Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the horse has had a special place in China's social,
religious, economic and military life ever since the Chinese
domesticated it for meat, milk and hides about 3000 B.C.
``Throughout China's long and storied past, no animal has impacted
its history as greatly as the horse,'' Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese believed the ``heavenly horse,'' like the dragon,
was capable of flight, even of carrying his rider to the ``home of
the immortals'' in the next world. The noble horse inspired ancient
philosophers, poets, writers and artists.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese were not the first to ride horses, they are
credited with perfecting two of the most significant inventions in
terms of world history: the harness and the stirrup, which
ultimately became as important as China's two other fabled
creations, paper and gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition are some of the earliest life-size sculptures
of Chinese horses and their riders. Excavated from a tomb in
Shaanxi province in 1977, a cavalryman and his horse are part of
the terra cotta army commissioned for the tombs of the Qin dynasty
(221 to 207 B.C.). The unglazed horse is saddled up, with studs and
tassel decorating his saddle. His master leads him by the reins.
The cavalryman wears a tight cap, a short robe, an armored vest,
tight trousers and boots. The duo is among 116 cavalrymen and
horses discovered in the same excavation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 220), Chinese
emperors realized the need to import horses of superior stock to
beat back the barbarians' ever more daring raids. ``China's very
survival relied on its equestrian prowess,'' Cooke writes.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining better horses by importing them was not easy, however.
In the second century B.C., Emperor Han Wudi sent an expedition to
Turkmenistan (then called Ferghana) to buy that region's prized
Akhal-Teke, an ancient Eurasian breed of desert horse that was
tall, fast, strong and required little food or water. (It is
thought to be the forerunner of the English thoroughbred.) The
Chinese called them ``horse of heaven'' or the ``thousand-li'' _
that is, a horse that could run 1,000 li _ a li is about a third of
a mile _ without tiring.
</P>
<P>
   The ruler of Ferghana refused to sell his horses and killed the
envoys. The emperor decided to take the horses by force. He sent
6,000 cavalrymen and 20,000 soldiers to Ferghana. The campaign was
a disaster. Half the force died in the mountains and deserts en
route; the rest were badly defeated in battle. They straggled home
two years later, only to face a furious emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the emperor decided to send yet a larger army. As
Cooke explained, this expeditionary force of 60,000 soldiers and
30,000 horses went West with a herd of 100,000 cattle to sustain
them.
</P>
<P>
   After a 40-day siege of Ferghana, the Chinese collected 3,000
horses, 2,000 of which perished on the return journey. It turned
out that only 50 of the captured horses were of the prized breed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the subjugation of Ferghana persuaded other tribes
to cooperate with the Han rulers, ultimately resulting in the
opening of the Silk Road. Thereafter, the Chinese traded silk and
tea for horses.
</P>
<P>
   The artistic depictions of horses most associated with China are
the magnificent terra cotta horses of the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618 to
907), which remain treasured works of art in the West today.(The
record price for one is $6.1 million at Sotheby's London in
December 1989.)

   To the Tang, the horse was not only a military necessity but
also a status symbol. The Tang used horses for battle, hunting,
dressage and polo. Women were allowed to ride. One particularly
charming figure in the show is a painted female tomb figure on
horseback. She sports a wide-brimmed black hat and a red flowered
jacket. Her yellow horse has a red mane and red spots like a modern
appaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Chinese, who were a sedentary civilization, the horse
was a source of joy and pleasure,'' Lally said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about another Tang horse with a female rider in the
exhibition, this one glazed in rare blue as well as green and gold,
Lally said: ``The flying-hooves stance is unusual. These horses are
from the great artistic center Xian, which was to Tang China what
Paris was to Napoleonic France.'' Xian is near the site of the
terra cotta army.
</P>
<P>
   Torkom Demirjian, director of the Ariadne Galleries in
Manhattan, pointed out the quality of the Chinese bronze horse
trappings in the show. Demirjian sells some Tang horses, but he is
a specialist in Scythian and Thraco-Scythian objects, including
horse trappings. He noted the similarities, saying, ``The Chinese
had extensive relations with these nomadic peoples long before we
think they did.'' He is so impressed with the workmanship of his
gold Scythian horse and chariot trappings that he is taking them to
Paris to sell at the Biennale des Antiquaires in September.
</P>

   Cooke said 80,000 people had visited the Kentucky exhibition
since it opened on May 1. He said arrangements with Chinese
officials have been problem-free from the start. When he first went
to China to discuss doing a show, he was introduced to Zhang Ting
Hao, director general of the Administrative Bureau of Museums and
Archaeological Data of Shaanxi province, at a banquet. He told
Zhang his ideas, and Zhang replied that he had written his master's
thesis on the role of the horse in Chinese history. ``That was
it,'' Cooke recalled. ``In 24 hours, we went from an idea to a
10,000-square-foot installation.`

HOME VIDEO: HOW GROSS-OUT GOT THAT WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They wouldn't deign to in a million years, but those who deplore
the adolescent vulgarity in films like ``Scary Movie'' might want
to sit in on a commentary track done for the recent DVD of
``Kentucky Fried Movie'' (1977) from Anchor Bay. The important
thing (only thing) to keep in mind is that John Landis made the
film, really nothing more than a string of gags, the same year he
made ``National Lampoon's `Animal House,''' the gross-out classic
usually cited as a harbinger of the current mess.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Animal House' was a hugely successful film, with 50 or 60
imitators,'' Landis said the other day. ``There was another one
this year: `Road Trip.''' Early signs of the genre are apparent in
``Kentucky Fried Movie.'' A man with a solid sense of humor about
himself and his work, Landis said he had agreed to the commentary
only after Anchor Bay invited his collaborators, the writers Jim
Abrahams, Jerry Zucker and David Zucker and the producer Robert K.
Weiss, to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Kentucky Fried'' could be plugged in about anywhere
today: reclaimed oil extracted from teen-agers' faces; Dino the
Gorilla, who throws a King Kong-sized tantrum when it is suggested
that he is impotent; fly zipping, nose picking, posterior
scratching, excrement smearing. ``Now's a good time to pull the
plug on that machine that's been keeping your daughter alive all
these months,'' a woman advises in one of the skits.
</P>
<P>
   Landis was 27 at the time, and today he and his colleagues watch
it all with a mix of hilarity and consternation. The Zuckers,
participants in many another piece of silly business, from
``Airplane!'' to the ``Naked Gun'' movies, were an earlier version
of the Farrelly brothers, makers of ``There's Something About
Mary'' and the current ``Me, Myself and Irene.'' Together, they
prod each other's memories, reacting in astonishment at some of the
bits.
</P>
<P>
   Landis, sounding serious, said the man in the gorilla suit had
gone on to win five Academy Awards. All the extras are either
somebody's cousin or the Zuckers, who fill in everywhere. Jerry
Zucker is thrown through a wall by the gorilla. ``This guy actually
went on to do porno,'' Landis said about one actor. There is plenty
of sex in ``Kentucky Fried Movie,'' and of the variety present
movie raters would be none too pleased with. ``That would get an
NC-17 now,'' Landis exclaims during an explicit shower scene. For
some reason, the video carries an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   On the disc the director says that when he went to make the
movie, he was thrown out of every studio, so he did what everybody
did: ``Look for a real estate guy with disposable income.'' In an
interview he made two basic observations about outrageous comedy.
First, the movie business follows the money, which is as
advantageous after ``There's Something About Mary'' as it was after
``Animal House.'' Second, it's not the joke, but the audience's
perception of who is telling the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Python, for example, got away with a lot because of its
perceived intellect and sophistication. `` `Mary' is a complicated
case,'' he said. ``I think it ultimately worked because of Cameron
Diaz. If she wasn't in the movie, it wouldn't have.'' &QL;

<P>
   `THE BEACH'
</P>
<P>
   An American tourist named Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) alights in
Thailand, where he knocks down jiggers of snake blood and persuades
two French contemporaries (Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet) to
help him find the perfect beach. On the way they narrowly escape
being machine-gunned by marijuana farmers before encountering a pod
of like-minded Western hedonists living communally in ``paradise.''
But while Danny Boyle's film has surface tension, Elvis Mitchell
wrote in The New York Times, ``all of DiCaprio's charisma and the
director's savvy are used to divert us from the fact that there's
not much going on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2000. Fox. $107.37; DVD, $34.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned.
R. Release date: July 25.
</P>
<P>
   `DROWNING MONA'
</P>
<P>
   No one in the tiny upstate New York town of Verplanck is overly
upset when Mona Dearly (Bette Midler) is sent to her demise in a
brakeless Yugo. As nasty as her name is ridiculous, Mona drew blood
every time she opened her mouth, so the real mystery around her
death is why anybody cares enough to find out who killed her. That
assignment falls to Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito), seemingly the
only reasonable person around. ``The real victims here are the
characters, who've been impaled on their own Herculean pursuit of
bad taste'' (Mitchell). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 95 minutes.
Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 15.
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?'
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the paranoid creeps he has played on television
and as a stand-up comic, Gary Shandling plays a man who would
simply like to impregnate a woman so he can take the child back to
his home planet. At a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, he comes
across Susan (Annette Bening), a freaked-out real estate agent who
becomes the emotional center of the film. As one of the writers of
Mike Nichols' film, Shandling gives himself plenty of space to work
the room, which leads to riffs about aliens, spirituality and other
topics. He may have become a fine actor over the years, ``but he's
finnicky and brittle here'' (Mitchell). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 104 minutes.
Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   `RIDE WITH THE DEVIL'
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War era has never looked quite the way it does in Ang
Lee's chilly, dramatically skimpy epic about a group of
pro-Southern bushwhackers waging war along the Kansas-Missouri
border. Far from ``Gone With the Wind,'' austere farmhouses and
primitive frontier towns are better suited to an anthropological
study. The story focuses on two of the bushwhackers (Tobey Maguire
and Skeet Ulrich) and leads to a stunning re-creation of the
guerrilla raid on Lawrence, Kan., led by William Clarke Quantrill,
but the meditative quality and attention to detail ``keep the story
at a distance'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   2000. Universal. $99.36: DVD, $24.98. 138 minutes. Closed

theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   `THE INDIAN TOMB'
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Lang didn't get around to directing a film of the same
title until 1959. Almost 40 years earlier, he co-wrote Joe May's
silent epic about the Maharajah of Eschnapur, who loses his wife to
a dashing British officer and determines to destroy him and
imprison her forever in a magnificent tomb he will have built
expressly for the purpose. Bring on the tigers, cobras, 3,000
extras (all filmed on May's 50-acre movie lot in Germany) and
Conrad Veidt as the vengeful, sadistic potentate. 1921. $79.95.
Information: (800) 551-8304.
</P>
<P>
   `IDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN'
</P>
<P>
   It may not be one of Michelangelo Antonioni's best, but
Antonioni is Antonioni and the movie is available for the first
time on video. Tomas Milian stars as an actor caught between two
women (Daniela Silverio and Christine Boisson). The actors aren't
bad, but ``there are still a number of red herrings drying in the
sun when the film ends,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York
Times. 1982. $79.95. 131 minutes. Italian with English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   `QUIET DAYS IN HOLLYWOOD'
</P>
<P>
   Here's an early look at Hilary Swank before all the ruckus over
``Boys Don't Cry,'' for which she won the Oscar as best actress.
Josef Rusnak's film presents seven unconnected vignettes about a
tawdry Hollywood world of gangsters, teen-age runaways and assorted

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe it's a good thing evolution is slow and
can't keep up with technology. Otherwise humans would be evolving
into land octopuses.
</P>
<P>
   We'd be driving our cars using one hand to dial a cell phone,
another hand for personal grooming, two hands to fiddle with the
global positioning system and the stereo, two hands to type e-mail
and two more hands to handle the Whopper, fries and Coke.
</P>
<P>
   We'd still be holding the wheel with our knees.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported
Tuesday that 4,000 accidents a year are caused by distracted
drivers, and American industry is constantly inventing new sources
of distraction to add to the inside of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   You can get satellite global positioning systems to tell you the
exact latitude and longitude of your car, even if you can't tell
when you're crossing the yellow line.
</P>
<P>
   You can get on-board computers, perfect for e-mailing accident
reports to your insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   You can get TVs for the back seat, which is awash in the
distraction department. The kids will be a lot quieter, except when
they say, ``There's nothing good on. Are we there yet?''
</P>
<P>
   God forbid they tune into Ricki Lake, and you start trying to
figure out what kind of freaks she has on.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of electronic options is increasing, most
Americans still can't drive and talk on the phone at the same time,
much less dial a number. You can always tell when someone is
dialing because the car slows dramatically and drifts right or
left, depending on which hand is doing the dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Now Americans are being given more electronics than the average
Boeing 747, and they don't have to pass any tests to use all this
stuff. Driving inspectors are still making drivers weave around
orange cones, when they should be seeing if drivers can make
restaurant reservations at 55 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The only hope is that cell phones cause brain cancer, and it
gets them before they get us.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the NHTSA urged drivers not to talk on cell
phones or surf the Internet. That's a little like standing in the
surf and trying to keep the tide from coming in, especially since
the safety agency has no legal powers.
</P>
<P>
   A vehicle safety expert for the auto industry suggested that
automakers might start looking into high-tech solutions for
high-tech distractions, like putting calls on hold if automatic
sensors detect complicated traffic situations.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, they should put cars on hold in those situations.
</P>
<P>
   These are the same auto industry guys who didn't want to give us
seat belts because they cost too much. Now they say they can equip
cars like A-6 bombers, with defensive countermeasures to detect
approaching drunken drivers and little old ladies stepping into
crosswalks.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are already loaded with offense electronic systems, very
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   As if the high-tech threats aren't enough on the road, some of
the biggest threats involve the lowest-tech system of all _ the
ingestion of food.
</P>
<P>
   The food industry is putting all its technological genius into
encouraging us to eat, drink and drive at the same time _ while
dialing and keyboarding with the other hand, of course.
</P>
<P>
   American society has sunk so low that 7-Eleven has begun selling
macaroni and cheese on a push-up stick.
</P>
<P>
   The sociological rationale for one-handed meals and cell phones
is that Americans lead high-pressure lives, in which they have to
stay wired to the world at all times, and don't have time to sit
down to real meals.
</P>
<P>
   This is not life. Technology was supposed to make our lives
easier and more pleasurable, and now we're prisoners in a world
science-fiction writers never could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the cars of the future were supposed to drive us
automatically from place to place _ no hands required, no BMW
phonies on phones coming up fast behind.
</P>
<P>
   Food of the future was supposed to come out of squeeze tubes,
but no one thought it would be macaroni and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Forget mac-on-a-stick. Why don't they install in-car
naso-gastric feeding tubes, and then we'll be really wired.
</P>
<P>
   Does that come in nacho?
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't my idea; my interview subject was the one who
suggested we meet in a corner bar to talk about something that
might lead to a column.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a Miller Genuine Draft; he drank a Diet Coke with a
lemon.
</P>
<P>
   At one point I excused myself to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do me a favor,'' he said. ``Take your beer with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me?''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated the request: ``Finish your beer first, or take it
with you, OK? Because if you leave it on the table, I might pick it
up and take a drink _ and I haven't had a drink since I quit cold
turkey on January 1st.''
</P>
<P>
   I suggested we go somewhere else _ a coffee shop, whatever _ so
he'd feel more comfortable, but he explained that he still liked
going to bars, even though he was no longer drinking 15 beers a
night and waking up in his car.
</P>
<P>
   He liked the smoke, the smell, the sounds. And he really didn't
mind if the people he was with were drinking alcoholic beverages _
as long as they didn't leave him alone at a table with ``live''
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   So I took my beer with me and when I returned, I saw that he had
ordered a fresh Diet Coke with a lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Already I can hear the loyal foot soldiers for Alcoholics
Anonymous preparing to recite the litany of mistakes being made by
the man in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   This guy's a ticking time bomb, they'll say. He's in denial. He
shouldn't be hanging out in bars. He needs the help of an organized
network.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But you know what, maybe not. Maybe this man has found
exactly what he needs to keep from drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The road to recovery has been a subject of intense debate
lately, in the wake of the too-ironic-for-fiction story of Audrey
Kishline, 43, the founder of Moderation Management, a controversial
organization that says there's a difference between hardcore
alcoholics and problem drinkers, and that problem drinkers can
continue to imbibe as long as they learn to modify their habits.
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, Kishline was driving 60 mph in the wrong direction
on a highway in Washington state, a bottle of vodka on the seat
next to her, when she rammed her pickup truck into a 1982 Dodge
carrying Richard ``Danny'' Davis, 38, and his daughter LaShell, 12,
killing both.
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed Kishline's blood alcohol level at 0.26, more than
three times the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Kishline pleaded guilty to two counts of
vehicular homicide, and on Aug. 11, she'll learn how long she'll be
in prison _ anywhere from 41 months to life.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Alcoholics Anonymous, not with glee but perhaps
with a certain righteous vindication, will say: There, see that?
That's what happens when you think you can control your problem
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's more complicated than that. For one thing, Kishline had
renounced Moderation Management, two months before the accident. In
a Jan. 20 letter to MM members, Kishline said she had failed her
own programs and was joining Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   So are we to blame AA for not ``curing'' Kishline? Of course not
_ not any more than Moderation Management is at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Kishline is to blame. She's the one who turned her
automobile into a loaded weapon by getting behind the wheel while
tanked beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous make direct
reference to God or a higher power, e.g., Step 3, ``Make a decision
to turn our will and our lives to the care of God as we understood
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The religious influence and the assertion that alcoholism is a
disease infuriate the founders of Rational Recovery, a group that
advocates personal responsibility above everything and has a
mission statement filled with incendiary claims such as, ``The
disease theory of misbehavior is a greater heresy against human
decency than racism and Nazism,'' and, ``The stigma of addictive
disease is far more damaging than the shame of drunkenness.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I don't endorse the belief that AA is the only way to
kick addiction. Read the article in salon.com by Steve Burgess, a
former wildman who took his last drink 15 years ago and says, ``No
12 steps; I took one, right off a cliff, and found I could fly.''
Is he a failure because he did it his way?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dahl, a legendary radio personality in Chicago who himself
has been sober for five years, was talking about a lot of this
stuff on the air the other day, and he had it right: What's the
point in arguing that there's only one way to stay dry? Find what
works for you and hope that your fellow travelers on the highway
and in life have found their own solutions as well.

INSIDE ART: CALDER'S EAGLE LANDS IN SEATTLE; EXPANSIONS IN HARTFORD
AND DENVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Texas, Wash., Colo., Conn., Britain, Germany, Japan)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALDER'S `EAGLE' LANDS IN SEATTLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a year, ``Eagle,'' a monumental sculpture by Alexander
Calder, has stood in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Now
the 39-foot-high biomorphic steel structure is heading to Seattle,
where it is to become the centerpiece of a sculpture park scheduled
to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Art Museum announced this week that it had acquired
the Calder for its new Olympic Sculpture Park, a six-acre site
downtown. The sculpture, which experts say cost more than $10
million, was purchased with a donation by Jon and Mary Shirley,
Seattle collectors, to the museum's acquisition fund.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the deal said Thomas Gibson, a London dealer,
represented the Shirleys on behalf of the museum. He declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   One mystery is the name of the seller, a group of investors
whose identity is being withheld by the Seattle museum.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, ``Eagle'' was owned by the Fort Worth
National Bank and stood in front of its headquarters in Texas. It
was bought by Loutex, the Fort Worth real estate development
company that bought the bank's building. Loutex sold it to the
investors' group several years ago. In April 1999, it left Texas
after unsuccessful efforts to find a buyer who would keep it in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was anybody willing to buy it for Philadelphia. ``The Calder
was lent to the city of Philadelphia through the Calder
Foundation,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia
Museum of Art. ``It would have been great if a donor had acquired
it and given it to the museum, but that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   R.C. Rower, a grandson of the artist and the director of the
Calder Foundation, said the reason might have been that ``everyone
there knows the foundation is going to be bringing large-scale
works to Philadelphia.'' A Calder Museum is planned for a site
across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway right across from the Rodin
Museum. ``We hope to have chosen the architect by early August,''
Rower said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eagle,'' made in 1971, two years before the artist died, is to
arrive in Seattle in the fall. ``We're working to find a temporary
location until the park opens,'' said Mimi Gates, director of the
Seattle Art Museum. The Calder is the first piece earmarked for the
sculpture park.
</P>
<P>
   A BIGGER ATHENAEUM
</P>
<P>
   The Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, Conn., is embarking on its
first expansion in 30 years. The oldest art museum in the United
States, it occupies five contiguous buildings constructed over 125
years. The expansion will improve circulation and connections
between the existing buildings and add a new building to house at
least part of the permanent collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many objects have been languishing in our storerooms,''
said Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser, the acting director. ``As our
attendance has increased, it has become more and more been
difficult to accommodate visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum has hired Fox &AMP; Fowle, New York architects best know
for the new Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square, to become what
the Athenaeum calls its ``executive architects.'' It has also asked
the artist Maya Lin to create an environmental artwork for the
museum's Main Street exterior. Lin's project is being financed in
part by a $2.5 million grant from the state of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be exploring the merger of art, architecture and
landscape, the ambiguity of what's outside and what's inside,'' Lin
said. But, she added, ``it is still too early to discuss more
specifics, other than to say that I'd like to see art from inside a
museum come outside.'' Some ideas she is considering include
creating outdoor roomlike spaces for art, perhaps using video
artists to invent lighting and commissioning site-specific pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason Lin's plans are not fully formed is that the
museum has launched an international search for for a design
architect, to be chosen by October, to design a new building and
help renovate and reorganize some of the existing structures.
</P>
<P>
   EXPANSION IN DENVER
</P>
<P>
   After an intensive six-month search, the Denver Art Museum has
selected Daniel Libeskind to design its $62.5 million expansion.
Libeskind, born in Poland and now based in Berlin, has designed a
spiral extension for the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and a
new home for the Jewish Museum in San Francisco. He is to create a
new 146,000-square-foot building, the Denver museum's first major
expansion since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in 2004, it will nearly double the size of the
museum, creating new space for special exhibitions and for its
departments of modern and contemporary art and architecture, along
with its design and graphics departments. The addition will also
include education and multimedia programming and spaces for public
events.
</P>
<P>
   The main building, a 28-sided two-tower structure completed in
1971, was designed by the Italian architect Gio Ponti, who died in
1979. The expansion will use an open area across the street. It
will include a 1,000-car garage and a connection to the existing
building.

   ``We spent a lot of time talking to different architects,'' said
Louis Sharp, the museum director. ``We developed a list of 40
architects and narrowed it down to 3.''
</P>
<P>
   The finalists _ Libeskind, Thom Mayne of Santa Monica, Calif.,
and Arata Isozaki of Tokyo _ each gave a public lecture and a
daylong workshop, which were shown on cable television.
</P>
<P>
   When the Victoria and Albert Museum released the design for its
extension, neighbors and preservationists opposed the radical glass
structure, which resembles a series of tumbling boxes set between
two ornate Victorian palaces. Still, Louis said he did not think
Libeskind was too racy for Denver. ``This is a young city,'' he
said. ``We're prepared and excited to be stepping out.'' &QL;

<P>
   But the more frequent discipline was flogging. According to an
account written in 1836 by a sailor known as Jack Nasty Face, a
typical maritime punishment proceeded this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The prisoner is made to strip to his waist; he is then seized
by his wrists and knees to a grating or ladder; the boatswain's
mate is then order to cut him with a cat-o'nine-tails; and after
six or twelve lashes are given, another boatswain's mate is called
to continue the exercise, and so they go on until the captain gives
word to stop. From one to five dozens lashes are given, according
to the captain's whim, but the general number is three dozen.''
Others say two dozen was the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's early naval service gives a good indication of the
frequency with which masters resorted to the lash; during his
18-months aboard the frigate Seahorse, the teenage seaman saw men
flogged on at least 200 occasions. Naval records show that in 1810,
31 members of the ship Alfred were flogged for different offenses
on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   A brutal flogging could maim or even kill. One particularly
sadistic British captain, Hugh Pigot of the Hermione, who sometimes
ordered the last man down from aloft flogged, killed at least two
men that way; it's no surprise his crew mutinied in 1797 and
murdered him. But Pigot was hardly alone in his sadism.
</P>
<P>
   One British officer reported to the admiralty: ``I served in a
ship where every one of the maintopmen were stripped and flogged at
the gangway for no other cause than that another ship in company
got her topgallant yards up first, and not for any wilful
negligence on the part of our men.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the crew of the Namur rioted, demanding shore leave,
three ringleaders were hanged, while four received 500 lashes.
Another seven received 200 lashes or more. Yet the captain, Edward
Boscawen, was considered such a fair and forgiving officer that men
begged to serve with him.
</P>
<P>
   Flogging was a regular part of American naval discipline as
well, though general treatment seems to have been more lenient, as
evidenced by the fact that men regularly left England's service to
join the US Navy, while desertion seldom occurred in the opposite
direction.
</P>
<P>
   None of which should in any way diminish an observer's delight
in the picturesque armada sailing this summer, of course. It's just
that rapture is always best balanced with reality.
</P>
<P>
   So enjoy the Tall Ships _ but don't let their grandeur sweep you
too far off history's moorings.

TALL SHIPS, BRUTISH LIVES

 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tall Ships are sailing again and they again make stowaways
of our fancy, fostering dreams of a life at sea, of rippling sails
overhead, the pitch of the deck beneath our feet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we have a way of forgetting the dark side of history, of
glorifying war, or romanticizing times of sacrifice. Thus, before
we bid bon voyage to the armada (and our senses), it is instructive
to ask what life was like during the golden age of sail, an era
that ran from 1460 to about 1860? Here's a hint: Not a whit like
the impression one might glean from the gleaming flotilla that came
gliding into the harbor on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Writing of the British Navy of the Stuart era, which spanned
most of the 17th century, historian G. M. Trevelyan described life
aboard ship this way: ``The sailors, famished when they were not
poisoned, seldom clothed, and hardly ever paid, were kept together
by flogging, keel-hauling and other sea tortures on men of war that
were often little better than ill-managed convict hulks and
ill-supplied plague hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did perspicacious 18th-century observers think life at sea
had improved much by their time. ``No man will be a sailor who has
contrivance enough to get himself in jail,'' Samuel Johnson said at
mid-century, ``for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the
chance of being drowned. A man in a jail has more room, better food
and commonly better company.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Johnson was right in much of what he said of seafaring
life, he was wrong in implying jail offered protection from the
British Navy. In Horatio Nelson's era (the late 18th and early 19th
centuries), only about half of the sailors on British naval vessels
were volunteers. Others were dragged aboard by the notorious press
gangs in what was essentially legal kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Prison was a regular recruitment site. Britannia filled her
decks with smugglers, thieves, pickpockets, debtors, rogues, and
the like. Complained one veteran sailor of the quick-fingered
scalawags he was forced to serve with: ``Neither chest nor bed nor
blanket nor bag escaped their sleight-of-hand thievery.''
</P>
<P>
   Although American custom and tradition forbade ``impressment'' _
outrage over England's seizing of sailors from American ships was,
after all, one of the causes of the War of 1812 _ the American Navy
was full of characters as shady as any.
</P>
<P>
   In ``White-Jacket: Or the World in a Man of War,'' Herman
Melville, who had served on the frigate the United States, called
the US Navy ``the asylum for the perverse, the home of the
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was life like aboard ship? At this midsummer juncture, a
review of history serves to remind us. Because although sailing may
conjure up images of endless idle hours spent on deck in the glory
of sun and wind, that was hardly the case. To paraphrase Hobbes,
seafaring life was poor, nasty, brutish _ and wet.
</P>
<P>
   In rough weather, a sailor's work was dangerous indeed as he
wrestled with sails aloft, seldom more than a slip away from
plunging to his death on the deck or in the raging seas. Other
times, a day's labor was dull, tedious, and repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sailors themselves knew the allure of the sea was a landlubber's
delusion. ``No sooner . . . has the young sailor begun his new life
in earnest than all this fine drapery falls off, and he learns that
it is but work and hardship after all,'' student-cum-sailor Richard
Henry Dana wrote in ``Two Years Before the Mast,'' a chronicle he
penned in no small part to combat the misimpressions that drew
young men down to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The day aboard ship began between 6 and 7 a.m. with the cry
``all hands ahoy.'' The first chore was often washing and scrubbing
of the decks, a task done daily even in freezing weather. Beyond
the task of sailing the ship _ the setting, reefing, furling, and
bracing of sail _ repairing of the miles of rigging, scrubbing of
sails, overhauling of gear, and general cleaning, tarring,
painting, greasing, and oiling went on without surcease. On a naval
vessel, sailors also found time for regular practice with and
inspection of guns and equipment. Make-and-mend days filled any
spare hours.
</P>
<P>
   Except on Sundays, and for a few moments in the evening, if a
man was on deck, he had to be at work. ``It is the officer's duty
to keep everyone at work, even if there is nothing to be done but
to scrape the rust from the chain cables,'' Dana wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended between 8 and 9 p.m., when the off-duty watch or
shift could retire for four hours below decks to their hammocks,
slung so close that little more than two feet separated one
snoozing sailor from the next.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sunday was different, including a church service and some
sort of music or revelry.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the retrospective romance of sailing is the
notion of traveling the world, sampling the exotic cultures of the
various ports of call. But when shore leave for naval sailors came
at all, it was generally restricted to a small portion of the crew.
In home ports, there was frequently no leave, because reluctant
captains feared desertion. That situation led one British sailor to
call his five years of service ``floating imprisonment,'' other
servicemen to complain of serving ``upwards of ten years without
having the satisfaction of seeing our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of leave was one of the grievances that precipitated
the great British naval mutiny of 1797, in which more than 50,000
men serving in more than 100 vessels rebelled. (Thomas Payne, who
stoked American revolutionary fervor with ``Common Sense,'' helped
popularize another key grievance in his ``Rights of Man: Part the
Second'': ``The pay . . . is about the same now as it was about a
hundred years ago, when the taxes were not above a tenth part of
what they are at present.'')
</P>
<P>
   The admiralty made one concession to concupiscence: In ports,
wives and prostitutes were allowed aboard, and the lower deck often
took on aspects of an orgy. But if heterosexual sex was allowed,
the sentence for homosexuality, which was sometimes, but not
always, overlooked, was death.
</P>
<P>
   Food was neither plentiful nor good. Breakfast was usually tea
and hardtack (hard, dry, unleavened bread) or biscuit. Salt beef or
pork and biscuits were the monotonous mainstays of other marine
meals, though peas, oatmeal, beans, cheese, potatoes, and rice also
figured in. Even in port, fresh vegetables were not a regular part
of meals until late in the 19th century; only after 1795 was citrus
included to combat scurvy.
</P>
<P>
   A regular rapping came at the beginning of each meal as the men
banged their biscuits on the table to knock the worms out. As a
Sunday treat, the men might have ``duff,'' a gummy flour pudding
eaten with molasses. Beggars ate better, groused one British
sailor.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly calamity made that true, for then, starvation loomed.
Things got so desperate for one English ship blown off-course
during the 16th century that rats, mice, and the ship's cats were
all devoured. During their epic, 12,000-mile crossing of the
Pacific, Magellan's starving men were reduced to eating the leather
that wrapped the mainyard to reduce chafing.
</P>
<P>
   Although men could usually drink freely from the water cask on
deck _ the scuttle butt that has given its name to the gossip
traded there _ water became foul tasting after weeks in casks.
</P>
<P>
   Beer and spirits were a sailor's favored drink. Beer, when it
could be had, was given at the rate of a gallon per man per day.
</P>
<P>
   If not, a sailor was entitled to a pint of wine or a half-pint
of spirits, usually rum or brandy, half in the morning, half at
night. (When, to reduce the general inebriation, Admiral Edward
Vernon, known as Old Grogham after the green grogham cloak he wore,
ordered the half pint of rum cut with a quart of water, the diluted
drink became known as ``grog.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, drunkenness, or grogginess, was common aboard ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be drunk is considered by every sailor as the acme of
sensual bliss,'' wrote one mariner in his mid-18th century memoirs.
``In our ship the men would get drunk in defiance of every
restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   But at their peril: By most accounts, at least half of all
disciplinary measures had inebriation as their root cause.
</P>
<P>
   And woe betide the poor swab who ran afoul of the captain.
Discipline was unsparing, particularly in the British Navy, and
``all hands ahoy to witness punishment'' a regular command.
</P>
<P>
   Mutiny, of course, was punishable by death. Although we think of
mutiny as a general rebellion, the charge also included striking an
officer, as Melville's Billy Budd found out, as well as individual
acts of disobedience. It could even be stretched to cover
insubordinate language. A condemned man was executed by hanging,
accomplished by fixing a noose about his neck, tossing the end over
the yardarm, and hauling him skyward.

`ALICE AND MARTIN:' THE LOGIC OF TRUE LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Techine is the most novelistic of filmmakers, by which I
don't mean that he stints on the visual aspects of his craft. On
the contrary, his new film, ``Alice and Martin,'' like his
masterpieces ``Ma Saison Preferee'' and the scandalously underrated
``Wild Reeds,'' is full of gorgeous photography, swift, elegant
editing and meticulously composed scenes. Techine's camera captures
the dazzling yellow of a meadow in southern France, the deep grays
of Paris at night and the rhythms of the sea beating against russet
rocks on the Spanish coast.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this beauty is thrown onto the screen for its own
sake; it seems to occur almost as a byproduct of Techine's
fanatical concentration on the fine grain of his story. Like a good
novel, and like Techine's previous films, the story resists
summary. While it glances at some interestingly knotty themes _ the
tension between bohemian asceticism and consumer culture, the
atavistic pull of family history, the self-destructive logic of
true love _ ``Alice and Martin'' proceeds almost entirely without
speech-making or exposition. You have to work a bit, especially at
first, to figure out the relationships among the characters, to say
nothing of their feelings and motives, but your attention is
rewarded by a film of surprising depth and a few deep surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The first scenes play out almost breathlessly, as 10-year-old
Martin (Jeremy Kreikenmayer), who lives happily with his mother, a
hairdresser, and her boyfriend, a taxi driver, is abruptly sent to
live on a gloomy estate ruled by his truculent father (Pierre
Maguelon), a local industrialist. All this information is imparted
almost in passing, as if any concession to the audience would break
the spell of realism. In due course we learn that Martin is
illegitimate and that he has three older half-brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly it's 10 years later, and Martin, grown into a handsome,
delicate young man (Alexis Loret), bursts from his father's house
to roam the countryside until he is caught stealing a farmer's
eggs, after which he drifts to Paris, where he encounters his
brother Benjamin's roommate, Alice (Juliette Binoche).
</P>
<P>
   One of this film's most ingenious and unnerving effects is the
way it confounds our sense of time: both chronology and duration.
Just when you think you've mastered the relationships among the
characters and begun to infer where the story is going, the
narrative swerves back into the past with whiplash-inducing
suddenness. Similarly, and even more unnervingly, it's often
impossible to tell whether a sequence of scenes unfolds over days,
weeks or months. The ripening of Alice and Martin's relationship
and its eventual crisis unfold in roughly equal screen time, with
equal intensity and speed, even though their courtship lasts
through several phases of Parisian weather, and their breaking
point is reached during a brief retreat to an isolated Spanish
fishing village.
</P>
<P>
   This dislocation is deliberate, and it effectively communicates
the emotional rhythms of the characters' lives. One of Techine's
skills is his ability to sustain a sense of unpredictability
without sacrificing coherence. But although ``Alice and Martin'' is
always engrossing, it moves at once too quickly and too slowly.
During the film's last section, which follows Alice's solitary
journey to Martin's hometown in search of his family secrets, much
of the earlier intensity dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   At this point the film feels emotionally complete _ the two main
characters have arrived at some understanding of each other and of
themselves _ and its long denouement seems both superfluous and
underdeveloped. It is suggested, but only suggested, that Martin's
native territory, the Cahors region of southern France, is defined,
like the American literary South, by intricate social hierarchy and
gothic domestic relations. In the end, Martin's family members take
over the film, and though their presence is meant to explain his
despair, they end up obscuring him.
</P>
<P>
   But too much complication is, in this case, too much of a good
thing, and the proliferation of characters allows us to see
performances we might otherwise have missed, notably Carmen Maura
as Martin's stepmother, and Mathieu Amalric as Benjamin. ``Alice
and Martin'' is a richly populated, observant film that suffers,
forgivably, from an excess of curiosity about the world it depicts
_ a surfeit of generosity, intelligence and art.

`STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LAND': BONDING AND BIASES THAT BUILT
CHINATOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: broadcast notes at end of review)

<P>
   Chinatown: The word implies strong identity and limiting
boundaries. But that label does not communicate the rich depth of
Chinatowns in San Francisco, New York, Vancouver and many other
cities where Chinese immigrants have made their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's History Channel ``Time Machine'' presentation,
``Chinatown: Strangers in a Strange Land,'' aims to show the depth
of Chinatown, ``a world that is rarely seen and even more rarely
understood,'' according to the narration.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree that aim is achieved. The program is clearly a
History Channel presentation; ``Strangers in a Strange Land'' feels
impersonal, and contemporary Chinatown gets slight attention. But
while the documentary is stingy with heart, it is generous with
fact and offers a dense, insightful visit to these communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers in a Strange Land'' mixes contemporary videography
with archival stills to document the Chinese experience in
Chinatowns, described in voice-over by the actor Monte Markham as
both ghettos and havens for their residents. Beginning with the
first major wave of Chinese immigrants during the California Gold
Rush of the mid-1800s, the documentary describes the combination of
American discrimination and Chinese heritage that led to the
development of Chinatowns.
</P>
<P>
   The discrimination provides especially compelling material.
Chinese gold miners, for instance, faced taxes not levied on
Caucasians for the same work. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act for a
time suspended legal migration to America; later, immigrants were
held in internment camps, which are shown in the documentary as
they appear today. Facing the weight of such discrimination, many
Chinese-Americans sought refuge in communities of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese cultural life also led immigrants to bond, the
documentary explains. An array of contemporary Chinese-Americans _
storekeepers, detectives, lawyers and authors _ explain how the
traditional associations and tongs, complex units of Chinese
community life, served as organized touchstones for their ancestors
and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary aims to praise, not bury, these Chinatowns, but
it does note their defects. Stories are told of gang wars in the
1980s in New York's Chinatown, where Doyers Street was called the
``bloody elbow'' for its violence. The negative side of a passion
for gambling is also described, as are the traditions that keep
many Chinese-Americans bound to a narrow range of job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the documentary admires its subjects,
describing Chinese-Americans as a ``model minority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers in a Strange Land'' is skimpy with personal
portraits, choosing instead to load viewers' minds with historical
assertions. But while noting the extraordinary, the documentary
more memorably depicts the ordinary: food markets that draw
enthusiastic cooks, outdoor tai chi sessions with an
intergenerational mix of participants and celebrations that promote
the pride and interdependence of families.
</P>
<P>
   That, the program implies, is the hidden truth of Chinatown; it
is a place where residents hold off assimilation to hold onto their
culture in the face of forces both attractive and overwhelming. As
one resident puts it, ``It's a small-town feeling in a large
city.''

`POKEMON THE MOVIE 2000': A MILLENNIAL MESSAGE FROM POKEMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Pokemon the Movie 2000,'' Pikachu and his fellow mystical
creatures pursue two new adventures. This program, which seems to
have been cobbled out of several episodes of the syndicated
television series from Japan, is probably about as good as cut-rate
animation that seems to consist of screen savers can be.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two films is ``Pikachu's Rescue Adventure,'' a
short. Since the entire program runs less than 90 minutes, what
does that make the main feature? Probably way too long for the
uninitiated, but that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of the two offerings, Pikachu, the little yellow
character with black ears, and his mates, including Squirtle (who
resembles a turtle), Snorlax (a penguin with a thyroid problem),
Psyduck (a pink tailless platypus) and others, are off to assist
several other Pokemon of an eggy sort during an intense and driving
rainstorm. With the exception of some complaints voiced by Meowth _
the Pokemon associate of Team Rocket, the bad guys _ no English is
spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the short is filled with Pokemon speak and has no
subtitles, and it's an inventive way for youngsters to learn a new
language. It may be a language they'll be able to use only at
Pokemon conventions, or as a way to irritate their parents. Still,
some small amount of educational purpose is better than none at
all. The Pokemon known as Exegutter emerges by the end, and his
name's pronunciation is so similar to executor that some may think
the Pokemon have finally found a creature to help plan their
estates.
</P>
<P>
   In the main feature, Ash, the young trainer who traps and
nurtures Pokemon _ and is often the star of the adventures with
Pikachu _ has to stop the menacing Collector, a nasty sort who is
caging up Pokemon with tremendous powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you talk, Pokemon are just things to collect,'' Misty,
a member of Ash's team, says to the Collector in English _ a remark
that will doubtless provoke mirthless laughter from parents.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiar dialogue exchange occurs when someone tells Ash, ``If
you want someone to do whatever you want, whenever you want, you
should find yourself a girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we do not get to see how this piece of advice
complicates Ash's dating life. Perhaps we will in ``Pokemon 3000,''
by which time someone else can disentangle the unwieldy plot
machinations found in ``Pokemon 2000,'' which quieted the children
with whom I saw it because they, too, were lost.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects this is called ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' not just
to remind parents how much cash they have spent on Pokemon products
to date, but also because the end of the world is threatened. The
millennial message is that one person can make a change, though
that person is, as usual, Ash. He vows to stop the Collector from
capturing the Pokemon representing the elements of nature, like
Moltres (a fire-breather) and Zapdus (who sends out lightning
bolts). This would upset the Earth's elemental balance. Even Jessie
and James, the villainous Team Rocket, elect to help Ash.
</P>
<P>
   Several new Pokemon are introduced, but perhaps the most notable
is Ash's mother, Ketchum. She gives the young adventurer, who wears
a hat with an insignia that looks suspiciously like the Lexus logo,
a piece of her mind and reminds him that he is her greatest
treasure. At this point, parents can gather their greatest
treasures and take them home before the end credits. &QL;

&HT;        GORE AND BUSH VISIONS OF SPACE PROGRAM EMERGE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 20 - Space exploration may be the final
frontier of the 2000 presidential contest: Mars missions and the
rocket industry have been subjects relatively untouched by either
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet advisors to Vice President Al Gore and George W. Bush,
outlining the presumed nominees' visions for space at a Capitol
Hill event yesterday, said both candidates are developing a space
agenda. Both candidates appear to share the goal of putting humans
on Mars and investing in a sluggish aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   The event -- coinciding with the 31st anniversary of the Apollo
11 moon landing -- was billed as the first public discussion of
space policy under the next administration. The event was attended
by space industry officials and was held by the nonpartisan group
Women in Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Walker, a former Pennsylvania congressman and now a
consultant to Bush -- the all-but-named Republican nominee -- said
voters should expect a ``new direction'' for the space program
under a Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would provide the ``boldness and leadership that assures
American dominance in a new millennium,'' Walker said. Walker
criticized the Clinton-Gore administration for NASA's flat budget
in recent years. ``At best they have ignored space and at worst
they have used it as a political tool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said although the Texas governor was still fine-tuning a
space agenda, its would likely entail several key principles,
including tying the space program to military ends and spurring
commercial investment. Bush has voiced strong support for building
a space-based national missile defense, a plan also supported to
varying degrees by Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush would look to give humans a ``permanent
presence on the Moon and on Mars,'' Walker said. ``I do believe a
Bush administration would aggressively pursue policies to take us
back to the Moon and on to Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Adviser Steven O. Palmer said Gore also would back NASA's Mars
program, whose future is uncertain after the loss of two probes at
the Red Planet last year. ``The question of human exploration of
Mars is not if, but when,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Gore's experience on space issues, Palmer said Gore would
make ``wise investments'' in the aerospace industry, and support
``pushing the envelope'' in science, technology, and space
exploration. Gore supports reducing the cost of space launches by
offering tax-free bonds and loan guarantees, and reforming export
control laws that restrict companies from selling technology
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a friend, an ally, and a leader in this community,''
Palmer said. ``After his election, his door will be open to all of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said the vice president stands by the $60 billion
national missile defense system, which has come under intense
criticism, especially after a recent test failure. ``However, he's
unwilling to move ahead unless the technology will work, it's
affordable, and it will not disturb world peace,'' Palmer said.

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN _ They are one of the world's few
remaining bands of Marxist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Fidel Castro's rag-tag army of Cuban peasants in the
1950s or leftist insurgents dodging around Central America in the
1980s, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are flush with
cash _ lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, as they are known by their Spanish acronym, have
tapped a 1990s source of revenue: drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted with AK-47 rifles, black berets, new uniforms and
knee-high black rubber boots, these guerrillas have become a
battle-proven force of soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   They control huge swaths of the Colombian countryside, and buy
their guns and equipment with tribute paid by poor farmers who
raise coca and poppy, as well as drug traffickers who process and
smuggle the contraband destined for the streets of Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   They also make millions by kidnapping, holding their victims _
sometimes children _ for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   But their connections to Colombia's notorious drug industry are
what have propelled the FARC from a backwater group to powerful
military force with a sophisticated propaganda machine. Their top
negotiators now hobnob with visiting diplomats and recently toured
several European countries with a delegation aiming to bring peace
to Colombia. They even have their own Website.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents, however, bristle at the notion that the FARC
are anything more than ruthless, ideologically driven killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't answer to anybody on this earth or in the next
life,'' said Gen. Mario Montoya, head of a new Colombian
anti-narcotics task force that will spearhead a campaign funded by
a $1.3 billion U.S. anti-drug package. ``They make huge amounts of
money from the drug trade. Coca grows like a weed here, and they
are the middle men.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bulk of their forces still hide in the mountains
and the jungles, the FARC now have their own territory where they
walk the streets free from fear of attack by government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to jump-start peace talks, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana pulled his troops out of a Switzerland-sized area in
southern Colombia in January 1999, in effect creating a safe haven
for the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   But after starting amid great hopes, he peace talks have made
little progress, with the two sides barely able to agree on a rough
list of topics to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FARC have consolidated their hold on their turf,
turning San Vicente _ a town of about 15,000 _ into something of a
rebel showcase.
</P>
<P>
   Few tourists venture to the town, which can be reached by
regular commercial airline service. Guerrilla checkpoints dot all
roads leading into the enclave, with armed FARC soldiers ordering
riders out of cars for searches and questioning.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months the guerrillas have welcomed journalists,
perhaps eager to tell their side of the story.omatic rifles and
hand grenades clipped to their belts are clearly the real power in
town.
</P>
<P>
   The local courts collapsed when the judges fled, and they've
been replaced by a FARC system of justice that includes a complaint
center where citizens bring gripes about everything from disputes
with neighbors to domestic squabbles. There are numerous reports
that a separate FARC tribunal deals sternly with those accused of
spying for the government, sometimes imposing death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   FARC billboards urge the people toward ``a new Colombia,'' and
extol the ``Bolivarian Movement,'' a campaign named after South
America's revolutionary hero, Simon Bolivar. There are also banners
decrying government torture and crop fumigation aimed at the coca
plots that support many poor farmers _ as well as the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a rebel information office just off the town

</P>
<P>
   Few tourists venture to the town, which can be reached by

roads leading into the enclave, with armed FARC soldiers ordering
riders out of cars for searches and questioning.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months the guerrillas have welcomed journalists,
perhaps eager to tell their side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence that we can construct a new government for
Colombia,'' said Fidel Rondon, a member of the FARC commission
holding peace talks with government negotiators in a rural village
called Los Pozos, about 40 minutes from San Vicente. ``We want a
better future for all Colombians. This nation has been ruled by a
violent political class. The people of Colombia no longer believe
in this government.''
</P>
<P>
   San Vicente is the largest of five small towns in the FARC-held
territory. A muddy farm center od a beret takes requests from
visiting journalists, holding court in a spotless room decorated
with photos of Marx, Lenin and Latin America's modern leftist hero,
Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople shrug when asked about their strange status, many
reluctant to talk openly about their de-facto rulers. But they
admit there is now peace in San Vicente _ which, before the FARC,
suffered attacks from all sides in the long-running civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the guerrillas came, nobody wanted them to come,'' said
Jorge Solis, a long-time resident. ``But now we have had peace, so
everybody is happier. The economy is good, people have work, and
there aren't bodies in the streets like before. Most people don't
favor one group over the other. They just want peace and to be able
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The FARC were born in the rough countryside outside San Vicente
in the 1950s, when Colombia was torn by political violence between
its dominant political parties. The group formed to advocate for
the poor peasants caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, FARC power waxed and waned. Almost written off
15 years ago, the group has transformed itself into Colombia's most
powerful insurgent force through money earned from the drug trade.
Colombian media estimate the group earns hundreds of millions each
year through ``taxes'' imposed on drug growers and smugglers, and
the FARC now boasts around 20,000 soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the guerillas rule by terror, forcing
young peasant youths into their ranks or seducing them with the
promise of a gun, comradeship and a monthly salary of 400,000 pesos
(US$200), more than double the average wage.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, international diplomats and Colombia's press
have blasted the FARC _ as well as other guerrilla bands and
right-wing paramilitary groups _ for their reliance on kidnapping.
Across Colombia, there is growing outrage that some 200 children
were among the estimated 3,000 kidnapping victims nationwide last
year.
</P>
<P>
   FARC leaders deny kidnapping children, although they admit
taking adults for ransom to raise funds. They also steadfastly deny
involvement in the growing or shipping of cocaine and heroin,
although they admit ``taxing'' those who do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We condemn narco-trafficking,'' said Andres Paris, one of the
group's top negotiators. ``It's not of the guerrillas. It's an
economic and social reality in Colombia. We charge taxes on the
biggest business in our area. It's a political tax to finance the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds for Colombia, it's clear the FARC have
now become a powerful, well-financed guerrilla machine that can't
be ignored and won't easily be defeated in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being chastened by the demise of many Marxist regimes
around the world, FARC leaders seem more committed and confident
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare us to Russia,'' said Rondon, who once taught
school in rural Colombia. ``We have taken the ideas of Marx but
applied them to Colombia. As the crisis between the rich and poor
in Colombia has grown, we've grown. And as the Army of Colombia has
modernized, so have we.''

 &HT;    Trick's on you. At the end, you'll want your money back.
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Squint hard and you can almost see what Emily
Watson had in mind when she got involved in the painfully unfunny
``screwball film noir,'' ``Trixie.''
</P>
<P>
   After stunning performances in such sober social dramas as
``Angela's Ashes'' and ``Cradle Will Rock,'' you'd yearn to break
out into a brazenly comic role too. And it sort of made sense for
her to place her trust in director Alan Rudolph, the resolutely
offbeat filmmaker who has given affectionate showcases to actresses
from Geraldine Chaplin (''Remember My Name'') to Genevieve Bujold
(''Choose Me'') to Julie Christie (''Afterglow'').
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that ``Trixie'' is an embarrassment for all
concerned, as leaden and vacant a comedy as you are likely to see
all year. Or rather, as you are likely to pass on seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph has a quirky storyteller's touch and an affection for
actors, but when he miscalculates, the results can be excruciating.
Ask those fans who saw his previous effort, the incoherent
adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's ``Breakfast of Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest is a strained send-up of private detective tales, the
adventures of gum-chewing, language-mangling Trixie Zurbo (Watson),
a department store security guard who yearns for some genuine
undercover work. She gets hired for graveyard shift surveillance at
a two-bit casino and stumbles onto a murder case involving a sex
scandal, an incriminating videotape and a cheesy, patently corrupt
state senator (Nick Nolte).
</P>
<P>
   In the lighting fixtures of life, Trixie is one dim bulb, a fact
that is bluntly underscored by her habit of talking in
metaphor-mixing malaprops. She goes around saying things like
``Fish or get off the pot'' and ``Grab the bull by the tail and
look him in the eye.'' What begins as an endearing,
character-revealing habit quickly grows annoying. With everything
Trixie utters sounding like Yogi Berra-isms, the joke soon
evaporates and calls attention to the artificiality of Rudolph's
script.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, her way with words proves contagious, at least with
bumbling lothario Dermot Mulroney and with Nolte's Sen. Avery.
Actually, Avery has his own style of windy palaver that almost
suggests an intentional theme of miscommunication, but is probably
just Nolte being indulged as he improvises politico-speak. Either
way, the irritating dialogue is sheer brilliance compared with
``Trixie's'' plot, which also feels made up on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   It has something to do with an alcohol-soaked party girl (Lesley
Ann Warren, bumping and grinding her career to a screeching halt)
who falls or is pushed out a motel window to her death. Also along
to muddy matters is a would-be movie star (Brittany Murphy) who
carries multiple ID cards with varying birth years and an
ill-at-ease Nathan Lane as a casino lounge entertainer who wiles
away his life doing bad impersonations of the likes of Anthony
Newley and Humphrey Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   All of this might have been stirred into a tasty
tongue-in-cheek, Raymond Chandler-esque stew, as Rudolph's mentor
(and ``Trixie's'' producer) Robert Altman managed with 1973's ``The
Long Goodbye.'' Instead, the comedy deflates and two hours in the
dark have never felt so long.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is gamely devoted to her character and while she is
straitjacketed by the role's one dimension, there are moments that
hint at the comedian within her. Nor does Nolte rise above the
writing, though you sense him pressing hard to please.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie'' should have gone straight to video, or perhaps the
studio's vault. If you go to see it, check the theater's refund
policy on the way in.

 &HT;    '70s duo tries to `Do it Again,' differently
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Call it the Steely Dan formula: a little
soul, a little substance, a little satire. And, of course, all that
jazz.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the '70s and early '80s, it was a sound that defined
a creative pop ideal. Even though the duo _ guitarist Walter
Becker, now 50, and keyboardist Donald Fagen, 52 _ had its share of
hits (''Reeling in the Years,'' ``Do it Again,'' ``Peg,'' ``Rikki
Don't Lose That Number''), this wasn't exactly music for the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   It still isn't. Witness Steely Dan's first new album in 20
years, ``Two Against Nature,'' a nine-song compilation that covers
such topics as incest and murder, with the occasional romantic
ballad thrown in. It's all accompanied by a jazzy beat, clever horn
arrangements and sly, shifting harmonies. Like much of Steely Dan's
work, it occupies a place somewhere between sinister and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the members of the duo say they've ever thought
consciously about their sound. It just, well, evolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started making records, and by the third record, we
developed a style that included all the things we liked,'' says
Fagen, speaking by phone from the same tour that will bring the duo
to the MARS Music Amphitheatre on Tuesday. ``At this point, we
still don't try to go for that, but it just shakes out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is good news for dedicated Dan fans, who haven't been able
to get their hands on any new material since 1980's ``Gaucho.''
Unlike most rock splits, this wasn't the result of some scandal or
blowup. The band, which was rounded out by some of the best studio
musicians from that era, had already given up touring in the
mid-'70s, claiming it wasn't the best vehicle for promoting its
finely crafted music. By the early '80s, Becker and Fagen were
simply burned out altogether. But they did stay friends _ Becker
produced Fagen's 1993 solo album, ``Kamakiriad ``_ and in the
mid-'90s, they regrouped and hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   An album was the logical next step, lest Becker and Fagen resign
themselves to being labeled a nostalgia act. ``We're just glad we
have new material,'' says Fagen.
</P>
<P>
   And some material it is. Take your pick of shady and strange
characters _ the album is full of them. There's the vagabond who
returns home, only to find his kid cousin is suddenly a sexy,
mature woman (''Cousin Dupree''). There's the failed novelist who
now spends his directionless days toiling at a bookstore (''What a
Shame About Me''). And there are women of every age and every shade
of moral character.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the songs are written in an elusive poetic style,
there's clearly something going on. ``I think underachievement is a
kind of theme,'' Fagen says of the album. Not unlike Dylan's ``Time
Out of Mind `` album, this is rock from a middle-aged man's
perspective. The difference, of course, is that Becker and Fagen
temper their wisdom with dark humor. Who else can get away with
writing a song about incest _ and make it pure fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a sense of humor about it, you can almost get away
with anything,'' says Fagen. ``It's sort of a way of looking at
life itself.''

   Musically, Fagen says the group hasn't bothered to update its
sound _ there are no nods to hip-hop, no pretense of being popular:
``I don't think at this point some kind of incredible innovation is
going to happen. . . . That would be dishonest.'' But he does note
that ``there's a lot of harmonic stuff we haven't tried before,''
and Becker's guitar playing has ``become much more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His guitar style dominates the record and gives it a unity
that maybe the other albums didn't have,'' Fagen adds. But if
there's a musician who steals the show, it's saxophonist Chris
Potter, whose solo on ``West of Hollywood,'' the album's
concluding, eight-minute song, turns it into an instant jazz-rock
classic.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, radio doesn't play eight-minute songs, so don't
expect to hear ``West of Hollywood `` on Top 40 anytime soon. These
are much different times than the early '70s, when Becker and
Fagen, two literame out with something in the next couple of
years.''

`INNOCENT AS CHARGED': SHE LEFT TOWN A WRECK, BUT CAME BACK A
STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the Russian playwright Alexander Ostrovsky, all
the world was quite literally the stage, and a life in the theater
was the only honest life worth pursuing. In an exuberant
celebration of Ostrovsky's vision that also offers a master class
in acting, the Vakhtangov Theater of Moscow is presenting
``Innocent as Charged'' through this weekend as part of the Lincoln
Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Ostrovsky was a forerunner of what would become a revolution in
the theater. If it was Chekhov's ax that finally brought down the
cherry orchard that was 19th-century Russia, it was Ostrovsky who
honed it with dozens of plays that satirized the landed gentry and
provincial bureaucrats. Although immensely popular in his day (a
statue of him stands outside the Maly Theater in St. Petersburg),
he frequently ran afoul of the czar's censors. He was one of the
favorites of the Communist authorities during the Soviet years,
which may explain why he was seldom performed in the West.
</P>
<P>
   New York audiences unfamiliar with Ostrovsky could ask for no
better introduction than the splendidly acted and visually opulent
production from the Vakhtangov that at times takes on an almost
circus atmosphere as characters move in and out of the audience,
wander on and off stage and interrupt dialogue with snatches of
song or even, in one delightful scene, a can-can line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innocent as Charged,'' which is played in Russian and
simultaneously translated via headphones, is an old-fashioned
melodrama in structure and theme. Seventeen years separate the
first act (in which a young unwed mother is jilted by the father
and told that her 3-year-old child has died) and the next three
acts. During the intermission that follows, the woman moves away,
changes her name and becomes a famous actress. When the audience
returns, it finds her appearing in the same town from which she
fled, a star of the Russian stage. Naturally, the child had not
died, and is now a leading actor with the local theater company.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son, of course, eventually reunite. But it is not the
story _ dramatic and sentimental as the denouement may be _ that
earns Ostrovsky his reputation as a precursor of the modern
theater. The strength of his plays, and the fascination of the
Vakhtangov's fine staging, is in the playwright's concentration on
character development, even in the secondary roles, and the flow of
action interspersed with songs that the director Pyotr Fomenko has
given this production.
</P>
<P>
   A behind-the-scenes story to the Vakhtangov's visit was
Fomenko's refusal to join the company here, saying he was too busy
with a new production in Russia and he thought the actors needed
more rehearsal time. He need not have worried. This production has
been a huge hit in Moscow, and it is easy to see why. The play
features a cast of 13, and there is not a weak link in it. The
lessons of Konstantin Stanislavsky are alive and well in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, the famous actress (the character of Yelena
Ivanovna Kruchinina, given a fine performance by Yuliya Borisova)
explains to her ardent admirer (Nil Dudukin, superbly played by
Yuri Yakovlev) how she manages to so accurately portray night after
night the agony of a mother who has lost her child. It is quite
simple: she, too, had lost a child, and she calls on that
experience in recreating her role. Like Hamlet's instructions to
the players, Ostrovsky's actress is giving advice that Stanislavsky
would expand on in developing his method of acting that would
dominate 20th-century theater.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the actors uses small gestures or even a simply prop to
build an indelible character. Yevgeny Kniazev, who is an
irresistible free spirit as Grigory Neznamov, the grown lost son of
the famous actress, enters with a pool cue stick and a long purple
scarf that becomes part of his persona. For Mikhail Uliyanov, who
plays Grigory's fellow actor and older sidekick, it is an old coat,
hat and a decanter of vodka. And Lyudmila Maksakova, who is a
joyous bundle of raw seductive energy as Nina Pavlovna Korinkina,
the leading lady in the provincial acting troupe, uses a
long-stemmed carnation to create a femme fatale.
</P>
<P>
   Although the simultaneous translation via headphones (in which
one person renders all the roles) is as spiritless as a United
Nations Security Council debate, Ostrovsky's humor can still filter
through (as when Dudukin, presenting a gift of caviar to Yelena,
observes ``You must eat something.'') However, one noticed that
those in the audience not needing to rely on the translation were
laughing more than those of us who were.
</P>
<P>
   The Vakhtangov production is spectacular to look at. Whoever
paved the way for the troupe to bring its wardrobe deserves a vote
of thanks. The costumes by Olga Ahmatovakaya are stunning _ richly
textured silk gowns, smartly cut suits and top hats and wonderfully
tattered rags. And Tatyana Selvinskaya's sets _ crocheted doilies,
an old Victrola, a samovar _ are like time travel to 19th-century
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the inconvenience of moving between two venues (the
opening act is played on a postage-stamp stage _ to give the feel
of a cramped apartment, no doubt _ with the spectators sitting on
bleacher-like benches) and the fire-drill atmosphere of a general
admission audience elbowing its way to unreserved seats for the
second act (played in a sort of hotel ballroom atmosphere), just
watching the Vakhtangov actors is a treat for which anyone who
loves the theater should be grateful.

   Bravo: The Clinton administration wants to give e-mail the same
protections enjoyed by phone conversations. No longer can the feds
read your e-mail as they please; they'll have to wake up a judge at
3 a.m., get him to sign a warrant, and then read your mail while
the judge totters back to bed.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how many judges wake up every morning
thinking, ``I had that strange dream where I signed a piece of
paper again.''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't the only online issue being decided nowadays.
There's Carnivore, DeCSS and the notion of criminal linking. Sounds
geeky and irrelevant, sure -- but these issues affect everything
from the right of artists to control their work to the government's
ability to read Grandma's mail. It's the biggest intellectual
cluster-headache in the history of intellectual property;
everyone's slightly right and slightly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Take the FBI's Carnivore device. It consumes all incoming and
outcoming e-mail to an Internet service provider, sifting for data
that might pertain to ongoing criminal investigations. It's like an
anti-Mafia automated phone tapper that listens to every
conversation in New Jersey and sets off a bell when it hears the
phrase ``horse head inna bed.'' Effective? Sure -- and gassing
everyone in New York and taking their prints while they're
unconscious would help law enforcement assemble a useful database
for identifying criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Carnivore would catch criminals. Might even
catch a few terrorists too stupid to use encryption. It's the old
trade-off -- freedom vs. security. On one hand it's a frightening
device, but on the other hand it's heartening: Only in America do
we learn that these devices are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if they're telling us about Carnivore, it's probably
to take away attention from Omnivore, which has been capturing
every keystroke we've made since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Next issue: copyright. Emmanuel Goldstein, a k a Eric Corley,
publisher of the hacker zine 2600 and Webmaster of 2600.org, went
to court in mid-July. He's being sued by every movie company on the
planet. Background: Linux users wanted to watch DVDs on their
machines -- not because it's a good way to watch movies, but
because everyone else could do it. (A good excuse -- for a
5-year-old.) So a Norwegian teen named Jan Johansen cracked the
code and handed out a program called DeCSS to thwart the encryption
scheme. Some used the program for piracy, and the studios feared a
real yo-ho-ho fest of movie thievery.
</P>
<P>
   For good reason. Now a pirate can e-mail a movie to his DVD
sweatshop in Shanghai and get a jump on the legitimate
distributors. No one knows exactly how artists can profit from this
new model -- perhaps in the future we'll all pay an entertainment
utility bill, charged by the bit for our music, literature and
movie downloads.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, consider the problem of the illegal link. A
link is a few bytes of code that allow someone to leap off one Web
page and land on another. It's an exit sign -- and should someone
be held liable for an exit sign? Of course not. What if it leads to
an unguarded bank vault with piles of money? If someone uses your
exit to go someplace and commit a crime, are you guilty? Probably
not. But what if you build the exit and send out fliers announcing
``Free Entrance to Unguarded Bank Vault''?
</P>
<P>
   You can what-if this to death, so let's cut to the chase: You
can't criminalize links. This would be akin to banning ``Mein
Kampf'' and forbidding World War II histories to even acknowledge
its existence. Major news sites link to many external sites, and
they always remind us that they don't endorse these sites. If
someone can be held liable for linking, then the big media
companies will think twice before linking. Then the casual user
will think twice. The link is the essence of the Web. Stifle the
idea of the link, and the Web shrivels, dies and turns into
hermetically sealed channels with no interaction. TV, in other
words. Verdict: Hackers must prevail on this point.
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel Goldstein, of course, was the name of a political
critic in George Orwell's ''1984.'' The real Mr. Goldstein was
brought to trial at the same time that TV premiered ``Big
Brother,'' a show about people who have willingly given up their
freedom and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Willingly. At least Orwell thought we'd put up a struggle.

   LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton.
</P>
<P>
   Four miles from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster,
Brixton is a riot of noise and color.
</P>
<P>
   It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae rhythms dancing
from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD stores and
appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market, you hear
the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish _
occasionally even English.
</P>
<P>
   The market's shops and stalls offer London's best Afro-Caribbean
and African fare _ plantains, caramel-colored smoked fish,
thermo-nuclear peri-peri sauce and yams. The air smells of scorched
coffee, limes and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, bright red double-decker busses _ the symbols
of familiar London seem drab in Brixton _ pass through, a reminder
that the heart of the Anglo-Saxon universe is a 10-minute commute.
</P>
<P>
   No less than Parliament House with Big Ben and Churchill's
statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the fiber of modern
London, a city rapidly being redefined by its ethnic variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is this that is
igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote Yasmin
Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper and
author of Who Do We Think We Are: Imagining the New Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation started at the end of World War II, when
Britain began accepting a substantial number of immigrants from
countries that for the most part had been colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Most settled in London's boroughs. Today, nearly 25 percent of
Londoners are from non-white minorities. In boroughs such as
Brixton, the percentage of non-whites is 40 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Wilson, a Brixton resident, came to London in 1952 from
Spanish Town in the hills above Kingston, Jamaica. Wilson, an
electrician, has raised children and now grandchildren in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still Jamaican,'' he says, buying a pair of fresh chickens
for his wife to grill. ``But these young ones, they are Londoners _
not Englishmen, mind you, but Londoners.''
</P>
<P>
   People here insist that London is no melting pot, as immigrants
don't shed their cultural identities in the process of
manufacturing a new one. Nor is London seen as a multicultural
mosaic on the order of Toronto or Chicago, which have ancient,
separate and sheltered ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In London, things are more fluid. With notable exceptions, few
neighborhoods could be called ``Little Delhi,'' ``Little Jamaica,''
or ``Little Lagos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evening Standard perhaps said it best when it described
London as an ``ethnic kaleidoscope _ always shaking into a new
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling city of 8 million has 33 distinct ethnic
communities speaking 300 languages. One central London school
recently reported that its 800 students speak 79 languages at home.
At school they are unified in their struggle with English.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this multi-ethnic seasoning is palpable. In fact,
the favorite food in Britain no longer is fish and chips or
steak-and-kidney pie _ it's curry.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has sparked a wave of creativity matched only by
the bell-bottomed Carnaby Street revolution of the mid '60s that
introduced wide belts and frilly Edwardian suits to millions of
American closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other place in the world like this city today,''
London musician Aki Navaz said recently in The New York Times. ``I
used to look through the windows at the white world. Now I know
that white kids are looking through mine, wanting to join in with
this energy.''
</P>
<P>
   London even has become a cultural center for other cultures. In
June, the best and brightest of ``Bollywood'' - the Indian version
of Hollywood - flocked to the Millennium Dome for the Indian
version of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   With Britons, ``Bollywood'' takes a backseat only to Hollywood.
A new 30-screen cineplex is dedicating six screens to Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Three Bollywood movies, known as extravagant productions of epic
lengths and lavish musical interludes, entered the United Kingdom's
top 10 list this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mambo Sharman, one of the Bollywood awards organizers, said he
was amazed at this trend. ``Often I go past a cinema in London and
look at the queues for Bollywood films and there are as many white
faces as Indians,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It makes me
feel guilty for not going as often as I should myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Madame Tussaud's, the venerable British waxworks museum, soon
will add its first ever Bollywood display. And Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the superstar British musical machine with a keen sense of the
popular, is preparing to stage Bombay Dreams, a new musical set in
Bollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an exaggeration to say non-whites now dominate the
London entertainment scene, the ethnic variety is nevertheless
remarkable. A number of black and Asian comedians _ notably Nina
Wadia and Meera Syal _ have become household names.
</P>
<P>
   Many young Britons are plugged in to Fun-Da-Mental, a
multiracial group that plays a fusion of Persian jazz, rap and
hip-hop. The music produced by these hip, young musicians as well
as the established Jazzie B of Soul II Soul reflects a mix of
original cultures shaken but not stirred in the traditions of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The British cutting edge is layered with artists such as Steve
McQueen, the black Turner Prize winner whose haunting film The Bear
has received praise at the new Tate Modern museum.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   These changes have not come comfortably to all Britons.
</P>
<P>
   David Irving, the historical writer and accused Holocaust
denier, earlier this year said he spoke for many of his countrymen
when he expressed longing for the days when Britain was more
British.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go to Heathrow airport, take a 747 and fly back
10 hours later to find England as it used to be,'' he said during
his libel trial against Emory University professor Deborah
Lipstadt. ``I can't say I applaud uncontrolled colored immigration.
I regret the passing of old England.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party has found political capital in attacking
what it describes as a flood of immigrants from Asia and Africa,
with the implied threat to British culture and institutions if the
torrent isn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government has responded by
tightening immigration rules. It has become so difficult to enter
Britain that a thriving black market has emerged in trafficking
immigrants. Last month, 58 Chinese immigrants were found dead in
the back of a vegetable truck where they suffocated while being
smuggled into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   For all the worries about immigrants, Britain remains very white
_ 94.6 percent white, according to government statistics. Away from
London and other large cities such as Birmingham and Manchester,
non-whites are rare. About half of all the non-whites in Britain
live in London.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, blacks _ mostly from the Caribbean _ constitute 1.6
percent of the population. Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis _
generally lumped together and called Asians _ constitute about 2.7
percent. The balance includes Chinese and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the minority population is much younger than the
white population, the government estimates that in 20 years, the
percentage of non-whites in British society will double.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the predictable tensions over change, blacks and Indians
often say they believe for the most part they have been accepted _
if not embraced _ by whites.
</P>
<P>
   When Rasshied Din started in business a few years ago, he was
warned not to use his own name because the English would think he
was a ``second-hand sari salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Din Associates is now the seventh-largest design consulting firm
in the country with a client list that features retail and fashion
heavyweights such as Tommy Hilfll up and say, 'Oh, you speak
English,' as if they were surprised,'' he said. ``It seems strange
looking back, but you have to remember that this was before there
were any prominent Asians in business or in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the changes, race doesn't occupy the august station in
British society or politics that it holds in the United States. For
many Londoners, it is a topic like sex and religion, best not
discussed over the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. A strong minority vote was essential to
Ken Livingstone's election in May to become London's first elected
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone now represents the largest base of constituents in
the country, potentially elevating the agenda of London minorities
to national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hall, a respected black intellectual, believes Britain is
becoming more like the United States in its racial dynamics _ if
perhaps in a gentler, more civil fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Britain going to accept its diversity and become more
humane? We don't yet know,'' he said. ``Yes, things are better in
some ways, but a lot of people feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's no going back in the fundamental change in the
nature of London, making the city a unique and fascinating
experience, said Trevor Philips, a black politician and social
critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hum of London's streets cannot be replicated,'' Philips
wrote recently. ``It's the sound of a hundred cultures softly
clashing, sometimes melding, occasionally grating uncomfortably.''

&HT;     BUSH'S VP CHOICE COULD INFLUENCE GORE'S PICK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No one will be more closely watching Republican
George W. Bush's choice of a running mate this week than Democrat
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's selection promises to shape the political
landscape for the fall campaign by freeing Gore to choose a
conventional Democratic running mate or forcing him to match any
bold Republican selection with a dramatic choice of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the most important decision that Bush makes
before the election,'' says Larry Sabato, a political scientist at
the University of Virginia. ``Gore's choice of a running mate is
going to be determined by what Bush does.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nelson, a presidential scholar at Rhodes College in
Memphis, Tenn., who authored `''A Heartbeat Away'' on vice
presidential selection and succession, says Bush could throw Gore
on the defensive by choosing a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush wants to do something bold and path breaking, the best
move on the board would be to pick Elizabeth Dole,'' says Nelson,
citing the former Republican Cabinet officer and ex-Red Cross
president who withdrew from the GOP presidential race last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By choosing a woman, Bush would put Gore in a bind in terms of
having to come up with a `diversity pick' of his own,'' said
Nelson. ``It would be very hard for Gore to just pick another white
male.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby, president of the Zogby International based
in Utica, N.Y., says Bush has already overcome Democrats'
traditional edge among women voters. Bush stands almost even with
Gore among women _ 43 percent to 44 percent. By contrast, President
Clinton enjoyed a 16 percentage point edge among women voters in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's choice of Dole or New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman
might prompt Gore to give greater consideration to prominent women
Democrats, such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., or Maryland Lt.
Gov. Kathleen Kennedy-Townsend, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to announce his running mate after the
Republican convention wraps up on Aug. 3 with Bush's acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The only woman ever chosen to run on a national ticket was then-
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., selected by Democrat Walter Mondale
to join the Democratic ticket in 1984 in a failed effort to
sidetrack Ronald Reagan's quest for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Griffin, a political scientist and sociologist at
Vanderbilt University, says Bush's selection will signal whether
the two-term governor envisions building a victory coalition upon
hotly contested constituencies such as women, union members, Roman
Catholics and minorities _ or whether the Texan plays it safe by
choosing a trusted, reliable running mate who will cement ties with
traditional Republican loyalists such as evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look behind his choice and you'll see his political
strategy,'' Griffin says.
</P>
<P>
   Bush faces a unique personal challenge with his selection as
well: He has to demonstrate that he can avoid the kind of misstep
that put a cloud over his father's nomination as the Republican
presidential candidate in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush saw his moment of triumph
extinguished from the unanticipated controversy that erupted over
his surprise selection of then-Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's use of family connections to win a coveted spot in the
Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam war became the focus of
the convention rather than Bush's own vision for the nation
following the two-term presidency of Republican Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rebounded from the setback to win 54 percent of the popular
vote and 426 electoral votes in the November election, crushing
Democrat Michael Dukakis, then governor of Massachusetts. Quayle
proved such a chronic embarrassment to GOP fortunes that year that
his campaign handlers shielded him from the news media and limited
his campaign activities.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush resisted advice from some GOP advisers in 1992
that he should dump Quayle from the ticket. Instead, Bush and
Quayle went down to defeat at the hands of the all-southern ``Baby
Boom'' ticket of Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, and Gore, then
a senator from neighboring Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush is banking that extensive screening of his
prospective running mates by Dick Cheney, a widely respected former
defense secretary and one-time White House chief of staff will
avert any unforeseen embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   As Sabato put it: ``We're going to see this week whether the
Bush family has a gene that causes them to blow the choice of
running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who cites loyalty as one of his highest priorities, said
last week that he will choose a running mate who ``can do the job,
wants the job and is willing to work'' for him as president. Bush
added: ``You want somebody who's not going to hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also is weighing the prospective running mates'
home states, gender and race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to showcase his choice during a five-day, six-state
barnstorming campaign through swing states that haven't voted
Republican since 1988, before arriving at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Latest nationwide polls show that voters rarely are persuaded by
a candidate's choice of running mate. A USA Today-CNN survey last
week found that 88 percent of the respondents said they had never
voted for a candidate because of the choice of running mate and 89
percent said they had never voted against a candidate because of
the choice of running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush prepared for his decision with frequent consultations with
Cheney by phone and in person; face-to-face meetings with
prospective running mates and carefully phrased favorable comments
about potential partners designed in part to bolster their standing
in their home states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would honor requests not to be considered for the
post made by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a popular defeated rival,
and former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Bush faced bold choices that would underscore his bid for
moderate voters, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge; New Jersey
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman; New York Gov. George Pataki; and Sens.
Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, both Republicans from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Other prospects offered Bush the chance to bolster ties with
conservative Republicans, such as Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.;
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating; and House Budget Committee Chairman
John Kasich, R-Ohio.

</P>
<P>
   Whatever the choice, history shows that vice presidential
nominees get a hefty boost toward the presidency despite
disparaging assessments such as Vice President John Adams's
dismissal of the post as ``the most insignificant office'' ever
``contrived'' by man. Vice President John Nance Gardner, who served
during the Great Depression, said the assignment ``wasn't worth a
bucket of warm'' liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Such notorious quips came before President Franklin D. Roosevelt
wrested the selection from party elders in 1940, setting the stage
for party nominees to make personal choices with whom they could
forge the kind of seamless partnership that emerged between
President Clinton and Gore during the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The post has proven an important stepping stone into the Oval
Office even though only four vice presidents in American history
have succeeded directly to the presidency _ Adams in 1796, Thomas
Jefferson in 1800, Martin Van Buren in 1836 and George H.W. Bush in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 12 vice presidents since World War II, including
Gore, have subsequently captured their party's nomination for
president. Five of the 10 post-war presidents had served previously
as vice president. Including Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon,
Gerald Ford and Bush.

TWEEDLE NOT-SO-DUMB: BRIAN DOWNEY ON `LEXX' 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Brian Downey
in a scene from ``Lexx.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The joys of ``Lexx'' are unending for Brian Downey.
 &HT;    ``I've been chained, wrapped in plastic, covered in a gigantic
condom, strapped to a cross and immersed in freezing water in
Namibia,'' says Downey, who co-stars in the envelope-stretching
series, which on Aug. 18 will kick off its second season on Sci-Fi
Channel. ``Apart from glue on the penis, I don't know what else
they can do to me.''
 &HT;    Surely the sadistic chaps who write ``Lexx'' will think of
something, because they seem to love torturing poor Stanley Tweedle
(Downey). For those who don't follow ``Lexx'' regularly, the show
follows the offbeat, decidedly unheroic adventures of Xev (Xenia
Seeberg), a love slave coveted by Stanley, and Kai (Michael
McManus), an ageless corpse _ and, of course, 790 (Jeffrey
Hirshfield), a robot who also worships Xev. And they all trek
through space on the Lexx, a sentient ship that resembles a
colossal insect.
 &HT;    Season two will differ from last year in ways both subtle and
pronounced. Now that Seeberg has established herself as Xev, the
actress will sport blonde tresses rather than red, and her outfits
will be toned down just a tad.
 &HT;    Venturing beyond its sound stages in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
``Lexx'' will benefit visually from location shooting in Germany
and Namibia.
 &HT;    In terms of tone, look for the often-wacky humor of the past to
give way to a slightly serious feel, meaning more dramatics and
deeper relationships between the core characters. And, rather than
feature stand-alone episodes, this year's 13 episodes of ``Lexx''
will play out as so many parts of one overall story.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot of big changes,'' Downey says by telephone
from his home in Newfoundland. ``At the end of your season one, we
didn't know what to do and went into suspended animation. We took
our chances and just flew out into space.
 &HT;    ``The opening of season two, `Fire and Water,' is us floating
through space and you see that we've encountered two planets, Fire
and Water,'' he says. ``One is all water and one is the most
horrific desert planet you could ever imagine. We are boarded by
people from the Fire planet who are very, very nasty.
 &HT;    ``They wake me up first and I have no idea who they are, no idea
where we are,'' Downey says. ``All we know is that right now, as
usual with `Lexx,' we are in trouble.
 &HT;    ``During the episode we find out that we've been in suspended
animation for 4,000 years,'' continues Downey, who's portrayed
Tweedle since 1995, when ``Lexx'' debuted as a quartet of
television movies. ``So the episodes that follow will be about how
we extricate ourselves from this particular problem, how we deal
with the new characters'' _ among them Fire's fiery leader, Prince,
played by Nigel Bennet of ``Forever Knight'' fame _ ``and how we
deal with the new adventures each of the regulars go through.''
 &HT;    Future episodes will include ``May,'' in which Stanley falls in
love, and ``Boomtown,'' in which he indulges in more sex than he
can possibly handle. ``The Key'' will bring Stanley dangerously
close to scoring with Xev.
 &HT;    Considering the show's popularity overseas, more ``Lexx'' seems
likely, even if the ratings don't ultimately warrant a third season
on Sci-Fi Channel. Right now, though, Downey is simply enjoying the
moment and the show itself.
 &HT;    ``I totally understand that `Lexx' is not everybody's cup of
tea, and it never was intended to be that,'' he says. ``We weren't
trying to be the next `Star Trek.' We weren't in competition with
anyone.
 &HT;    ``The whole intention was to do something that was different,''
Downey says. ``We said, `We don't know for sure if this is going to
work, but we're going to have fun doing it and we're going to make
that read on screen.'
 &HT;    ``That's exactly what we've done, and I give audiences all over
the world credit for being hungry for something new and something
that is a bit innovative.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ He is a Christian living near the place where Jesus
was crucified, but Palestinian Jack Mardin still feels like some
people do not recognize his place here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think there are Jews and Muslims and there are no
Christians here,'' said the 25-year-old Mardin (pronounced,
Mar-DEEN''). ``The Holy Sepulcher is our church. Our patriarchs are
here. We have lots of churches.''
</P>
<P>
   His patriarchs may feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   This week, local leaders of the three major local Christian
denominations wrote a letter to U.S., Israeli and Palestinian
leaders asking for a place at the Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust you will not forget or overlook our age-long presence
here,'' stated the letter from the patriarchs of the Greek
Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Armenian Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks that Christian communities not be divided and
for guarantees that holy sites will remain open to all the faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Jerusalem, ruled by Israel but claimed in part by
the Palestinians, is said to be a major sticking point in the
10-day-old summit talks at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are asking for sovereignty primarily over the parts
of Jerusalem that they populate, which were captured by Israel in
the 1967 war. Israelis say that Jerusalem has been the center of
Judaism for 3,000 years and cannot be shared.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has been painted in largely terms of Muslims vs.
Jews. Focus is on who will rule over the Western Wall, sacred to
Jews, and the Haram esh-Sharif complex, sacred to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for world opinion, Israeli leaders repeatedly
state that Jerusalem is not as important for Muslims as it is for
Jews. It is, they say, the ``heart of Judaism.'' Christians are
rarely.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Jerusalem's place in Christianity, Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert said recently, ``It is a lung for Moslems and a lung
for Christians and a heart for Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerusalem is the site of Jesus' crucifixion and
resurrection. The place where he prayed in Gethsemane and where his
mother, Mary, lived. It is also home to about 10,000 Christians.
Most of them are Palestinians and some are Armenian.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's Christian sites are also the destination of hundreds
of thousands of Christian pilgrims from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, pilgrims lined up in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
the cavernous collection of chapels where Catholics and Orthodox
Christians believe Jesus was crucified.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Swehla, a 22-year-old pilgrim from Modesto, Calif., said he
was keeping track of the Camp David talks but does not expect them
to affect the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will really make a difference,'' he said,
standing in the line to see Jesus' tomb. ``No one will do anything
to it. It's too historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few expect any major changes in the holy sites soon.
Modern history has seen generally open access under Israel. The
Palestinian Authority built Christian confidence by sinking
millions of aid dollars into improving conditions around the
birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem, under their control.
</P>
<P>
   But, before the modern age, the Holy Land saw churches,
synagogues and mosques ransacked as rulers of the different
religions held sway. Even the Church of the Holy Sepulcher has been
destroyed more than once since it was first built in the Fourth
Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has shown that whoever has the political power tends
to favor his own,'' said Pietro Sambi, the Vatican representative
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the patriarchs was similar to other
pronouncements that Christian leaders have made during
negotiations, said Palestinian analyst Mahdi Abdul-Hadi.
</P>
<P>
   It stated that they oppose a proposal reportedly being discussed
at Camp David in which Israel would retain control of the Jewish
and Armenian areas in the Old City. The Palestinians would get
control of the Christian and Muslim areas.
</P>
<P>
   The church leaders said the Armenians are Christians and should
not be divided from the other Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also asked for ``international guarantees'' that
Christians will have open access to Christian sites. It also asked
that Christians be allowed to continue to develop their
communities, which have shrunk dramatically in proportion to the
Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Wadie Abunassar, spokesman for the authors of the letter, said
they did not intend to meddle in politics or favor either side in
the negotiations but to protect Christian interests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a major Protestant group has taken a pro-Israel
stand. The International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem has for
more than a year circulated a petition commending Israeli control
of holy sites in Jerusalem and throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The ICEJ organizes trips and activities in Israel primarily for
evangelical churches around the world and has consistently sided
with Israel in its bid to hold onto occupied areas.

   JERUSALEM _ He is a Christian living near the place where Jesus
was crucified, but Palestinian Jack Mardin still feels like some
people do not recognize his place here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think there are Jews and Muslims and there are no
Christians here,'' said the 25-year-old Mardin (pronounced,
Mar-DEEN''). ``The Holy Sepulcher is our church. Our patriarchs are
here. We have lots of churches.''
</P>
<P>
   His patriarchs may feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   This week, local leaders of the three major local Christian
denominations wrote a letter to U.S., Israeli and Palestinian
leaders asking for a place at the Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust you will not forget or overlook our age-long presence
here,'' stated the letter from the patriarchs of the Greek
Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Armenian Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks that Christian communities not be divided and
for guarantees that holy sites will remain open to all the faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Jerusalem, ruled by Israel but claimed in part by
the Palestinians, is said to be a major sticking point in the
10-day-old summit talks at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are asking for sovereignty primarily over the parts
of Jerusalem that they populate, which were captured by Israel in
the 1967 war. Israelis say that Jerusalem has been the center of
Judaism for 3,000 years and cannot be shared.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has been painted in largely terms of Muslims vs.
Jews. Focus is on who will rule over the Western Wall, sacred to
Jews, and the Haram esh-Sharif complex, sacred to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for world opinion, Israeli leaders repeatedly
state that Jerusalem is not as important for Muslims as it is for
Jews. It is, they say, the ``heart of Judaism.'' Christians are
rarely.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Jerusalem's place in Christianity, Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert said recently, ``It is a lung for Moslems and a lung
for Christians and a heart for Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerusalem is the site of Jesus' crucifixion and
resurrection. The place where he prayed in Gethsemane and where his
mother, Mary, lived. It is also home to about 10,000 Christians.
Most of them are Palestinians and some are Armenian.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's Christian sites are also the destination of hundreds
of thousands of Christian pilgrims from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, pilgrims lined up in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
the cavernous collection of chapels where Catholics and Orthodox
Christians believe Jesus was crucified.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Swehla, a 22-year-old pilgrim from Modesto, Calif., said he
was keeping track of the Camp David talks but does not expect them
to affect the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will really make a difference,'' he said,
standing in the line to see Jesus' tomb. ``No one will do anything
to it. It's too historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few expect any major changes in the holy sites soon.
Modern history has seen generally open access under Israel. The
Palestinian Authority built Christian confidence by sinking
millions of aid dollars into improving conditions around the
birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem, under their control.
</P>
<P>
   But, before the modern age, the Holy Land saw churches,
synagogues and mosques ransacked as rulers of the different
religions held sway. Even the Church of the Holy Sepulcher has been
destroyed more than once since it was first built in the Fourth
Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has shown that whoever has the political power tends
to favor his own,'' said Pietro Sambi, the Vatican representative
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the patriarchs was similar to other
pronouncements that Christian leaders have made during
negotiations, said Palestinian analyst Mahdi Abdul-Hadi.
</P>
<P>
   It stated that they oppose a proposal reportedly being discussed
at Camp David in which Israel would retain control of the Jewish
and Armenian areas in the Old City. The Palestinians would get
control of the Christian and Muslim areas.
</P>
<P>
   The church leaders said the Armenians are Christians and should
not be divided from the other Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also asked for ``international guarantees'' that
Christians will have open access to Christian sites. It also asked
that Christians be allowed to continue to develop their
communities, which have shrunk dramatically in proportion to the
Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Wadie Abunassar, spokesman for the authors of the letter, said
they did not intend to meddle in politics or favor either side in
the negotiations but to protect Christian interests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a major Protestant group has taken a pro-Israel
stand. The International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem has for
more than a year circulated a petition commending Israeli control
of holy sites in Jerusalem and throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The ICEJ organizes trips and activities in Israel primarily for
evangelical churches around the world and has consistently sided
with Israel in its bid to hold onto occupied areas.

   Apple's New Computer Goes Back to Square One
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Jobs officially unveiled the new PowerMac G4
Cube at Mac World Expo on Wednesday. But even before his speech,
Mac fans, never shy in their ardor, couldn't contain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube _ the nickname that enthusiasts immediately gave the
new computer _is a 450-megahertz computer encased in an 8-inch
cube. About one-quarter the size of the G4 computer that is
currently on the market, the Cube sits in a clear plastic display
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow'' was the exclamation of choice among Mac fans at the
Javits center in New York, as people pushed and shoved one another
to grab for posters that had been placed, unannounced, in an
unmarked corner of the Apple booth. They had been intended for
distribution after the keynote address by Jobs, Apple's chief
executive. But before he finished, no posters were left.
</P>
<P>
   The G4 Cube has 64 megabytes of memory, ports for USB and
FireWire connections and a DVD player that opens through a slot on
the top. It comes with a keyboard, speakers and an optical mouse,
but it doesn't include one part that is typically required in
computers of that speed: a fan. Engineers have designed the machine
with an air channel in the middle so the processors can be kept
cool without any fan noise.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube also comes with another feature: with a push of a
button, a handle pops up from the belly of the machine, enabling
users to pull it out of its plastic case and add or subtract parts
at will.
</P>
<P>
   It will go on sale in August for $1,799; a 500-megahertz version
will also be available, for $2,299, exclusively through the
company's Web site.

   Software Can Turn Notes Into Audio or Video Bookmarks
</P>
<P>
   Note takers, take note: Software is now available for those who
are tired of having to fast-forward through audio or video
recordings in hope of finding that one significant moment they
jotted down in their digital notepads.
</P>
<P>
   The software, called Souvenir, is designed for students,
reporters, lawyers, conference attendees and anyone else who takes
notes while recording interviews or lectures. The technology works
by issuing a time stamp each time a note is taken and using those
time stamps to create links between the jotted words and the
digital recording. When users review the notes later, they only
need to click on the words to pull up the corresponding video or
audio clip.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which is available for free downloading until this
fall at www.i-recall.com, requires that notes be taken on a digital
device like a personal computer or handheld organizer and that the
audio or visual recording must be digital, too.

<P>
   British Columbia Decides To Restrict Some Videogames
</P>
<P>
   A week after it restricted sales of the Soldier of Fortune
computer game to adults, the Canadian province of British Columbia
announced that it will review and rate all electronic games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about censorship here,'' said Andrew Petter,
the attorney general. ``The goal is to give parents better
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a complaint from a parent, the provincial director of
film classification, Mary-Louise McCausland, issued a decision on
July 11 classifying Soldier of Fortune as an ``adult motion
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The adult classification, similar to an X rating under film
industry guidelines in the United States, means that rentals or
sales of the game to anyone under 18 is prohibited. Stores that
want to carry the title must obtain a special license and stock it
separately from other games.
</P>
<P>
   In her decision, McCausland found the game's violence to be
realistic, brutal and ``exploitative.'' Activision, the game's
distributor, declined to comment on the rating.
</P>
<P>
   Like many computer games, Soldier of Fortune was voluntarily
rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, a U.S.-based,
industry-backed group. But Petter said that his government wants
its own ratings system that reflects ``made-in-B.C. values.'' He
also said that minors would still be able to purchase games like
Soldier of Fortune online. ``The goal is not to hermetically seal
the province of British Columbia.''

`WEST WING,' `SPRANOS' LEAD EMMY PACK IN NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ This time, Emmy mostly got it right.
</P>
<P>
   Kvetching by TV critics about oversights and howlingly bad
choices is a tradition almost as venerable as the Emmy Awards
themselves. But that proved hard _ though certainly not impossible
_ to do as the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences announced a
slate of nominations that generally separated wheat from chaff and
opened the door wider for newer shows.
</P>
<P>
   Gratifying choices abounded, along with, inevitably, a few
puzzling omissions. The two best-written dramas on television,
NBC's freshman ``The West Wing'' and HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' led
the pack with 18 nominations, rivaled in the dramatic category only
by the 10 nominations picked up by ABC's Boston-based ``The
Practice.'' Meanwhile, two increasingly formulaic dramas, ABC's
``NYPD Blue'' and Fox's ``The X-Files,'' deservedly did not make
the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the academy sensibly spurned Fox's ``Ally McBeal,''
which won for best comedy last year but has since gone downhill
with startling speed, and bestowed 11 nominations on ``Will &AMP;
Grace,'' whose head-snapping repartee made it perhaps the funniest
show on TV in its second season. Another audacious sophomore show,
HBO's ``Sex and the City,'' snagged nine nominations, which is sure
to encourage rival networks now churning out copycat versions.
</P>
<P>
   The only breakout new comedy of the 1999-2000 season, Fox's
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' inexplicably did not garner a nomination
as best comedy. However, in a heartening turn of events, skilled
stage, screen, and TV veteran Jane Kaczmarek was nominated as best
actress in a comedy for her role as Malcolm's fierce but loving
mom. ``It's very sweet, happening at this time in my life,'' the
40-something Kaczmarek said Thursday in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarek said, though, that she was disappointed the show
itself was not nominated _ ``Sometimes, they make comedies pay
their dues'' _ and that her husband, Bradley Whitford, was not
nominated for his portrayal of White House aide Josh Lyman in ``The
West Wing.'' Declared Kaczmarek with a laugh: ``How could they be
so smart to nominate me and so stupid not to nominate him?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the five ``West Wing'' cast members who did get nominated
for ``The West Wing'' was Richard Schiff, who wears a perpetual
poker face as chief of staff Toby Ziegler. In an interview in Los
Angeles Wednesday night, Schiff did crack a smile occasionally but
frowned as he worried that the show's strong ensemble cast might
``cancel each other out'' in the Emmy competition. ``Any award we
get is a compliment to the group,'' he insisted, and to creator
Aaron Sorkin, who he said ``tells wonderful stories'' while
offering ``optimistic, positive examples of what public servants
can bring to our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The day must have been tinged with bittersweet feelings for
writer-producer Sorkin. On the one hand, there was the triumphant
showing of ``The West Wing,'' a show that has exploded the myth
that politics and politicians cannot make for engrossing drama. On
the other hand, the academy was no kinder to Sorkin's brilliant
``Sports Night'' than Nielsen viewers were. The low-rated, recently
canceled ABC dramedy and its superb cast got stiffed in all the
main categories as ``Sports Night'' earned a mere handful of
nominations in technical categories.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-producer David E. Kelley (``Ally McBeal,'' ``The
Practice'') must have had similarly mixed feelings as he weighed
Emmy's snub of ``Ally'' against its embrace of ``The Practice,''
last year's winner for best drama.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy Awards will be announced on Sept. 10 in a ceremony to
be broadcast on ABC. Herewith, a few kudos, caveats, and general
observations about the nominations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone but not forgotten were the late Nancy Marchand, nominated
for her chilling mob matriarch, Livia, in ``The Sopranos,'' and
Michael J. Fox, nominated as best actor in a comedy for his role in
a show he has just left, ABC's ``Spin City.'' Gone and virtually
forgotten was NBC's canceled ``Freaks and Geeks,'' quite possibly
the best new show of last season _ not that anyone inhabiting
Nielsen households noticed. ``Freaks and Geeks'' got a meager two
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   _ The good news is that the entire cast of CBS's ``Everybody
Loves Raymond'' and NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace'' won nominations. The bad
news is that so did John Lithgow, for his relentless hamminess in
NBC's ``Third Rock from the Sun,'' despite his own eye-rolling
surprise at winning last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ HBO continues to build on the momentum generated by ``The
Sopranos,'' while the WB network, all the rage a year or two ago
with its teen-angst dramas, continues to fade. NBC got 97
nominations, HBO earned 86 (including 10 for ``RKO 281,'' its fine
film about the making of ``Citizen Kane''), followed by ABC with
64, CBS with 41, UPN with seven, and the WB with a lowly five. When
UPN gets more Emmy nominations than you, trouble has officially
arrived. And the academy continued to turn a cold shoulder to the
WB's best show, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' PBS, meanwhile, got
only 12 nominations (including one for ``New York,'' a Ric Burns
documentary coproduced by WGBH-TV in Boston), three fewer than last
year and only one ahead of the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   _ The academy showed a definite preference for movie stars when
it came to choosing nominees in the miniseries category. For
instance, while HBO's gritty and groundbreaking ``The Corner'' was
nominated for best miniseries, star Khandi Alexander was ignored in
favor of Sally Field, Holly Hunter, Judy Davis, Halle Berry, and
Gena Rowlands. Some of the male nominees in the category _ Jack
Lemmon, William H. Macy, Beau Bridges _ are best known for their
film work.

 &HT;    A TOUGH CHICAGO POL BEGINNING A TOUGH JOB AT GORE CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ A small mirrored disco ball twirls almost
unnoticed from the ceiling of Vice President Al Gore's campaign
headquarters, a whimsical touch seemingly out of place as his staff
begins the serious task of taking on George W. Bush in the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From the disco ball above the scores of newly arrived volunteers
and workers hangs a small sign: ``GRITS.'' It stands for ``Gore
Rocks In The South.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, though, it is a no-nonsense Chicago pol who is
rocking this part of the South these days: political fixer William
Daley, a son of the legendary Mayor Richard Daley, who officially
took over as chairman of the Gore presidential campaign this week.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's arrival, as much as the political calendar _ the
election is less than four months away _ has quickened the pace of
the campaign, giving it an edge and a focus that has been largely
missing since Gore dispatched challenger Bill Bradley in the
Democratic primaries last spring.
</P>
<P>
   And with national polls showing Gore in a virtual tie with Bush
after months of trailing the soon-to-be Republican nominee, the
campaign is fun again for the vice president's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the excitement again, and he is a big part of
it,'' campaign communications chief Mark Fabiani said of Daley
during a tour of the campaign headquarters this week.
</P>
<P>
   Daley agreed last month to leave his job as President Clinton's
commerce secretary to take over for Tony Coelho, who was forced to
resign as campaign chairman because of health problems. His first
full day on the job was Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But where Coelho was ``Tony'' to the headquarters staff, Daley,
known to his family and friends as ``Billy,'' is ``the Chairman.''
And where Coelho, a Californian, donned cowboy boots and jeans upon
arriving in Music City, Daley has yet to be seen in the
headquarters in anything other than a dark business suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my uniform,'' Daley chuckled during an interview this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Daley is not unlike the vice president himself who, no matter
how he tries to change his stripes, seems most comfortable in a
blue suit, white shirt and red tie.
</P>
<P>
   Daley understands that the South is a bit more laid back than
his home town of Chicago, at least in its style and manner. But he
also understands that there is nothing laid back about the politics
of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never lived in the South before, but I worked in Jimmy
Carter's campaign,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 51-year-old Daley has worked in every Democratic
presidential campaign since he accompanied his father to the 1960
convention in Los Angeles and met John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But for what he doesn't understand about the South, he turns to
Donna Brazile, the campaign manager and a native of Louisiana, who
learned grassroots presidential politics in the presidential
campaigns of Carter and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main goal here is winning the election (for Gore),'' he
added. ``I think I understand a little bit about politics, and you
win elections by pounding away and connecting with the American
people. I think that's what's beginning to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley's arrival in Nashville coincides with a more aggressive
campaign style from Gore, one in which he tries to skewer Bush with
his own record as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's takeover of the Gore campaign also coincides with new
national polls suggesting that the vice president has pulled even
with Bush after months of trailing the Texas governor, sometimes by
double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Daley dismisses the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, for months now, there's been a perception, at least in
Washington, that the campaign was going well,'' he said. ``But you
could get out of Washington and see that most Americans just
weren't paying that much attention to the presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is about to change, though, as both parties prepare for
the nominating conventions that will usher in the final phase of
the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Daley's time is being spent on Gore's vice presidential
selection, on convention preparations _ most notably negotiating
time slots for Bradley and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, on
Gore's post-convention trip down the Mississippi River, and the
three presidential debates scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
   The day-to-day task of ministering to the Democratic Party's
powerful constituency groups, such as organized labor and women,
falls to Brazile, just as it did when Coelho was chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna and I work well together,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley has also brought with him a core of assistants from
the Department of Commerce. And he has cleared the way for longtime
party operative Tad Devine to handle getting out the campaign's
basic ``prosperity and progress'' message.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile's office in the Gore headquarters sits next to Daley's.
But Brazile's outspokenness _ she once suggested that the
Republican Party uses former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin
Powell and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma as window dressing on racial
issues _ has occasionally gotten her in hot water. Consequently, it
is Daley who speaks for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm notable, not quotable,'' said Brazile.

 &HT;    Material makes teen romantic comedy better than average
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Either Billy Wilder is going to be very
flattered by the new teen romantic comedy ``Loser `` or he is going
to have great grounds for a plagiarism suit.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Amy Heckerling has brought fresh qualities to
teen films from ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High `` to ``Clueless,''
but you would never confuse her for darkly cynical satirist Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it dawns on us slowly that there is something awfully
familiar about her latest effort, the tale of a sweetly naive
Midwesterner named Paul (Jason Biggs, who romanced that pastry in
``American Pie'') who comes to New York for college and falls for
cash-strapped coed Dora (Mena Suvari, the sexual tease of
``American Beauty''), who is having an affair with their European
Lit professor.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul gets up the nerve to ask Dora to a concert, she
accepts, then stands him up, getting drunk and drugged at a party
held, unbeknownst to her, at Paul's place. He returns home, finds
her passed out, nurses her back to health, and they grow closer.
Gradually, she realizes what an unfeeling louse the professor is
and leaves him for Paul, who she sees is anything but a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Without crediting it, Heckerling has duplicated the plot of the
1960 Oscar winner ``The Apartment,'' substituting a contemporary
college milieu for the corporate world. Chances are most of the
movie's target teen audience will not know the original source or
care, but the alterations have been made quite cleverly. If
Heckerling is going to borrow from another movie, at least you have
to admire her taste in what she chooses to plunder. And it does
give adults something to focus on and retain their interest
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   As he heads off to the Big City, Paul gets fatherly advice from
Dan Ackroyd about being nice to everyone and looking them in the
eye. Wrong. He is taken advantage of from his first moments in New
York, as his three rotten roommates gang up on him instantly. Of
course, it doesn't help that he wears an ``Abuse-me-I-am-a-geek''
winter hat with ear flaps, as if he were a fugitive from the movie
``Fargo.'' Heckerling does tap into our college memories, when so
many of us felt like outcasts and losers. In the movies, however,
losers get to end up with the likes of Suvari.
</P>
<P>
   Dora is given quirks like subsisting on free packets of honey
and chugging thimbles of coffee whitener. She is a hopeless
romantic, blind enough not to see how she is being used by the
condescending prof (Greg Kinnear). Suvari is an endearing waif who
can hold onto our sympathies even after she loses honesty points by
demonstrating to Paul how to steal bread and sneak into Broadway
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their bonding process involves farm boy Paul showing
Dora how to cut a newborn kitten out of its placenta. Those with
queasy stomachs might want to stroll to the lobby at this point. As
romantic stars, Suvari and Biggs will never be confused for, say,
Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, but they generate sufficient chemistry to
fuel a vehicle like ``Loser.''
</P>
<P>
   True, interest does spike more whenever Heckerling brings in one
of her several cameo players. Don't blink or you might miss Andy
Dick as a prune-sucking bureaucrat, David Spade as a vindictive
video store clerk and Andrea Martin as a sour teacher. There is
probably a better movie to be made about the three of them.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a certain confidence to name your movie ``Loser,''
giving reviewers and headline writers such easy ammunition.
Heckerling has not made an unqualified winner, but she has crafted
a better-than-average summer night's entertainment. Of course, she
started with great material.

HIDDEN ELECTRONIC FENCES CAN KEEP DOGS FROM GOING ASTRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No amount of scolding, begging or foot-stomping will keep most
dogs home in their yards and out of the streets. So some frazzled
owners try to turn their neighborhood travelers into docile
homebodies with radio-controlled fences.
</P>
<P>
   These hidden fences consist of wire loops, buried an inch or two
below the surface, that emit radio signals when connected to
transmitters. Each dog wears a collar with a receiver; when the dog
gets too close to the wire, the collar emits a warning beep. If the
dog ignores the beep, the collar's two metal prongs give the dog a
mild shock, or a series of shocks if the dog persists.
</P>
<P>
   Debby and Ed Christian have two Old English sheepdogs, who are
so well trained by a hidden fence that they never leave the
Christians' yard in Acton, Mass. ``I could probably not even use
the collars anymore,'' Christian said, ``and the dogs would stay.
Even when another dog comes into the yard, my dogs won't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christians bought a version called Invisible Fence, made by
ISCO Enterprises. Their 8-year-old male, Fletcher, and 2-year-old
female, Phoebe, figured out the invisible barrier right away.
</P>
<P>
   When dogs are trained, flags are posted along the boundary wire
and the dogs are walked toward them on a leash. As the dogs
approach the flags, the dogs hear their collars beep. They are told
``no'' and are turned back toward the house. The final step in the
process, which is repeated over several days, is to deliver a mild
shock _ or correction, the euphemism favored by all the
hidden-fence manufacturers _ to reinforce the idea that the dog
should not cross the boundary line. Some dogs require only one
shock to learn to stay within the hidden fence, while others need
several.
</P>
<P>
   The shock hurts the dog, but it causes no lasting harm. The dogs
yelp, said Dr. Melissa Bain, a resident in clinical animal behavior
at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of
California at Davis, but the punishment has to be unpleasant to be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was petrified of what was going to happen when the shock was
given,'' Christian said. ``Fletcher jumped in the air and never
went near the boundary again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shock works,'' said Dr. Katherine Houpt, the director of
the Animal Behavioral Clinic for the College of Veterinary Medicine
at Cornell University, ``because it is simple aversion learning.
However, it works best with those dogs that are not highly
motivated to leave.'' Among the more difficult pupils she described
are male dogs that are not neutered, dogs that like to hunt or
chase cars and highly territorial dogs that are eager to cross
boundaries to scare off approaching strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Invisible Fence was invented in 1973 by Richard Peck, a
traveling salesman and animal lover who was saddened by the number
of dead dogs he saw on the side of the road. When his patents
expired in 1990, several other companies joined the industry. Some
of the products, like Invisible Fence and DogWatch, made by
DogWatch Inc., are sold by independent dealers who install the
product and usually train the dogs (and owners).
</P>
<P>
   While prices vary among dealers nationally, a system enclosing a
quarter-acre costs about $600 from Invisible Fences and about $900
from DogWatch. Even the most expensive hidden fence is considerably
cheaper than a chain-link or wood fence.
</P>
<P>
   Products that are installed by the customer, who has to bury the
wire around the perimeter of the property and do the dog training,
cost much less. Radio Systems Corp. of Concord, Tenn., for example,
sells a system, under the PetSafe brand, that will enclose 25 acres
for just under $200.
</P>
<P>
   Some dogs are willing to endure the punishment in order to leave
the property, especially when they learn that the shock is brief.
One such dog is Teddy, a 3-year-old Pomeranian-and-terrier mix
owned by Renee and Gregory Abel of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she sees a dog walking by the yard, she doesn't care about
the zap,'' Abel said. ``She'll run through it. We have to go get
her, take off the collar and carry her back over the wire.'' The
fence system works about 85 percent of the time, Abel said. ``I
feel bad about the shock, but we'd feel worse if she got lost or
hit by a car.''
</P>
<P>
   A hidden fence may protect a dog that is prone to roam, but it
does not necessarily protect strangers approaching the yard. The
dog knows where the boundary is, Houpt said, but a visitor like a
letter carrier may not know that there is a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Bain also says that is a drawback of hidden fences. If a
stranger steps into the yard, she said, the dog can become
aggressive because someone is in its territory. ``The aggression
can range from chasing them to biting them, depending on the dog,''
she said. ``We tell people with aggressive dogs to get a real
fence,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden-fence companies can tailor their fences to the needs and
quirks of individual dogs and owners. Most of the companies offer
collars with different shock levels, and the fences can also be
used to protect flowerbeds or pools. Invisible Fence has a
three-sided wire system for lakefront properties.
</P>
<P>
   For owners who would rather not shock their dogs, PetSafe has a
collar that emits a spray of citronella instead; most dogs do not
like the smell. PetSafe also offers a wireless product that keeps
the dog in a 90-foot radius around the transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   Some dogs can outsmart a hidden fence. They have figured out
that if they stand near the boundary wire to trigger the beep, the
battery will eventually run out and they can come and go without a
shock. In December, PetSafe will introduce a collar that is
designed to discourage escapees by progressively increasing the
intensity of the shock as the dog approaches the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs can sometimes be shocked even when they are on good
behavior because of interference by television signals. DogWatch
has switched from the standard AM radio signal to a more precise FM
signal for its transmitters to avoid that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter what the companies come up with, some dogs
won't stay put _ a squirrel or a cat across the street can become
just too enticing. ``It is always better to have the dog in the
house unless you can walk it on a leash,'' Houpt said. ``Yes, it's
true a dog needs exercise, but probably so does its owners.''

 &HT;    Spooky Hitchcock homage `Lies Beneath' unravels at the end
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Gus Van Sant tried his hand at it. Brian De
Palma has practically built a career on it. So why shouldn't Robert
Zemeckis take a crack at making a thriller in the style of Alfred
Hitchcock?
</P>
<P>
   No one understood the psychology and mechanics of suspense quite
like Hitchcock, yet for much of ``What Lies Beneath `` _ a creepy
little yarn of guilt, gullibility and ghosts _ the Oscar-winning
director of ``Forrest Gump'' concocts a reasonable facsimile of the
British master's handiwork. Then, when stuck for a sufficiently
violent wrap-up to appease today's more bloodthirsty moviegoers,
Zemeckis settles for the pumped-up improbabilities of ``Fatal
Attraction `` crossed with the ``Cape Fear'' remake.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. The first three-quarters of this movie are so
entertaining, if hardly original, that what lies afterward is a
genuine disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the overly explicit trailers for ``What Lies
Beneath,'' you know that Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer, an
ideal blond Hitchcock heroine) will believe she is seeing ghosts,
specifically the spirit of one of her genetics professor husband
Norman's (Harrison Ford) former students. But first, as an homage
to ``Rear Window,'' Claire becomes obsessively convinced that their
new next-door neighbor on a picturesque Vermont lake has killed his
wife. This is merely a subplot, but it gets us doubting Claire and
questioning our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Claire's daughter has just gone off to college and her
post-parting funk leads her to pour out her feelings and suspicions
to a psychiatrist. She could be heading for a mental breakdown, but
what explains the way her front door keeps opening by itself, the
frequent power outages, the water that refills in her bathtub and
the reflection of a face in that water?
</P>
<P>
   First-time screenwriter Clark Gregg will eventually let him
down, but Zemeckis knows how to build an air of creepiness that
gets an audience delighting in the dread of what may pop out at
them. Even in the most static of scenes, he keeps his camera on the
prowl, circling around, exploring the background in a way that
suggests something or someone lurks beyond the picture frame. It's
cheap suspense, but enormously effective.
</P>
<P>
   Claire may not have seen ``The Sixth Sense,'' but she has seen
detective movies, so when she learns _ awfully conveniently _ that
her ghost is a still-missing, presumably dead female student, she
launches her own investigation. She visits the girl's mother,
swipes a lock of the girl's hair and conducts a seance, complete
with Ouija board. The girl is roused from the dead to visit Claire,
inhabit her body and try to settle a score with Norman.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, it seems that no hackneyed plot device is
beneath ``What Lies Beneath.'' Claire finds a box of incriminating
evidence submerged just off her dock, other clues leap out at her
in a nearby village, and she is nearly drowned in her bathtub. She
then has to make a mad dash from a killer in her home and race away
in her truck, only to then stumble upon the body of the dead
student. You may find it hard to decide whether to scream or
giggle.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and Pfeiffer remain enjoyable to watch, even as the
movie careens out of control. This movie is beneath each of them,
but it is preferable to their previous efforts _ ``Random Hearts''
and ``The Story of Us.'' Harrison is his usual jut-jawed, scowling
screen persona, while Pfeiffer gets more interesting acting
opportunities, as paranoid Claire and later as the seductive
student who possesses her.
</P>
<P>
   Movie buffs can spend their time spotting the references to
earlier thrillers. Suffice it to say that ``What Lies Beneath''
will probably not do for bathtubs what ``Psycho'' did for showers.

 &HT;    This crudely animated cartoon is an exercise in exploitation
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You would have thought one Pokemon movie
would be enough punishment for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. The forces behind this fad in all its forms _
video game, TV series and trading cards _ have made a sequel to
last year's debut Pokemon flick. It's as if they're trying to cash
in before Pokemon becomes another relic to add to the trash heap of
kiddie culture. Remember how hot those Beanie Babies once were?
</P>
<P>
   So here we have ``Pokemon the Movie 2000.'' In a way, this kind
of picture is review-proof. Children will want to see it regardless
of what their elders say _ and they'll stick with it even as Mom
and Dad snore into their popcorn. (My advice: Get an extra-large
Coke _ you'll need the caffeine.) But in a summer that's given us
such a brilliant kid-friendly picture as ``Chicken Run,'' you have
to ask: Why settle for less?
</P>
<P>
   And this is about as little entertainment as you can expect from
a children's flick, as exemplified by the crude animation.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is the usual good-vs.-evil shebang. Meet Jirarudan,
the bad guy: He collects rare Pokemon _ miniature monsters of
varying sizes, shapes and characters. His ultimate goal is to
capture Lugia, a mysterious Pokemon who lives in the sea and serves
as a sort of high-powered water-district manager, controlling the
flow of the currents. To get to Lugia, Jirarudan must first bag
three other, birdlike Pokemon, who represent the forces of fire,
lightning and ice. But the good guys stand in his way, namely young
Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum and his sidekick, Pikachu. Expect lots
of raging battles over sea and land.
</P>
<P>
   Does it make any sense? Not to me; but then again, I'm not a
corporate exec looking to sell kids more Pokemon trading cards.
That, of course, is the real goal.

FALUN GONG MEMBERS CONTINUE PROTESTS ONE YEAR AFTER GROUP WAS
BANNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The police and Falun Gong followers played a grim game
in Tiananmen Square Thursday, with lean young cadets dashing across
the vast open space to snatch down ochre banners briefly unfurled
by middle-aged members of the banned spiritual discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of the group's followers have been
taken into custody in the past few days as the protests increase to
mark the first anniversary of the government's crackdown on the
spiritual movement that swept the country in the late 1990s,
gathering millions of adherents. The arrests and a pervasive
anti-Falun Gong propaganda campaign may have shrunk the group's
numbers, but also hardened the will of those followers who remain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, exhortations by Falun Gong's exiled leader, Li
Hongzhi, have become increasingly urgent in recent weeks, praising
followers who ``defend the practice'' and warning destruction for
those ``evil beings'' who stand in its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wicked and evil will soon be eliminated, the vile ones in
the human world will receive due retribution, and sins will no
longer be allowed to continue,'' he wrote in a message recently
posted on the group's official Web site. ``Disciples are waiting to
reach consummation, and I can wait no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Li founded Falun Gong in the early 1990s, developing a series of
yoga-like exercises based on the Chinese practice of qigong, the
discipline of breathing control and meditation intended to channel
the body's qi, or vital life force, to various ends.
</P>
<P>
   His message of personal salvation from a morally degenerating
world struck a chord with millions of Chinese who were
disillusioned with the spiritual vacuum created by the collapse of
the country's communist ideology and rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese government grew increasingly uneasy with Li's
growing popularity, and in early 1998 he left under pressure to
live in the United States. He owns a home in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   China began arresting adherents of the sect a year ago, and it
is still at it. Despite well-publicized prison terms of up to 18
years for the most active followers and reports of torture and
death among believers who have been detained, Falun Gong adherents
continue to arrive at Tiananmen Square, China's symbolic center and
most public space, to bear fleeting witness to their faith.
</P>
<P>
   The protests appear futile amid the crowds of tourists from
across China that fill the square each day. So huge is the square
that the small bands of protesters, usually only a handful in
number, attract little attention in the few seconds that it takes
for the plainclothes police spread among the crowds to subdue them.
The protesters rarely manage to raise a banner long enough for
anyone to read one, and they are quickly whisked away in the
blue-and-white police vans that cruise around the square for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Because China's state-run media rarely mention the protests, few
Chinese are even aware that they are happening.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What was that?'' asked a woman, after a dozen young policemen
dragged down a yellow banner and bundled several Falun Gong
followers into a van that arrived within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some troublemaker,'' replied a man beside her.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic scuffles, occasionally over elderly men or women
sitting in the lotus position and raising their arms in the opening
gesture of Falun Gong's meditative exercises, gave a bizarre edge
Thursday to the square's otherwise festive atmosphere. Tour groups
marched around behind guides bearing pennants and children flew
colorful kites. Occasionally, bystanders gathered to watch dumbly
as the police pummeled a resistant protester. At one point,
uniformed police officers could be seen punching a man who was in
one of their vans.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong activists abroad have grown increasingly
sophisticated in their efforts to reach people inside China and
keep the movement alive.
</P>
<P>
   Its members have established an expanding network of Internet
sites that occasionally circumvent China's efforts to block access.
And the group has even begun daily Chinese-language broadcasts into
China, though the broadcasts were jammed soon after they began this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The group's message has taken on an increasingly apocalyptic
cast as China's effort to exterminate the movement grinds down its
numbers. Earlier this week, a message on Falun Gong's main web site
reported that Li has been locked for nine months in a battle with
evil forces that have damaged his body and turned his hair gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fellow cultivators, let us strive forward diligently and
courageously,'' the message said. ``Let us cherish the repeated
opportunities that Master, through tremendous sacrifice, has
created for us to advance towards Consummation!''
</P>
<P>
   Li's writings do not elucidate the meaning of ``consummation,''
but the message suggested that it refers to a transcendent event of
the sort promised by many religions, old and new. ``That humankind
has made it to the year 2000 is not to give humankind prosperity,
and even less is it to allow humankind to continue creating karma
for their own selfish interests,'' the message said.
</P>
<P>
   It is that sort of talk that most worries Beijing's leaders.
China has a history of milenarian movements that have led to tens
of millions of deaths and marked the end to some dynastic
governments. Invisible as the Falun Gong protests are to most
Chinese, they represent the most coordinated and sustained
challenge to Communist Party rule since the pro-democracy movement
of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cult will not voluntarily step down from the historical
stage,'' said an editorial in Thursday's People's Daily, the
party's official mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The fight against Falun Gong, it said, will be a ``long-lasting,
complicated and acute struggle.''

   Unfamiliar faiths can be easier to accept when expressed in
foreign tongues. The chant-based sacred music of Tibet has helped
stimulate American interest in both that country's religion and in
its struggle against Chinese dominance.

<P>
   New albums by the expatriates Yungchen Lamo and Lama Gyurme ,
communicate Tibetan wisdom _ and defiance _ within soothing New Age
electronica.
</P>
<P>
   Yungchen Lhamo's music is political as well as spiritual. On
``Coming Home,'' she spans artistic borders, aided by the renowned
producer Hector Zazou. At times she sounds like Sarah McLachlan or
a Hong Kong pop star. Zazou's settings for her high, melancholy
voice incorporate electric guitar, violin, cello and a sample of a
Tuvan throat singer. Yet whether singing in English or wordlessly
shouting, Lhamo keeps her focus on the essentially Tibetan themes
of compassion and liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Lama Gyurme is a monk, and on his second collaboration with the
French pianist Jean-Philippe Rykiel, he focuses on Vajra style
devotional chanting. Rykiel surrounds Gyurme's appealingly homely
voice with organ, violin and keyboards, creating a hymnlike tone.
Less overtly political than Lhamo, Gyurme still eloquently argues
for the preservation of Tibet, in a form flexible enough to appeal
to the West.

<P>
   Republicans had a tough time last year selling their tax-cut
package: The public didn't seem interested, Democrats scored points
deriding it as welfare for the rich and, at nearly $800 billion
over 10 years, even some party regulars worried that it sucked up
too much of the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, Republicans have easily pushed two
major tax cut bills through the House and the Senate and even
managed to convince a few Democrats to come along for the ride.
With their presidential convention just 10 days away, the GOP
leadership is rushing along another tax-relief measure, all but
daring President Clinton to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans owe their newfound success to good timing and
political strategy, according to analysts and lawmakers. Tax cuts
are always popular on Capitol Hill during an election year, and
rosy federal budget projections have made tax cuts especially hard
to resist. Meanwhile, the Republican leadership decision to
dismantle last year's mega-package and instead offer tax cuts in
smaller, targeted bills has made tax relief this year even more
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, nine Senate Democrats voted for the Republican-backed
estate and gift tax repeal and on Tuesday eight voted with the GOP
to partially eliminate a tax on married couples. Both proposals
were elements in the GOP package last year that was savaged by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all has to do with packaging,'' said Marshall Wittman of
the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``Last year, the Republicans
tried to sell a huge, eye-glazing package. Now they've broken it
down into items everyone can identify with: death and marriage.
It's put it in comprehensible terms to the average voter.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is credited with
repackaging the Republicans' $792 billion, catch-all tax cut. The
targeted bills have allowed Republicans to push big-ticket tax
relief without appearing fiscally irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the GOP last year were openly uncomfortable with their
own party's mega-tax-cut package, fearing that it would undermine
efforts to pay down the debt. This year's tax cuts aren't cheap:
The marriage penalty relief would cost $248 billion over the next
10 years and the estate tax repeal would cost $105 billion through
2010 and $750 billion in the decade after that. The bite-sized
portions, however, appear easier to swallow, and growing budget
surplus projections make them go down even more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the
non-Social Security budget surplus will reach $100 billion in 2001,
three times larger than earlier projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts in the face of large budget surpluses have a
presumption in their favor,'' said Henry Aaron, a Brookings
Institute economic analyst. ``With a bigger budget surplus, it's
easier to find things to spend it on.''
</P>
<P>
   The piecemeal approach has forced Democrats to risk going on
record as opposing specific tax-relief measures popular with
voters. While polls showed last year that voters had no appetite
for a massive tax cut, individual items -- especially the marriage
penalty relief -- are very popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Democrat in a marginal (political) situation, especially
in a conservative region, has to be very careful when it comes to
voting against a repeal of taxes on death and marriage,'' said
Wittman of the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a vote against the tax cuts could easily be turned
into 30-second attack ads during a campaign featuring ``a wedding
ceremony or the grim reaper putting a tax on you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stuff people can relate to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly on the defensive, Democrats are feeling the pressure.
Earlier this week Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers held an
unusual conference call with reporters to attack the Republican
bills as giveaways to the rich. He said that when fully phased in,
the measures would provide a tax break to the wealthiest 1 percent
of the population 84 times larger than for the average family.
</P>
<P>
   From the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart charged that
the Republicans are less interested in tax relief than in scoring
political points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made it very clear that they want to get bills done,
timed to their convention, so they'll have something to talk about
at their convention,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has vowed to veto both bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even more tax-relief is on the table. On Wednesday, the House
Ways and Means Committee passed a bill designed to repeal a tax on
Social Security benefits for couples making more than $44,000 a
year. The bill would effectively roll back a 1993 Clinton
administration policy that taxed 85 percent of those benefits as a
means of shoring up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders complained that, once again, the Republicans
are trying to give relief to the best-off taxpayers at the expense
of safety-net social programs. They also said that at $44 billion
over five years, the proposed tax cut is sizable.
</P>
<P>
   But already Republicans are sharpening their rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a flawed concept that a Social Security check from the
government arrive with a bill from the IRS attached,'' Rep. J.C.
Watts, R-Okla., said about the tax.
</P>
<P>
   With healthy surpluses and congressional elections approaching,
the Social Security tax cut may be another one that Democrats will
find hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to be taken up on the House floor next
week.

&HT;     FEINSTEIN AND BOXER TO CO-CHAIR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer announced
Thursday they will wield gavels during the 2000 Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles next month as the first two women
co-chairs of a national political convention.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Boxer, both California Democrats, will make
opening remarks at the convention, which begins Aug. 14th and
preside over votes and official business from the dais.
</P>
<P>
   The two women previously chaired Democratic conventions as
single chairpersons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Democrats chose Texas Gov. Ann Richards to chair their
New York convention and in 1984, Gov. Martha Layne Collins of
Kentucky was selected as the chair of the convention held in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the convention would shine a spotlight on the
fact that California _ the largest state in the country with 34
million people _ has elected two women senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows the openness of the party to women,'' Feinstein
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer recalled watching Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., on the
dais at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York when
she nominated Al Gore as vice president. At the time Mikulski was
the only Democratic woman senator who hadn't been appointed to fill
a position.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate now has nine women: Feinstein, Boxer, Mikulski and
Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, Patty Murray, D-Wash, and Sens. Olympia Snowe
and Susan Collins, both Maine Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Feinstein were both running for Senate seats in 1992
and both spoke at the convention that year. ``It was an amazing
experience,'' Boxer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein won her election that year to serve out the remaining
two years of Pete Wilson's term when he resigned his Senate seat to
become governor. Boxer also won her election, succeeding the
retiring Alan Cranston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've made history together as the first women co-chairs
of the convention, so this is a wonderful moment,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee also announced Thursday that
California Gov. Gray Davis will serve as the convention's honorary
chair.

BACKSTAGE DRAMA AND BOLSHOI POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sheer dance power is what the Bolshoi Ballet has
brought back to New York. There was no better showcase than its
exciting second program of the season, which introduced a phalanx
and variety of dancers on a mixed bill that ranged from Marius
Petipa to George Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of ``Symphony in C,'' the first Balanchine work
ever danced here by the company from Moscow, had been preceded by
backstage drama. The initial movement of the 1948 Balanchine-Bizet
classic was led on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater by
Anastasia Goriacheva, who turned 19 on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet until Tuesday, she had never even rehearsed the role.
Nonetheless, when Svetlana Lunkina, the company's rising young
star, injured herself, Goriacheva was plucked out of the corps to
replace her and put into nonstop rehearsal mode.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the depth of the Bolshoi's youngest ranks
that Goriacheva could sail so smoothly through the lively first
movement with such charm, confidence and polish and also keep up in
the unison finale with three, mostly senior, ballerinas. ``Symphony
in C,'' which closed the program, brought the audience to its feet
in an ovation so strong and prolonged that it seemed to catch the
dancers by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   It was a capital idea for Lincoln Center Festival 2000 to offer
the equivalent of what the Bolshoi Ballet used to call a concert
program _ mainly excerpts with a full ballet (``Symphony in C'')
thrown in. The major excerpt was the Kingdom of the Shades scene
from Petipa's ``Bayadere,'' with a juicy, disciplined corps framing
the stunning grand style of Galina Stepanenko, perfect in her form
and musicality, and Nikolai Tsiskaridze, an extraordinary dancer
both wayward in his charisma and brilliant in his virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   The program opened shrewdly with the blast of male bravura once
synonymous with the Bolshoi. In this case, it was the ``Appian
Way'' scene from Yuri Grigorovich's 1968 ``Spartacus,'' in which
the Thracian slave of the title prepares for battle against the
Romans.
</P>
<P>
   Drama and brawn revved up the audience, paving the way for Nina
Ananiashvili and her elegant new partner Andrei Uvarov, in the
``Don Quixote Grand Pas,'' the Bolshoi staple that backs up the
familiar pas de deux with a small female ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   In this limited panorama of the company as a whole, the surprise
is the stylish new form of the men, from corps to principals. They
move easily from classical precision to the expressive and athletic
stamina of the ``Spartacus'' excerpt.
</P>
<P>
   The women are more unpredictable. On one hand there is Maria
Alexandrova, the company's new golden girl. She dances big in the
Bolshoi style and she and Tsiskaridze, in the third movement of
``Symphony in C,'' made the Balanchine ballet breathe with the
spirit and energy it deserved. The stage was too small for their
leaps and their dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is occasional disdain for niceties of
form. For every supple arched back in a perfect line of women as
the ghosts or shades in ``La Bayadere,'' there are soloists whose
feet are not neat or in the right position.
</P>
<P>
   Ananiashvili (partnered by Uvarov), could get away with her
blurred passes in ``Don Quixote'' because she communicates
something larger: the exhilaration and joy of dancing.
</P>
<P>
   In its approach to ``Symphony in C,'' the company did what it
was taught: It danced a version that differed in some respects from
the current staging at New York City Ballet, Balanchine's own
company. The differences are in the group formations and especially
in the second movement where the ballerina turns her back to the
audience several times. This is the version preferred by John
Taras, Balanchine's longtime associate. He owns the rights to the
ballet and staged it in Moscow with Patricia Neary. Since they were
also credited with the Kirov Ballet's staging last year, one can
wonder why the two ballets look so different.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it has to do with the Bolshoi's style. Ananiashvili, a
guest in 1988 with City Ballet, still prefers to snap into
positions rather than flow into them in the second movement, in
which she is basically miscast.
</P>
<P>
   Uvarov was a fine and forceful partner, as was Sergei Filin in
the first movement, where Goriacheva did wonders with music that
sagged under Andrei Sotnikov's baton. The orchestra comes from the
New York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   It took some time for both the dancing and the music to sing.
But when Stepanenko and Dmitri Belogolovtsev, with his ultrahigh
spring, led the fourth movement, the female corps was ready to shed
its square-cut phrasing and mechanical precision. Energy finally
poured forth from all for a dazzling finale.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanenko is a solid ballerina who promises little refinement
and yet surprises with her gift to make form exquisite and
expressive. Her dancing as Nikiya in ``La Bayadere'' was impressive
for its technical perfection, subtle in its musical climaxes.
Repeatedly, Tsiskaridze as her partner left her to balance in
arabesque. Repeatedly, she came softly down from toe and followed
him.
</P>
<P>
   In his solo and coda, Tsiskaridze flew around the stage in
arrow-sharp leaps, a god of the wind with whirlwind grace. He
carried off the virtuosic double assemble turns in the air with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   As for the excerpt from ``Spartacus,'' it is easy to see why
Grigorovich's shrewd blend of cinematic dissolves and mass
groupings retains its power. Belogolovtsev may be slim and not in
the heroic mold of the past. But there is no question that every
tattered shepherd on stage, dancing his heart out, will rally to
this Spartacus.
</P>
<P>
   He triumphs through the sheer conviction of his performance.

 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore took on George W. Bush on his home ground today, in San
Antonio, accusing him of cutting taxes for special interests
instead of helping families that lack health care. Texas, he said,
``should be a state where it's just as easy to raise a child as it
is to set up an oil rig.'' Gore paid a glancing tribute to Bush's
political strengths at home and his ``warm and engaging
personality.'' But then he said pointedly that the presidency ``is
more than just a popularity contest.'' Gore's discussion with
invited guests took place at the Seven Oaks Resort and Conference
Center, a venue not exactly in keeping with the message but the
only one campaign aides said they could find on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST RULE: DO NO HARM
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says he is getting close to a decision on his
running mate and suggests one political priority: ``You want
somebody who's not going to hurt you.'' Twelve days before the
opening of the national convention, Bush told reporters at an
impromptu news conference in Austin: ``I will make up my mind
soon.'' A number of Republicans are urging him to sit on his lead
in polls and make a ``safe'' pick, giving greater weight to a
candidate's potential to do harm than his prospects for bolstering
the ticket. Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and even Dick Cheney _ head
of Bush's search _ reportedly are the latest favorites of the
take-no-chances crowd.
</P>
<P>
   IF CLINTON WERE DOING THE PICKING
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been steering clear of the vice
presidental selection process, but the New York Times reports that
he has told friends and associates that two of his favorite choices
for Al Gore's running mate are ex- Majority Leader George Mitchell
of Maine and Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, both of whom he considered
picking eight years ago. Gore himself, speaking in Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, said he wants a vice president who would be much like himself
_ someone who has helped ``carry the heavy load that sometimes is
pretty crushing for a president.''
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY SET FOR PRIME TIME
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the only Democratic rival to Al Gore during the
primary season, will play a major role at the Democratic convention
with a 15-to-20 minute speech during prime time on the second
night, Aug. 15. The ex-New Jersey senator campaigned with Gore for
the first time last Thursday, endorsing him in Green Bay, Wis., and
is slated to campaign for Democrats at all levels this fall.
</P>
<P>
   THEY CAN WAIT FOR THE RERUNS
</P>
<P>
   About four in 10 Americans say they have made no plans to watch
any of the national political conventions, says a poll on public
interest in the presidential elections. That's about double the
percentage who made that claim four years ago. In the poll from the
Vanishing Voter project, 43 percent said they don't plan to watch
the upcoming GOP convention, and almost that many, 38 percent, said
they have no plans to watch the Democratic convention in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BEAR CHECKS
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) argued today for the
abolition of all limits on campaign contributions, and urged
Republicans tommittee chairman. McCain reported raising $924,606
through June 30. He's already contributed $11,000 to Republican
congressional candidates, and spent about half the money raised on
travel, staff and events that have helped him maintain his
visibility on the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   AND THAT'S ALL SHE WANTS TO SAY
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton said she was done talking about allegations that
she used an obscenity-laced, anti-Semitic slur during a heated
discussion with a campaign aide to Bill Clinton in Arkansas 26
years ago. ``I've said all I'm going to say about this. It wasn't
true, it didn't happen and I'm not going to allow it to distract
from the real issues of this campaign,'' she told a news conference
in Albany, N.Y., where she picked up the Senate endorsement of the
2.5 million-member state AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   WOULD YOU SAY HE DOESN'T LIKE HER?
</P>
<P>
   The head of the New York state Republican Party accused Hillary
Clinton of being ``an angry woman'' driven by ``blind political
ambition'' and said voters should reject her bid for the Senate in
part because ``she didn't send Chelsea to school here.'' In a copy
of a fund-raising letter obtained today by The Associated Press,
William Powers said the first lady has ``been at the front and
center of every Clinton-Gore scandal, and this has been the most
seedy, shameless and corrupt administration in American history.''
It was the second harsh letter from Powers to surface in a week. In
the first, he called Clinton ``cold-blooded and hotheaded'' and
denounced her as a ``shrill and scheming person.''
</P>
<P>
   TALK IS GOOD _ MONEY'S BETTER
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Hillary Clinton should be running for senator of
Hollywood. She has a star-studded donor list, including Robert De
Niro, Robin Williams, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. She's also
popular with small-screen performers, particularly two talk show
hosts. The New York Post reports that nice talker Rosie O'Donnell
has coughed up $10,000 for Clinton's various campaign funds, with
trashy talker Jerry Springer matching that amount dollar for
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE 50 STATES, REMEMBER?
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party's Ralph Nader thinks Al Gore and George W. Bush
should pay a call to each and every state of the union. ``What
about dropping the poll-driven travel schedule at least on the
first round of campaigning and treat all citizens of the United
States equally by visiting all the states?'' Nader wrote in a
letter to Gore and Bush. He had some specific spots in mind, too:
For Bush, Alaska and the site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill; for
Gore, Hawaii, to reassure island citizens that President Clinton's
recent executive order affecting the coral reefs is more than just
talk.
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK'S FUND-RAISING CHARGES
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary-designate Norman Mineta received several
contributions in 1992 arranged by a convicted Democratic
fund-raiser who later acknowledged she reimbursed the donors,
according to congressional investigators' documents. The
investigators, however, said there's no evidence Mineta knew of the
scheme by fund-raiser Nora Lum to funnel $4,250 to his House
campaign through straw donors. Only $2,250 of the donations
actually reached Mineta's campaign treasury, according to Federal
Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   THIS TIME AROUND, THEY'LL AT LEAST TALK
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, who chairs the Republican
Platform Committee, assured GOP pro-choice advocates that their
views will get a full airing next week when the committee meets
before the party's national convention begins. After a closed-door
meeting that Thompson held with several pro-choice groups, Susan
Cullman, co-chair of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, said,
``What was newsworthy to us is that we continue to have a dialogue.
... In 1996 and 1992, no one would return our calls. So this is a
plus.''
</P>
<P>
   BRING ON THE AUDITORS
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party said it will double-check the names of
thousands of people who received ballots in the party's mail-in
primary. Party leaders are investigating whether front-runner Pat
Buchanan broke rules by having ballots sent to supporters who
didn't ask for them, and they have threatened to disqualify him if
he doesn't comply with the audit. Buchanan's sole challenger for
the Reform nomination, physicist John Hagelin, had previously
offered to audit the lists of more than 500,000 names himself, but
party leaders decided to hire an outside accounting firm. The
party's convention is in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   NOD GOES TO FIRST AMENDMENT
</P>
<P>
   Activists who have set their sights on the Democratic convention
scored a victory when a federal judge said Los Angeles officials
must give protesters better access to the convention site. U.S.
District Judge Gary Feess agreed with the American Civil Liberties
Union, which sued the city and police department. The suit claimed
a wide buffer zone officials planned to establish around the
convention site _ the downtown Staples Center _ would violate
protesters' constitutional rights by keeping them too far from
delegates. ``When it's convenience versus the First Amendment,
convenience loses every time,'' Feess said.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR BACKS OFF PROTESTS
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders have closed ranks around Al Gore and distanced
themselves from protests planned for the Democratic convention,
suggesting that the streets will be far less mobbed than some had
feared or hoped. Demonstrations against global trade policies in
Seattle last year included thousands of union members who, along
with environmentalists and students, had a clear objective to shut
down the World Trade Organization summit and force the WTO to
consider labor and environmental standards when setting new trade
roles.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO KEEP THINGS UNDER WRAPS
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia police are making final arrangements this week for
the Republican convention, including opening overflow prison cells
in the suburbs or at the shuttered site of a 1970 prison riot for
the hundreds of demonstrators who could be arrested. Police
officials scheduled two meetings with protest groups to try to
smooth concerns over violence and vandalism during demonstrations.
As many as 20,000 protesters are expected to be in town.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT MATTERS MOST
</P>
<P>
   What do voters pine for in their presidential candidate? A
Princeton Survey found that 39 percent said the candidate's
``positions on the issues'' ranks first, followed by character,
experience, intelligence, party affiliation, and choice of vice
president. But what issues matter? The economy gets top billing
from 21 percent of those surveyed, followed by health care,
education, Social Security, taxes, abortion, foreign policy, the
environment, and Supreme Court nominations.
</P>
<P>
   NO DICE IN PHILLY
</P>
<P>
   A Las Vegas-style casino night that was to be the Nevada
Republican Party's biggest fund-raiser at the convention in
Philadelphia ran into trouble. It turns out gambling is illegal in
Pennsylvania _ even if it's with fake money and chips. Pennsylvania
Attorney General Mike Fisher advised the Nevada delegation to that
effect, and as a result, GOP leaders have decided to scrap the
event they had hoped would bring in as much as $100,000 to help
elect Republicans in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   LOYALTY IS A FLEETING THING
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail this spring in New Jersey, Democratic
Senate candidate Jon Corzine repeatedly implored whoever was
listening to support Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey for governor
next year. His comment at a Democratic Party confab in Atlantic
City in early May was typical: ``You can make certain Jim McGreevey
is that governosh, every day is Thanksgiving. This from a
Washington Post reporter: ``In the last five hours, we have
consumed mashed potatoes, baked ziti, grilled chicken, beef
brisket, chicken soup, cauliflower, broccoli, crab-stuffed
mushrooms, shrimp and steak kebabs, pizza, chicken Caesar salad,
cookies and pastries, cheese and crackers, rolls, ice cream and
candy bars. At the moment, we are swarming around a table with egg
rolls and vegetables left over from a fund-raising event.''

 &HT;    ANNUAL SURVEY COULD EASE CENSUS BURDENS, OFFICIALS SAY
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau believes it has a better way.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the controversy over privacy concerns and the 2000 census,
officials told Congress on Thursday that a rolling annual survey
should replace the once-a-decade long form of detailed questions.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in the Internet also should make the next census seem
less obtrusive, said Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
   By 2010, officials envision that most people may be able to
securely file their census information via the World Wide Web or by
using a simple mail-back postcard. The Internet was available to
census-filers this year, but was not publicized or made a central
part of the agency's data-gathering effort.
</P>
<P>
   The government must still conduct a head count every 10 years,
as mandated by the Constitution, to apportion seats in Congress.
But it is asking Congress to fund an ongoing survey of roughly 3
million households a year, beginning in 2003, to learn details
about the population.
</P>
<P>
   The new method, known as the American Community Survey (ACS),
would provide the government with better and more timely
information with less intrusion in the lives of Americans, Prewitt
told a House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best solution is to radically simplify the census by
eliminating the long form,'' Prewitt said. He called the ACS, which
is being tested on a limited scale, ``the single most important
innovation'' in federal data-gathering over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ACS has been in the works for years as a better scientific
means of surveying America. Prewitt said the cost of the new
program would not exceed current spending for the 2000 census,
roughly $6.8 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans in March received the basic, eight-question short
form. The 53-question long form, delivered to one in six U.S.
households, became the target of talk-show hosts, Internet chat
sites and Republican Party leaders who said that some of the
questions were intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Americans complained that the long form asked
sensitive questions about such things as income and health. Some
who received it refused to return the form, saying they did not
trust the government to keep their answers confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think most of us here today support eliminating the
long form, is the American Community Survey the answer? I'm not
sure,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House
subcommittee on the census.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey would ask virtually the same questions as the
long form over years and provide the Census Bureau with an annual
sample of the state of America, rather than the current 10-year
snapshot.
</P>
<P>
   As a more subtle form of polling, it would not become a
once-a-decade lightening rod for public indignation against the
federal government, census officials suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Mac Collins, R-Ga., questioned whether ``this
additional information is absolutely necessary to fulfill the
constitutional purpose of the census.'' He has introduced a bill
that would remove federal penalties for failure to answer census
questions unrelated to apportionment.
</P>
<P>
   Questions asked on the long form are approved by Congress and
are intended to gather data called for by laws or administrative
rulings. Prewitt said about 400 current federal laws require
collecting the data asked for by the long form and another 35 bills
pending before Congress would add new questions.
</P>
<P>
   The information collected is used to apportion congressional
seats, to draw new congressional districts within the states, and
to equitably distribute about $200 billion in federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials also said that the ACS would be more efficient
because the information would be collected by staff professionals
rather than the tens of thousands part-time, temporary workers the
Census Bureau hires every 10 as part of the demonstration, ACS
forms were sent to about 700,000 households in 1,203 counties,
including virtually all U.S. counties with populations exceeding
250,000. Census researchers want to use the information to compare
it to the regular 2000 Census as a means of testing the ACS method.

A FINE DEBUT

   &QL; 
Nickelodeon's ``The Brothers Garcia'' laudably refuses to allow its
social significance _ it's the first TV comedy completely written,
directed and produced by and starring Latinos _ to weigh heavily
upon its souffle-light premise and tone. Reminiscent of ``The
Wonder Years,'' the series features John Leguizamo whimsically
narrating the story of the Garcias, a freshly scrubbed San Antonio
family embracing its ethnic heritage while wading through the
detritus of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Larry (Alvin Alvarez), the youngest, is the kid providing
Leguizamo's perspective; his twin sister Lorena (Vaneza Leza
Pitynski), is a drama queen addicted to tattling and telenovelas.
Larry's older brothers are Carlos (Jeffrey Licon), a smart schemer,
and George (Bobby Gonzales), who thinks he's ready to try their
pop's special ultra-hot salsa, even though it's rumored to be
capable of melting through the hood of a car. Mom Sonia (Ada Maris)
is a hairdresser and bingo junkie; Dad Ray (Carlos La Camara)
teaches history and has a fondness for wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   In tonight's debut, the kids wrangle enough money for tickets to
see their favorite wrestler grapple live, though Sonia thinks Larry
might be more edified (or at least less influenced by violence) by
a trip to the Bingo parlor. Some of the comic bits are undeveloped
or just don't work, and the show's writers feel obligated to tack
on messages _ Leguizamo declares at the end of the episode, apropos
of nothing, ``Dad took his responsibilities to heart and Mm taught
us to do the same.'' But the performers are uniformly appealing,
and the humor is sold deftly and gracefully, rather than with the
sledgehammer approach some of Nickelodeon's _ not to mention the
networks' _ sitcoms prefer. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``The Brothers Garcia.'' &QL; 
What: Family comedy focusing on a close-knit Latino household. &QL; 
The stars: Alvin Alvarez, Bobby Gonzalez, Jeffrey Licon, Vaneza
Leza Pitynski, Ada Maris, Carlos La Camara. &QL;

`LOSER': AMY HECKERLING'S ROMANTIC COMEDY, PROMISING AT START,
COMES UP SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen-age romantic comedies, a staple of every movie season, are
often treated with contempt and condescension, not least by the
people who make them, who seem to believe that young audiences will
swallow a hackneyed, slapdash piece of work as long as there are
cute actors and a good soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Forgettable, virtually interchangeable movies like ``She's All
That,'' ``Whatever It Takes'' and the nondance parts of ``Center
Stage'' operate on the disastrous assumption that since young love
is trivial, stories about it can be flimsy and second-hand. But
movies about adolescent longing (as distinct, for the sake of
argument, from adolescent lust) are the culture's last vital link
to the great studio comedies of the 1930s. If this proposition
seems laughable, that's because, owing to the cynicism and laziness
of filmmakers and production executives, the genre has been bled
dry of its innocence, its charm and its essential seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Heckerling has been among the few exceptions to this sorry
rule. She is responsible not only for ``Clueless'' (1996), a Jane
Austen adaptation superior in wit and insight to anything the
Merchant-Ivory gang could ever hope to perpetrate, but also, along
with Cameron Crowe, for ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' one of
the touchstones of modern youth culture, still notable for its
intelligence and realism. If Heckerling's new movie, ``Loser,''
which she wrote and directed, falls short of the high standards set
by her earlier work, it is at least smarter and more probing than,
say, ``Boys and Girls,'' the summer's other college love story.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Biggs, who plays Freddie Prinze Jr.'s comic sidekick in
``Boys and Girls,'' shows up here as the title character, an
earnest young man named Paul from upstate New York who goes to the
big city as a scholarship student at an unnamed university. (It
looks a lot like New York University.) The first in his family to
go to college, Paul worries to his father (Dan Aykroyd) that he
won't fit in with the sarcastic sophisticates of the big city.
``You've seen that Seinfeld show,'' he explains. ``It's like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact it's a good deal worse. Paul's diffidence and decency
make him an immediate target for the cruelty of his roommates,
three spoiled, foppish rich boys played, with verve, conviction and
the most garish wardrobe ever assembled in the service of
heterosexual villainy, by Thomas Sadoski, Zak Orth and Jimmi
Simpson. Their blithe sadism, which the academic system colludes
with, connects ``Loser'' to the great John Hughes comedies of the
mid-1980s, which concealed live wires of class antagonism within
the insulating fluff of senior-prom anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Paul, expelled from the dorm, is living in an animal
shelter with caged cats and dogs who seem better cared for than he
is. His companion in misery, the unwitting soul mate without which
no romantic plot can flourish, is Dora Diamond, played by Mena
Suvari, who set middle America's middle-aged male hearts aflutter
in ``American Beauty.'' Suvari, no longer iconically blond and now
permitted room to exercise her own warm comic talents, is well
matched with the handsome, unassuming Biggs. They're attractive
without being offensively cute, and their characters manage to be
genuinely nice without seeming bland or phony.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of phony, Dora is mixed up with a smug, predatory
literature professor (Greg Kinnear) who holds her in his sway like,
as Elaine once said on ``Seinfeld,'' some kind of Svenjolly.
Kinnear's role smacks of anti-intellectualism, but his supercilious
portrayal of wasted intelligence and gilded self-satisfaction hits
its mark pretty well; the Modern Language Association might
consider organizing a protest. The professor treats Dora like a
play-thing, but both Kinnear and Suvari are subtle enough actors so
that the relationship is appallingly believable.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul and Dora endure cruelty and humiliation at the hands of
people who hurt them for no other reason than that they have the
power, ``Loser'' pushes its honesty almost to the point of
grimness. Just as ``Fast Times'' stared unflinchingly at the
underside of sexual awakening (in ways that no movie today would
dare), so ``Loser'' glimpses a dark world of date-rape, drugs,
binge drinking and general dishonesty behind the bright facade of
college life.
</P>
<P>
   Heckerling manages to balance this dark satirical tone with a
lively lightheartedness. Funny cameos from David Spade and Andy
Dick (who is making a specialty of weirdo-behind-a-desk roles)
help, as does the film's buoyant affection for clothes, music and
its Manhattan locations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, ``Loser'' disappoints. Too many narrative
possibilities are thrown away, so it never reaches the critical
mass of desperate complication that would ensure a satisfying comic
pay-off at the end. Paul is a little too unambiguously good, and
the reward for his goodness seems to come too quickly. The last
half-hour feels forced and thrown together, as if a first-rate
comedy full of incident, intelligence and surprise had been nipped
in the bud, or edited away. But if ``Loser'' fails to revive the
fortunes of the teen romance, it at least makes a brave and sincere
effort.

&HT;     HEPATITIS C EMERGES AS A TOP HEALTH CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hepatitis C, an infectious disease that can go
undetected in a person for decades while slowly destroying the
liver, is emerging as one of the country's top health care
concerns, both in terms in loss of life and stress on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the AIDS virus, hepatitis C often is transmitted through
sexual contact, bodily fluids and sharing of intravenous drug
needles. People who had blood transfusions before 1992 also are at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disease can be detected with a simple blood test,
physicians, insurers and national health officials all express
concern about its growing prevalence and that few victims know they
are infected:
</P>
<P>
   _ The American Medical Association, which represents physicians,
says hepatitis C likely will become ``a high public health priority
as the number of people who die from the disease and those
requiring liver transplants are expected to dramatically increase
in the coming decade.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a
division of the government's National Institutes of Health, has
ominously warned that ``without better therapies, the number of
deaths is expected to triple by the year 2015 _ higher than the
current annual death rate for AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A leading insurance industry group, the Downers Grove,
Ill.-based Alliance of American Insurers, calls hepatitis C an
``emerging epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The American Liver Foundation, an advocacy group based in New
York, says that hepatitis C is the leading cause of liver
transplantation in the United States. Demand for livers, which
already far outstrips supply, is expected to rise dramatically over
the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The disconcerting statistics may be rooted partly in high-risk
behavior. Sixty percent of new infections are due to the sharing of
needles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Government and industry officials are concerned about the impact
on the nation's economy. The government estimates that the disease
already costs the nation some $600 million annually, in 1991
dollars, in medical costs and loss of work time. The sum, however,
excludes the costly expense of liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But the actuarial firm of Milliman &AMP; Robertson, which tracts
healthcare trends, says the costs actually are much higher.
``People with (hepatitis c) currently consume at least $15 billion
per year for all their medical care. Without effective curative
treatment, total health care costs for patients infected with
hepatitis C will peak at an estimated $26 billion per year in about
2021,'' the company predicts in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC says hepatitis C is the most common chronic blood-borne
infection in the United States, with about 4 million people
infected, or 1.8 percent of the population. Of the total, about 2.7
million people are considered chronically infected _ a stage in the
disease when liver damage has occurred or is imminent. Moreover,
hepatitis C leads to chronic liver disease and possible death in 7
out of 10 people it infects.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C far surpasses AIDS, another major blood disease, in
total infections. According to the CDC, the total reported cases of
people infected with the AIDS virus in the United States is
733,374. Hepatitis C kills nearly as many U.S. citizens each year
as AIDS. About 10,000 people died last year from it, while AIDS
claimed 10,200 lives, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic liver disease, which includes hepatitis c, is the No. 10
cause of death in the United States. Heart disease is the No. 1
killer, taking the lives of more than 725,000 people annually.
</P>
<P>
   The liver is one of the body's most essential organs. It is a
warehouse for storing sugars, fats, vitamins and nutrients; it
destroys toxins in the body such as alcohol; it filters out waste
products from the blood; and it acts as a kind of overall regulator
for the body, ensuring there is a proper balance of chemicals in
the system. When the liver malfunctions, the body is vulnerable to
secondary infections and general organ failure.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C is often confused with two much less deadly strains
of hepatitis, known as A and B, which can be prevented with
vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis A is transmitted mainly by contaminated food and
water, which is why international travelers often get infected.
While it can spark severe fever and impede liver function resulting
in jaundice _ a yellowish pallor to the skin and the whites of the
eyes _ it rarely leads to chronic liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most all people recover without lasting problems. Nearly
one-third of all Americans have been infected at some point in
their lives. The CDC estimates that there are 125,000, to 200,000
new infections annually.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis B is blood-borne like hepatitis C, spreading through
contact with infected blood, semen and vaginal fluid. Having sex
with an infected person or sharing drug needles spreads the
disease. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most all recover, with only 2 percent to 6 percent of
those stricken develop serious liver damage. The CDC estimates
140,00 to 320,000 new infections of this strain annually.
</P>
<P>
   With 36,000 new infections annually, hepatitis C can be
transmitted by sexual contact, drug use with needles, even sharing
a razor or toothbrush with an infected person. Scientists believe
there are other possible risk factors that bear further study, such
as tattooing or body piercing in unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC says recipients of blood transfusions before 1992, when
the national blood supply was purged of tainted blood, are also at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C is particularly disconcerting for health care
workers because there is no vaccine and in only a relatively small
portion of newly diagnosed cases, perhaps 25 percent, does the
patient exhibit any symptoms, which are similar to those of
Hepatitis B. Most new cases occur in young adults, aged 25 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a person requests a simple blood test to check for the
antibody indicative of infection, hepatitis c can stay hidden for
years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Peter Somani, former director of the Ohio
Department of Health, ``most people have no idea they have
hepatitis C until it has reached the chronic phase and the damage
to their liver is severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a person is treated with the leading course of drugs _ a
combination of two medicines, Interferon-Alfa and ribavirin, the
disease can be kept at bay but rarely cured.

`CRIMINAL LOVERS': MIX OF FAIRY TALE AND DOCUDRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francois Ozon's new film, ``Criminal Lovers,'' is such an
amalgam of fairy tales, old movies and tabloid stories that it
never develops a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the world's chicest term paper, quoting from ``Night
of the Hunter,'' ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``Gun Crazy,'' ``They Live
by Night'' and true crime stories told through the eyes of Larry
Clark (the director of ``Kids''), sharing his fixation on the
hairless chests of teen-age boys. (Some will note resemblances to
``The Blair Witch Project,'' but ``Criminal Lovers,'' which opens
Friday at the Quad Cinema, was completed first.)
</P>
<P>
   The two central figures are trapped in a world of violence and
strangled lust. Alice (Natacha Regnier) persuades Luc (Jeremie
Renier) to kill Said (Salim Kechiouche), one of their high school
classmates somewhere in France. Alice says Said first ridiculed and
then raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Luc, still struggling with his own sexuality, fatally stabs Said
after Alice lures their prey into an extracurricular tryst in the
boys' locker room. These early scenes have a drab documentary
style. Alice toys with Luc from the outset: His eyes are almost
spinning like pinwheels on his withdrawn, impassive face. Ozon
photographs Renier as a naif, making the boy's long, sad face the
emblem of innocence fighting to remain intact throughout the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Luc and Alice flee the scene of their crime and stumble through
the forest, lost and frightened, only to find themselves trapped in
the woodland cabin of a wild-eyed, bearded man who sticks them in a
hole under his house. The story of Hansel and Gretel is the primary
reference here, with Luc being the object of desire of both Alice
and the heavy-browed Woodsman (Miki Manojlovic), who tells Luc he
likes his boys fattened and his girls thin before he eats them.
</P>
<P>
   There is a perverse brazenness in Ozon, as his earlier feature,
``See the Sea,'' made clear. His corrosive deadpan shows up when he
chooses to emphasize the setting, lingering on the oppressive
verdant beauty of the forest as his murderous Hansel and Gretel run
and run and run. At times, the film's mordant absurdity plays with
poetry, but of the most self-conscious brand.
</P>
<P>
   Ozon, who also wrote the screenplay, plays with violence and sex
throughout the film. Luc gazes longingly at whatever it is he can't
have, and he seems to be equally attracted to Alice and Said. His
feelings aside, though, ``Criminal Lovers'' is a terribly cold
movie, very good at drawing attention to its sources but not
involving on even the simple level of fairy tales, with their
capacity for dwelling on native fears. Ozon's fantasy is
sterling-silver-plated and cool to the touch, so the direction
feels like nothing more than a form of gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   His intelligence shines through, but at the expense of the
characters. By the time Alice and Luc fall into each other's arms
and have a bout of soul-cleansing sex while forest animals gambol
about their naked bodies _ a smarter-than-the-average-bear riff on
Disney nature films _ the whole thing feels like a cool-breeze
exercise, with the film giving a detached running commentary on its
own content. It's one of those cases where the director trips over
his own brains; he's too smart for his own good.
</P>

`BE THE ONE': A SEXY BASEBALL SCOUT CAUGHT UP IN ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who would think to put baseball, voodoo, drug dealing former
Dominican generals and capitalist corruption together into a neat,
taut thriller? The answer is April Smith, whose new book, ``Be the
One,'' not only blends those elements seamlessly but adds to the
mix a sexy, athletic, adventurous, mistake-prone female protagonist
named Cassidy Sanderson, who is one of the better things to happen
to the thriller genre since Peter Hoeg gave us Smilla of the sense
of snow.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy is a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers, which is a novel
and creative occupation for a 35-year-old woman who, if she had not
been a woman, would have been a baseball phenomenon, a hall of
famer. In fact Cassidy's older brother and best friend, Gregg, was
a phenomenon, but his life was cut short by cystic fibrosis when he
was a teen-ager, so Cassidy's determination to succeed in a man's
world has an odor of vindication about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Cassidy's career, hemmed in by a good-natured sexism that is
subtly and skillfully portrayed by Smith, is on the edge. She
failed to sign her two best prospects, which has stigmatized her as
unproductive. ``My life is pathetic,'' she tells the bartender at
Papa's, the Los Angeles bar where she hangs out until the wee hours
one night getting drunk.
</P>
<P>
   But that very night she gets a call from the Dodgers' scout in
the Dominican Republic who tells her that he has found the future
Willie Mays in a small town there, and he tells her to fly down the
next day. Cassidy shouldn't do that. It's not her territory, and
she doesn't have authorization, but she goes anyway. (She had to;
if she hadn't, there would be no story.) She meets 18-year-old
Alberto Cruz, signs him and quickly returns home.
</P>
<P>
   All of this happens in Smith's first few pages, which is one of
the many virtues of ``Be the One.'' There is no throat clearing in
this novel, which clips along at a steady trotter's pace from its
very beginning. Other virtues: Smith has taken the trouble to
become familiar with several uncommon worlds, not least of them the
world of baseball scouts and the front office of a major league
team. The details here are hard to beat, like the story of the star
player who reported his cleats missing, ``only to have them surface
several months later for sale in a collector's magazine, prompting
one TV commentator to observe that twelve hundred bucks seemed a
lot of pay for athlete's foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's police work is sharply etched and authentic. She handles
downtown Los Angeles cocktail parties with the lawyer and developer
elite as though she has spent her whole life going to them. And she
has learned her voodoo. But at the center of it all is Cassidy
herself, smart-alecky and tender at the same time and pretty lusty,
too, but observant and possessed of all the warm female qualities,
even if she grew up trying hard to be a boy like her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cassidy doesn't like police stations,'' Smith's narrator tells
us at one point. ``They reek of failure.'' That's not an important
point, but it demonstrates Smith's writerliness. ``Be the One'' is
a thriller with more than literary pretensions; it is literary.
</P>
<P>
   After Cassidy like a big-game hunter brings home Alberto, things
start to unravel. Alberto gets notes from a village back home
telling him to send $10,000 to an address in the Dominican
Republic. Not long after that a bottle strung with razor blades, a
voodoo object, is thrown through the windshield of Cassidy's Ford
Explorer. Then she sees a similar bottle at a party in the Los
Angeles home of a businessman she met on her short trip to the
Dominican Republic, a smooth rich developer named Joe Galinis who
becomes a key figure in the story.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be a good guy, and, certainly, Cassidy falls for
him. But there is something off about him that we the readers can
see but that Cassidy cannot. The unexplained attempts at
intimidation and extortion turn brutal when Cassidy is beaten up by
two men in a parking lot at the Dodgers' spring training camp in
Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   With each ominous event, Smith takes us on an italicized
flashback to Cassidy's trip to the Dominican Republic, which turns
out to have been very eventful. At times the scaffolding of Smith's
intrigue shows itself a bit too obviously, as when Cassidy suddenly
remembers a crucial detail of a late-night car ride on that trip
that there was no good reason for her not to have remembered
earlier, other than Smith's interest in keeping us in suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy also follows the model of almost every main character in
almost every thriller ever written, which is that she goes places
on her own when any idiot would know to go to the police. There is
a shootout near the end of the book that is more than a touch
implausible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the police do enter the picture effectively, particularly
in the form of a clever, attractive Florida detective named Nate
Allen, who almost steals the show in Smith's final chapters.
Meanwhile Smith's brisk pacing never slows, nor does her
characters' sharp dialogue dull.
</P>
<P>
   Her ending, which has a Graham Greene touch of chilly exoticism,
draws together all the elements: Cassidy's recollections of her
trip to sign up Alberto, Alberto himself, Joe, Nate and a couple of
creepy hoodlums whom Cassidy first encountered in the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In short Smith has produced a tingling and pungent
entertainment, anchored in good characters and authentic-seeming
situations. Her first novel, ``North of Montana,'' was greeted by
critics as a promising beginning. ``Be the One,'' as they say of
ballplayers past their rookie seasons, shows that she is no flash
in the pan.

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Midnight loomed over the cloud-shrouded Catoctin
Mountains, framing the portrait of gloom that hung with the weight
of lost hope within the green clapboard walls of the Laurel lodge.
</P>
<P>
   For nine days and nights here Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators had argued and reasoned, fulminated and fumed, hoping
to resolve the dense web of dispute at the core of half a century
of enmity and war in the wounded heart of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Their talks, though, had failed. Their bags were packed for the
long journey home, and there seemed nothing left now but to bid
each other a farewell tinged in sorrow for what might have been, a
mournful wake for the dreams of peace they had dared to share over
strong coffee and simple meals in the days when that vision lay
just over the horizon of their common gaze.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby cabin, though, the body was still breathing. The
high-stakes peace summit, already officially declared dead, was
actually on diplomatic life support, sustained by a frenzy of
jawboning, cajoling and finally arm-twisting by at least one person
unwilling to let the talks die.
</P>
<P>
   With his black armored limousine waiting to ferry him from his
secluded retreat near here to the White House 70 miles away,
President Clinton pushed, nagged and let his temper flare in a
last-ditch effort to keep Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from leaving Camp David with no
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Through a five-hour diplomatic rollercoaster ride, Clinton
shuttled between Arafat and Barak, who had not met directly in four
days, while the badly listing summit teetered on the brink of
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 (ET) Wednesday night, Clinton appeared to give up.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, to announce to reporters
gathered in this hamlet five miles from Camp David that the
high-stakes talks had collapsed in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an
agreement,'' Lockhart said, sending the international press corps
galloping off like digital age town criers to announce to the world
that the negotiations had failed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Camp David darkness, U.S. Secret Service agents scrambled
to shoehorn Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's limousine into
the waiting presidential motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prepare for POTUS movement,'' an agent's voice crackled over
the scanner, using the White House acronym for President of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade stayed put, though. Albright, Clinton, his
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger and his top Mideast Envoy
Dennis Ross remained in contact with Arafat and Barak and their
negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight, the faltering peace summit had been resuscitated.
Arafat and Barak agreed to extend their negotiations for at least
three more days, while the president journeys to Japan and returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought it was over,'' Clinton said an hour later,
speaking to reporters holed up at the temporary press center set up
at Thurmont Elementary School. ``And then we discovered that nobody
wanted to quit. Nobody wanted to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the high-drama diplomacy, aides insist, was a
president determined, after seven years of trying, not to let the
chance for securing a peace accord slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, in the president's mind, was an opportunity, and an
opportunity to be seized,'' Lockhart told reporters early Thursday
morning, an hour or so after Barak and Arafat agreed to go into
overtime at a Camp David summit originally scheduled to have ended
by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the president used every ounce of his power of
persuasion that he had available to him,'' Lockhart said, ``and
then some that he didn't know he had.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton triumphed in holding the talks together, he remained
far from securing a peace accord. He warned clearly, moreover, that
none was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the fact that they're staying here that
magically makes this easier,'' Lockhart said. ``It's not easy, and
there's nothing that can make it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 a.m. (ET) Thursday when Clinton returned to the White
House. Less than three hours later he was gone, boarding Air Force
One with his daughter, Chelsea, for the 15-hour flight to Okinawa,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There, Clinton is to meet Friday and Saturday with his
counterparts from the so-called Group of Eight industrial
democratic powers _ the United States, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan, Germany and Britain plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the agenda will be Clinton's assessment of the prospects
for Mideast peace _ and his pleas for G-8 economic and security aid
to support an agreement, should one be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll remind the leaders of the G-8 both what's at stake and
discuss in some format how countries within the G-8 can help this
process eventually,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's absence, Albright met separately Friday with Arafat
and Barak, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters Friday, as negotiating teams from both sides held talks
focused on such core issues as the question of Palestinian
statehood, the future of Jerusalem, the fate of Jewish settlers and
Palestinian refugees and territorial and security matters.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how much longer the Camp David talks might
continue. That assessment, said Boucher, would be made by Clinton
upon his expected return late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that unlimited time should be spent on this,''
Boucher said. ``It is a matter of making decisions and working on
the issues so decisions can be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's chief task, until the president's return, will be to
try to clarify those areas where both sides remain apart and to
consolidate, where possible, issues on which they've made progress
toward agreement since the talks began July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will continue to try to close the gaps and move forward on
the issues,'' Boucher said. ``She is here to carry the ball forward
so that the president can assess our progress when we get back.''

`BENJAMIN SMOKE': A DYING HIPSTER FULL OF SONG, POETRY AND SWEET
NONSENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of ``Benjamin Smoke,'' some lines from a Patti
Smith poem appear on screen, and later Smith herself appears, to
recite the poem and pay tribute to the life and music of the film's
subject, an Atlanta musician, hustler, and occasional drag queen
known to his fans and collaborators as Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's presence is especially fitting, and not only because of
her personal connection with Benjamin, who opened for her shortly
before he died in 1999 from liver failure linked to hepatitis C and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   From Jim Morrison to Kurt Cobain, she has always been a
connoisseur of rock 'n' roll martyrdom, and Benjamin, born Robert
Dickerson in rural Georgia in 1960, seems to have materialized from
one of her songs _ a wispy, sensitive, self-destructive soul full
of sweet beatnik romanticism, pop poetry and entertaining nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen's new documentary is a loving piece
of hipster iconography, a poignant and respectful memorial to a
troubled and talented man. More impressionistic than biographical,
``Benjamin Smoke'' is a collage of interviews, performance and
rehearsal clips, and evocative glimpses of Cabbagetown, the shabby,
reluctantly gentrifying Atlanta neighborhood where Dickerson lived
much of his adult life _ an area, as he describes it, where
children build go-carts, go to jail early and watch their parents
do lots of inhalants.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the straitened circumstances in which it was
made, the film has a richer, more various visual texture than most
documentaries, combining still photographs, black-and-white video
and Super-8 film, sometimes with wild sound or none at all. The
ragged, absent-minded lyricism that results suits the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, bone thin, his voice ravaged by ill health and
cigarettes, has a hustler's easy charm. He also has a tendency to
wander toward the far edge of coherence. His rambling owes
something to his poet's sense of discursive possibility; it may
also be a result of a life of heavy drug use. In any case, we get a
sense of his taste for inspired goofing (``Tell me what a really
great orgasm is like . . . It's like chicken, only a little
gamier''), his fantasy life (``I used to pretend I was Claudine
Longet, and I'd just murdered my ski-instructor boyfriend'') and
his literary vision (a ballad about Luke Perry's feet).
</P>
<P>
   But we don't learn much about the details of his death and life.
There is more information about Benjamin's music, his travels and
his childhood in the movie's publicity materials, or on an
affiliated Web site (www.benjaminremembered.com) than in the film
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The best parts of ``Benjamin Smoke'' are the musical passages,
which provide necessary evidence that Dickerson was not just a
colorful, doomed eccentric and which make ``Benjamin Smoke''
authentically respectful rather than lurid or condescending.
</P>
<P>
   His music _ chanted more than sung, over the sounds of the band
Smoke, which features a droning banjo, a squalling electric guitar
and a keening cello _ owes a lot to Smith and to the beatnik
tradition she upholds.
</P>
<P>
   You may hear echoes of Tom Waits, the Velvet Underground, Allen
Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, and of the recently reissued
Harry Smith Folkways compilation. Cohen and Sillen should be
commended for preserving this small, vital piece of American
weirdness.

  As a decorating trend, using pool tables in the living room is
deeply felt 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EVEN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chow time, everybody! Pull up a chair at the side pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game-room staple, the somewhat shady mark of a male
hobby tucked away in a spare room where the wife wouldn't have to
see it, pool tables are now emerging front and center in homes.
</P>
<P>
   A practical alternative to expensive living room furniture or a
makeshift dining room table, the pool table is becoming proof that
formal living space is getting less formal. Gone are the
plastic-wrapped, ``don't touch'' sofas. Plant yourself on a
barstool and grab a cue.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, families would rather play than entertain, say the
owners of billiard supply stores, especially if it means keeping
the kids entertained and busy at home. Game rooms are making way
for office and computer space while garages are once again free for
cars or storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a commercial now that's scheduled to run that
asks, `What are you doing with your formal living room and dining
room?''' says Sal Butera, general manager of Quintessentials, a
game store with four locations specializing in pool tables.
``People want to be more family-oriented, spending more time with
their kids and using the space they have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a customer who rented one from me,'' adds Brian Otis,
manager of Billiards and Bar Stools in Glendale. ``His daughter and
son-in-law died and now the grandparents are raising two teen-age
daughters. They don't want the kids on the streets. They've rented
it for six months and now they're in the process of buying it. The
kids love it. They're having fun there at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get more use out of that room instead of paying $15,000 to
$20,000 on formal furniture that's not going to be used,'' says
Otis.
</P>
<P>
   The pool table-dominated room will still make a dent in your
wallet (tables cost anywhere from $1,000 to $70,000), but now your
table isn't a one-trick pony. With conversion tops and mechanisms,
a pool table can be covered for use as a dining room table or, if
you're still in gaming mode, it can be switched over to an air
hockey or ping-pong table for $400 to $500 more.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Berg owns a conversion unit, but the table in her Agoura
Hills home is rarely used for anything but pool. Not that visitors
hanging around that room will get bored. Between the pinball
machine, stand-up and table top arcade games and a pachinko machine
built into the wall, all in the same room, Berg's clients, friends,
daughter Ashley and Ashley's friends all figure to keep themselves
entertained.
</P>
<P>
   The room was originally constructed as a family room, but in
mid-design, even with furniture and decorator fabric already
purchased, Berg changed her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fireplace is still there. So somebody could buy this house
and change it back,'' says Berg, who owns a mortgage firm. ``I'm
more into having every room be usable. I just decided it would be a
waste of money to make it into a family room.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg carried her full-use philosophy into the revamping of her
living room _ a formal-looking room that, Berg says, is anything
but. With three television screens for mass sports watching or
simultaneous Nintendo game playing, the living room can be as
festive and action packed as the game room.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Berg entertains. Kids of all ages use her home
as an after-school and evening playground. Any of her formerly
formal rooms will routinely hold 20 to 30 kids with ease, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew early that, A) this was a house people would like
to come to, and, B) there's nothing else around here to do,'' says
Berg. ``(Before), my house was beautiful. It was all decorated and
gorgeous, and I never used the living room, never used the dining
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hailfinger of Simi Valley says he stumbled upon the
pool-table-in-a-dining-room concept almost by accident. True, he
and his wife were looking for a pool table for their game room, but
they also needed a dining room table and couldn't find something
the size they were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like bulky stuff,'' says Hailfinger, a technical services
representative for a printing company, who, like Berg, ended up
buying his table from Quintessentials. ``We were looking for a
12-by-12 table. A pool table was the closest we could get. It's a
really nice-looking piece of furniture. The fact that it's a pool
table is an added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hailfingers' table hasn't taken on true dining room
functions yet since the family is still awaiting the arrival of
custom-made chairs from Honduras. Once the room is assembled,
however, the table will comfortably seat 14 with nobody touching
elbows. &QL;

 &HT;    AIRLINES' WEB SITE FOR TICKETS COULD BE ABUSED, CRITICS WARN
 &HT;    With INTERNET-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shopping on line for an airline ticket will become
simpler and cheaper once the nation's biggest carriers start
selling tickets through a jointly sponsored Web site this fall, the
companies insist.
</P>
<P>
   But critics warned Thursday at a Senate hearing that the joint
venture, called Orbitz, will quickly become a ``platform for
collusion'' to steer customers away from independent travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   The launch of Orbitz this fall will ``eliminate or severely
curtail the competition from existing online travel agencies,''
said Mark Silbergeld, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union, a nationwide consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
agreed that Orbitz has the potential to harm consumers, but said
certain regulations could head off problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orbitz could potentially benefit consumers and airlines by
providing a wider range of fare options, bias-free displays, and
reduced booking fees,'' DOT Inspector General Kenneth Mead said.
``But red flags raised by competitive issues, such as airlines
potentially restricting their lowest fares exclusively to Orbitz,
must first be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mead suggested that the government insist that airlines disclose
their lowest fares to all travel agents so that consumers could get
the same information no matter where they go to find it.
</P>
<P>
   The Orbitz hearing was requested by Senate Commerce Committee
Chairman John McCain, who said he was concerned because of the
industry's history of using computerized reservation systems to try
to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be foolish of us to ignore our past experience'' and
assume that major airlines won't use the Internet to shift business
to themselves and their joint-venture travel agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orbitz is backed by the nation's five largest carriers: Delta
Air Lines, United Airlines, Continental Airlines, American Airlines
and Northwest Airlines. Thirty other airlines have agreed to join
as affiliates. But some carriers, including Southwest Airlines,
oppose the joint operation.
</P>
<P>
   Orbitz Chairman and CEO Jeff Katz said his company will use a
newly developed search engine that can find more and better fares
for customers by using multiple servers, rather than mainframe
computers. At the same time, Orbitz will help participating
airlines by drastically reducing their ticket distribution costs.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, a carrier pays a commission to the travel agent
who books the ticket. But with Orbitz acting as the travel agent,
the airlines the will, in essence, be paying commissions to
themselves _ a move that will hold hold costs down for consumers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, airlines have been trying to get travelers to buy
tickets from the carriers' own Web sites. But Web surfers have
preferred to seek out independent sites, such as Expedia, owned by
Microsoft Corp., and Travelocity, owned by Sabre Holdings Corp., to
compare fares. Nearly half of the roughly $7 billion spent on
online travel last year went to those two agents.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that airlines will offer their lowest fares only on the
Orbitz site, the American Society of Travel Agents has filed a
complaint with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he was skeptical about Orbitz,
given that it is owned by the same airlines that frequently have
failed to live up to pledges to improve customer service. ``Given
the pattern of anti-consumer activity by the airlines, we need to
determine the minimum safeguards'' to protect consumers before
Orbitz gets started, he said.

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Midnight loomed over the cloud-shrouded Catoctin
Mountains, framing the portrait of gloom that hung with the weight
of lost hope within the green clapboard walls of the Laurel lodge.
</P>
<P>
   For nine days and nights here Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators had argued and reasoned, fulminated and fumed, hoping
to resolve the dense web of dispute at the core of half a century
of enmity and war in the wounded heart of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Their talks, though, had failed. Their bags were packed for the
long journey home, and there seemed nothing left now but to bid
each other a farewell tinged in sorrow for what might have been, a
mournful wake for the dreams of peace they had dared to share over
strong coffee and simple meals in the days when that vision lay
just over the horizon of their common gaze.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby cabin, though, the body was still breathing. The
high-stakes peace summit, already officially declared dead, was
actually on diplomatic life support, sustained by a frenzy of
jawboning, cajoling and finally arm-twisting by at least one person
unwilling to let the talks die.
</P>
<P>
   With his black armored limousine waiting to ferry him from his
secluded retreat near here to the White House 70 miles away,
President Clinton pushed, nagged and let his temper flare in a
last-ditch effort to keep Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from leaving Camp David with no
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Through a five-hour diplomatic rollercoaster ride, Clinton
shuttled between Arafat and Barak, who had not met directly in four
days, while the badly listing summit teetered on the brink of
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 (ET) Wednesday night, Clinton appeared to give up.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, to announce to reporters
gathered in this hamlet five miles from Camp David that the
high-stakes talks had collapsed in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an
agreement,'' Lockhart said, sending the international press corps
galloping off like digital age town criers to announce to the world
that the negotiations had failed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Camp David darkness, U.S. Secret Service agents scrambled
to shoehorn Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's limousine into
the waiting presidential motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prepare for POTUS movement,'' an agent's voice crackled over
the scanner, using the White House acronym for President of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade stayed put, though. Albright, Clinton, his
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger and his top Mideast Envoy
Dennis Ross remained in contact with Arafat and Barak and their
negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight, the faltering peace summit had been resuscitated.
Arafat and Barak agreed to extend their negotiations for at least
three more days, while the president journeys to Japan and returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought it was over,'' Clinton said an hour later,
speaking to reporters holed up at the temporary press center set up
at Thurmont Elementary School. ``And then we discovered that nobody
wanted to quit. Nobody wanted to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the high-drama diplomacy, aides insist, was a
president determined, after seven years of trying, not to let the
chance for securing a peace accord slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, in the president's mind, was an opportunity, and an
opportunity to be seized,'' Lockhart told reporters early Thursday
morning, an hour or so after Barak and Arafat agreed to go into
overtime at a Camp David summit originally scheduled to have ended
by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the president used every ounce of his power of
persuasion that he had available to him,'' Lockhart said, ``and
then some that he didn't know he had.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton triumphed in holding the talks together, he remained
far from securing a peace accord. He warned clearly, moreover, that
none was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the fact that they're staying here that
magically makes this easier,'' Lockhart said. ``It's not easy, and
there's nothing that can make it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 a.m. (ET) Thursday when Clinton returned to the White
House. Less than three hours later he was gone, boarding Air Force
One with his daughter, Chelsea, for the 15-hour flight to Okinawa,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There, Clinton is to meet Friday and Saturday with his
counterparts from the so-called Group of Eight industrial
democratic powers _ the United States, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan, Germany and Britain plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the agenda will be Clinton's assessment of the prospects
for Mideast peace _ and his pleas for G-8 economic and security aid
to support an agreement, should one be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll remind the leaders of the G-8 both what's at stake and
discuss in some format how countries within the G-8 can help this
process eventually,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's absence, Albright met separately Friday with Arafat
and Barak, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters Friday, as negotiating teams from both sides held talks
focused on such core issues as the question of Palestinian
statehood, the future of Jerusalem, the fate of Jewish settlers and
Palestinian refugees and territorial and security matters.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how much longer the Camp David talks might
continue. That assessment, said Boucher, would be made by Clinton
upon his expected return late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that unlimited time should be spent on this,''
Boucher said. ``It is a matter of making decisions and working on
the issues so decisions can be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's chief task, until the president's return, will be to
try to clarify those areas where both sides remain apart and to
consolidate, where possible, issues on which they've made progress
toward agreement since the talks began July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will continue to try to close the gaps and move forward on
the issues,'' Boucher said. ``She is here to carry the ball forward
so that the president can assess our progress when we get back.''

`WHAT LIES BENEATH': DESPITE ZEMECKIS' SHOCKS, RESULTING `BENEATH'
IS SCHLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before moving on to more stately affairs (``Forrest Gump'' and
``Contact''), Robert Zemeckis was accomplished at good
old-fashioned unclean fun, so it should come as no surprise that he
has directed the new thriller ``What Lies Beneath.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start, he zaps us with quick, glib scares, just to show
he still knows how, but his heart isn't in this kind of material
anymore. His reflexes are a little slow.
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis and his former partner, Bob Gale, honed their skills
working on the hammy shock series ``Kolchak, the Night Stalker,'' a
creature-of-the-week television show from the late 1970s that
inspired ``The X Files.'' But those days of zip and wanton mockery
are long behind Zemeckis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' is as implausibly chilling as any ``X
Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes (this movie is two hours
and 10 minutes long), your interest will have long vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung
Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a
regular basis. Her daughter (Katherine Towne) has just gone off to
college. And Claire is still recovering from the trauma of a car
accident of a year before, when she was behind the wheel. Then her
house starts showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman
(Harrison Ford), is a driven research scientist who's never home to
offer any emotional support.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer plays the kind of damaged-goods housewife with too much
time on her hands that is one of the few horror-genre cliches
``Scary Movie'' didn't get around to making fun of. On the other
hand, ``Scary Movie'' understood the virtues of brevity. Pfeiffer
stops walking on eggshells about an hour into the movie and shows
that she's capable of breaking a few eggs. By this time, the
audience knows she is possessed by the spirit of a woman (Amber
Valletta) with whom Norman had an affair, and she drops onto him
from the ceiling for hot-blooded clinches.
</P>
<P>
   Between the shameless shocks, and with the help of about a third
of Pfeiffer's performance, ``Beneath'' clicks. The movie is too
similar to one of its climaxes, which involves Claire's fighting
off the effects of a drug that causes paralysis: the film stumbles
around in a stupor, trying to bring its eyes down from the top of
its head and wake up before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis has all the externals down cold. He uses long takes and
occasionally tosses off a firecracker of a surprise at the end of a
scene. There are ominous breezes through the house as a cello saws
away on the soundtrack. Diana Scarwid packs her own good time as
Claire's fun-loving New Age flake of a pal; her jaundiced squint
and hoarse croak of a laugh indicate she would know how to have fun
in a haunted house.
</P>
<P>
   Ford shambles through this picture like the real terror, the
Creature Without a Pulse. He, too, has the superficial details down
to a science, using his voice like a cozy cotton blanket to drop
over Pfeiffer's shoulders. The only surprise in this picture is its
audacious torpor; the trailer gives away everything but the price
of the large popcorn and Diet Coke special.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in his career, Ford knows he needs to try
something new, and very early in the film he shows more loose charm
than he did in ``Six Days, Seven Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis, too, wanted to test his skills; he squeezed this movie
in during a break from shooting ``Castaway,'' with Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   The big climax could be right out of ``Tales From the Crypt'' (
Zemeckis served as an executive producer for the cable series based
on the 1950s horror comics). Or, for that matter, from ``Kolchak,
the Night Stalker.'' It's openly schlocky. Mostly, ``What Lies
Beneath'' glazes over faster than a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and
neither is very flavorful after sitting around for a while.
</P>
<P>

CRIME FIGHTING FOR LAUGHS

Fighting crime takes it on the chin tonight, as the USA Network
introduces two new single-camera comedies that delight in mocking
the genre's conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Next Door'' is, for the time being, the more inspired
of the two _ inspired by countless bad movies and Mad Magazine's
``Spy vs. Spy'' comic, that is. It concerns two men inextricably
linked by fate both cruel and clueless. There's the upright
secret-agent hero Kennedy Smith (Linden Ashby) and evil genius
Kreigman (Damian Young) _ sorry, ``evil super-genius'' (he just got
promoted), who keeps his day's plans (guitar lessons, steal
plutonium, kill Kennedy Smith) on his Palm Pilot. Their antagonism
is so passionately virulent that it has virtually transformed
itself into a sublimely dysfunctional friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, believing he has finally killed his sworn enemy,
returns to his family in the suburbs, starts seeing a shrink and
takes a job selling vintage cars. Kreigman, however, turns up,
moving next door to Kennedy with an evil super-vixen named Barbara
Bush (Tara Rosling), and he proceeds to make life miserable for his
do-gooder opponent (by playing basketball really loudly really
early in the morning).
</P>
<P>
   Each episode will feature yet another clash to the death,
whereupon, like ``South Park's'' Kenny, the mortally defeated
combatant will arise to fight again in the next episode. It's a
concept both cheesy and morbid and, as executed in tonight's
premiere, terrifically funny.
</P>
<P>
   Young essays self-satisfied diabolism with deliriously suave
aplomb, while Ashby is a wonderfully stolid straight man. The
series comes courtesy Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi, writers of
the wan movie ``Snow Day,'' but don't hold that against them.
They've made amends with this silly but entertaining parody.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in ``Manhattan, AZ,'' a former Los Angeles undercover
vice-squad cop seeks a life change after his wife is killed helping
Greenpeace cut dolphins from tuna nets (she's buried in cartons of
tuna cans).
</P>
<P>
   David Henderson (Brian McNamara) and rebellious son Atticus
Finch Henderson (Vincent Berry) turn up in the title town. It's an
arid backwater populated by militia nuts, run by a corrupt mayor
(Chad Everett) and located perilously close to ``Area 61,'' a
mysterious governmental landscape for unspecified experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's episode finds Henderson investigating how the town's
dogs all ended up with only three legs. (McNamara, in a priceless
disclaimer at the end of the episode, explains that no animals were
injured in the making of this show, although ``we had offers'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Next Door's'' pilot and performers are funnier, but
``Manhattan, AZ's'' idea, which looks to have been cribbed from the
``Bakersfield, P.D.'' template and mixed with a dustier ``Northern
Exposure,'' may have a more sustainable concept. As is, they're
both smartly dopey shows. The USA Network, in one evening, offers
up as many amusing new comedy series as the networks were able to
uncork all of last season. &QL;

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BUTTERFLY,' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano.
Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle,
devastating new film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer
Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Lozano), a sensitive young
boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish
Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries
of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the
proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Fernan
Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political
complexity (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `CHICKEN RUN,' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson
and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86
minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is
immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that
credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the
standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to
tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a
chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also
directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of
the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful
big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Lord's
continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.
``Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ``Stalag 17'' to
``Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Gibson, the voice of
Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the
hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves
through the pluck of Ginger (Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal
of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `CHUCK AND BUCK,' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed
by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Arteta's funny,
creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who
inhabits the mental world of a pre-adolescent boy. As played by
White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive,
an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles
his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend
Charlie (Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed
careerist. Arteta's visual sense, White's insightful script and
strong supporting performances from Weitz and his brother Sam, as
well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this
one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some
time. ``Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of
lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore,
magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to
see this year (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `DISNEY'S `THE KID,'' starring Bruce Willis, Lily Tomlin and
Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this
cloying throwback to Disney's modest live-action comedies of old,
Willis plays a smarmy image consultant humanized by his encounter
with his 8-year-old younger self (Spencer Breslin), who arrives in
Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By rights, the movie should
be dreadful, and it is thick with therapeutic cliches, but it
occasionally soars to heights of not bad, thanks to strong
performances from Willis, Tomlin and Smart, and to Audrey Wells'
surprisingly clever script (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `GROOVE,' starring Hamish Linklater, Lola Glaudini and Steve Van
Wormer. Directed by Greg Harrison (R, 86 minutes). If you're
nostalgic for chasing down a rave gig across the city and arriving
to find a pair of 16-year-olds discussing the merits of drum and
bass versus jungle, then this mostly knowing and funny comedy is
just the film for you. Even if you're not, its seductive lack of
pretension will win you over. ``Groove'' is a comedy of moments,
tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of one night of pleasure
at a rave. Harrison and his team don't try to pretend that raves
are anything new or dangerous. Rather, they're an entrenched
circuit with specific tribal complications, and this genial picture
captures them (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,' starring Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger.
Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100 minutes). If
``There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its callous
mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of stalking
and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity from the
Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ``Me, Myself and
Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey, boyish
sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that may
prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Carrey, in
one _ or is it two? _ of his most charming and repellent
performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split
personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie
and plausible bewilderment by Zellweger (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `THE PATRIOT,' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directed by
Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic
that, at more than 2 1/2 hours, seems to take place in real time.
The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film
will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of
prequel to Emmerich's ``Independence Day'' stars Gibson as a gentle
farmer who leads the colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits,
using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to terrorism. His
anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief
asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his
children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling about his own
large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PERFECT STORM,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and
Diane Lane. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes).
Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother the
human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's
best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ``the
storm of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Clooney is the
ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Wahlberg and Lane are the
appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of
warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the
fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but
the movie becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SCARY MOVIE,' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and Shannon
Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes). Wayans'
latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the ``Scream''
movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy.
``Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale jokes involving male
genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment. There
are a few hilarious moments, and some that will provoke guilty
laughter, but Wayans hasn't quite figured out how to parody movies
_ like the wildly popular ``Scream'' series _ that already parody
themselves (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAFT,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey
Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree. A
sequel/remake to the 1971 semiclassic, starring the always
dependable Jackson. He plays the nephew of the original Shaft
(Roundtree, who appears briefly), and this time, Shaft is a cop. He
leaves the force to track down a racist WASP murderer (Bale), who
joins forces with a drug dealer (the flamboyant and skillful
Wright) to eliminate the hero. This may be the least politically
correct movie in some time, and though it tries to convert
archetype into stereotype, it doesn't succeed. Watching the two
villains squabble for center stage is like watching Luciano
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in a death match for the mike. But
Jackson comes out on top of this emptily entertaining hodgepodge of
retro and modern cliches (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SUNSHINE,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle,
Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180
minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances and those of Ehle and
Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of
the story is crudely told, ``Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and
thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful
historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `X-MEN,' starring Partick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman,
Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed
by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-awaited arrival of
Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of
levels: For one, the acting duel between Stewart (as the mutant
telepath Prof. X, the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the
mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism).
As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other, you get
the feeling you really are watching members of another species in
action. And Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational
Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all
wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He
lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications.
Otherwise, the movie is an earnest affair that's clumsy when it
should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously
than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that
devotion (Mitchell).

 &HT;    When your bones betray you
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The falling seemed interminable. Like Alice down the
rabbit hole.
</P>
<P>
   But the landing was hard, and Anita Stillman had no doubt that
she had broken her left hip.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly 79, this active woman was participating in a breast
cancer seminar at Boca Raton Community Hospital when her weakened
bones betrayed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting at the end of the table. I was getting up to get
a cold drink and somebody had put a pocketbook underneath,'' she
recalls, gesturing under her sofa to indicate how the errant object
had obstructed her path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught my right foot in it and I went flying, and . . .
believe me, as I came down, I could hear my doctor saying, `Your
left hip has nothing very much left there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit, I knew I cracked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing very much left there. Words that had caused the
grandmother to cringe when she had heard them only three days
before.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis: osteoporosis, a thinning of the bones that will
cause half the women over 50 to experience a fracture in their
lifetimes. And one in eight men over 50, as well, according to the
National Osteoporosis Foundation, (www.nof.org).
</P>
<P>
   Peak bone mass is reached in the 20s and 30s, so exercise and
calcium are extremely important then to build up strong bone mass.
At least 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily is advised. When bone
loss begins, as it will, in the 40s for women and in the 50s for
men, increased calcium is recommended _ about 1,200 milligrams a
day average _ along with continued exercise, moderate alcohol, and
no smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The message going out today is: Osteoporosis is both a
preventable and treatable disease.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman had very little bone density left when she fell, but
that was the second time she had gotten a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people her age, she thought that broken bones were a
consequence of aging and had tried and discarded treatment three
years earlier when the drug she was taking to build her bone mass,
Fosamax, gave her heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis? That hurt, and resulted in replacement of both her
knees.
</P>
<P>
   But osteoporosis is a silent disease that rarely alerts those
who have it.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman did have an indication, though, that all wasn't well.
</P>
<P>
   Her posture had deteriorated _ ``My children noticed I was
stooped, and my husband kept saying, `Stand up!' '' _ and she had
lost an inch in height, both signs of bone deterioration. Yet, she
didn't follow through on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't doing it consistently,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't suffer with osteoporosis. When I took my first (bone
density) test, I was surprised at the results. If it doesn't hurt,
you don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   FOCUSING ON CANCER INSTEAD
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem appears to be that women are more afraid of
cancer than of osteoporosis, even though the risk of a hip fracture
equals the combined risk of developing breast, ovarian and uterine
cancer, the National Osteoporosis Foundation advises.
</P>
<P>
   And 20 percent of those with hip fractures _ men and women _ are
dead within a year because of conditions like pneumonia that can
develop when people are bedridden with fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Some women are afraid, also, of Fosamax, the often prescribed
medication, which can cause intestinal problems or ulcers in the
esophagus if not taken correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon R. Sullivan of Greenaces is one of those. Even though her
mother had osteoporosis, and she herself had a bone density test
that showed she was losing bone mass, Sullivan quit taking the drug
four years ago after a four-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the drug disagreed with her, it's that she had
read about its possible risks _ which occur infrequently if
instructions are followed, according to the American Medical
Association _ and didn't want to take that chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there's got to be a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor showed her pictures of her weakened bones; he argued
with her to continue to take some medication. Eventually, she lied
and told him she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wanted to listen to him? I think he really truly believes
that I should and I didn't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows that medical tests showed Fosamax _ first introduced
in 1995 _ builds healthy bone at the spine and hip, but she prefers
to try a regimen of diet, exercise, and vitamins that is
recommended to prevent bone weakening.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, she walks 4 miles every other day, alternating with yoga
exercises followed by weight lifting. She also takes 1,200
milligrams of calcium plus vitamin D daily. (Doctors generally
recommend 1,500 milligrams daily for postmenopausal women not on
hormone replacement therapy.)
</P>
<P>
   And she eats lots of high-calcium foods.
</P>
<P>
   When she went back for her follow-up bone density test two years
after her initial exam, her condition was the same. She hadn't lost
bone density, but she hadn't gained any, either.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are other drugs that can be used for
osteoporosis, Sullivan is sticking with her routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the alternative method is far better for me. Not only
am I strengthening my bones by lifting weights, I'm eating foods
that have a lot more antioxidants in them. And I have lost a good
30 pounds!''
</P>
<P>
   She's scheduled to take another test this year (Medicare pays
for bone density tests every two years for people at risk) but
still hasn't decided whether she'd switch to drugs if her bones are
thinning further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking very positively at this point,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICATION CRUCIAL FOR SOME
</P>
<P>
   Doctors warn that waiting can be a dangerous game, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the early, early stages (of bone loss), chances
are you'd benefit from going on prophylactic care and not waiting
and seeing,'' said Dr. Richard Levine, an internist, who
specializes in geriatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you're downright osteoporotic, you should find a
medicine that works. Or watch your step!''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Ettinger, medical director of the Clinical Research
Center of South Florida in Stuart and Lake Worth, agrees that there
should be no doubt about taking medication if a patient already has
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   But there might be room for experimenting, such as Sullivan is
doing, if the patient is only mildly affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how low (in bone density) she is. If she's not
dangerously low, and maintaining (bone), fine. She needs to be
monitored on an ongoing basis. That's different from a woman going
down (in bone density) or already osteoporotic with a high risk of
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic number at which fracture risk increases. It's
an ever increasing continuum of risk. There are rapid and slow bone
losers. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he emphasizes, ``cleaning up lifestyles and taking calcium
pills are not enough for many women. An adequate diet and exercise
will certainly slow the rate of bone loss, but for some women it's
not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   CHANGES IN MOBILITY, ACTIVITIES
</P>
<P>
   Anita Stillman knows that truth.
</P>
<P>
   Since her fall, she has been using a nasal spray, Miacalcin, to
help retard bone loss, and is taking calcium and vitamin D daily.
</P>
<P>
   Her lifestyle, however, has been severely affected by her fall.
She has to use a walker and painkillers to get through her day, and
she no longer can dash out the door on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   She gazes at the ceiling fan she used to stand on a ladder to
clean and shakes her head, no. That's a task she won't try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a most debilitating thing. I must alter my lifestyle
because I know my bones are thin. I'll do my best to build them up
because I am aware of what is wrong. Once you know you have it, if
a person has any kind of intelligence, they have to know it doesn't
go away. Don't wait till you fall.''

 &HT;    COMMITTEE ADDS VOICE TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT ``IDENTITY THEFT''
 &HT;    By Rob O'Dell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House subcommittee unanimously approved a bill
that would protect Americans from identity theft _ primarily the
misuse of Social Security numbers _ by restricting how those
numbers can be used.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the Social Security subcommittee by a
voice vote Thursday, would restrict the use of Social Security
numbers in both the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft is the fastest growing financial crime in the
nation, affecting an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 Americans each
year,'' said subcommittee Chairman E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., the bill's
sponsor. ``Today, we've taken another significant step toward
protecting Americans from this devastating crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security was created to help Americans enjoy their
golden years, not spend their days trying to restore their good
name.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prohibit the sale of Social Security numbers by
private industries or any government agency _ at the local, state
or federal level. It also would prohibit third parties from
offering services to obtain Social Security numbers, such as
advertising agencies offering services to stores to obtain the
names and Social Security numbers of prospective clients.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, Social Security numbers also would be
prohibited from appearing on driver's licenses, motor vehicle
registration, or other identification-related records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year alone, the number of Americans who reported misuse
of their number increased 233 percent,'' Shaw said. ``Social
Security numbers were once a form of financial security, and they
have now become a tool for potential financial ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation would deter businesses from refusing service
if a person declines to provide their Social Security number by
making them liable under the Unfair Trade Practice Law. It would
not be a blanket restriction on all uses of Social Security numbers
but would simply ban sales of the numbers, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Social Security numbers were first introduced, their
purpose was to keep track of worker's earnings so benefits could be
calculated when the worker retired,'' Shaw said. ``But today,
Social Security numbers have become the gateway for crooked con
artists to raid your bank accounts, max out your credit cards, and
literally steal your identity.''
</P>
<P>
   House action on the bill is expected in September, said a
spokeswoman for Shaw.

   JERUSALEM _ He is a Christian living near the place where Jesus
was crucified, but Palestinian Jack Mardin still feels like some
people do not recognize his place here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think there are Jews and Muslims and there are no
Christians here,'' said the 25-year-old Mardin (pronounced,
Mar-DEEN''). ``The Holy Sepulcher is our church. Our patriarchs are
here. We have lots of churches.''
</P>
<P>
   His patriarchs may feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   This week, local leaders of the three major local Christian
denominations wrote a letter to U.S., Israeli and Palestinian
leaders asking for a place at the Camp David peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust you will not forget or overlook our age-long presence
here,'' stated the letter from the patriarchs of the Greek
Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Armenian Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks that Christian communities not be divided and
for guarantees that holy sites will remain open to all the faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Jerusalem, ruled by Israel but claimed in part by
the Palestinians, is said to be a major sticking point in the
10-day-old summit talks at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are asking for sovereignty primarily over the parts
of Jerusalem that they populate, which were captured by Israel in
the 1967 war. Israelis say that Jerusalem has been the center of
Judaism for 3,000 years and cannot be shared.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has been painted in largely terms of Muslims vs.
Jews. Focus is on who will rule over the Western Wall, sacred to
Jews, and the Haram esh-Sharif complex, sacred to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for world opinion, Israeli leaders repeatedly
state that Jerusalem is not as important for Muslims as it is for
Jews. It is, they say, the ``heart of Judaism.'' Christians are
rarely.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Jerusalem's place in Christianity, Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert said recently, ``It is a lung for Moslems and a lung
for Christians and a heart for Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerusalem is the site of Jesus' crucifixion and
resurrection. The place where he prayed in Gethsemane and where his
mother, Mary, lived. It is also home to about 10,000 Christians.
Most of them are Palestinians and some are Armenian.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's Christian sites are also the destination of hundreds
of thousands of Christian pilgrims from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, pilgrims lined up in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
the cavernous collection of chapels where Catholics and Orthodox
Christians believe Jesus was crucified.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Swehla, a 22-year-old pilgrim from Modesto, Calif., said he
was keeping track of the Camp David talks but does not expect them
to affect the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will really make a difference,'' he said,
standing in the line to see Jesus' tomb. ``No one will do anything
to it. It's too historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few expect any major changes in the holy sites soon.
Modern history has seen generally open access under Israel. The
Palestinian Authority built Christian confidence by sinking
millions of aid dollars into improving conditions around the
birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem, under their control.
</P>
<P>
   But, before the modern age, the Holy Land saw churches,
synagogues and mosques ransacked as rulers of the different
religions held sway. Even the Church of the Holy Sepulcher has been
destroyed more than once since it was first built in the Fourth
Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has shown that whoever has the political power tends
to favor his own,'' said Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the Vatican
representative to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the patriarchs was similar to other
pronouncements that Christian leaders have made during
negotiations, said Palestinian analyst Mahdi Abdul-Hadi.
</P>
<P>
   It stated that they oppose a proposal reportedly being discussed
at Camp David in which Israel would retain control of the Jewish
and Armenian areas in the Old City. The Palestinians would get
control of the Christian and Muslim areas.
</P>
<P>
   The church leaders said the Armenians are Christians and should
not be divided from the other Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also asked for ``international guarantees'' that
Christians will have open access to Christian sites. It also asked
that Christians be allowed to continue to develop their
communities, which have shrunk dramatically in proportion to the
Jewish and Muslim populations.
</P>
<P>
   Wadie Abunassar, spokesman for the authors of the letter, said
they did not intend to meddle in politics or favor either side in
the negotiations but to protect Christian interests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a major Protestant group has taken a pro-Israel
stand. The International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem has for
more than a year circulated a petition commending Israeli control
of holy sites in Jerusalem and throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The ICEJ organizes trips and activities in Israel primarily for
evangelical churches around the world and has consistently sided
with Israel in its bid to hold onto occupied areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Heckerling kicked off the modern wave of teen revisions of
the classics with ``Clueless,'' her high-school twist on Jane
Austen's ``Emma.'' Her new college romance, ``Loser,'' is inspired
by, of all things, Billy Wilder's classic film ``The Apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Transplanted from corporate culture to a university setting,
it's an amiable little comedy with a pair of bright young leads
propping up a film with little dramatic heft.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Biggs, the ``American Pie'' pastry lover, is the eponymous
loser Paul, a sweet, small-town doofus who leaves his Midwest home
for New York University. Paul is the lump in the melting pot, a
clumsy, culturally clueless kid in a dorky hunting cap and haircut
out of the Jazz Age dropped into a dorm with three preening rich
snots who are in college to party, score chicks and party some
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dora (Mena Suvari, the rose petal princess from ``American
Beauty''), dressed in thrift-store punk fashions and coifed in a
carefully chaotic nest of hair, looks the gloomy goth chick but is
really a bubbly, bright girl selling herself short in crummy jobs
and a demeaning affair with their patronizing European history
teacher, Professor Alcott (Greg Kinnear).
</P>
<P>
   The romantic complications of ``The Apartment'' arrive when
Paul, already smitten with Dora, arrives home to find her passed
out in his bathroom. His treacherous former roomies have been using
his off-campus digs to stage drug-fueled parties and slipped her a
mickey, leaving her in a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   Oily Alcott will have nothing to do with her, and Paul becomes
her nurse, best friend and heartsick suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs strikes a balance between awkward, out-of-place flailing
and nice guy sincerity and naivete , and Suvari is delightfully
animated as a struggling city girl. Though they never really spark
as a romantic couple, their easy, relaxed performances make their
scenes together great fun, and Heckerling never lets the picture
slip into doofus humor.
</P>
<P>
   But the film never comes alive. Kinnear is almost too good as a
smarmy, stuck on himself jerk, and the three elitist fashion
stooges quickly devolve into vicious miscreants. Such cartoonish
characters offer little weight to the quandaries offered in this
obvious morality play.
</P>
<P>
   And for a college romantic comedy, it's completely lacking in
the campus culture. It's up to Biggs and Suvari to shore up the
piece. Their charm can't overcome the underbaked drama, but they're
fun to spend time with. Sometimes that's good enough.

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT _ THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton staked a
great deal of diplomatic capital on the Camp David summit. Perhaps
that is why just when everyone _ including White House officials _
thought the talks has fallen apart, he made a daring rescue and
convinced both sides to stay at it in his absence. But what really
happened Wednesday night and the wee hours of Thursday morning? And
where do they go from here? Clinton is still in danger of losing
the one legacy he so desperately wants for his presidency: A
lasting peace in the Middle East. Developing. (Deans, Cox News

   MIDEAST-CHRISTIANS _ JERUSALEM _ While teams primarily of
Palestinian Muslims and Israeli Jews in Camp David battle_ or talk
_ through the fate of Jerusalem, Christians want to remind them
that the Holy Land is theirs, too. The leaders of the three biggest
Christian denominations in Jerusalem _ Roman Catholic, Greek
Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox _ penned a letter this week asking
for representation at Camp David. The request was belated and not
likely to be honored, but it was intended as a reminder that
Jerusalem is the site of Christianity's holiest sites and should be
kept open for Christians. Israeli leaders have brushed off
Christian concerns lately. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) WITH _ Box

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ GALVESTON, Texas _ My first impression of
Galveston was literally a blur. I was 14 years old and there on a
Scout trip. Being terribly nearsighted and full of teen-age
stupidity, I wore my glasses into the surf so I would be able to
see if I was about to be bit by a jellyfish, or worse, a shark.

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Wait. You
actually think the Texas comptroller _ a partisan elected official
_ would trot out revenue statistics with an eye to politics? Next
you'll say Santa Claus is my mom and dad. Well, not to suggest the
recent revenue estimate by Republican Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander isn't accurate. But suffice it to say that Rylander and
her Democratic predecessors know how to use the revenue estimate as
a political tool. (McNeely, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The record-setting heat that has plagued parts of the Southeast
for most of July will abate Friday and Saturday as a front drifts
south through the Gulf states. The front will be the focus for
clusters of thunderstorms for the next several days. The strongest
storms Friday will be from eastern Oklahoma to the western
Tennessee Valley. Scattered thundershowers will also occur near the
front in the Carolinas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cool air will cover a large area from the upper
Middle West to the Northeast. A front marking a new surge of the
cool air will be preceded by a broken band of thundershowers near
the central and northern Appalachians. Behind the front, abundant
clouds and sprinkles will occur in the chilly air around the Great
Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, heat will expand as high pressure promotes ample
sun.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HAWAIIAN TROPICS
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the tropical ocean south of Hawaii gave birth to the
first tropical depression of the central Pacific hurricane season.
Should the depression, which is 700 miles south of the island
chain, strengthen, it would be named Alika. Tropical storms and
hurricanes that form in the Pacific between 140 degrees west
longitude and the international dateline are given Hawaiian names
and are monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in
Honolulu. Hurricanes that form farther east in the Pacific have a
separate set of names and are tracked by the Tropical Prediction
Center in Miami.

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In an October broadcast eerily reminiscent of Orson Welles' 1938
radio thriller, ``The War of the Worlds,'' ABC News broke a
horrific story to a startled television audience: terrorists had
unleashed deadly biological weapons on an unsuspecting American
city. Undetected by subway commuters braving the evening rush hour,
the attackers had tossed bottles of anthrax spores onto the train
tracks, releasing lethal bacteria in an invisible cloud. Within a
week, 50,000 people would be dead.
 &HT;    It was every civic leader's worst nightmare, and one of the
greatest disasters in U.S. history. But it never happened. Like
Orson Welles' apocalyptic tale of alien assault, it was a fictional
account, and like the 1938 radio broadcast, it triggered its share
of controversy.
 &HT;    Though ABC made it clear that it was presenting a fictional
scenario, some viewers lambasted the network, complaining that it
was encouraging potential terrorists to act. Others accused the
network of unnecessary theatrics that could only promote fear and
confusion.
 &HT;    But was the broadcast accurate? Do Americans really face the
specter of a biological Armageddon?
 &HT;    According to Defense Secretary William Cohen, the prospect of a
catastrophic attack is all too real. In a recent statement, he
described how contagion could spread dramatically in the aftermath
of a biological attack, with doctors offering little relief and
hospitals becoming warehouses for the dead and dying. He concluded:
``This is not hyperbole -- it is reality.''
 &HT;    Others are more sanguine. Robert Burnham of the FBI's domestic
terrorism unit considers the risk of a biological attack to be
relatively low, though he says that the FBI is genuinely concerned
about a loophole in federal law that makes the possession of
bioweapons like anthrax perfectly legal, regardless of whether one
has a legitimate reason to possess such material. This loophole
complicated the prosecution of Larry Wayne Harris in 1995 for the
possession of the agent that causes bubonic plague.
 &HT;    Dr. D. A. Henderson, Director of the Center for Civilian
Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins University, believes that the
threat of bioterrorism has heightened in recent years, and that
dissident groups have both the motivation and the ability to deploy
some of the most dangerous pathogens as weapons against the U.S.
population.
 &HT;    He dismisses the widely held view that the scientific expertise
required to produce and disperse lethal organisms is only within
the reach of the most sophisticated laboratories.
 &HT;    ``Recipes for making biological weapons are available on the
Internet,'' he explains, ``and even groups with modest finances and
basic training in biology and engineering could develop an
effective weapon at little cost.''
 &HT;    The Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo is best known for its 1995 sarin
gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, but we now know that the
group also planned to use biological weapons like anthrax against
U.S. forces in Japan. The cult's arsenal included large amounts of
nutrient media, botulinum toxin, anthrax cultures, and drone
aircraft equipped with spray tanks. Members of the group even
traveled to Zaire in 1992 to obtain samples of Ebola virus for
weapons development.
 &HT;    Henderson cites two familiar microbes -- smallpox and anthrax --
as the most formidable threats to the public. Anthrax, with a
fatality rate of 80 to 90 percent, could cause thousands of
casualties, paralyzing an entire city. Smallpox is also a killer of
unimaginable proportions: in the 20th century alone, it has killed
500 million people.
 &HT;    Unlike anthrax, smallpox is a highly communicable disease, which
means that it could spread like wildfire through the population.
And since routine smallpox vaccination in the U.S. was halted in
1972, as much as 90 percent of the population lacks smallpox
immunity. This means that a major city could quickly be swamped
with cases of a disease in which one out of three people will die.
 &HT;    It would not take many cases to overwhelm the medical system.
The Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies reports that even if
only 50 people were initially infected, it could lead to a
nationwide epidemic with thousands of fatalities. Cities, moreover,
lack the isolation facilities needed to prevent further spread of
the contagion. In Washington, D.C., for example, there are only
about 100 hospital beds that could provide proper isolation of
infected patients. Making matters worse, smallpox vaccine reserves
would rapidly be depleted. The U.S. currently has about 15 million
doses on hand, but it is estimated that only about half of these
doses are usable. If more vaccine were needed, it would take up to
a year to produce it, since there is presently no manufacturing
capacity for the product.
 &HT;    All of this points to a serious gap in the nation's preparedness
to address the biological weapons threat, despite the Clinton
administration's efforts to increase spending over the past two
years to fight terrorism. According to medical experts, the problem
may be one of priorities as well as financial resources.
 &HT;    In recent testimony before Congress, Dr. Tara O'Toole of the
Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health reported that
domestic preparedness programs have focused primarily on the threat
posed by conventional explosives or chemical weapons. Yet medical
experts maintain that biological terrorism is more likely than ever
before, and far more threatening than either explosives or
chemicals. While the worst effects of a chemical or explosive
attack are soon over, the devastation following a smallpox or
anthrax outbreak would continue for days, weeks or even months as
new cases continued to arise.
 &HT;    An effective response would require significant medical
resources, but for fiscal year 2000, the Department of Health and
Human Services is requesting just $230 million out of a total
anti-terrorism budget of $10 billion. This represents less than 3%
of the total budget, and health professionals contend that it is
emblematic of the administration's lack of attention to the
bioweapons threat.
 &HT;    O'Toole addressed the issue of biological preparedness in her
House testimony. She explained that few American cities have
practiced responding to an attack that employs biological weapons,
and that even when bioterrorism scenarios are considered,
clinicians, hospital leaders and public health experts are
frequently excluded from the training and exercises sponsored by
federal agencies.
 &HT;    She also stressed that the government urgently needs to expand
its efforts to develop national pharmaceutical and vaccine
stockpiles and to improve disease surveillance systems.
 &HT;    Dr. Michael Osterholm, a former Minnesota state epidemiologist
and an authority on bioterrorism, is even blunter in his
assessment: ``We have a substantial national response to terrorism
-- the problem is they forgot to include a meaningful biological
component in their plans.''

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In an October broadcast eerily reminiscent of Orson Welles' 1938
radio thriller, ``The War of the Worlds,'' ABC News broke a
horrific story to a startled television audience: terrorists had
unleashed deadly biological weapons on an unsuspecting American
city. Undetected by subway commuters braving the evening rush hour,
the attackers had tossed bottles of anthrax spores onto the train
tracks, releasing lethal bacteria in an invisible cloud. Within a
week, 50,000 people would be dead.
 &HT;    It was every civic leader's worst nightmare, and one of the
greatest disasters in U.S. history. But it never happened. Like
Orson Welles' apocalyptic tale of alien assault, it was a fictional
account, and like the 1938 radio broadcast, it triggered its share
of controversy.
 &HT;    Though ABC made it clear that it was presenting a fictional
scenario, some viewers lambasted the network, complaining that it
was encouraging potential terrorists to act. Others accused the
network of unnecessary theatrics that could only promote fear and
confusion.
 &HT;    But was the broadcast accurate? Do Americans really face the
specter of a biological Armageddon?
 &HT;    According to Defense Secretary William Cohen, the prospect of a
catastrophic attack is all too real. In a recent statement, he
described how contagion could spread dramatically in the aftermath
of a biological attack, with doctors offering little relief and
hospitals becoming warehouses for the dead and dying. He concluded:
``This is not hyperbole -- it is reality.''
 &HT;    Others are more sanguine. Robert Burnham of the FBI's domestic
terrorism unit considers the risk of a biological attack to be
relatively low, though he says that the FBI is genuinely concerned
about a loophole in federal law that makes the possession of
bioweapons like anthrax perfectly legal, regardless of whether one
has a legitimate reason to possess such material. This loophole
complicated the prosecution of Larry Wayne Harris in 1995 for the
possession of the agent that causes bubonic plague.
 &HT;    Dr. D. A. Henderson, Director of the Center for Civilian
Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins University, believes that the
threat of bioterrorism has heightened in recent years, and that
dissident groups have both the motivation and the ability to deploy
some of the most dangerous pathogens as weapons against the U.S.
population.
 &HT;    He dismisses the widely held view that the scientific expertise
required to produce and disperse lethal organisms is only within
the reach of the most sophisticated laboratories.
 &HT;    ``Recipes for making biological weapons are available on the
Internet,'' he explains, ``and even groups with modest finances and
basic training in biology and engineering could develop an
effective weapon at little cost.''
 &HT;    The Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo is best known for its 1995 sarin
gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, but we now know that the
group also planned to use biological weapons like anthrax against
U.S. forces in Japan. The cult's arsenal included large amounts of
nutrient media, botulinum toxin, anthrax cultures, and drone
aircraft equipped with spray tanks. Members of the group even
traveled to Zaire in 1992 to obtain samples of Ebola virus for
weapons development.
 &HT;    Henderson cites two familiar microbes -- smallpox and anthrax --
as the most formidable threats to the public. Anthrax, with a
fatality rate of 80 to 90 percent, could cause thousands of
casualties, paralyzing an entire city. Smallpox is also a killer of
unimaginable proportions: in the 20th century alone, it has killed
500 million people.
 &HT;    Unlike anthrax, smallpox is a highly communicable disease, which
means that it could spread like wildfire through the population.
And since routine smallpox vaccination in the U.S. was halted in
1972, as much as 90 percent of the population lacks smallpox
immunity. This means that a major city could quickly be swamped
with cases of a disease in which one out of three people will die.
 &HT;    It would not take many cases to overwhelm the medical system.
The Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies reports that even if
only 50 people were initially infected, it could lead to a
nationwide epidemic with thousands of fatalities. Cities, moreover,
lack the isolation facilities needed to prevent further spread of
the contagion.
 &HT;    In Washington, D.C., for example, there are only about 100
hospital beds that could provide proper isolation of infected
patients. Making matters worse, smallpox vaccine reserves would
rapidly be depleted. The U.S. currently has about 15 million doses
on hand, but it is estimated that only about half of these doses
are usable. If more vaccine were needed, it would take up to a year
to produce it, since there is presently no manufacturing capacity
for the product.
 &HT;    All of this points to a serious gap in the nation's preparedness
to address the biological weapons threat, despite the Clinton
administration's efforts to increase spending over the past two
years to fight terrorism. According to medical experts, the problem
may be one of priorities as well as financial resources.
 &HT;    In recent testimony before Congress, Dr. Tara O'Toole of the
Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health reported that
domestic preparedness programs have focused primarily on the threat
posed by conventional explosives or chemical weapons. Yet medical
experts maintain that biological terrorism is more likely than ever
before, and far more threatening than either explosives or
chemicals. While the worst effects of a chemical or explosive
attack are soon over, the devastation following a smallpox or
anthrax outbreak would continue for days, weeks or even months as
new cases continued to arise.
 &HT;    An effective response would require significant medical
resources, but for fiscal year 2000, the Department of Health and
Human Services is requesting just $230 million out of a total
anti-terrorism budget of $10 billion. This represents less than 3%
of the total budget, and health professionals contend that it is
emblematic of the administration's lack of attention to the
bioweapons threat.
 &HT;    O'Toole addressed the issue of biological preparedness in her
House testimony. She explained that few American cities have
practiced responding to an attack that employs biological weapons,
and that even when bioterrorism scenarios are considered,
clinicians, hospital leaders and public health experts are
frequently excluded from the training and exercises sponsored by
federal agencies.
 &HT;    She also stressed that the government urgently needs to expand
its efforts to develop national pharmaceutical and vaccine
stockpiles and to improve disease surveillance systems.
 &HT;    Dr. Michael Osterholm, a former Minnesota state epidemiologist
and an authority on bioterrorism, is even blunter in his
assessment: ``We have a substantial national response to terrorism
-- the problem is they forgot to include a meaningful biological
component in their plans.''

OPEN SOURCE SHARES WEB SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB NORBERG   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ Perl, Apache, Sendmail and Bind are not
household names, say, like Microsoft. Unless the house is filled
with techies whose lives revolve around building interactive Web
sites for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But those little-known technologies increasingly are the
infrastructure of the Internet and are part of a growing worldwide
``open source'' movement in which software code is shared freely
among techies.
</P>
<P>
   Without those programs, no one could surf the Internet for
advice on buying a new car or plan a Hawaii vacation, send e-mail
to a stock broker, buy a book or sell an antique desk at auction.
</P>
<P>
   It was those technologies _ and the far-flung community of
programmers that developed them _ that were on display this week at
O'Reilly &AMP; Associates' second annual Open Source Conference,
drawing 1,800 Web developers, programmers and systems
administrators from 24 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this worldwide development community that is
invisible to the general public, just as what they create is
invisible to the public,'' said Sara Winge, spokeswoman for
O'Reilly, based in Sebastopol. ``And yet what they have created,
the Internet, is the greatest technological impact to come along in
a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference began four years ago as a classroom program of
tutorials for Perl, the computer programming that connects Internet
servers to other computer programs and makes the Web interactive.
</P>
<P>
   It evolved into an open source conference coinciding with the
strengthening of the open source movement, which believes that
software, programming and innovation are best served when the
source code is open and available on the Internet, allowing anyone
to work on it, and not closed and proprietary, such as software
produced by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open source is a process, not a product,'' said Tim O'Reilly,
O'Reilly &AMP; Associates' founder and president.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Behlendorf, who co-founded Collab.Net with O'Reilly to run
open source projects for corporations, said an open source project
could involve 50,000 programmers worldwide adding a bit of code,
and current estimates are 5 million to 10 million open source
programmers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real innovation happens in the universities and by people
hacking at home on their own, and open source nurtures that,''
Behlendorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Open source has developed into a community with an almost
cultlike following.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly said an open source conference was a natural follow-up
to his company's best-selling Perl book, a textbook on programming
Perl scripts to connect Web servers to other computers, which allow
Web sites to become interactive and also perform functions. Perl,
for instance, allows a stock quote page to link to news stories or
searches Web sites for key phrases of text.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly's book publishing business, which caters to developers
and programmers, sold $15 million in Perl books since its first
publication in 1992. Company revenues are about $60 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Without the open source movement, the Internet never would have
succeeded, O'Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers use Apache software for their
servers, e-mail uses Sendmail, Perl links Web servers to other
programs, like databases, and Linux operating systems are used in
Web publishing and system administration.
</P>
<P>
   All of those programs are open source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was all this important technology, and it was all
underground,'' O'Reilly said, adding that his company's ``sweet
spot was documenting all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which costs as much as $1,000 to attend,
includes four days of tutorials in those subjects. Chuck Burwell of
San Francisco, a systems administrator for Wells Fargo Bank,
attended for sessions on Sendmail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find the information at other places, but it is not as
centralized,'' Burwell said. ``We use several open source tools.
Sendmail is the biggest one. Our entire e-mail system is based on
Sendmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Perl programmer Jason Maxham of Alexa, an Amazon.com subsidiary
in San Francisco, was interested in the tutorial classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great place to learn,'' Maxham said. ``The courses
are taught by the best and the brightest in the world of Perl.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane O'Donnell of OpenNMS.org, from Raleigh, N.C., used the
conference to meet developers face-to-face. His company has an open
source program that connects servers to networks for ISPs and large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the only conference, there are Linux conferences,
but it is the broadest format within the open source community,''
O'Donnell said.

 &HT;    WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL CLEARS NEXT-TO-LAST HURDLE TO APPROVAL
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Fine Arts Commission approved plans
Thursday for a World War II monument to be built on the National
Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote came after six hours of emotional testimony.
Opponents argued that the memorial's granite arches and pillars
will spoil the open, sweeping vista of ``America's front yard.''
Supporters countered that the sunken design will not mar the view,
and that this ``hallowed ground'' is the appropriate site to
remember the most significant event of 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The approval leaves only one more bureaucratic hurdle before
construction can begin. Final approval of the design is needed next
month from the National Capital Planning Commission, which has
already given a preliminary okay. Ground-breaking for the $100
million monument is scheduled for Veterans Day in November. and
dedication for Memorial Day in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   With World War II veterans dying at a rate of 1,000 a day,
supporters said there is some urgency in getting started. The war
ended 55 years ago, and the average age of its veterans is 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost 10 million of the 16 million men and women who
served in uniform. There are less than 6 million of us left,'' said
former Sen. Bob Dole, chairman of the National World War II
Monument Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is taking longer to build the memorial than it took to
fight the war,'' said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, author of the
legislation authorizing the memorial. Congress voted its approval
in 1993, and President Clinton dedicated the site two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Kaptur began the effort at the urging of Roger Durbin, a
constituent and World War II veteran who had visited Washington and
was dismayed to find no memorial to the epic struggle waged and won
by what Tom Brokaw has termed ``the Greatest Generation'' of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, Roger passed away earlier this year,'' Kaptur told the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Years of debate have improved the memorial design, but ``there
comes a point'' when action must replace talk, said Sen. Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii. ``We have reached that point,'' said Inouye, who,
like Dole, was partially disabled by his World War II wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right site. We have the right design. What we do
not have is a lot of time,'' said Luther Smith, who served with the
Tuskegee Airmen, an African American unit, before being taken
prisoner after his plane was shot down over Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But dozens of opponents marched to a microphone and told the
arts commission that ``it's not too late'' to move the memorial to
another spot.
</P>
<P>
   The site is wrong. with the memorial imposing itself upon the
majestic open space between the Washington Monument and Lincoln
Memorial, said Judy Scott Feldman, an architectural historian
leading the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II Memorial would encircle the existing Rainbow
Pool, an integral part of the Lincoln Memorial, she said. Her
group, the National Coalition to Save Our Mall, may file suit to
stop the project, citing a National Park Service report that they
say confirms this connection between the Rainbow Pool and the
Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two cannot be severed without destroying the whole,'' said
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting congressional delegate of the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference before the commission meeting, Norton said
the memorial should be located in the Constitution Gardens, a few
hundred yards north of the proposed site. If the memorial is built
as planned, she said, ``our generation will be blamed'' for
``obstructing'' and ``defacing'' the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial features two semi-circles of 56 stone pillars with
bronze wreaths, representing the number of U.S. states and
territories during the war. The pillars surround a 7.4-acre sunken
plaza and fountains in what is now the Rainbow Pool. On the north
and south entrances are 41-foot triumphal arches that designers say
will stand under taller elm trees that already line nearby paths.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of criticism, the original design was altered so the
vista was not obstructed, said Fredrich St. Florian, the architect.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will be ``sensitive to its setting'' and
``respectful of its neighbors,'' he told the commission, and it
will convey the message that democracy triumphed over tyranny.

MEDICAL COMMUNITY SEES DOMESTIC MURDER CASES AS BIZARRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (In third graf, corrects that it's Dr. Kartell's estranged wife's
lover who was shot.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD AND RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One practiced plastic surgery in upscale Andover. The
others were affiliated with two renowned Harvard teaching
hospitals. Each, authorities say, ended his career as a healer in a
burst of deadly violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 48 hours, three Boston-area physicians have appeared
in court facing murder charges, a macabre coincidence that is
prompting some local doctors to ponder their special responsibility
to remain gentle under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dr. James Kartell of Andover received a five- to
eight-year prison term for shooting his estranged wife's lover to
death inside the Methuen hospital where Kartell had long practiced.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the defense continued to present its case in the
trial of Dr. Dirk K. Greineder, who headed the allergy department
at Brigham and Women's Hospital until he was accused last fall of
bludgeoning his wife to death in a Wellesley park.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Dr. Richard Sharpe, a Gloucester dermatologist
affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was arraigned
on charges that he shot his estranged wife to death Friday in her
Wenham home. Greineder and Sharpe have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the state Board of Medicine expressed concern over
the trio of murder cases. They suspended Sharpe's license Wednesday
_ as they did previously with Greineder's and Kartell's _ and said
they would redouble efforts to reach out to troubled physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Board's Physician Health and Compliance Unit works closely
with the (Massachusetts Medical Society) to ensure doctors in need
of support receive assistance and supervision,'' said board member
Dr. Peter Madras.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors interviewed stressed that they see the three killings
mainly as a bizarre coincidence, not as a sign that doctors have
somehow become prone to homicide. But they said that in the days
since the Sharpe case erupted, it has been a hot topic in some
medical circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any colleague that I've seen that I
haven't had the conversation, `Can you believe this?' '' said Dr.
Kenneth Arndt, who until March headed the dermatology department at
Beth Israel Deaconess and was Sharpe's adviser during his Harvard
residency. ``Every place I am, people know him or have known him.''
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, where Sharpe completed a
fellowship, several doctors said Wednesday that they were working
too hard to consider the issue, and some had not heard of the
murders. But one resident wearing blue scrubs, who refused to give
his name, said the news about Sharpe had disturbed him and made him
think about doctors' need to stay calm at the most stressful times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think a doctor could've found another way of
resolving the conflict, which is what we're taught all the time in
dealing with patients,'' the resident, in his mid-30s, said as he
grabbed a snack from a hot dog cart near the hospital. ``You'd like
to think we're . . . maybe better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen J. Bergman has considered himself ``a spokesman for
humane medical training'' since his 1978 novel ``The House of
God,'' based on his residency at Beth Israel, became a cult classic
among medical trainees. He said Wednesday that he pays special
attention to murders by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm especially interested in where we go wrong, how we lose
our humanity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two sensational murders that have become part of popular culture
involved doctors accused of killing their wives _ Sam H. Sheppard
and Jeffrey R. MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman said that while murder accusations are extreme cases,
the recent ones made him feel angry that the medical profession is
not better at quickly detecting emotional and drug abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe may have abused prescription drugs, his wife's lawyer has
said, and Greineder, authorities said, had turned to prostitutes
and online pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a self-centered, achievement-oriented, competitive
perspective, that can be rewarded in destructive ways by medical
schools and medical training programs and the medical profession,''
Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that all of the accused are more than 40 years old, he
said that self-centered view ``can take you only so far in your
life . . . and then something's gotta give.'' Bergman, a
psychiatrist, added that middle-aged doctors have a high incidence
of depression, substance abuse, and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Medical Association, doctors are more
likely to become the victims of homicide than to commit it. There
is no evidence that doctors are more or less prone to commit murder
than people in other professions, says the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, Dr. Virginia
T. Latham, found a different message in the killings: Domestic
violence affects all professions, including doctors, and
``transcends socioeconomic levels.'' She said the society is trying
to stress that point to its membership, and sent guidelines on
detecting domestic abuse to all doctors in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Sharpe had several businesses built around cosmetic
surgery such as liposuction and that Kartell was a plastic surgeon,
area plastic surgeons said that they are under particular pressure
because they work on people's faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like an entertainer who is on stage,'' said Dr.
Joel Feldman, a private-practice plastic surgeon in Cambridge.
``There is the sense that your work is all out there for people to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he added, that is no reason to kill.
</P>
<P>
   The changing nature of medicine with its stress on efficiency is
a burden on many doctors, said Dr. Richard Corlin, a Santa Monica,
Calif.-based gastroenterologist who is president-elect of the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you have in Boston,'' he said, ``is a tragic and
bizarre coincidence.''

   THURMONT, Md. _ Midnight loomed over the cloud-shrouded Catoctin
Mountains, framing the portrait of gloom that hung with the weight
of lost hope within the green clapboard walls of the Laurel lodge.
</P>
<P>
   For nine days and nights here Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators had argued and reasoned, fulminated and fumed, hoping
to resolve the dense web of dispute at the core of half a century
of enmity and war in the wounded heart of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Their talks, though, had failed. Their bags were packed for the
long journey home, and there seemed nothing left now but to bid
each other a farewell tinged in sorrow for what might have been, a
mournful wake for the dreams of peace they had dared to share over
strong coffee and simple meals in the days when that vision lay
just over the horizon of their common gaze.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby cabin, though, the body was still breathing. The
high-stakes peace summit, already officially declared dead, was
actually on diplomatic life support, sustained by a frenzy of
jawboning, cajoling and finally arm-twisting by at least one person
unwilling to let the talks die.
</P>
<P>
   With his black armored limousine waiting to ferry him from his
secluded retreat near here to the White House 70 miles away,
President Clinton pushed, nagged and let his temper flare in a
last-ditch effort to keep Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from leaving Camp David with no
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Through a five-hour diplomatic rollercoaster ride, Clinton
shuttled between Arafat and Barak, who had not met directly in four
days, while the badly listing summit teetered on the brink of
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 (ET) Wednesday night, Clinton appeared to give up.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, to announce to reporters
gathered in this hamlet five miles from Camp David that the
high-stakes talks had collapsed in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an
agreement,'' Lockhart said, sending the international press corps
galloping off like digital age town criers to announce to the world
that the negotiations had failed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Camp David darkness, U.S. Secret Service agents scrambled
to shoehorn Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's limousine into
the waiting presidential motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prepare for POTUS movement,'' an agent's voice crackled over
the scanner, using the White House acronym for President of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade stayed put, though. Albright, Clinton, his
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger and his top Mideast Envoy
Dennis Ross remained in contact with Arafat and Barak and their
negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight, the faltering peace summit had been resuscitated.
Arafat and Barak agreed to extend their negotiations for at least
three more days, while the president journeys to Japan and returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought it was over,'' Clinton said an hour later,
speaking to reporters holed up at the temporary press center set up
at Thurmont Elementary School. ``And then we discovered that nobody
wanted to quit. Nobody wanted to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the high-drama diplomacy, aides insist, was a
president determined, after seven years of trying, not to let the
chance for securing a peace accord slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, in the president's mind, was an opportunity, and an
opportunity to be seized,'' Lockhart told reporters early Thursday
morning, an hour or so after Barak and Arafat agreed to go into
overtime at a Camp David summit originally scheduled to have ended
by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the president used every ounce of his power of
persuasion that he had available to him,'' Lockhart said, ``and
then some that he didn't know he had.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton triumphed in holding the talks together, he remained
far from securing a peace accord. He warned clearly, moreover, that
none was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the fact that they're staying here that
magically makes this easier,'' Lockhart said. ``It's not easy, and
there's nothing that can make it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 a.m. (ET) Thursday when Clinton returned to the White
House. Less than three hours later he was gone, boarding Air Force
One with his daughter, Chelsea, for the 15-hour flight to Okinawa,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There, Clinton is to meet Friday and Saturday with his
counterparts from the so-called Group of Eight industrial
democratic powers _ the United States, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan, Germany and Britain plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the agenda will be Clinton's assessment of the prospects
for Mideast peace _ and his pleas for G-8 economic and security aid
to support an agreement, should one be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll remind the leaders of the G-8 both what's at stake and
discuss in some format how countries within the G-8 can help this
process eventually,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's absence, Albright met separately Thursday with
Arafat and Barak, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters Thursday, as negotiating teams from both sides held talks
focused on such core issues as the question of Palestinian
statehood, the future of Jerusalem, the fate of Jewish settlers and
Palestinian refugees and territorial and security matters.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how much longer the Camp David talks might
continue. That assessment, said Boucher, would be made by Clinton
upon his expected return late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that unlimited time should be spent on this,''
Boucher said. ``It is a matter of making decisions and working on
the issues so decisions can be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's chief task, until the president's return, will be to
try to clarify those areas where both sides remain apart and to
consolidate, where possible, issues on which they've made progress
toward agreement since the talks began July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will continue to try to close the gaps and move forward on
the issues,'' Boucher said. ``She is here to carry the ball forward
so that the president can assess our progress when he gets back.''

TRITE FILM `BENEATH' EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C-  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Zemeckis (``Forrest Gump'') is usually such a reliable
filmmaker that you really have to wonder how he managed to
criminally misuse the marquee dream team of Harrison Ford and
Michelle Pfeiffer and turn out a summer thriller as predictable and
hackneyed as ``What Lies Beneath.''
</P>
<P>
   He's quoted all over the media as saying he wanted to make a
``pure suspense movie,'' ``something really terrifying and
mysterious'' _ ``perhaps the kind of film Hitchcock would have made
in his day, but using the modern technology of today to help tell
the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though the film winks at Hitchcock's ``Suspicion'' and
``Rear Window,'' it's actually a ghost story _ and one that seems
to have been hastily rewritten at the last minute to be the kind of
somber, low-tech variety of the genre that was the rage of last
summer's box office.
</P>
<P>
   It opens well, the production values are very strong and there's
a goose bump or two raised in the first act. But it soon collapses
into a plodding patchwork of scenes from other, better movies and a
climax so melodramatic that it drew hoots of laughter at last
week's Seattle preview.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about the Spencers, a seemingly perfect couple who
live in a lakeside Victorian mansion in an idyllic Vermont town:
Claire (Pfeiffer), a fortyish, ex-classical musician recovering
from some undisclosed recent trauma; and her second husband, Norman
(Ford), a workaholic genetics professor (Ford).
</P>
<P>
   When their only daughter goes off to college, Claire not only
suffers the empty-nest syndrome in a big way, she begins hearing
voices and seeing strange visions, and soon concludes that a young
woman neighbor has been murdered and _ as in ``The Sixth Sense''
and ``Stir of Echoes'' _ the ghost is trying to tell her something.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, this is a bad script. It's out for suspense with a
capital ``S,'' but since there's absolutely no surprises in it, the
audience is always two steps ahead of the game. It's also clear
from the get-go just who the real villain is _ indeed, it's even
spelled out for us right there on the film's poster.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that the movie is a grueling two-hours and 10
minutes long or that Zemeckis' narrative pacing is way off, or that
he overdoses the audience with so many clumsy false scares _ things
menacingly jumping out that turn out to be the family dog or some
other innocuous nothing _ that we're soon completely immune to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer tries valiantly but she's helpless under the
circumstances. Ford doesn't seem to be trying at all, and is
surprisingly charmless and dull. He may be the biggest movie star
of the last 25 years, but after last fall's ``Random Hearts'' and
this clunker, he may be in need of some serious career advice.

&HT;     WHO IS FRANK KEATING? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Texas Gov. George W. Bush picks Oklahoma Gov.
Frank Keating as his running mate _ which insiders suggest Bush is
inclined to do _ the country will be confronted with a very
conservative, Southern-dominated Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, Keating's great charm is that he is a long-time chum
who could be depended on to be loyal and supportive. He is not a
Bush clone, but their views are similar.
</P>
<P>
   Keating,56, is an anti-union, anti-abortion Catholic in good
standing with the party's religious right activists.
</P>
<P>
   He took the conservative Heritage Foundation here by storm on
Thursday, packing the think tank's auditorium with ideological
allies and curious members of the media. His official purpose was
to discuss his campaign to reduce Oklahoma's high divorce rate.
Most of his audience simply wanted to have a close look at an
obscure, small-state governor who might be thrust into national
prominence any minute now.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't duck the big ``veep'' question, admitting that all the
speculation was flattering. He joked about waiting for the magic
phone call from Bush, wondering aloud if it would come.
</P>
<P>
   And he observed wryly that one unexpected consequence of all the
speculation was that his son recently called from college and
``treated me reverently _ that has never happened before in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating lavishly praised Bush, promising to ``do anything he
wants'' even if there is no Bush-Keating ticket. ``It may be that I
will be serving ice tea at some reception,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The slim, white-haired Keating is an attractive personality with
an easy-going manner not unlike Bush's own. He won a reputation for
calm leadership with his sympathetic, reassuring response to the
1995 Oklahoma City bombing in which 168 people died.
</P>
<P>
   But his views are so conservative that his presence on the
ticket would be a downer if Bush intends to reach out to
independents and turn a moderate face to the electorate in
November. Furthermore, as a fellow governor, Keating lacks the
legislative and foreign policy experience that a senator could
bring to the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that matter to Oklahoma have little resonance in the
industrial Midwest, the bustling West Coast or the liberal
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Keating stands with the religious right not only against
abortion but also on the contentious issues of school prayer and
the teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court said student-led prayers broadcast over a
loudspeaker system at a football game were an unconstitutional
breach of the traditional wall between church and state, Keating
accused the high bench of violating the Constitution instead of
upholding it.
</P>
<P>
   When Oklahoma's State Textbook Committee demanded that all
biology textbooks bear a disclaimer saying that evolution is
``unproven'' and a ``controversial theory,'' Keating applauded. He
described this official snub of all the scientific evidence that
confirms the human evolutionary process as ``thoughtful.'' For good
measure, he added irresponsibly that he didn't think he was
descended from a baboon.
</P>
<P>
   When he got into a fight over pay levels with the state's
unionized teachers, he was asked his solution for dealing with
them. ``Homicide,'' he snapped. (He later claimed it was just a
joke, but the teachers were not amused.)
</P>
<P>
   His elevation to the national Republican ticket might galvanize
not only teachers' groups but other unions as well. Many labor
leaders already prefer Vice President Al Gore, but the members are
not uniformly enthusiastic. Wait until they learn that Keating
regularly pushes for a state right-to-work law, which the unions
hate. Such laws prohibit employers from requiring a worker to join
a union in order to obtain or hold a job.
</P>
<P>
   Keating has not had his way on right-to-work because the
Oklahoma legislature is not always prepared to do his bidding.
Asked his opinion of the state's lawmakers earlier this year, he
replied, ``The legislature has yet to get religion. That's to be
expected, since two-thirds of them are Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried later to explain that he didn't mean Democrats are
godless heathens but merely that they are politically
unenlightened. The fact he made the crack at the religion-based
Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., however, tends to undercut
his sanitized revision.
</P>
<P>
   In short, adding Keating to the ticket might make Bush feel
comfortable but it wouldn't do much toward winning the election.
The only Republican who would do that remains Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, and Bush does not seem to have the courage to cope with an
independent star who could outshine him.

G8 MEETING FOCUSES THE WORLD'S EYES ON OKINAWA 
</HEADLINE>
  (This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ Of the many locations Japan considered for the
annual summit meeting of the world's largest industrialized
nations, this resort town in the country's southernmost island,
Okinawa, seemed a most dubious choice.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa, a backwater province plagued by a tragic past, lacked
the infrastructure and know-how needed to mount an international
event of such magnitude. Relations between Tokyo and the erstwhile
island kingdom have never been good, and the islanders have long
demanded the removal of the U.S. military bases that constrict
their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   But the late Japanese Prime Minister Keichi Obuchi, who died
suddenly of a stroke in May, insisted on staging the summit meeting
here, hoping to bolster Okinawa's weak economy and make some amends
for decades of abuse and neglect of the island by Japan and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   With the summit meeting opening Friday, many Japanese officials
and their U.S. counterparts are now regretting Obuchi's
well-intentioned choice, and are fretting about the potential for
mishap and mayhem in what is ostensibly a sun-drenched paradise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can say that we are all on pins and needles,''
said a Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Although we feel ready for the summit, there is a sinking feeling
in our stomachs that it will either go off without a hitch or there
could be great chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   To the unknowing eye, Okinawa is a haven: a sub-tropical slice
of striking beauty, rich in coral reefs, lush forests, pristine
beaches and blue-green waters.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble lurks not far beneath this shimmering surface. The
recent arrest of a U.S. Marine accused of molesting a sleeping
Okinawan schoolgirl has heightened outrage among islanders who have
vowed to disrupt the summit meeting with massive demonstrations.
About 27,000 angry people formed a human chain Thursday around
Kadena Air Base to protest the presence of U.S. troops on the
island _ a major embarrassment to the decorous host nation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit Okinawa
since it reverted back to Japan from the U.S. military in 1972. On
Friday, the president is scheduled to make a major speech at the
peace monument on this island, which at the end of World War II was
the scene of a fierce battle between the United States and Japanese
troops. Nearly one-third of Okinawa's population was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese security forces, which have deployed 22,000 officers
from across the country to Okinawa, are bracing for a possible
repeat of the violence that erupted during international trade
meetings in the United States in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   And summit meeting organizers have expressed fear that Okinawa,
Japan's poorest and least-developed prefecture, cannot handle the
onslaught of the thousands of foreigners who are expected to attend
the conference. Forecasts of nightmare traffic jams, power
failures, overbooked hotels, faulty telephone lines and seasonal
typhoons abound.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before Japan annexed Okinawa in the early 1600s, the island was
the seat of the Ryukyu Kingdom, which was closely linked to China
and had diplomatic and trade ties with Korea and Southeast Asia.
Because of their multicultural links, Okinawans have their own art
forms, dialect, cuisine and way of life that are distinct from the
homogeneity elsewhere in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the door to Asia for Japan,'' said Ryu Yamazaki, the
foreign ministry spokesman. ``We wanted to introduce the world to
this unique culture which is part of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been host to past meetings of the G8 nations, but in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa is the largest of the small islands that make up the
prefecture, which has a population of 1.2 million people and is
home to about two-thirds of the 45,000 U.S. military personnel in
Japan. Okinawans maintain that they bear an unfair burden because
their island is less than 1 percent of Japan's total area but
contains 75 percent of the U.S. military facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The island also has its share of social problems. Okinawa's
unemployment rate is twice the national average. It has Japan's
lowest household savings rate and lowest per capita income, and the
country's highest teenage pregnancy and divorce rates.
</P>
<P>
   One reason to bring the meeting here was to convince islanders
to accept a much-disputed plan to construct a new U.S. Marine Corps
helicopter base off the coast of Nago. The new heliport will
replace the Futenma Air Station, which is set to be returned to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Okinawans welcomed the closing of the old air station,
which was a major nuisance to local residents, they are adamantly
opposed to allowing the United States to build a new military base.
But the allure of hosting the international summit meeting, with
its economic benefits, was seen as the major factor that persuaded
local Okinawan officials to accept the relocation plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot deny the political benefits of putting the summit
in Okinawa,'' said Yukio Okmoto, a former foreign ministry
official, who served as an adviser to past Japanese governments on
the Okinawa issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the main reason was to bring a new era of thinking to
the Okinawa mentality,'' Okmoto said. ``Okinawa has been shackled
by past history and unable to move forward like the rest of Japan.
Mr. Obuchi thought the summit would be a very important turning
point in the island's history.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many Okinawans have mixed feelings about the summit meeting:
They are delighted that the conference will focus worldwide
attention on them and their culture, but worried that the summit
meeting will be seen as a quick fix for their long-standing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the islanders' dislike of the U.S. military bases is
clear, many expressed great pride that the three-day conference has
come to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the summit, Okinawa will no longer be a question on
`Jeopardy,''' Takada said. ``The world will know us.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the island, government offices, businesses, private homes
and taxi cabs are displaying the flags of the eight nations whose
leaders are attending the summit meeting. The central government
has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to construct new
conference halls, widen roads, refurbish parks and install new
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thing for world leaders to come here and learn
about the Okinawan reality,'' said Yashikazu Tamaki, an Okinawan
assemblymen. ``It's good for Okinawan children because it will give
them a sense of pride and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am worried that leaders like President Clinton will come
to Okinawa and make a speech thanking Okinawans for accepting the
military bases,'' Tamaki said. ``That would be like rubbing salt
into the wounds of Okinawans, because the reality is we don't want
the bases.''

<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Even by the elastic standards politicians use
to measure success, July 13 was an exceptionally good day for Al
Gore. In fact, it was as close to perfect as Gore had experienced
since launching his candidacy for president 13 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, who challenged Gore for the Democratic nomination,
had just enthusiastically endorsed him in front of 1,000
sign-waving, high-decibel supporters at a picturesque old amusement
park on the shore of Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement was news, and the visuals were good, earning
Gore a prominent place on that night's network news. The weather
was sunny and warm. Voters nationwide saw Gore in literally the
best possible light.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a long time, there was a sense of momentum
surrounding Gore and his campaign, an unmistakable optimism that
the campaign _ and the candidate _ were finally hitting their
stride.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as he rode back to Green Bay's airport in his black
limousine, the 52-year-old vice president was surprisingly subdued,
refusing to give in to the exhilaration that surrounded him, even
when asked a softball question about the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of voters respect his judgment and have an
interest in his thoughts and recommendations,'' Gore said of
Bradley. ``So I think it is a very big endorsement that will help
quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the candidate who is famous for keeping his emotions
in check was playing true to form. And in so doing, Gore
highlighted one of the biggest barriers between him and his goal of
being the next president of the United States. Voters, even
stalwart Democrats, have a hard time getting excited about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of voters, Gore is not inspiring; he's wooden,''
said Don Balmer, a professor of political science at Lewis &AMP; Clark
College in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released last week by the independent Pew Research Center
confirmed Balmer's assessment and exposed Gore's dilemma as he
heads toward the Democratic National Convention next month and the
crucial weeks that follow.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that while voters in general are lethargic about
the race, Gore's Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, ``has
an enthusiasm edge over Gore ... particularly within his own party
base.''
</P>
<P>
   It drives Rep. Norm Dicks crazy. Dicks, D-Wash., is one of
Gore's closest friends and has spent enough time with him to see a
side that Gore shields from public view. If only Gore would loosen
up, Dicks says, life would be so much easier for him.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't, and Dicks is at a loss to explain why. ``That's
one of the biggest mysteries I've ever encountered. The guy who I
played basketball with in the gym or sat on the floor with and
chitchatted is a guy with a lot of energy, a lot of personality and
a good sense of humor. He's very witty and quick.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gore would not concede that people find him
difficult to like. ``Even if it were true, it wouldn't be a matter
of great concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because so few people are really focused on the election right
now and where I'm personally involved (to the public), they know me
as vice president, but they don't really know me as a person or as
a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job over the next 3{ months includes introducing myself and
telling them very clearly what my vision for the future of the
country is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for Gore is the lingering questions about his
role in raising money during the 1996 campaign. The Justice
Department and the FBI have recommended that a special prosecutor
be appointed to investigate allegations of illegality, but Attorney
General Janet Reno has declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the attention is focused on a 1996 event Gore attended
at a Buddhist temple where campaign contributions were collected.
Republicans in Congress also have called for a special prosecutor
to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has been linked to 37 ``coffees'' at the White House
that investigators believed were improper fund-raisers. Gore has
told investigators he attended 25 of the events but insists nothing
improper took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not fund-raisers,'' he said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet
The Press.'' ``That's the simple point. And again, this has all
been investigated many times, and I put out the entire transcript
(of his questioning by investigators) of that voluntarily,
completely and fully, so that people can make up their own minds
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a region in the country where the vice president
should be doing well, it is the Northwest, where his experience and
his liberal-to-moderate views on the environment, education, health
care and other issues resonate. Yet a recent poll had him behind by
5 points in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is Gore's natural cautiousness. On issues
important to Washington, such as the preservation of salmon and the
future of Microsoft, he offers answers that only raise more
questions.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Gore had to say in the interview about preserving
salmon and the potential for tearing down four large dams along the
Snake River _ an issue on which there is no middle ground:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have pledged that I would bring together all of the affected
and interested parties, build a science-based consensus in the
Northwest on the best approach to secure the future of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extinction is not an option. Nor is massive economic
dislocation. But with a consensus approach that brings all of the
parties together, I'm confident we can develop a solution that
works for all parties.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Microsoft's future and the government's
anti-trust case against the software maker, Gore offered even less.
``I don't comment on ongoing legal proceedings. It would be
improper of me.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues important to Washington state, such as trade,
Gore's stance is virtually the same as Bush's. Both support
expanding trade to China and opening markets overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Gore is having problems in Oregon and Washington
is indicative of some large problems with his campaign,'' said Tim
Hibbitts, an independent pollster in Portland. ``Why isn't Gore
winning big'' in the Northwest? Hibbitts wonders. ``He's not that
unpleasant an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his aides are trying to figure it out, too. Polls show
that voters agree with his positions on such issues as education,
crime, Social Security, the economy and health care more than they
do with the positions taken by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still other polls show that people are feeling good about the
direction the nation is headed, about the economy and the future.
Yet Gore reaps little benefit from those good feelings, even though
as vice president he had prominent roles in formulating policy.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that Gore is prepared for the job. He has been
vice president for eight years and before that he was a U.S.
senator and a congressman. He served five months in Vietnam as an
Army journalist, going to the front lines ``with an M-16 and a
pencil,'' Gore likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting into politics, he was a newspaper reporter in
Nashville, Tenn. He spent a year of study at a divinity school
before winning a seat in Congress in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being born in Carthage, Tenn., Gore is more a creature
of Washington, D.C.'s power alleys than of the South. His father,
Albert Gore Sr., was a U.S. senator from 1953 through 1970. He
attended one of the capital's most elite prep schools and received
a degree in government with honors from Harvard University in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Gore credits his father with nurturing his political instincts
and ideology. The elder Gore was notable for being one of the
South's few liberals. He supported civil rights and opposed the
Vietnam War. Those views ultimately brought him down.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore Jr. formally announced his candidacy, his speech
included a loving tribute to his father, who died in 1998, and to
his father's last campaign, in 1970. ``His last election was lost _
but his conscience won,'' Gore said. ``He taught me all my life
that that was what really counted. I miss my dad, but I know he's
here in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Less public influences are his wife, Tipper, and his oldest
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff. Gore often seeks their advice
regarding the campaign. Of Tipper, he told USA Today, ``I really
trust her judgment a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A trained psychologist and former newspaper photographer, the
51-year-old Tipper Gore has been called the ``principal power
center in Gore's world'' and plays a major, if quiet, role in many
of Gore's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   They have been married for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna Gore Schiff, at 26 the oldest of Gore's four children,
reaches out to young voters as part of her campaign duties. As for
her political instincts, her father says she has ``nearly perfect
pitch,'' which gives her comments extra weight within the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She also is the mother of Al and Tipper's only grandchild, a boy
born on July 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first go-round for Gore in presidential
politics. In 1988, he won more than 3 million votes in seven states
before dropping out of the race for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is familiar with Washington state. He has visited 15 times
since the 1996 election. Last summer, he and his son, Albert,
climbed Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said having a president with such a
deep understanding of the state is important. ``I'll know that a
year from now if I have a problem with apples in central Washington
I can call a president who gets it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore comes across as guarded, he doesn't shy away from a
political fight. He battered Bradley so aggressively in the
primaries that Bradley called Gore ``dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   He has relentlessly attacks Bush as being a pawn of the gun
lobby, ``big oil'' and the wealthiest of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Bush was compassionate, as the Republican
claims, Gore said, ``I don't really know him personally, so I can't
comment on his personal attributes. I don't think the policies he's
followed tend to be compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly not toward the children who have to go without
health insurance in larger numbers in Texas than in any of our
other 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly not for those who are breathing in the worst air
pollution in any state because of sweetheart deals with the big oil
companies. ... I could go on, but I think you get the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he chose a life of public service, Gore became
animated for the first time in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``A life of public service? Oh, my gosh. I talked to a woman two
days ago who is blind because of diabetes she got 10 years ago. I
want to raise the amount of research funding to speed the finding
of a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman is a senior citizen, and she talked about the
prescription drug bill. She was really near desperation because she
couldn't afford to pay for her prescription and still have enough
money to buy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing a prescription drug benefit and getting that woman the
health care she deserves would make any kind work and sacrifice
worthwhile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his senior advisers are hoping that people will be
swayed not by Bush's easy backslapping but by Gore's experience,
his strong Democratic credentials and most of all, his promise for
``a fresh start, a new president who has the willingness to fight
for the working people; and serve the people instead of the
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about me,'' Gore said in the interview. ``It's not
about George W. Bush. It's about the future of America. It's about
the American people and I have great confidence in the judgment of
the American people. ``I strongly believe that the positions that I
have had ... for almost a quarter of a century now are far more in
tune with what the American people want than the views on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident of that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: DISCERNING SCOTS STUDY TIGER'S GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Out near the ninth green of the Old
Course, an elderly Scot suddenly shook his head and asked, ``Why
are there so many people?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods,'' he was told, ``is in the next group.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the 24-year-old U.S. Open champion had made eight
quiet pars, all those people following him had not made much noise.
The Scots never do. Tom Weiskopf, who won the 1973 British Open at
Troon, once assumed his blind shot at a Scottish course would be
close to the hole, but when he and Jack Nicklaus arrived at the
green, his ball was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is,'' Nicklaus finally said. ``In the cup.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way off the green, Weiskopf looked over at the gallery of
Scots and asked, ``Did anyone see the ball go in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you clap?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a practice round.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Woods shot a 5-under 67 in Thursday's opening round of
the 126th British Open, the Scots were equally discerning. It was
as if they were examining a new high-tech timepiece to learn what
makes it tick.
</P>
<P>
   Some stopped at the concession stands to munch fish and chips,
chicken and chips, burgers, sausages and sandwiches while drinking
soda (``That's one fifty, love,'' the counter lady said) and
McEwan's Export ale, advertised as ``the perfect round.'' But
mostly they were quietly studying the golfer in the black cap, gray
shirt, black vest, black slacks and black shoes who has changed the
game that Scottish pros brought to America a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the Scots were studying how Woods would adapt his
power to the nuances of seaside-links golf, especially at the Old
Course, with its steep-walled bunkers. But Thursday, he was never
in a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, as Woods' pitching wedge spun to within 12 feet on the
352-yard ninth hole, the applause was firmer. When he made the putt
for his first birdie, he was accorded a quick burst of applause
that resembled the weather _ sunny and warm. ``All right, Tiger,''
someone even yelled.
</P>
<P>
   If he had made that birdie at the Masters, the roar would have
shaken Augusta National's cathedral pines.
</P>
<P>
   If he had made that birdie at the recent U.S. Open at Pebble
Beach, the roar would have rolled across Carmel Bay like the surf.
</P>
<P>
   At the Old Course at St. Andrews Thursday, the only roar was
when Royal Air Force fighter jets took off from the Leuchers air
base across the Firth of Tay.
</P>
<P>
   But even without U.S. sound effects, that first birdie seemed to
energize Tiger Woods. On his way to the 10th tee, he had a quicker
spring in his step. He hadn't used his driver since the sixth tee
but now he crushed a tee shot that rolled across the hard, fast
fairway to within a few yards of the huge green on the 379-yard
hole and prompted an ``ooooh'' from the gallery. And when his
50-yard putt stopped about 10 feet from the cup, he earned a burst
of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understood and appreciated that it was a good putt,'' he
said later. ``They know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scots also seemed to know that Woods was on the move now.
After a par at the 174-yard 11th, he birdied the 314-yard 12th with
a driver and two putts. Counting his par at the 175-yard eighth, he
suddenly had five consecutive 3s.
</P>
<P>
   After another 300-yard drive on the 14th, he surveyed the Hell
Bunker where Jack Nicklaus took five to get out en route to a 10 in
the 1995 Open and where an U.S. tourist once turned to his Scottish
caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I carry that Hell Bunker?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it, sir. It probably weighs 20 tons.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods carried those 20 tons. He pounded a 3-wood onto the green
and two-putted for another birdie. At the 456-yard 15th, a driver
and a 9-iron to 10 feet of the hole created his fifth birdie. But
with people peering out of the windows of the Old Course Hotel, a
pulled 3-wood off the tee on the 17th, the dreaded ``Road Hole,''
preceded his best shot of the round _ a slashed 160-yard escape
from the heather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hit it hard with my right hand, then again
hold on with my left,'' he explained later. ``You have to open up
the face because you know the grass is not going to grab the
clubhead, it's going to grab the shaft. That's the trick to it. You
need to hit it hard and hold on so you don't flip it. It was a
delicate balance I was trying to find.''
</P>
<P>
   When his ball soared to just short of the green, and then he
putted to within a foot to save par, the Scots understood and
appreciated what he had done. They even applauded.

GEORGE W. BUSH A MAN `AT EASE WITH HIMSELF' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As a senator's grandson, son of a president and
the Republicans' soon-to-be nominee for the White House, George W.
Bush comes from an American political dynasty that extends the
velvet glove but knows how to use a fist of steel.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor bills himself as a ``compassionate
conservative'' who promises education policies that will leave no
child behind, just as his father, George Bush, spoke of ``a kinder,
gentler America'' in 1988 and pledged to be the ``education
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes basic Republican principles and adds a soft edge to
them,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., chairwoman of this year's
Bush campaign in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But George W. Bush also delights in being seen as a tough guy
and recalling what happened to those who underestimated him. ``In
1994 I was diminished,'' he said in a recent interview here,
referring to the campaign in which incumbent Texas Gov. Ann
Richards dubbed him ``shrub.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been living with the name `George Bush' all my life, I'm
proud of it,'' added Bush. He unseated the popular Richards.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Texas governor comes from a line of Connecticut
Yankees transplanted to the Oil Patch. The Bushes have long put
emphasis on personal generosity, proper behavior and public
service. But they also fight to win and rarely forget a slight.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was given the nickname ``Junior'' behind his back
when serving as a sometime political troubleshooter in his father's
campaigns and presidential administration. He was the
enforcer-gatekeeper who briefly shut off Newsweek magazine's access
after it ran a campaign profile with the cover headline ``Fighting
the Wimp Factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1992 campaign, he performed an unpleasant deed that
his father could not bring himself to do _ telling the abrasive
White House chief of staff, John Sununu, it was time to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he enjoyed playing the role of enforcer,'' said Molly
Ivins, the populist Texas newspaper columnist and co-author of an
unflattering biography of George W.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Bush took no prisoners in his 1988 quest for the
White House, depicting Bob Dole as a tax-raiser and blaming Michael
Dukakis for crimes committed by furloughed Massachusetts convict
Willie Horton. Four years earlier, after a debate with Democratic
vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro, he boasted that he
``kicked a little ass last night.''
</P>
<P>
   His son turned around the race for this year's Republican
nomination in the South Carolina primary by unleashing leaders of
the Religious Right who conducted a highly negative, personal
campaign against John McCain. The Arizona senator had beaten Bush
in the lead New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a tough competitor, by the way,'' Bush said. ``That's what
the primaries showed, that I could take a punch and come back.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one political difference between father and son. Vice
president Bush abandoned the Pacific Northwest late in 1988 and
again in the '92 campaign. He drew such raucous protests that at
one point aides nicknamed Portland ``the Beirut of America'' after
anarchists overturned trash cans and burned a U.S. flag outside a
hotel where he was speaking.
</P>
<P>
   But his son is targeting Washington and Oregon, pledging in
particular that he will resume the logging of ``a reasonable amount
of board feet'' out of national forests in the Northwest and that
he will not try to restore salmon runs by breaching four dams on
the lower Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point is, we can have both salmon runs and hydroelectric
energy by having salmon-friendly turbines,'' Bush said. He has
discussed Northwest issues to the point where, after answering
questions from donors at a recent fund-raiser here, he quipped:
``Quite a policy wonk, aren't I?''
</P>
<P>
   It's music to the ears of GOP Sen. Slade Gorton, who faces a
tough re-election race and wants to roll back Clinton
administration environmental policies. ``Between Jennifer (Dunn)
and me, we will have an excellent ear in the White House,'' Gorton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is a person very much at ease with people more
intellectual than he,'' Gorton added. ``He listens, he absorbs
ideas, and then he makes up his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is not universally shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extent to which (Bush) has never thought about many things
is awesome,'' Ivins joked. She said Bush depends heavily on an
``iron triangle'' of advisers _ campaign chief Karl Rove,
communications director Karen Hughes (who ghost-wrote Bush's
autobiography) and an old Midland, Texas, friend named Don Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is promising he would bring to the White House a targeted,
somewhat minimalist agenda, following a pattern he established
after entering the Texas governor's office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will spend my capital on entitlement (Social Security and
Medicare) reform, tax cuts, education and restoring our military
strength,'' he said. ``American presidents can't be all things to
all people and get anything done. The American people understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the agenda is domestic, in contrast to his father, who
was most comfortable dealing with foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in fairness to his father, he had no experience at
the state level. Governor Bush has had to deal with these issues,''
said Craig Berkman, a Portland venture capitalist and fund-raiser
in the presidential campaigns of both father and son.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush has caused the greatest stir with his plan to overhaul
and partially privatize Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   He would allow workers to invest a portion of their payroll
taxes in personal retirement accounts. They would get to choose
among a diversified set of stock and bond portfolios. After
retirement, investors would be required to convert some of their
accounts into securities that pay regular benefits, like Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to make deep cuts in America's nuclear weapons
arsenal and to remove some U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles
from what he recently called ``hair-trigger'' alert status.
</P>
<P>
   But he would also spend billions to put in place a missile
defense system far more ambitious than the one the Clinton
administration is pondering. It would aim to protect not just the
United States, but also Europe, Israel and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is straightforward on education. He would give local school
districts far more latitude over how federal education dollars are
spent. But he would require tests to prove that ``we are seeing
results,'' particularly on reading and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Texas as example, however, critics fear that Bush as
president would withhold funding from other important issues, such
as air and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, ``he has never made the environment a priority. ...
He thinks business and industry will do the right thing on the
environment in keeping with his laissez faire attitude on
government,'' said Ken Kramer, director of the Lone Star chapter of
the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Houston overtook Los Angeles as the nation's
smoggiest city. The nation's oil and petrochemical capital
registered 52 days when ground-level ozone, the main ingredient in
smog, exceeded the national health standard's maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush bristles at talk of pollution in his state's largest city.
``Houston, Texas, is a booming town,'' he said. ``It's an auto
town. What's not reported is that a Clinton appointee to EPA says
air quality in Texas has improved over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things are so lousy, why did I get 70 percent of the vote''
in his 1998 re-election race? he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did sign legislation last year that will require utilities
``grandfathered'' out of the state's clean air act to install
state-of-the-art pollution control equipment by 2003. The bill was
stronger than proposed by Bush, who originally asked Exxon and
Marathon Oil executives to ``develop the concept of a voluntary
program to permit grandfathered facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Northwest, Pat Ford of Save Our Wild Salmon questions
Bush's understanding of the ``salmon-friendly turbines'' that will
supposedly solve the salmon crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an anecdotal recovery plan,'' Ford said. ``The turbines
will kill fewer fish. That's all. They will also cost almost as
much as removing the dams. You are talking on the order of $20
million per turbine, with more than 50 turbines.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office in Austin reflects its occupant. A pair of
glass-paneled wooden cabinets contain Bush's collection of 250
baseballs, autographed by ballplayers and other figures. Bush
bought a small share of the Texas Rangers in 1989 for $606,000 and
was designated by fellow owners as the public face of the
franchise. The Rangers prospered in the field, and the city of
Arlington built the team a $190 million stadium (of which the
Rangers paid about $50 million). In 1998 the governor sold his
share of the Rangers for $14.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Behind his desk, a framed picture shows toddler George W. Bush
with his parents and grandparents, Connecticut Sen. Prescott Bush
and Dorothy Walker Bush, at the Midland airport.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the office is an 1830s painting of Texas'
founder, Sam Houston, depicted in a toga and captioned, ``Sam
Houston as Marius Among the Ruins of Carthage.'' Houston was down
on his luck when artist Washington Cooper painted him. Bush tells
visitors that he keeps the painting as a reminder of what drink can
do to even an outstanding public figure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has talked in general terms of his ``young and
irresponsible years,'' while declining to give the press any fodder
on the rumors of past drug use that have popped up since his first
gubernatorial campaign in 1994. His staff is extremely sensitive
about a biography, ``First Son,'' published late last year by Bill
Minutaglio, a writer with The Dallas Morning News. It depicts Bush
as a Yale student in the 1960s, a party boy oblivious to the social
ferment of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Bush quit drinking 14 years ago under the quiet, firm influence
of his wife, Laura. A former librarian, she calls him ``Bushy'' and
is known as a calming influence on a man nicknamed by friends
``Bombastic Bushkin'' after a Johnny Carson character.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appears to be, as Gorton put it after a visit to Austin,
``very much at ease with himself.'' Asked how he would keep from
getting an exalted view of himself in the White House, Bush
replied: ``The answer is based on the internal soul of the person
running.''
</P>
<P>
   The presumed GOP nominee is a reborn Christian, an advocate of
what he calls ``faith-based programs'' in which churches help ease
the impact of welfare cuts. The elder Bush is an active
Episcopalian; his son has followed Laura into the Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not an orator. He has inherited his father's habit of
mangling words. He once referred to the people of Greece as
``Grecians.'' In the interview, he talked about how a death penalty
case ``had full analyzation'' but had inspired ``emotionality.''
</P>
<P>
   But he can wax eloquent on faith, as in a recent speech at the
Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. ``For all its flaws, I
believe our nation is chosen by God and commissioned by history to
be a model to the world of justice and inclusion and diversity
without division,'' Bush declared.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however, the same politician who opposed legislation to
ban the execution of mentally retarded defendants and vetoed a bill
to require appointment of legal counsel within 20 days for people
who cannot afford a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a Talk magazine interview, Bush mocked Karla Faye Tucker, the
first woman executed in Texas in more than a century, as she
unsuccessfully pleaded for clemency. He imitated her, whimpering,
``Please don't kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he opposed legislation setting down criteria in
considerations of clemency for death row inmates, Bush saw it as
entirely consistent with his philosophy, saying: ``Government's
role is not to try to judge heart. That's up to somebody higher, a
higher authority than government.''

&HT;     CHARTER SCHOOLS FARE NO BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL ONES ON STATE
TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Statewide test scores released this week show
charter schools in the San Francisco Bay area generally doing no
better than traditional public schools at improving student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of second-grade reading, math, language and
spelling scores of the region's charter schools with second-grade
statewide averages shows charter schools faring slightly better in
reading and math and slightly worse in writing and spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Of 16 Bay-area charter schools that tested second-graders in
reading, scores at nine schools were higher and seven were lower
than the statewide reading average.
</P>
<P>
   Of 17 charter schools that reported second-grade math scores,
nine were higher and eight lower than the statewide math average.
In spelling, scores at 10 schools were lower and seven were higher.
In language, scores at nine schools were lower and eight higher.
</P>
<P>
   The results come at a time when charter schools are embraced as
a panacea for public education and are opening at the rate of 10
per month. With about 85,000 children in 263 schools, California
boasts the nation's largest charter school enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about charter schools being the magic bullet,
what these scores tell us is that we're not seeing stark
differences between charters and traditional public schools,'' said
Luis Huerta, a research associate at Policy Analysis for California
Education and co-author of the forthcoming book ``Inside Charter
Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see half gains and half losses, with charter schools
scoring comparably to traditional schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scores for 4.3 million students in nearly 8,000 schools were
released Monday by the California Department of Education. In its
third year, the multiple-choice Stanford 9 exam is given to
students in grades 2 through 11. In the exam, a score of 50 is the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   The scores for charter schools in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin,
Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Solano and Sonoma counties show
general teaching strengths and weaknesses by academic subject. They
also reveal extreme inconsistencies from grade to grade and subject
to subject within schools.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples of Bay-area charter schools where grades vary
from subject to subject include:
</P>
<P>
   _ At Novato Unified Charter in Marin County, only 18 percent of
second-graders scored at or above the national average in reading.
In spelling, kids did even worse: 14 percent met or surpassed the
national average. In math and language, the same second-grade class
performed better. Sixty-eight percent scored at or above the
national average in math; 45 percent were at the national average
in language.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Cali Calmecac Charter in Windsor in Sonoma County, 27
percent of second-graders read at or above the national average,
compared with 66 percent in math, 45 percent in language and 14
percent in spelling.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Creative Arts Charter in San Francisco, 79 percent of
second-graders met or exceeded the national average in reading,
compared with 33 percent in math, 19 percent in language and 13
percent in spelling.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Edison Charter Academy, also in San Francisco, 39
percent of second-graders read at or above the national average,
compared with 58 percent in math, 18 percent in language and 34
percent in spelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inconsistencies are important to look at,'' Huerta said.
``Many charters try to break away from the norm. These are usually
organizational differences, but there are also curricular
differences. Some of those differences may explain the
inconsistencies in test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a contradiction here,'' Huerta said, ``in that charter
schools are given local freedom and innovation to create something
new. But, at the same time, they're bound by this state test, which
is very standardized and may not fit the mission or objectives of a
charter school.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are publicly funded, but free from many state
and local regulations. Proponents say such schools offer parents
more choices and give educators the freedom to innovate. These
innovations may be picked up by traditional public schools,
proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco school board member Dan Kelly has said charter
schools aren't the cure for what ails public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, charter schools haven't been particularly
innovative or striking as a group,'' Kelly said. ``The biggest
difference is that charters have autonomy from the school district.
That may be good, it may be poor. They have great opportunity to
succeed _ or to fail, in a big way.''

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Now it can be told: Hugh Jackman used to walk around
the house with steel blades protruding from his knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those
claws, to get used to them,'' Jackman said. ``I've got scars on one
leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a
bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned.''
</P>
<P>
   The process by which one of the thousands of aspiring young
actors from all over the world first breaks out of the Hollywood
pack and then somehow rises to stardom is difficult to handicap.
Every year a dozen or so fresh names are offered up as the next hot
things and given the big push by the major studios and the top
publicity firms, and nine times out of 10, they fall short of the
golden ring. But every now and then, something clicks, and at the
moment something seems to be clicking for Hugh Jackman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackman, 32, is an affable and accomplished Australian actor
with a background in musical theater. His performance as Wolverine,
the central character in ``X-Men,'' has transformed him from
another face in the ensemble to a name above the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I thought when I read the script was, `Get me
to a gym,''' Jackman said. ``It's pretty physical. We worked a lot
on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial
arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early
fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that
seemed right for Wolverine.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who are not ``X-Men''-literate, the story is set in
the near future, when the next stage in human evolution has begun.
Every now and then, mutants are born with weird, often
uncontrollable powers. Non-mutants hate and fear them and want to
destroy them or, worse, regulate them.
</P>
<P>
   Wolverine has the ability to heal himself almost instantly. In
addition, sometime in his past (he can't remember) someone operated
on him and implanted a steel skeleton that causes razor-sharp
blades to protrude from his hands whenever someone ticks him off.
</P>
<P>
   So he's a little tense. Tread carefully.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Jackman is in New York, beginning work on a new
film, ``Animal Husbandry,'' opposite Ashley Judd, another recent
example of a young star bursting through the ranks. It's a romantic
comedy. ``No hair, no claws,'' Jackman said.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he would take a little time this week, though, to go
to one of the theaters in Manhattan showing ``X-Men'' and watch it
with a paying audience. ``I want to hear them cheering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AN EVOLVING CAREER
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Reitman has become almost the grand old man of comedy in
Hollywood. It seems as if it was only a couple of weeks ago that he
was hanging out with the Ghostbusters. And now, after a three-year
hiatus from directing, during which he got his new production
company, Montecito Films, off the ground, Reitman is going back
behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution'' will be a grand-scale, special-effects comedy _
his old ``Ghostbusters'' stomping ground _ with a story that
contains echoes of ``X-Men,'' about a fresh burst in evolution that
leads to the sudden appearance of strange creatures. But no one is
watching Mike Tyson fights to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we want to design new creatures that make sense and
aren't just silly, like a head with a hand sticking out of it, but
something that makes some cognitive sense,'' Reitman said.
</P>
<P>
   He's just about to send the script to actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for any major movie stars or comedy stars,
just really funny people who will make the story work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with luck, ``Evolution'' will be in theaters by mid- or late
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people sometimes get carried away with special
effects,'' Reitman said. ``The key to this movie will be that, in
the end, it's a comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   NORMAL IN HOLLYWOOD
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Paradis set a bottle of water to one side and leaned
forward, her hands clasped between her thighs, as if she were
chilly: ``It's great to be here in Los Angeles because I can just
be normal here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Normal is an interesting concept for the serious and earnest
Paradis, a model turned pop singer turned actress who stars in
Patrice Leconte's ``Girl on the Bridge.'' Paradis, 28, was a
teen-ager when a chance encounter at a recording studio in France
resulted in her first record, ``Joe le Taxi,'' which became a huge
bubble-gum hit all over Europe in the late 1980s. In 1989, she won
a Cesar, the French equivalent of the Oscar, for her supporting
role in ``White Wedding,'' playing a troubled teen-ager who seduces
and destroys the teacher who tried to help her. And she has been a
regular face in television and magazine advertisements. Together,
they have brought a celebrity that does not always make her
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In France, I don't know, it's the look on people's faces,''
she said. ``Being looked at, being pointed at, being talked about
when you are only an inch away. Here I can feel like a human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Paradis can do that here, in the United States, is
that until now her celebrity has not crossed the Atlantic, at least
with anything like the intensity it enjoys in Europe. That's fine
with her, she said. She needs a place to be normal.
</P>
<P>
   She was sitting around a chipped, weathered dining table in a
side room at the Chateau Marmont Hotel on the Sunset Strip. She was
in town to conclude some mixing work on her latest album, to be
released in Europe later this year, to promote ``Girl on the
Bridge,'' which has a limited U.S. premiere in New York and a few
other cities next July 28, and just to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is one of the three cities where Paradis and her
husband, the actor Johnny Depp, maintain residences. (Paris and New
York are the others.) They have a 14-month-old daughter, Lily-Rose
Melody, and she said they were expecting another baby in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the film Paradis plays Adele, another young and troubled
woman. This one is stopped from hurling herself off a bridge by a
circus knife-thrower who recruits his assistants from the ranks of
the suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not as pure and smart as Adele is,'' Paradis said. ``When
I read the part, there was not one word that I wanted to change.''
</P>
<P>
   What did stop her, at least for a moment, was that the film
opens with Adele delivering an eight-page monologue directly into
the camera. But in the end, she took a deep breath, focused and,
with the help of Leconte, with whom she also worked on the 1998
``Half a Chance,'' she nailed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I must be honest,'' Paradis said. ``I was so afraid.'' &QL;

`MOTHER OF THE BRIDE': A MARTYR TO MATRIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 By BEN STEELMAN   
 The Morning Star, Wilmington, N.C.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to Spencer Tracy and Steve Martin, the plight of the
father of the bride has been amply documented. But what about Mom?
</P>
<P>
   Joan Bennett and even Diane Keaton, for Pete's sake, seemed to
take it all so calmly, totally in control at all times.
</P>
<P>
   According to certified m.o.b. Ilene Beckerman, don't believe it
for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' she writes, ``childbirth was easier
than being the mother of the bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, put another way, ``My mother-of-the-bride story begins with
the conception of my daughter, which took about five seconds;
briefly covers my pregnancy, which took the usual nine months; and
ends with the planning of my daughter's wedding, which took a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckerman, a sometime resident of New Jersey, didn't begin
writing until she was past 60 but made up for lost time fast. In
``Love, Loss and What I Wore'' (Algonquin Books, 1995), she told
the entire story of her life based on her favorite clothes, from
her Brownie uniform to the Diane von Furstenberg wrap. In ``Mother
of the Bride,'' subtitled ``The Dream, the Reality, The Search for
a Perfect Dress,'' she writes epigrammatically, in a style that
falls somewhere between Erma Bombeck and Dorothy Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do five girls _ one short, one tall, one buxom, one flat,
one who gave birth a month ago _ have in common?'' she asks. ``A
bridesmaid's dress they all hate.''
</P>
<P>
   She illustrates her work as well, in a style that falls
somewhere between Dilbert's Scott Adams and The New Yorker's Roz
Chast.
</P>
<P>
   Her observations are prickly yet pointed, as in the hunt for the
ideal m.o.b. dress: ``I finally found something. It showed a little
cleavage. I learned a long time ago, if you show a little cleavage,
nobody ever looks anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   She also quickly discovers the principle that Mothers of Brides
can do nothing right, except open their checkbooks and shut their
mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how to act with my daughter anymore. I had to
watch my words. I had to watch my tone of voice. Once she was
inside my body. Now I was getting under her skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sibling rivalry rears its ugly head: `` `If I have to
spend one more minute talking about her wedding,' I heard her
sister say, `I'll tell the whole world she used to pick her nose
and eat it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And between everything else, such as the Great Shower Debate,
Mom can't help wondering what happened to adorable little girl she
once knew, ``how she stood on a kitchen chair and sang all the
words to every song in the third-grade play but was too shy to even
move her lips onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a good dessert souffle, ``Mother of the Bride'' is light,
frothy, tart enough not to be too syrupy-sweet and so delicate,
it's a marvel it didn't fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   And it is absolutely on key. My wife, who's marrying off her own
daughter in December, swears that every word is true.
</P>
<P>
   Wedding season is almost over, but there's still time to buy
this little gem as a thank-you present for the unsung heroine of
every summer nuptial.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Ilene Beckerman points out, nobody will ever love
you as much as your mother. Nobody. Not even your dog. And to a
95-year-old woman, her 70-year-old daughter will always be her
baby.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today's puzzler: The family (plus a couple of interlopers) is
gathered for a holiday dinner. Grandpa stands up to speak. ``In
this wonderful country,'' he says, ``our family has been blessed.
We have prospered. Our wonderful children have married wonderful
partners and given us many wonderful grandchildren. Your
grandmother and I love you all very much.''
</P>
<P>
   He then goes around the table giving each family member and
in-law (but not, alas, the interlopers) a kiss and an envelope
containing two checks.
</P>
<P>
   Question: What was the amount on the checks?
</P>
<P>
   Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.
</P>
<P>
   Time's up. The answer: The checks were all for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egad, Holmes! How in blazes did you know that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elementary, my dear Watson. The two checks were the vital
clue. Why two? Because the law exempts gifts of up to $10,000 a
year, per recipient, from the confounded Estate and Gift Tax _ or
'death tax,' as the Republicans so wittily call it. The
grandparents were clearly attempting to take maximum advantage of
this law by issuing separate checks from each of them to each
family member. Inclusion of the in-laws merely confirms the
hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think, Watson! If Grandpa and Grandma do this for just 10
years, with four children, their spouses, and 12 grandchildren, $4
million will escape the clutches of the big-spending Democrats!''
</P>
<P>
   Even by current low standards, the campaign to abolish the
estate tax has been remarkably disingenuous. It does not take
Sherlock Holmes to know that with a minimum of foresight and
offspring, and no fancy footwork, you can pass on several million
dollars tax-free _ not the official exemption of $675,000 (already
scheduled to rise to $1 million).
</P>
<P>
   But the most deceptive argument in the debate is that it is
unfair to tax the same money twice _ once when you earn it and
again when you die.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the Friday, July 14 edition of the Wall Street
Journal, economist Martin Feldstein grandly calculates that if you
start with $1,000, you pay income tax on it, you sock it away for
30 years and pay income tax on the interest, then you die and your
estate pays the death tax ... the effective tax rate on your $1,000
is a shocking 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein calls this ``very unfair.'' And maybe it would be, if
it ever happened. Professor Feldstein has surely made far more than
$1 million over the years telling wealthy Republicans things they
like to hear. May he live long and prosper. But were he struck down
tomorrow _ possibly by the sight of President Clinton vetoing
Congress' estate tax abolition bill _ I bet there aren't many
dollars in his estate that will have come through a tax gantlet of
anything like 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that most of the accumulated wealth that is subject
to the estate tax was never taxed at all as income. Repeat: never
taxed at all. If the estate tax is abolished, the average
billionaire's billion-and-first dollar will be subject to a
cumulative tax rate of zero. By comparison, the very first dollar
earned by someone frying burgers at McDonald's is subject to the
FICA tax of about 15 percent (Investment income is exempt from
FICA).
</P>
<P>
   Tendentious comparisons of this sort are often dismissed these
days as outmoded ``class warfare,'' unless the complaint is about
unfairness to the rich. Nevertheless, taxing Dollar one at 15
percent and Dollar billion-and-one at zero percent seems, to quote
Feldstein, ``very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason most inherited wealth was never taxed as income is
that it consists of so-called ``appreciated property.'' The
simplest example is shares of stock. If you buy at $100 and die at
$120, your $20 profit is never taxed as income. When your heirs
sell the stock, their profit is calculated as if they bought at
$120
</P>
<P>
   Stocks aren't the best example, though. The best examples are
the poster children of the campaign to abolish the estate tax:
farmers, ``small''-business owners, and people who have suffered
the terrible tragedy of buying a house cheap and watching it become
phenomenally valuable. When the owners die, not a penny of the
value of these farms, businesses, and houses has ever been subject
to the income tax.
</P>
<P>
   We can have a metaphysical argument about whether this is fair
or not. But it is simply wrong to say that subjecting these assets
to the estate tax means taxing them twice.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Feldstein claims that abolishing the estate tax would
actually increase total tax revenues. By cherished Republican
tradition, this Free Lunch Guarantee must be part of the argument
for any tax cut. Feldstein _ actually, the most sober of leading
Republican economists _ at first hangs a nervous little
``probably'' on it, but the assertion gains certitude with
repetition.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does he figure? The usual free-lunch argument is that
lowering the tax on some activity will stimulate more of that
activity. But the proposition that lower death duties will
encourage more people to die is both implausible and unappealing.
There's also the problem that a tax rate of zero will not bring in
any revenue no matter how stimulating it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein, undeterred, tries a new twist: The estate tax, he
argues, encourages people to make deductible contributions to
charity, so abolishing the estate tax will make them stingier,
which will mean fewer income-tax dollars lost to the charitable
deduction. Possibly true, but I'd like to see the Republicans this
fall campaigning on a call to increase tax revenues by discouraging
donations to charity.
</P>
<P>
   As a special treat, Feldstein throws in a similar argument that
abolishing the estate tax will encourage rich parents to hoard
their wealth until the end, rather than helping out their children
in lower income-tax brackets. Another good one for the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa is right: This country has been good to most of us _ and
spectacularly good to a few. Is it really so unreasonable for the
luckiest 2 percent to pay some taxes on their good fortunes at
least once in a lifetime? Even if they happen to be farmers or
small-business owners or winners of the real-estate lottery?

CLIMBING RAINIER TAKES GOOD TRAINING, GUIDES AND LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY E. NEVALA  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ I grew up in southern Michigan, where the highest
elevation within 40 miles of my home was the top floor of a
downtown parking garage. Mountain climbing never made my athletic
resume, and after relocating to Seattle I considered the Cascade
Range just a pretty backdrop for cycling and snowshoeing.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in March, when I paused before an American Lung
Association poster featuring a smiling woman gripping an ice ax
near the top of Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure of climbing one of the highest peaks in the United
States intrigued me. I talked to Rainier climbers, read books on
the topic, then nervously began training to take part in the
Washington Lung Association's annual fund-raiser, Climb for Clean
Air.
</P>
<P>
   My rookie jitters diminished when I discovered that our route
from Paradise, the mountain's most popular base-to-summit
trailhead, was not technical. Although the climb requires ropes,
crampons, ice axes and helmets above 10,000 feet, it does not
involve scaling rocks and cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   Most described the two-day, round-trip climb as a long, steady
march.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climbing Mount Rainier is a lot like climbing stairs,'' said
famed Rainier guide Lou Whittaker. His guide outfit, Rainier
Mountaineering Inc., begins the ascent at Paradise at 5,400 feet
and includes a lengthy evening rest stop at Camp Muir at 10,000
feet before a midnight attempt on the 14,411-foot summit.
</P>
<P>
   The early start for the top ensures a cold, firm climbing
surface, reducing the risk of rock- and icefall and allowing for a
timely descent. The group returns to Paradise the same day as the
summit attempt.
</P>
<P>
   To train I upped my aerobic activity. Weekdays I swam, cycled
and jogged, and on weekends I hiked Mount Si near North Bend. As
the climb date approached, before work each day I threw on a pack
stuffed with a water-filled milk carton and an eight-pound
``Encyclopedia of Mammals'' and trudged up and down Queen Anne
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Twice I drove to Paradise for practice hikes to Camp Muir. My
cousin's 21-pound baby boy even helped with workouts, riding in a
backpack koala-style to the top of Tiger Mountain outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While guides direct climbers' every move on the mountain, this
risky sport requires safety training. A month before my climb, I
spent a Saturday with the RMI guides at Paradise to learn ice-ax
handling and rope-team etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to avoid the label ``dope on a rope.''
</P>
<P>
   We practiced self-arrest, purposely hurtling our bodies down the
slope headfirst and upside down, then stopping falls with our axes
and kicking our plastic boot toes into the snow for bracing.
</P>
<P>
   The guides emphasized two tips for a successful climb: a type of
walking called the rest step, and pressure breathing.
</P>
<P>
   To learn the rest step, one guide suggested we ``walk like a
stork.'' The front foot quickly steps forward, while the straight
back leg pauses and holds the body weight, allowing skeletal
support. Repeated again and again and those restful pauses add up.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the rest step with pressure breathing _ normal
inhaling followed by hard, whoooshing exhaling that rids the lungs
of excess carbon dioxide _ has helped thousands of climbers to
mountain summits much higher than Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick is to consume plenty of water and food. Eating at
altitude doesn't always appeal, since many climbers' stomachs start
to hula. So RMI guides emphasize favorite foods over healthier
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're certainly not going to gain weight on this climb,''
they said. ``Bring whatever you will put in your mouth and
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   And so I carried phad thai noodles, pretzels, chocolate energy
bars, Fig Newtons and M&AMP;Ms tucked in 30 pounds of gear when I
departed Paradise on a sunny Thursday morning with 23 teammates and
six RMI guides.
</P>
<P>
   We switchbacked in shorts and T-shirts single file for the first
couple of miles. After skirting crumbly rocks at Pebble Creek, we
hiked straight up the Muir Snowfield, a giant white mat of treeless
landscape. After each hour of hiking, we stopped for a 15-minute
break to eat, drink, adjust clothing layers and apply sunblock.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at Camp Muir at 10,000 feet in five hours, thrilled
by the sight of the modest A-frame ranger hut, boxy bunkhouse,
stone cookhouse and three outhouses. A dinner of spaghetti, red
sauce and corn revived us. After eating, RMI guide Brent Okita
detailed the terrain and weather conditions for the summit attempt,
then shooed us to bed at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Light sleepers found no mercy from snoring, stinky, restless
climbers as we lay in cozy bundles within the bunkhouse's plywood
shell. Most climbers were wide-eyed when Okita gave the wake-up
call at 12:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Good-natured chaos followed in the college-dorm-size room as 24
climbers scrambled out of sleeping bags, layered their clothing,
cinched plastic boots and adjusted harnesses and helmets. I gulped
hot peach oatmeal before retrieving my pack outside.
</P>
<P>
   My hands shook as I reloaded snacks, fleece shirts and a
Gore-Tex jacket. It was nerves, not cold. The climbing conditions
were ideal, with the temperature around 30 degrees and only a
gentle swirl of wind.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Okita announced the climbing teams, guide-led
groups of five and six people mixed and matched according to
strength and ability. Before roping to my team, I swapped my
climbing poles for an ice ax and laced on crampons _ metal spikes
attached to boots to give traction on the glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   Guides double-checked our harnesses and headlamps and we were
the first RMI team to walk away from Camp Muir at 1:54 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A glittering quilt of stars draped the sky and my stress eased
as I breathed the cool air. I relaxed my white-knuckled hold on my
section of rope _ our guide, my five teammates and I were each
separated by 30 feet. The trail ahead resembled a miniature
highway, the path brightened by headlamps from independent climbers
who started even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes of gentle hills over ice-crusted snow, we hit
Cathedral Gap, a nasty, steep outcropping of loose dirt and
fist-size volcanic rock. We spent 40 minutes picking through when,
at 11,000 feet, I snagged my crampon. I stumbled, my right knee and
shin crunching on sharp rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get up, we have to go,'' called Okita from his lead position.
With 200 Rainier summits notched on his climbing belt, he knew this
route. And I knew he wasn't kidding. Rockfall was a danger here.
</P>
<P>
   We hustled another 200 feet to our first rest stop. I palmed my
knee and felt the swell beneath my climbing pants. With a triathlon
and several bicycle trips scheduled _ in addition to a 9,000-foot
descent _ I needed a healthy leg.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked and disappointed, I knew my summit would have to come
another day.
</P>
<P>
   As a pink and orange sunrise lit craggy Little Tahoma, I turned
back with a guide and another climber suffering from altitude
sickness. My teammates walked on to complete what many later called
the most difficult physical challenge of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   For the next five hours they rested only three more times as
they steadily gained another 3,000 feet in elevation. They crossed
a 100-foot deep crevasse via a horizontal ladder and battled colder
winds, thinner air and steeper slopes.
</P>
<P>
   One rope team dodged a boulder rolling down the mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   Altitude sickness stopped two more climbers. Others suffered
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so pumped to get there. Nothing was going to turn me
around,'' said Carter Woollen, a Seattle architect. ``The
adrenaline was just going.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue Web writer Carry Porter called the last 300 yards to
the snow-swept summit the most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   At the top many climbers hugged and slapped hands. Some cried.
While many dropped their packs and bodies on the mountain's crater
rim, a dozen walked another quarter-mile across the flat crater
floor to the true summit, Columbia Crest, a small snowy knoll at
14,411 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was calm, the air was crystal clear and we had a fantastic
sunrise,'' Porter said. ``You could see mountains in Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   One hour and dozens of snapshots later, the group reversed
course. At noon, three hours after departing the summit, they
arrived at Camp Muir rubber-legged but smiling, snacking on Oreos
and honeydew melon before a two-hour descent to hot showers and a
celebration dinner at the Paradise Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest thing I've ever done. My calves and quads
are just shredded,'' said Laura Downey, who works in a retail
garden center at Pike Place Market. ``I've run two marathons, done
the STP (Seattle to Portland bicycle ride), and multiple
half-marathons. They are easy money, in comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   But was it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Downey: ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   CLIMBING MOUNT RAINIER
</P>
<P>
   Reaching Rainier's 14,411-foot summit requires a vertical
elevation gain of more than 9,000 feet over a distance of eight or
more miles. While most routes are not technical, climbers must be
in excellent physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Many climbers go with a guide service offering one-day climbing
instruction, two-day summit climbs, five-day climbing seminars and
private climbs. Summer is the most popular time to climb, although
trips go year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Gearheads rejoice: There is plenty of required equipment,
including ice axes, crampons, ski poles, helmets, down jackets,
sleeping bags and boots. Most equipment can be rented locally.

THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Power Plays: Shakespeare's Lessons in Leadership and
Management'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 2000), John O. Whitney and Tina
Packer honor their subject with a pleasurable and instructive book.
They give us an engaging testament on practicality and morality in
business, richly illuminated by instances from Shakespeare, all
expertly dissected. A reader whose memories of Shakespeare's magic
are lost in cobwebs can expect a treat.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, lover of Shakespeare and senior professor at the
Columbia Business School, provides the business wisdom. An expert
on saving troubled companies, he writes with the assurance of a
half-century in business. The book has lots of cases (Did James
Robinson get the heave-ho at American Express because, like Richard
II, he neglected his realm?), but the professor is most cogent in
holding his own experiences up to Shakespeare's mirror.
</P>
<P>
   A wise old bird, he instructs as often from mistakes as from
accomplishments. At times a chief executive, at other times No. 2,
he has absorbed the ways and means and machinations of command.
</P>
<P>
   The reader hears a lot about Pathmark Supermarkets, where
Whitney, installed as chief operating officer, led a notably
successful turnaround three decades ago. As the applause rolled in,
he was sure he had a lock on the chief executive's chair. In fact,
people had knives out for him, an outsider and an unwelcome savior.
``I was foolish _ and blind, to boot,'' he writes on reflection. It
was an outcome worthy of ``Henry IV.''
</P>
<P>
   At his elbow as he writes is Packer, once of the Royal
Shakespeare Company, who came to this country to present
Shakespeare as it should be presented. She is founder and chief
executive of Shakespeare &AMP; Company, a thriving theater in Lenox,
Mass. She and the professor are a congenial pair. He has exulted in
Shakespeare all his adult life; her creation has become a sizable
business.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney writes most of the book. Packer periodically steps on
stage to add a creative dramatist's understanding of what it is to
act or how actors rise above self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   She also offers some fresh thinking on Shakespeare's women and
power. She admires the Rosalind of ``As You Like It,''
free-spirited and independent, much preferring her over the
tormented Ophelia of ``Hamlet''; but Packer is taken with the
cunning Cleopatra. In an epilogue, Packer finds a new set of
corporate values in Shakespeare's late plays, based on redemption
and collaboration, not bloodshed and deceit.
</P>
<P>
   But the magnetic voice here is Shakespeare's. He ``plumbed more
deeply into the problems of leadership than anyone before him and
most who came after.'' On leadership and power, Whitney finds gold
in the kingship plays and the great tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' provides a contrasting backdrop for an admiring
sketch of Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, whose focus, decisiveness and
fleetness of foot compare so starkly with the breast-beating
vacillation of the Prince of Denmark. (``Hamlet cannot lead,
manage, or follow.'')
</P>
<P>
   The authors take three topics in order _ power, persuasion,
values _ and a good book gets even better when it gets to values.
Anyone who mines Shakespeare for insights on power can't miss, and
this discussion doesn't. The section on persuasion offers, as the
model inspirational speech, Henry V's immortal call to arms on the
eve of Agincourt, with the English outnumbered five to one. It
reminds us how masterfully the young king played the theme of honor
until the woefully discouraging odds became a rallying point.
</P>
<P>
   We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.
</P>
<P>
   For he today that sheds his blood with me
</P>
<P>
   Shall be my brother. . . .
</P>
<P>
   To turn a hostile crowd, what example could trump Mark Antony's
oration at Caesar's funeral?
</P>
<P>
   . . . the noble Brutus
</P>
<P>
   Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
</P>
<P>
   And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
</P>
<P>
   Polonius, the foolish old man in ``Hamlet,'' was given to
fatuous declarations:
</P>
<P>
   To thine ownself be true,
</P>
<P>
   And it must follow as the night the day
</P>
<P>
   Thou canst not be false to any man.
</P>
<P>
   The aphorism is ``patently absurd,'' Whitney declares, given
that interests are at least as likely to clash as coincide, and he
sets off on an exploration of how Man Alone squares with Man in
Society. His musings take him to Frank Sinatra (``I did it my
way'') as well as Ralph Waldo Emerson. Eventually he decides that
the best of religion and law, checked by the free market, provides
the most hopeful reconciliation. Happily, he notes that Shakespeare
_ a wealthy, worldly man as well as playwright _ was at home in a
market-driven society.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney has a soft spot for Sir John Falstaff, the quick-witted,
carousing reprobate who instructed Prince Hal in the true nature of
his domain. But when Hal became King Henry V, he stunned Jack
Falstaff by banishing him summarily. Was his fate just?
</P>
<P>
   Falstaff becomes the opportunity to talk about business'
distaste for the inspired oddball. The professor has his share of
maverick blood; in his turnaround days, he once made a point by
publicly torching the company-policy manual. It tickled him to play
host to a visiting chief executive in the company cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   So he accepts Falstaff's fall from favor, but most reluctantly:
``I would have fired him for his actions, not his thoughts.''
Falstaff takes bribes, flops in battle, commits highway robbery.
``Banish the Jack Falstaff of `Henry IV,' yes, but banish him with
love, care and caution.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor sets tough moral standards. ``Deceit is at the
center of all of Shakespeare's tragedies,'' he writes, adding that
it is not unknown in business. Iago deceives Othello. Richard III
deceives almost everyone. Cassius seduces Brutus into the plot to
kill Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   So is it ethical in business, Whitney asks, when one has decided
to leave a company and start one's own, to furtively recruit
colleagues to come along? Deceit always harms, he answers, if only
the deceit of self. ``Is deception acceptable if it harms no one?
By now, we realize that this is an oxymoron,'' he says. But the
world cannot live without deception, he concedes: ``Shakespeare,
the great philosopher, and life itself make us confront it. When is
it justified? When is it not?''

RAYTHEON SLIDE IN SALES CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. posted income from continuing operations of $95
million for the three months ended July 2, a 68 percent decline
from a year earlier, as the company continued to suffer from
slowing sales of missiles and delays in aircraft deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The results were in line with analysts' expectations, however,
and a rising order backlog suggests the Lexington, Mass. company's
financial slide may have bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
   Including businesses it has since divested, Raytheon reported
net income of $49 million, down from $290 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter fell 10 percent to $4.13 billion, from
$4.57 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the company didn't revise its outlook downward any further
and said its backlog stood at a record $25.6 billion, a relatively
successful report given past troubles at the country's
third-largest defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in a while things haven't been the
same, or worse (than expected),'' said an SG Cowen analyst, Cai von
Rumohr. ``This was something of a turn.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters and analysts, Raytheon chief
executive Daniel Burnham said company leaders were ``not prepared
to say all our issues are behind us, but we feel we've taken
another step'' toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected
income from continuing operations of 27 cents a share, a penny less
than Raytheon reported.
</P>
<P>
   The company's widely traded Class B shares rose $2.50 to close
at $23.4375 in New York Stock Exchange trading. The financial
results were announced yesteday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Shares reached a high of $74.9375 last July, then fell sharply
after Burnham disclosed slowing overseas missile sales and
difficulty integrating various defense businesses that Raytheon
began buying in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The problems prompted Burnham to shuffle managers, lay off more
employees, and sell an engineering unit he had hoped to salvage.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of that Cambridge, Mass. division, Raytheon Engineers &AMP;
Constructors, to Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, was
completed last month, resulting in a $46 million loss for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Raytheon is also considering the sale of its
civil-aircraft division. That unit, in Wichita, Kan., saw operating
income decline 49 percent to $35 million, despite higher sales,
because of price competition and rising computer-system costs.
</P>
<P>
   Operating income also declined, compared to a year earlier, at
Raytheon's missile-making Electronic Systems unit, its command,
control, communications and information-systems unit, and its
commercial electroncis business.
</P>
<P>
   Divestitures could help Raytheon pay down debt from its
acquisition campaign. Debt stood at $10.5 billion on July 2, up
from $9.9 billion a year earlier. Net debt, or debt minus cash, was
$10.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's chief financial officer, Frank Caine, said the
company will pay down net debt to at least $9.2 billion by
December.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's order backlog of $25.6 billion was 20 percent more
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also hopes to benefit from increased spending on
missile-defense programs, both for the Navy and for the Pentagon's
National Missile Defense effort. A test of the latter flopped
earlier this month when a rocket failed to deliver a
Raytheon-produced antimissile device to the target.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Burnham noted many in Congress still support the
projects. ``The general political mood is in strong support of
missile defense, and therefore we're bullish, whether (defenses
are) sea-based or land-based,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs would produce about $700 million in revenue for
the company this year and more than $3.5 billion in revenue through
2005, Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Willian Fiala, analyst for Edward Jones, said the results could
be the start of a rebound for Raytheon. ``It appears the worst is
over, but they still have a long way to get back on track,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is the backlog, but it will take time for them
to get through a lot of their operating issues,'' he said.

ARMSTRONG EASES BACK WITH 5-MINUTE LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   FREIBURG, Germany _ An hour before Thursday's stage in the Tour
de France, Lance Armstrong was where he usually is prerace _
sequestered in the RV near the US Postal Service team's designated
area.
</P>
<P>
   So it's doubtful Armstrong saw much of Lake Leman in Lausanne,
Switzerland, Thursday's starting point, until he rolled out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   And it's just as doubtful Armstrong's fans saw much of him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several Americans hoping to catch a glimpse of
Armstrong merely saw a flash of yellow as the race leader left the
van to sign in for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to get his autograph,'' said Caryn Dahm, who was
leaning over a metal barricade with Christy Tanis. They looked more
like they were outside the studio of the ``Today'' show than at a
bike race as they held up a sign that read ``Iowa Loves Lance.''
Both live near Lausanne, where their husbands work, but Dahm is
from New Hampston, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Next to them was John Green, from Philadelphia, clad in a gray
T-shirt with an American flag on it, and holding a Wheaties cereal
box featuring Armstrong's picture.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't get an autograph, but his fans at least would get
the satisfaction of seeing Armstrong retain the yellow jersey at
the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The 148-mile leg _ the third longest in the Tour _ headed north
from Lausanne over rolling hills to Germany. The course was lined
with an estimated 1.5 million people, many wearing pink Deutsche
Telekom hats. They were not only honoring the German-based team,
but native Jan Ullrich, who won the Tour in 1997 and currently is
in second place.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fifth visit to Germany in the 87-year history of
the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Five riders broke from the pack early but none were contenders
in the overall standings, so the rest didn't bother to chase them.
With 40 miles to go, the gap was more than 16 minutes, and the pack
could only roll their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Salvatore Commesso and Alexandre Vinokourov of
Kazakhstan left the leaders with less than 20 miles to go and
played a cat-and-mouse game as they rode into town. Neither wanted
to give the other control, and both slammed on their brakes at the
final turn. Commesso edged Vinokourov in the final sprint,
finishing in 6 hours 8 minutes 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Three others finished just more than a minute later, but most of
the pack, including Armstrong, cruised in 15 minutes after the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go easy or go hard, and it's never easy,'' Armstrong said.
And easy or not, Armstrong said pedaling for almost 150 miles is
not his idea of a good race, for either riders or spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's good for the race or the drama and the
aggression of the race to have stages of 250 kilometers,'' he said.
``Yes, there was a breakaway today, but with a race that's 250
kilometers in one direction with a headwind the whole way, you're
just never going to see a dramatic race in those conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   With three days of racing left, Armstrong's lead over Ullrich is
more than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong took umbridge when asked what he thinks his chances
are in Friday's time trial, his forte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I thought I won all three time trials last year,'' he
snapped. ``I'm starting the race planning on winning.''

GILLETTE TO KEEP BRAUN PRODUCT LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Saying it plans to hang on to all of its Braun product
lines, Gillette Co. reported Thursday strong second-quarter sales
for blades, razors, and its Braun electric shavers and small
household appliances.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillette also reported declining or flat sales for its
Duracell batteries and its Oral-B oral-care products.
</P>
<P>
   Total quarterly sales rose 2 percent to $2.25 billion. Net
income from continuing operations rose 2 percent to $296 million,
or 28 cents a share, matching Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Gillette warned that sales growth in the quarter might
be affected by the euro's decline. Foreign curreny issues are one
reason why Gillette's momentum has slowed recently.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the adverse effects of exchange and the divestiture of
its White Rain hair-care line, second-quarter sales were up 8
percent, Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with these results,'' said vice president Eric
A. Kraus, who noted that, on an earnings-per-share basis, net
income from continuing operations rose 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As for a possible sale of its ailing stationery business to
Newell Rubbermaid Inc., Gillette would only say Thursday that
negotiations, first announced last month, are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   While second-quarter razor sales and profits rose 8 percent and
7 percent respectively, Duracell sales fell 3 percent, and profits
declined 19 percent. It was the second straight quarter that
Duracell has reported a sales decline.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gillette officials, Duracell's performance has been
``clouded'' by short-term issues such as ``aggressive competitive
activity.'' Duracell's long-term outlook remains bright, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Gillette said it would consider selling its
stationery lines and the household-appliance portion of its Braun
product line so it could focus on its core businesses.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting a strategic review of its Braun business,
Gillette said Thursday it will keep the product line intact.
</P>
<P>
   Braun sales rose 11 percent in the second quarter, and its
profits more than doubled, Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to make progress, reflecting the success of our
new products and the improving economic conditions in developing
markets,'' said Gillette chairman and chief executive Michael C.
Hawley. ``We look for further progress in the second half of 2000,
based on strong fundamentals in our core categories.''
</P>
<P>
   One investor expressed displeasure with Gillette's decision to
keep the Braun division intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braun has been one disappointment after another,'' Northstar
Group president Henry Asher told Bloomberg News. ``I can't
understand why they wouldn't sell it, unless they didn't get an
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette issued results before the New York markets closed. On
the New York Stock Exchange, shares fell $1 to $32.3125.

genes. By Tamar Lewin.

FORMER IRISH LEADER HAUGHEY TO TESTIFY IN CORRUPTION SCANDAL

<P>
   DUBLIN _ James Joyce once observed that it would be impossible
to walk across Dublin without passing a pub. Were Joyce alive
today, he might suggest it is impossible to walk across Dublin
without passing a crooked politician.
</P>
<P>
   These are normally the dog days of summer in Ireland, when
Dubliners step outside the doors of their ornate pubs, drinks in
hand, to enjoy conversation and the light that lingers well past 10
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the summer of scandal in Ireland, and Friday the
nation's former prime minister, Charles J. Haughey, is scheduled to
take the witness stand in one of the myriad tribunals probing
corruption throughout Ireland's political, judicial, and business
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin O'Connor couldn't have dreamed up Charlie Haughey. In
O'Connor's epic novel, ``The Last Hurrah,'' the protagonist Frank
Skeffington, a thinly-veiled James Michael Curley, Boston's
legendary and corrupt mayor, was portrayed as a duplicitous,
vainglorious, class-baiting thief.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to using his position to enrich himself, even
fictional rogues like Frank Skeffington pale in comparison to
Charlie Haughey.
</P>
<P>
   According to prior testimony, Haughey solicited more than $12
million in bribes while he was prime minister, mostly from property
developers. Calculating how much money Haughey got from his
government salary and how much he spent on his lavish lifestyle,
prosecutors say privately Haughey took at least three times that
amount from just about anyone who wanted to do business in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, during an investigation into influence-peddling
that spawned the tribunal that Haughey will appear before, Haughey
stunned the nation when he admitted he had received a $2 million
donation from a supermarket magnate in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey insisted he did nothing wrong, did no favors for the
money, and blamed any transgressions on his former financial
manager and close friend, Des Traynor, who is now, conveniently for
Haughey, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying the arrogance that some find endearing and others
consider outrageous, Haughey denied the millions he took from
businessmen looking for influence funded his lavish lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a lavish lifestyle,'' he told the tribunal
counsel, Denis McCullough. ``My work was my lifestyle and when I
was in office I worked every day, all day. There was no room for
any sort of an extravagant lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Haughey, who served as prime minister for three terms during the
1980s and 1990s, operated like a dictator of a banana republic,
sipping rare wines while much of his country wallowed in poverty
and hundreds of thousands of young people were forced to emigrate
to find work. He shamelessly shook down businessmen then spent the
ill-gotten gains on fine art, rich food, and assorted luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   He used $50,000 in bribes on tailored Charvet shirts from Paris.
He bought an island off the Irish coast so he could vacation in
privacy. He lined the walls of his 200-year-old, $30-million home
on a 300-acre estate north of Dublin with millions of dollars of
art.
</P>
<P>
   Lording over the most socially conservative country in Europe,
he carried on a torrid affair with a gossip columnist who regaled
the nation with tales about how ``Sweetie,'' as she called Haughey,
would lavish her with good meals and better sex.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey's venality was breathtaking. When his longtime friend
and deputy prime minister Brian Lenihan contracted an ultimately
fatal illness that required treatment in the United States, Haughey
hit up businessmen for more than $300,000 to offset the medical
bills, then allegedly pocketed most of the cash.
</P>
<P>
   While Haughey was the undisputed king of Irish sleaze, he was
not alone. Influence-peddling was rampant, according to testimony
presented to various tribunals. Even the current prime minister,
Bertie Ahern, widely hailed by President Clinton for his
stewardship of the peace process in Northern Ireland, has been
implicated.
</P>
<P>
   In April a businessman said he gave Ahern $75,000 in a hotel
parking lot in 1989. Ahern publicly denied it, but has admitted
signing blank checks for Haughey when Ahern was in charge of his
Fianna Fail's party finances.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to condemn Haughey, Ahern has sought to distance
himself from his old mentor. Many political commentators in Dublin
say it is only a matter of time before Ahern's coalition government
collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Irish people are alternately amused and appalled by the
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything and everyone was for sale. It's almost more
pathetic than scandalous,'' says Frank McDonald, author of the
recently published book, ``The Construction of Dublin.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said most Irish politicians do not take corruption
seriously, nor, he says, do most Irish people, though that could be
changing. A recent poll by the Sunday Tribune newspaper found that
for the first time ever, a majority of Irish people said that
corruption is the biggest issue facing the nation. Two-thirds of
those polled said they do not believe Ahern is cooperating fully
with the tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like McDonald say the politicians are hoping that the
sheer length and complexity of the tribunals will bore the public
into apathy rather than rouse their anger to demand systemic
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in the 78-year history of the state has anyone been
imprisoned for political corruption. That almost beggars belief,''
said McDonald. ``Irish people have long been in denial about
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is impossible to ignore any longer, so ubiquitous are the
tribunals investigating influence-peddling in political, legal, and
business circles.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Manning, who besides being an Irish senator is a
professor of political science at University College Dublin, said
Ireland's prosperity has indirectly exposed its underbelly. Only
the United States produces more software than Ireland. And while
the growing popularity of computers and the Internet has turned
Ireland from one of Europe's poorest countries to one of its
richest in fewer than 10 years, it has also allowed prosecutors to
document influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electronic money trail changed everything,'' said Manning.
``The ability to use electronic bank statements, to trace phone
calls, this gave the investigators the ability to catch people in
lies. Only recently have Irish people realized how deep the
corruption goes. It had been drip, drip, drip. Now people are
saying we've got to get rid of this lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The question today is not whether Haughey was corrupt, but
whether he should go to jail. Last month, a judge postponed
Haughey's trial on charges of lying to a previous tribunal, arguing
that deputy prime minister Mary Harney's suggestion to jail Haughey
made it impossible for him to get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Irish people are divided on whether the 75-year-old Haughey, who
is in failing health, should go to prison. Manning isn't sure.
McDonald said until crooked politicians are put in jail, Ireland
will not begin to control corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between Haughey and Boston's rogue mayor, James
Michael Curley, are striking. The Irish newspapers are calling
Haughey's appearance Friday his ``Last Hurrah.'' After federal
prosecutors finished with him, Curley died broke and broken.
Prosecutors would like to do the same to Haughey.
</P>
<P>
   Both politicians were helped at the ballot box rather than hurt
by their roguish behavior. Both had an extraordinary sense of
entitlement, and made their names by helping the poor and elderly.
Haughey's defenders cite policies that helped the disadvantaged as
a mitigating factor when trying to put his corruption in context.
</P>
<P>
   When he takes the stand at Dublin Castle, Haughey will face a
stark choice. He can either name those who forked over a fortune to
him or face the prospect of being forced to pay for the cost of the
tribunal. Prosecutors say they have spent about $10 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he is forced to pay, it is doubtful that Haughey
will end up the pauper that Curley was after his last hurrah.
Haughey's personal fortune is estimated at about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Few people here, meanwhile, expect Haughey to cough up names.
Nothing and no one is more reviled in Ireland than an informer.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Haughey, his friends say, may have been a thief, but
he's no informer.

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SPAR OVER BUSH RECORD IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Flanked by two Lone Star state flags and a
clutch of poor families, Vice President Al Gore fired the latest
shots in his budget battle with Texas Governor George W. Bush
Thursday _ from close range.
</P>
<P>
   In a nondescript conference room in a down-at-heel neighborhood
in San Antonio, Gore renewed his criticisms of Bush's fiscal
abilities during a visit to the governor's home state, through the
stories of mothers who were struggling to get health care for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful state,'' Gore said. ``But I think it
should be a state where it is just as easy to raise a child as to
set up an oil rig.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore assailed Texas's record on providing health care for
children and families, and accused the governor of failing to make
it a high enough priority. Instead, Gore argued, Bush had pushed
through a large tax cut, which contributed to a budget shortfall,
leaving little for the women and children who sat beside the Vice
President Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was quick with an irritated reply, calling Gore's
characterization of his Texas record a ``travesty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that the vice president of all the United
States would come to one of those states and try to mislead people
about our state's budget,'' Bush told reporters gathered at the
governor's mansion in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Texas budget is balanced and our Texas budget is in the
black. We have a surplus of $1.4 billion in the bank,'' Bush said.
``For Vice President Gore to claim otherwise for his own political
purposes is a travesty and he should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore clearly sensed that he was walking a fine line, coming to
Texas to highlight the line of attack he has favored all week. Bush
is extremely popular in Texas, and Gore seemed aware that too
strident a skewering would make him look overly-aggressive and
negative. So the Vice President took care to credit the Texas
Governor in a backhanded sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand Governor Bush is a popular and well-liked
Governor here, and I want to give him some credit on that score,''
Gore said. ``I think he has a warm and engaging personality. But
you know, the Presidency is more than just a popularity contest. It
involves whether or not you're willing to fight for what is right,
whether you're willing to spend some of that popularity doing some
difficult and hard things. That's where you get to priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The most forceful criticisms of the governor came from not from
Gore but from the women on stage with him who told stories of
health care delayed for want of adequate medical insurance, and
from local elected representatives _ Democrats, all _ who pilloried
the governor for neglecting their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and his surrogates aggressively defended their record
Thursday, and suggested they welcome the Gore stratagem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this becomes a question of Gov. Bush's stewardship versus
Al Gore's lack of leadership, that's a fight we look forward to,''
campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said. ``That's a fight the vice
president can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Gore effort to ``distort and mislead'' would serve
only to remind voters of what they dislike in politicians. And he
went on to quote former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley who
questioned Gore's veracity during the primary battle: ``Why should
the American people believe Vice President Gore will tell the truth
as president if he doesn't tell the truth as a candidate?''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists and outside observers were divided on whether Gore's
focus on Texas would work.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the state surplus is at the core of Gore's
argument. That surplus soared to a record $6.4 billion in 1999, at
the start of the state's two-year budget cycle. Bush pushed, and
the Texas legislature approved, two major uses for that surplus:
$3.8 billion for a school finance bill, and $1.7 billion for a tax
cut. Those two expenditures, and other smaller ones, used up the
entire surplus, said Dick Lavine, a senior fiscal analyst at the
non-partisan, Austin-based center for Public Policy Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Texas faces unanticipated expenses of at least $610
million, including $400 million to pay for a Medicaid shortfall
from rising prescription drug costs, and $100 million to cover the
extra costs of housing prisoners from the overflowing state
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas budget will stay out of the red this year, since
the state is also running a surplus this year of $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just lucked out,'' Lavine said. ``It appears we have enough
cash to cover our needs. The more prudent approach would have been
to take some of the surplus and set it aside in a rainy day fund.
Massachusetts' rainy day fund is overfull, but (Texas') is next to
empty.''
</P>
<P>
   The rainy day fund in Texas, which is separate from the surplus,
contains $84 million, which Lavine said would run the state's
government for only 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $1.7 billion tax cut Bush pushed through was for
property owners. A small percentage of the cuts -- about $45
million -- went to oil producers. According to Lavine, 40 percent
of Texas residents rent and 60 percent own their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been contrasting the rising federal surplus with
Texas's shrinking one to make the argument that Bush would wreak
havoc on the nation's economy with his tax cut proposals. He has
been saying the governor's $1.7 billion tax cut left Texas without
sufficient resources to deal with more pressing social needs.
Neither he nor aides make mention of the larger, $3.8 billion
schools expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time a presidential candidate has used his
opponent's local record against him. In 1988, then-vice president
George H.W. Bush traveled to Boston Harbor, then one of the most
polluted in the country, to embarrass Governor Michael Dukakis. And
in 1992, President Bush and other Republicans tried to tar
then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton with accusations that he was
``the failed governor of a small state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Harbor analogy does have some credibility here,''
Gore Press Secretary Chris Lehane said. But the harbor pollution
was one example of an unexpected local weakness, Lehane said.
``There's a whole slew of Boston Harbors in Texas. We could do one
a day, and that's because of the choices the governor has made.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the strategy work this time, given the very
circumstances and candidates. It was phenomenally successful in
1988, but produced no joy for President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went after Clinton's Arkansas record in '92 and we were
firing blanks,'' said Charles R. Black, Jr., the Republican
strategist who worked on former President Bush's 1988 and 1992
races. ``It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, who is also advising the younger Bush this year, believes
the Texas Governor will likewise withstand Gore's onslaught. He
contends that Bush's record of bipartisan accomplishment, and the
willingness of some Democrats to stand up on his behalf, will
innoculate the governor.
</P>
<P>
   He was echoed on that by Rob Junell, the Democratic Chairman of
the House General Appropriations Committee stepped forward Thursday
to defend Bush against the vice president's criticism that he has
mishandled the state's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus on the plight of Texas children -- noting that
Texas ranks second worst in the nation in the percentage and number
of uninsured children and that Texas children are less likely to be
immunized than in other states -- left Black similarly unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can go down and say there are still a lot of poor people in
Texas, but Clinton and Gore have been in office a lot longer than
Bush has been governor. What have they done?'' Black asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials believe the problems in Texas will have
potent staying power.
</P>
<P>
   `` This is a story about a pattern,'' said Laura Quinn,
communications director for the Democratic National Committee.
``He's got proposals that primarily protect some of the powerful
interests that have given him campaign money and run contrary to
the interests of working families.''

CHRISTIAN CLERGY DECRY LACK OF PRESENCE AT CAMP DAVID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The heads of Jerusalem's three largest Christian
denominations expressed concern in a letter published Thursday that
their interests were not being represented at the Camp David talks,
and requested that representatives of the churches be permitted to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust you will not forget or overlook our agelong presence
here,'' stated the letter, which was signed by Greek Orthodox
Patriarch Diodoros I, Latin Catholic Patriarch Michel Sabbah, and
Armenian Orthodox Patriarch Torkom II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich tapestry of this land is made even richer and more
precious with this continuous Christian life, witness, and presence
alongside the two other Abrahamic traditions of Judaism and
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was addressed to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and President Clinton, and
excerpts were published in the respected Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   One of the proposals that has reportedly been considered at Camp
David is a division of the Old City, with the Palestinian Authority
taking administrative control of the Muslim and Christian quarters
and Israel maintaining control of the Jewish and Armenian quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Christian community _ who represent approximately
140,000 Christians in Israel, the Palestinian-controlled West Bank,
and Jerusalem _ strongly oppose separating the Armenian and
Christian quarters, saying that they are ``inseparable and firmly
united by the same faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian Authority's high commissioner
for church affairs and an adviser to the Palestinian negotiating
team, said, ``We are conveying a message that they cannot rule out
the Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is holy to the three monotheistic faiths, Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam. The Western Wall is the holiest site in
Judaism, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aksa mosque complex is
generally considered the third holiest shrine in Islam after Mecca
and Medina, and the Holy Sepulchre is one of the most sacred sites
in Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of religion in the negotiations is not an
imperative one, and should not be a divisive one,'' Hassassian
said. ``But the Israelis have made some attempt to downplay the
religious dimension of the other two faiths. That is wrong, and a
reminder is needed that this is a city sacred not only to Jews and
Muslims, but to Christians as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassassian said he did not expect the request for
representatives of the churches to attend Camp David to be
accepted. But he added that he felt it was important for the church
leaders to state their concerns during the negotiations.

 McENROE WON'T BE PLAYING DOUBLES FOR U.S.  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTANDER, Spain _ It wasn't quite mutiny, as much it was an
example of U.S. democracy. Collectively, delicately, John McEnroe's
players let it be known that they preferred him on the sideline,
where a Davis Cup captain belongs.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe took that attitudinal proclamation from a team meeting
Wednesday night and Thursday officially junked his tentative plan
to play doubles Saturday, as a 41-year-old antique whose last Davis
Cup competition was in 1992. Minutes before Thursday afternoon's
draw, he removed himself from the four-man U.S. roster that will
begin play Friday as a heavy underdog to Spain in the Cup
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   An unsightly blister in the middle of his left hand and some
soreness in his left arm from three days of practice hadn't
convinced McEnroe to lay down his racquet. The tenor of the team
meeting, however, made it clear to him that his players,
undecorated as they might be, thought it was unfair for McEnroe to
nominate himself, given the clay court surface that was likely to
exploit his fitness and age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that John is not head and shoulders above any of
us in his caliber as a doubles player right now,'' said Todd
Martin, the senior U.S. player and de facto diplomat.``His
knowledge of the game is better, and to have him on the sidelines,
telling us what we're doing right and wrong, I think will help the
doubles team quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, designated as the No. 1 singles player, will play Albert
Costa in Friday's first singles match, before Jan-Michael Gambill
meets Alex Corretja. It was after Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi
withdrew their commitment to play the semifinal that McEnroe named
himself to the team. Thursday, he said, it was, in large part, a
strategic maneuver in the event Agassi changed his mind, which he
had heard was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since he assumed the captain's job last summer, the idea of
playing doubles had been bouncing softly around McEnroe's head like
one of his legendary touch volleys. When he didn't name an active
doubles player to this team last week, he seemed to be setting the
stage for himself, though he admitted he was not playing well on
the practice court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me _ I wanted to play, but these guys talked me out
of it,'' McEnroe said. ``They wanted a chance at glory, so now they
have to step up and show them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' _ Chris Woodruff and Vince Spadea _ are ranked No. 188
and 864, respectively, in doubles. The Spaniards don't have
accomplished doubles players either, and their team of Corretja and
Juan Balcells is in itself little more than a marriage of
necessity. Doubles, McEnroe said, is the one match here this
weekend that he has been counting on winning, no matter who played.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, then, was less about results and form than it was
about whose team this was, in the absence of the U.S. stars.
Players such as Woodruff and Spadea understand they are not and
never will be what McEnroe was, but they argued that they are
active professionals, in the prime of their careers and they,
unlike Sampras and Agassi, made the effort to return to Europe
after the clay and grass-court seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, everybody in the world knows that he's the best
doubles player of all time,'' Gambill said of McEnroe. ``That goes
without saying. But it's not like because he's not out there we
can't win. We pretty much discussed it. It wasn't really like we
said, `John, you can't play.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to McEnroe, it was more what wasn't said: something
along the lines of ``John, please play.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Gambill at any point during the week, McEnroe said,
expressed enthusiasm over the possibility of playing doubles with
him. Martin and even Woodruff made it plain that while McEnroe's
second serve may be good enough for seniors' events, the Spaniards
were likely to treat it like batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had considered playing despite his players'
sentiments, McEnroe said: ``I'd feel a little awkward. Maybe I've
gotten a little soft in my old age. So far I've led democratically.
I haven't led dictatorially.'' He admitted that the ``the focus had
gotten off track,'' and that he was uncomfortable with the notion
that he was ``riding in on a horse to save the Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the doubles will be moot unless the
Americans can avoid being ground down by Corretja and Costa in
singles. The Spanish captain, Javier Duarte, raised some eyebrows
by choosing Costa as his second singles player instead of Juan
Carlos Ferrero, one of the hottest young clay court players in the
world. Ferrero is ranked 13th. Costa is 16th. Corretja is ranked
seventh. Martin is ranked 29th, while Gambill is 37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, they should win,'' he said. ``But Spain has been
underachieving for 20 years in Davis Cup. I've just been surprised
that they haven't been able to get over the hump and have choked so
many times.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, McEnroe picked up and was off to Bilbao, an hour's
drive, to hit the Guggenheim Museum. He didn't have to practice.
There are benefits to being 41, and done.

 &HT;    BellSouth exceeds forecasts with another record quarter
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. on Thursday turned in yet another
record quarter, with a 39.9 percent increase in earnings and
revenue up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During the three months ended June 30, the Atlanta-based
regional telecommunications company reported $1.1 billion in
earnings, or 56 cents per share, compared with $786 million, or 41
cents a share, during the same quarter a year ago. Those results
beat a consensus of analysts' estimates by a penny a share as
revenue hit $6.8 billion during the quarter, compared with $6.1
billion in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important is the top-line growth,'' said Isaiah
Harris, vice president for finance. ``I am not sure there are a lot
of surprises. We have delivered fairly consistent results.''
</P>
<P>
   Growth was fueled largely by data services, wireless and
international units.
</P>
<P>
   Data services to businesses, including providing high-speed
lines and hosting Web sites, grew 27 percent to $869 million during
the quarter. Meanwhile, BellSouth's premier means of delivering
high-speed data _ digital subscriber lines and fiber _ now have
74,000 customers, compared with 49,000 three months earlier and
30,000 at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   By quarter's end, about 788,000 customers were using BellSouth's
Internet unit.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the company's wireless operations in the United
States, which are mostly limited to the Southeast, surged 17
percent to $877 million during the quarter. The company now has 5.9
million customers paying an average of $54 a month, up from a
monthly average of $51 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has announced an alliance with SBC Communications that
will merge the two companies' wireless units, creating a new
company to be based in Atlanta. An offering from the combined
company is expected by late this year.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's international business grew to $834 million during
the quarter, up nearly 18 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company this year has expanded its reach in Colombia and
Brazil, the largest market in Latin America. BellSouth's
international interests at quarter's end accounted for 7.6 million
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's core business _ local phone service in the
Southeast _ still accounts for the majority of BellSouth revenue
and has kept growing, albeit more modestly than wireless or data.
</P>
<P>
   Land line communications, including fees for connecting to
BellSouth's network, accounted for $4.6 billion in revenue, roughly
two-thirds of BellSouth's total. Local service alone brought in
$2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company workforce grew again last quarter as the company
again began to approach the size it had reached a decade ago before
starting years of painful cuts. BellSouth completed the quarter
with 99,027 employees, up 4,029 from a year before, with most of
the hiring coming in service and sales to handle growing wireless
and data businesses.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company earlier this year announced cuts of 2,100
jobs in an effort to reduce corporate staff. ``There is actually a
negative hidden beneath the surface,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth peaked in 1990 with 103,152 workers, then reached its
lowest ebb in 1997 with about 81,100.
</P>
<P>
   But solid performance quarter after quarter doesn't always reap
a Wall Street reward. Like other large telecom companies, BellSouth
has been receiving a cool investor reception. Analysts have
variously blamed that on Internet fever _ the shifting of billions
of investment dollars to ``new economy'' companies _ and investor
fear of an acquisition that will dilute holdings.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth shares did get a bounce in the spring with the
announcement that the company plans a tracking stock for its Latin
American unit, but then the telecom tide went out again. In the
past 52 weeks, BellSouth has traded as high as $53.50 and as low as
$34.94.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the company needs to shrug off the market malaise.
``Our only reponse is to continue to deliver growth and to tell our
story. We believe that over time, the stock will reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock on Thursday dropped $2.13, closing at $39.44.
</P>
<P>
   Among others reporting earnings was BellSouth partner SBC, which
said second-quarter profit was flat, but _ like BellSouth _ higher
than Wall Street expectations by a penny per share. San
Antonio-based SBC's revenue was up 10 percent to $13.2 billion.
Earnings were $1.92 billion, or 56 cents per share, only slightly
higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   SBC doubled the number of customers for its DSL service and
after being permitted into long-distance in Texas signed up 150,000
customers in eight days. SBC added 537,000 wireless customers
during the quarter, while wireless revenues climbed 30.6 percent to
$1.6 billion.

 &HT;    Sprint suitor strays, but earnings rise
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sprint reported better-than-expected profit Thursday,
even as a potential suitor seemed to be turning its attention
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas-based Sprint, the nation's fourth-largest wireless
carrier and third-largest long-distance company, reported quarterly
earnings of $926 million, up 13 percent from the same period a year
ago. Excluding a one-time gain, that represents 67 cents per share
_ about 20 percent better than the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has been seen as an alluring marriage candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anteing up for its wireless business, Sprint PCS, is a good
way for long-term investors to own a piece of greatness,'' wrote
Morningstar.com's Todd P. Bernier on Thursday. ``The company's
showing in the June quarter, announced today, was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sprint's deal to be acquired by Mississippi-based
WorldCom was blocked last month by regulators. Speculation then had
Sprint being purchased by Deutsche Telekom, and the two were
reportedly talking. Then several dozen U.S. senators objected,
citing DT's majority ownership by the German government.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom seemed then to shift its attentions. While the
company is reportedly in a host of different negotiations, its
priority seems to be VoiceStream. DT has reportedly offered more
than $200 a share _ or about $53 billion _ for the wireless
carrier, and a deal would make a Deutsche bid for Sprint and its
wireless network unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The VoiceStream pricing is right, wrote analyst Walter Piecyk of
PaineWebber. ``While competitive bids are possible, we believe this
is a price that management would accept.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would leave the field open to ... whom?
</P>
<P>
   Only a few players are big enough to bid for the company.
BellSouth, which bid against WorldCom for Sprint in October, has
thus far expressed no interest in renewing the chase. A
BellSouth-Sprint merger would still bump against a continued ban on
BellSouth offering long-distance. Moreover, since the fall,
BellSouth has announced an alliance of its wireless operations with
those of SBC Commu- nications.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint stock fell $2.44 Thursday to $42.56 a share. The tracking
stock for its wireless unit rose 52 cents to $64.38.

LEADERS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BRING VOICE OF THE POOR TO G-8
MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With leaders of the world's industrialized countries
gathering in Japan for their annual meeting, a handful of major
Third World nations took center stage Thursday and lambasted the
richest nations on behalf of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Tokyo on the eve of the summit meeting,
which is being held on Japan's southern island of Okinawa, leaders
of South Africa, Nigeria and Algeria _ three of Africa's largest
countries _ said the world's seven leading economic powers, plus
Russia, had been too slow to act on debt relief and other issues
vital to economic growth in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer a question of what we should do,'' said
Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo. ``We all know what we
should do. The question is do we have the political will.''
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was sponsored by Jubilee 2000, a coalition
of charities calling for debt relief for the poor. Obasanjo is head
of the so-called Group of 77, a political coalition of
underdeveloped countries, and is also head of the movement of
nonaligned nations. .
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Obasanjo _ and similarly spirited remarks made
by the South African leader, Thabo Mbeki, and the Algerian
president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika _ were among the rare contretemps
in a minutely planned diplomatic ballet as delegations from the
leading industrial nations _ the United States, Britain, Italy,
Canada, France, Germany and Japan _ joined delegates from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo and his African peers accused the world's
industrialized powers of selfish shortsightedness in their dealings
with the Third World. Heavy debt-servicing demands in developing
countries prevent spending on vital services like health care and
education.
</P>
<P>
   The anger of the Third World presidents was underscored by
reports that the industrialized nations would act to speed debt
relief for Russia during the three-day Okinawa meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki said that in addition to debt issues, representatives of
rich and poor nations at a meeting Thursday discussed increasing
foreign direct investment in Africa, Africa's access to foreign
markets and the transfer of information technology and
biotechnology to Africa, among other things. ``It is a range of
things that are interrelated, and it is important that the G-8,
when they address these questions, address all of these
questions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The African leaders were not met separately by the Japanese
prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, as they had requested, but instead
were included at a dinner Thursday night with leading officials of
the seven industrialized nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Third World leaders also met with leaders of several
international technology giants, including Sony Corp. and Cisco
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   After the talks, the U.S. treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers,
who was standing in for President Clinton _ who was arrived late
because of the Israeli-Palestinian talks at Camp David, Md. _ said
that significant ground had been covered during the evening
meeting. Among the proposals agreed upon were expanding debt relief
programs beyond the poorest, most-heavily indebted countries that
had previously been eligible. It was also agreed that the next
round of World Trade Organization talks would be devoted to the
problems of poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a somewhat skeptical note, Mbeki said the Third World
must await the outcome of the summit meeting before gauging how
determined the rich nations are to provide more meaningful
assistance for solving the problems of poverty and disease. ``The
question of what they will say, that can only come at the end of
the Okinawa meeting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the summit meeting last year, the world's richest nations
announced with great fanfare a $100 billion debt relief package for
40 of the world's poorest countries. But almost none of the money
called for under the program has been disbursed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration narrowly averted embarrassment over
this issue when the House of Representatives voted only last week
to finance Clinton's request for Washington's $262 million share in
providing debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, the industrialized nations are promising a
number of major initiatives at their summit meeting, and the plans
are as sweeping as they have ever been.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting has been billed as the Information Summit, and has
set as one of its goals reducing the so-called digital divide _ or
access to the Internet and other information technology _ between
rich and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has pledged to donate $15 billion over the next five years
to help poor countries increase Internet access and develop
information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Major goals have also been announced in health care. The leaders
of the industrialized nations have reportedly agreed on setting a
target of 25 percent for reducing AIDS infection among 15 to 24
year olds in the Third World by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 35 million people are living with AIDS worldwide, and
70 percent of the victims are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has pledged $3 billion to battle AIDS and tropical
diseases like malaria in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also announced an AIDS initiative this week for 24
African countries that will provide them with $1 billion in loans
annually to pay for medicine and other treatment to fight AIDS.

 &HT;    Market share up, UPS profit soars 18%
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rising domestic and international shipments fueled an
18 percent jump in profit at United Parcel Service Corp. during the
three months that ended June 30, the company reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   UPS earned $695 million, or 60 cents a share, in its second
quarter on revenue of $7.3 billion. The Sandy Springs-based
transportation giant earned $588 million, or 52 cents a share, on
revenue of $6.6 billion during the same period last year, excluding
one-time charges. The company's performance was in line with Wall
Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, we're pleased by the company's growth
across all segments,'' said Jim Kelly, UPS chairman and chief
executive. ``Customers are rewarding us for superior service and
the industry's broadest product portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS daily package volume averaged 13.2 million units in the
quarter, up 6.7 percent from 12.4 million in the same period last
year. Domestic volume rose 6 percent with premium-priced,
next-morning shipments growing 9.9 percent. International volume
rose 15.3 percent, with U.S. exports surging 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   UPS also announced Thursday that it will impose a 1.25 percent
fuel surcharge beginning Aug. 7 to make up for recent price spikes.
Fuel typically accounts for about 3 percent of the company's total
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Satish Jindel, transportation analyst at SJ Consulting, said UPS
is gaining market share from rivals FedEx Corp., Airborne Express
and the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth in this sector is not evenly spread,'' Jindel said.
``UPS is taking business away from the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS ``non-package revenue'' from ancillary businesses such as
insurance, logistics and finance rocketed to $371 million during
the quarter, up 70 percent from $218 million a year ago. Robert
Clanin, chief financial officer at UPS, said large start-up costs
will keep the logistics division from being immediately profitable,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investing heavily in logistics,'' Clanin said. ``We
anticipate it will take a year or more for logistics to become
fully profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rosy outlook, UPS shares fell $1.69 to $59.56
because the company failed to surpass analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting expectations doesn't get you a pat on the back,''
Clanin said.

STRONG SPRINT HELPS ITALIAN STEAL STAGE

   FREIBURG, Germany _ Five low-ranked but aggressive riders jumped
away early Thursday in the Tour de France, built a lead of nearly
28 minutes through the gingerbread villages of Switzerland and held
more than half of it at the finish before enormous crowds in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of exciting day that often develops toward the
end of a Tour when the stage is monstrously long and the leaders
have their eyes on another day _ a long individual time trial
Friday _ and are content to let lesser lights shine.
</P>
<P>
   The shiniest was Salvatore Commesso, an Italian with Saeco, who
won a sprint finish against Alexander Vinokourov, a Kazakh with
Deutsche Telekom, a German team.
</P>
<P>
   Commesso finished first by half a bicycle length in 6 hours 8
minutes 15 seconds for the 246.5-kilometer (153-mile) 18th of 21
stages. Commesso's speed of 40 kilometers an hour (a shade under 25
mph) brought him home 15:40 ahead of the main pack.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, who complained afterward about the length of
the stage and the fact that an even longer one is scheduled
Saturday, a day before the finish in Paris, continued in the
leader's yellow jersey with an unchanged edge of 5:37 in overall
elapsed time over Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Julich could have been, should have been, in the breakaway
group, but wasn't. He is low-ranked _ 49th place, one hour 37
minutes 40 seconds behind his former teammate and longtime rival,
Armstrong. But Julich, 28, an American who rides for the Credit
Agricole team from France and finished third in the 1998 Tour, is
not aggressive these days.
</P>
<P>
   A strong climber who has worn the king of the mountains jersey
in other races, Julich has been limping home in the gruppetto, the
Italian word for the group of riders who work together far behind
in the mountains to make sure they all finish within the time
needed to avoid disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the Tour de France through different eyes,'' Julich
said. ``It's kind of a humbling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   His troubles in this Tour began on the first day in the
Pyrenees, the climb to the Hautacam peak on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power just wasn't there in the legs in the mountains,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Julich finished nearly 13 minutes behind the winner, snuffing
his hopes of standing on the three-step victory podium when the
race ends in Paris on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized it was over,'' he said, ``and it's kind of
difficult to pick up the pieces after that.''

GENZYME SEEKS OK TO TEST DRUG FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genzyme Corp., unsuccessful in developing a gene therapy
treatment for cystic fibrosis, Thursday said it will ask the US
Food and Drug Administration for permission to start human testing
of its first drug to treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to begin an initial safety study of the drug, named
Lumarel, follows eight attempts to treat the inherited breathing
disorder using gene therapy. None proved effective for the
Cambridge, Mass. biotechnology company that has been studying the
disease for nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme's optimism with Lumarel stems from the research by Drs.
Juan Alvarez and Steven Freedman at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. They found that a reversible imbalance between two
fatty acids found in cell membranes is linked to the common
symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Those symptoms include the large
buildup of excess mucus in the airways and chronic inflammation of
the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Working with mice carrying the genetic defect that causes cystic
fibrosis, Alvarez and Freedman reported they could correct the
problem by feeding them large amounts of one of the fatty acids,
known as docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA. Genzyme began collaborating
with the researchers last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Only two drugs are on the market to treat the symptoms of cystic
fibrosis. They are Pulmozyme from Genentech Inc. of South San
Francisco, Calif., and Tobramycin from PathoGenesis Corp. of
Seattle. In addition to these drugs, patients take several enzyme
replacement drugs to help in food digestion.
</P>
<P>
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal hereditary disease
among whites in the United States, affecting an estimated 30,000
people. The median life expectancy of people with the disease is 32
years old, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Association of
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven cystic fibrosis drugs in development, including
two considered ``gene-assist therapies,'' according to the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which
represents the major drug companies. Last year there were 11 drugs
under development _ the decline due, in part, to gene-therapy
failures by several companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in Genzyme Corp. rose $2.375, to $66.025, in trading on
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beverly Hills - Harrison Ford may be the star of the modern-day
ghost story (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath(enditalic), but that
doesn't necessarily mean he likes horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   Or even watches them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last scary movie I went to and enjoyed was
(beginitalic)Bambi(enditalic),'' Ford says in a recent interview.
``I was about 6 years old, and it scared the bejesus out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath (enditalic)is Ford's first real
foray into the supernatural, unless you count the occult elements
in the Indiana Jones series. He says he took the role because it's
different from what he's done lately and allowed him to work with
director Bob Zemeckis and co-star Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   He also liked the script, or as he puts it, ``the quality of the
set-up, the establishing of the relationship and the surprises the
plot holds for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotionally truthful film,'' Ford adds. ``And I
think that's one of the reasons you get sucked into it as an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 58, plays Dr. Norman Spencer, a respected researcher
married to the beautiful Claire (Pfeiffer). The couple's idyllic
life begins to unravel after their picturesque Vermont lake house
is haunted by the spirit of a woman who looks remarkably like
Claire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events are seen from her perspective,'' Ford says. ``It's
her point of view, because she's the one with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's stylistic camera work smacks a little of Alfred
Hitchcock, though Ford says (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath
(enditalic)takes it up a notch from the ``master of suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I admire the tradition of Hitchcock {ellipsis} I
never really believed his characters,'' he says, ``to the extent
that I think these characters are believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we invested a lot more in the emotional reality of
these characters and less in the plotting elements that were
typical of Hitchcock.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ford's fans, this is a departure from roles like Han Solo,
Indiana Jones and the president of the United States, which he
played in (beginitalic)Air Force One(enditalic). Ford, who thinks
of his fans as customers, says that's the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who have been my customers over the years
have enjoyed the fact that we don't serve the same meal every
time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains, however, that Ford gained his fame as an
action hero, from (beginitalic)Star Wars (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Raiders of the Lost (enditalic)(beginitalic)Ark
(enditalic)to films like (beginitalic)The Fugitive (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Patriot Games(enditalic). But he hasn't done much
action-adventure in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really read anything in the action genre in the last
couple of years I thought was good enough to do,'' he says. ``I'm a
bit tired of the motivations for action that they generally use.
Retribution and revenge bore me now.''
</P>
<P>
   In his films, Ford says, he tries to establish that violence has
costs, both for the victim and the perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate gratuitous violence,'' he explains. ``I hate
indiscriminate gunplay for its entertainment value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford also talked about recent revelations about the cult classic
(beginitalic)Blade Runner(enditalic), in which he plays a detective
trying to hunt down rogue ``replicants'' - artificial life forms
that resemble humans. After the release of the movie's ``director's
cut'' on DVD, fans began to see more clues that Ford's character,
Deckard, was a replicant himself.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ridley Scott recently removed all doubt, telling the
BBC that Deckard was indeed a replicant.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford says that as far as he's concerned, the character in
the 1982 film was human. He says that during the filming, he
battled Scott to keep Deckard human, ``because I think the audience
deserved one proxy on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware that Ridley did not fully agree with me.
{ellipsis} He kept slipping in little details which indicate I was
a replicant,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ford maintains that it would be difficult to replicate
(beginitalic)What Lies Beneath(enditalic), which he considers
top-notch:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary, surprising, unexpected, accomplished and fun.''

EVERETT APPEALS 10-GAME SUSPENSION, FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Minutes after being informed Thursday that he had
been suspended for 10 games and fined an undisclosed amount by
Major League Baseball for twice making contact with plate umpire
Ronald Kulpa last Saturday, Red Sox center fielder Carl Everett
filed an appeal through the Major League Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lenaghan, assistant general counsel for the players'
union, said he filed the appeal after speaking with Everett in the
visitors' clubhouse here Thursday morning, about an hour before the
penalty was announced by Frank Robinson, vice president of on-field
operations for Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal allows Everett to continue playing until a hearing is
held. The hearing will be conducted by Paul Beeston, chief
operating officer for Major League Baseball. No date has been set
for the hearing, and while Beeston has attempted to hear appeals
more quickly than league presidents did in the past, it took him
nearly six weeks to make a ruling on the multiple appeals filed
after the Dodgers' brawl with spectators May 16 at Chicago's
Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   It also was three weeks before Beeston conducted his hearing on
the Tigers-White Sox brawls of April 22, for which Dean Palmer of
the Tigers was suspended eight games for charging the mound, then
coming out of the clubhouse for a second brawl after already having
been ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need time to prepare,'' Lenaghan said. ``This
is not your garden-variety case.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-game suspension assessed Everett is the stiffest penalty
given a player by Robinson, who is in his first year of
administering discipline. It also is the longest given a player for
an on-field incident since Bill Madlock, who was then playing for
Pittsburgh, shoved his glove in the face of umpire Jerry Crawford
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the commissioner's office,
``Boston Red Sox outfielder Carl Everett has been suspended for 10
games and fined an undisclosed amount for excessive arguing, using
foul language, and making contact with an umpire on two occasions
during the Mets-Red Sox game at Fenway Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett hit a home run in his first at-bat after being informed
of his suspension, then struck out a season-high four times in the
Red Sox' 11-7 win over the Orioles in Game 1 of a day-night
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a reaction,'' Everett said before the first game,
breaking his silence on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was asked about comments by Larry Reynolds, his agent,
that a closer viewing of videotapes of the incident showed he had
not head-butted Kulpa, who is in his first season in the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is that the majority of the media tried to
make a guy (into) a monster,'' Everett said. ``Everybody is quick
to judge. I fault the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he regretted any of his actions, Everett said, ``You're
asking a question I really don't have an answer for, because that
answer can be fabricated. There's no need to answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the executive board of the
World Umpires Association, the umpires' new union that is in a
critical stage of its negotiations with Major League Baseball on a
new collective bargaining agreement. Karen Brinkman, administrative
assistant for the WUA, said the union may have a statement
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox spokesman Kevin Shea said general manager Dan Duquette,
who was not here, would not comment on the suspension. Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams was asked if he found the penalty excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for me to decide,'' he said. ``Everybody has a job,
just like you have with that pen right now. Frank Robinson
certainly has a tough job, but somebody has to make a decision. He
accepted the responsibility of taking that job, so he's handled it
the best he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett acknowledged he had spoken with Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him, that's all I can do,'' Everett said. ``He
called me. I talked to him. I told him my side. That's all I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the severity of the suspension, Everett mentioned
how he had spoken out against Pedro Martinez's five-game suspension
for hitting Cleveland's Roberto Alomar with a pitch April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've defended Pedro before, and what I stated with Pedro I
pretty much still feel the same,'' he said. ``Certain situations
are going be treated differently, so really I don't have an opinion
on every situation that goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The media) tried to make me out to be a monster, that's the
whole thing. That's purely it. If you listen to everything someone
said, it's their own opinion instead of what you actually see.
That's what they want everyone else to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he saw, Everett said, ``I would say I didn't do the
things people said I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he found unfair about the suspension that led
him to appeal, Everett said, ``I can't really state that here
because there's no merit here. Where I state that is when I go for
my appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reporter mentioned to Everett that several of his
teammates had explained Everett's actions as the result of a
competitor being ``juiced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There again, I mean I can say some things that could rattle
some feathers but I'd rather keep that to myself until I appeal my
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if he blamed Kulpa, who twice drew a line in the
dirt around home plate after Mets catcher Mike Piazza complained
that Everett was standing too close to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to judge another person,'' he said. ``I would
not go out of my way to just make myself look better. Let
everything stand as it is right now. At a later date, I can
elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he felt he owed an apology to his teammates, he
said: ``That's just something between me and my teammates.''

CLIMBING RAINIER TAKES GOOD TRAINING, GUIDES AND LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY E. NEVALA  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ I grew up in southern Michigan, where the highest
elevation within 40 miles of my home was the top floor of a
downtown parking garage. Mountain climbing never made my athletic
resume, and after relocating to Seattle I considered the Cascade
Range just a pretty backdrop for cycling and snowshoeing.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in March, when I paused before an American Lung
Association poster featuring a smiling woman gripping an ice ax
near the top of Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure of climbing one of the highest peaks in the United
States intrigued me. I talked to Rainier climbers, read books on
the topic, then nervously began training to take part in the
Washington Lung Association's annual fund-raiser, Climb for Clean
Air.
</P>
<P>
   My rookie jitters diminished when I discovered that our route
from Paradise, the mountain's most popular base-to-summit
trailhead, was not technical. Although the climb requires ropes,
crampons, ice axes and helmets above 10,000 feet, it does not
involve scaling rocks and cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   Most described the two-day, round-trip climb as a long, steady
march.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climbing Mount Rainier is a lot like climbing stairs,'' said
famed Rainier guide Lou Whittaker. His guide outfit, Rainier
Mountaineering Inc., begins the ascent at Paradise at 5,400 feet
and includes a lengthy evening rest stop at Camp Muir at 10,000
feet before a midnight attempt on the 14,411-foot summit.
</P>
<P>
   The early start for the top ensures a cold, firm climbing
surface, reducing the risk of rock- and icefall and allowing for a
timely descent. The group returns to Paradise the same day as the
summit attempt.
</P>
<P>
   To train I upped my aerobic activity. Weekdays I swam, cycled
and jogged, and on weekends I hiked Mount Si near North Bend. As
the climb date approached, before work each day I threw on a pack
stuffed with a water-filled milk carton and an eight-pound
``Encyclopedia of Mammals'' and trudged up and down Queen Anne
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Twice I drove to Paradise for practice hikes to Camp Muir. My
cousin's 21-pound baby boy even helped with workouts, riding in a
backpack koala-style to the top of Tiger Mountain outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While guides direct climbers' every move on the mountain, this
risky sport requires safety training. A month before my climb, I
spent a Saturday with the RMI guides at Paradise to learn ice-ax
handling and rope-team etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to avoid the label ``dope on a rope.''
</P>
<P>
   We practiced self-arrest, purposely hurtling our bodies down the
slope headfirst and upside down, then stopping falls with our axes
and kicking our plastic boot toes into the snow for bracing.
</P>
<P>
   The guides emphasized two tips for a successful climb: a type of
walking called the rest step, and pressure breathing.
</P>
<P>
   To learn the rest step, one guide suggested we ``walk like a
stork.'' The front foot quickly steps forward, while the straight
back leg pauses and holds the body weight, allowing skeletal
support. Repeated again and again and those restful pauses add up.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the rest step with pressure breathing _ normal
inhaling followed by hard, whoooshing exhaling that rids the lungs
of excess carbon dioxide _ has helped thousands of climbers to
mountain summits much higher than Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick is to consume plenty of water and food. Eating at
altitude doesn't always appeal, since many climbers' stomachs start
to hula. So RMI guides emphasize favorite foods over healthier
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're certainly not going to gain weight on this climb,''
they said. ``Bring whatever you will put in your mouth and
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   And so I carried phad thai noodles, pretzels, chocolate energy
bars, Fig Newtons and M&AMP;Ms tucked in 30 pounds of gear when I
departed Paradise on a sunny Thursday morning with 23 teammates and
six RMI guides.
</P>
<P>
   We switchbacked in shorts and T-shirts single file for the first
couple of miles. After skirting crumbly rocks at Pebble Creek, we
hiked straight up the Muir Snowfield, a giant white mat of treeless
landscape. After each hour of hiking, we stopped for a 15-minute
break to eat, drink, adjust clothing layers and apply sunblock.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at Camp Muir at 10,000 feet in five hours, thrilled
by the sight of the modest A-frame ranger hut, boxy bunkhouse,
stone cookhouse and three outhouses. A dinner of spaghetti, red
sauce and corn revived us. After eating, RMI guide Brent Okita
detailed the terrain and weather conditions for the summit attempt,
then shooed us to bed at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Light sleepers found no mercy from snoring, stinky, restless
climbers as we lay in cozy bundles within the bunkhouse's plywood
shell. Most climbers were wide-eyed when Okita gave the wake-up
call at 12:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Good-natured chaos followed in the college-dorm-size room as 24
climbers scrambled out of sleeping bags, layered their clothing,
cinched plastic boots and adjusted harnesses and helmets. I gulped
hot peach oatmeal before retrieving my pack outside.
</P>
<P>
   My hands shook as I reloaded snacks, fleece shirts and a
Gore-Tex jacket. It was nerves, not cold. The climbing conditions
were ideal, with the temperature around 30 degrees and only a
gentle swirl of wind.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Okita announced the climbing teams, guide-led
groups of five and six people mixed and matched according to
strength and ability. Before roping to my team, I swapped my
climbing poles for an ice ax and laced on crampons _ metal spikes
attached to boots to give traction on the glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   Guides double-checked our harnesses and headlamps and we were
the first RMI team to walk away from Camp Muir at 1:54 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A glittering quilt of stars draped the sky and my stress eased
as I breathed the cool air. I relaxed my white-knuckled hold on my
section of rope _ our guide, my five teammates and I were each
separated by 30 feet. The trail ahead resembled a miniature
highway, the path brightened by headlamps from independent climbers
who started even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes of gentle hills over ice-crusted snow, we hit
Cathedral Gap, a nasty, steep outcropping of loose dirt and
fist-size volcanic rock. We spent 40 minutes picking through when,
at 11,000 feet, I snagged my crampon. I stumbled, my right knee and
shin crunching on sharp rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get up, we have to go,'' called Okita from his lead position.
With 200 Rainier summits notched on his climbing belt, he knew this
route. And I knew he wasn't kidding. Rockfall was a danger here.
</P>
<P>
   We hustled another 200 feet to our first rest stop. I palmed my
knee and felt the swell beneath my climbing pants. With a triathlon
and several bicycle trips scheduled _ in addition to a 9,000-foot
descent _ I needed a healthy leg.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked and disappointed, I knew my summit would have to come
another day.
</P>
<P>
   As a pink and orange sunrise lit craggy Little Tahoma, I turned
back with a guide and another climber suffering from altitude
sickness. My teammates walked on to complete what many later called
the most difficult physical challenge of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   For the next five hours they rested only three more times as
they steadily gained another 3,000 feet in elevation. They crossed
a 100-foot deep crevasse via a horizontal ladder and battled colder
winds, thinner air and steeper slopes.
</P>
<P>
   One rope team dodged a boulder rolling down the mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   Altitude sickness stopped two more climbers. Others suffered
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so pumped to get there. Nothing was going to turn me
around,'' said Carter Woollen, a Seattle architect. ``The
adrenaline was just going.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue Web writer Carry Porter called the last 300 yards to
the snow-swept summit the most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   At the top many climbers hugged and slapped hands. Some cried.
While many dropped their packs and bodies on the mountain's crater
rim, a dozen walked another quarter-mile across the flat crater
floor to the true summit, Columbia Crest, a small snowy knoll at
14,411 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was calm, the air was crystal clear and we had a fantastic
sunrise,'' Porter said. ``You could see mountains in Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   One hour and dozens of snapshots later, the group reversed
course. At noon, three hours after departing the summit, they
arrived at Camp Muir rubber-legged but smiling, snacking on Oreos
and honeydew melon before a two-hour descent to hot showers and a
celebration dinner at the Paradise Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest thing I've ever done. My calves and quads
are just shredded,'' said Laura Downey, who works in a retail
garden center at Pike Place Market. ``I've run two marathons, done
the STP (Seattle to Portland bicycle ride), and multiple
half-marathons. They are easy money, in comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   But was it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Downey: ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   CLIMBING MOUNT RAINIER
</P>
<P>
   Reaching Rainier's 14,411-foot summit requires a vertical
elevation gain of more than 9,000 feet over a distance of eight or
more miles. While most routes are not technical, climbers must be
in excellent physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Many climbers go with a guide service offering one-day climbing
instruction, two-day summit climbs, five-day climbing seminars and
private climbs. Summer is the most popular time to climb, although
trips go year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Gearheads rejoice: There is plenty of required equipment,
including ice axes, crampons, ski poles, helmets, down jackets,
sleeping bags and boots. Most equipment can be rented locally.

 &HT;    Career as a Las Vegas blackjack dealer hard way to make an easy
living
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ She's standing at a blackjack table at The Mirage
Hotel, expertly dealing the cards and chatting with patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Her name tag reads ``Nancy'' and ``Dayton, Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want customers to know where we're from because it's an
icebreaker,'' explains Nancy Potasky Stein, who's been a Las Vegas
dealer 16 years. ``It gives them a chance to say they're also from
Dayton or Columbus or Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in tuxedo shirt and bow tie, short black skirt and
teal-and-black vest decorated with a palm-tree design, Stein has
worked her way up to the top of a profession she calls fun and
exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard way to make an easy living,'' Stein says. ``I like
it because it's a people job.''
</P>
<P>
   That's obvious on this particular morning as a patron steers her
wheelchair up to Stein's table.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know my mother passed away,'' the woman confides as Stein
begins to deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a local who always came in with her mother,'' says Stein
later. ``I knew right away when I didn't see her mother that
something was wrong. I have a lot of repeat customers; you get to
know their whole life stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clients come from around the world and speak a variety of
languages. Her workplace is one of the strip's most elaborate
hotels, housing novelties ranging from Siegfried and Roy's gorgeous
snow-white leopards and white tigers to a ``live volcano'' that
erupts every half hour.
</P>
<P>
   On her way to work, she passes live dolphins and sharks, a
tropical rain forest, palm trees and loads of orchids.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as glamorous as it might appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stand on your feet all day and sometimes you have to put
up with obnoxious people,'' Stein says. ``But, overall, people are
basically nice _they're out having a good time, they're on
vacation, they're relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did a local girl end up cutting the chips in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   It all started when her dad opened an auto painting shop in Las
Vegas and his daughter began accompanying him to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I might want to be a dealer,'' said Stein, then 24,
who had attended the University of Tampa and always worshipped the
sun. ``I had never picked up a deck of cards in my life!
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had a friend who had a dealers' school and he said
you could earn a good living,'' she remembers. Today, according to
Stein, dealers earn between $20,000 and $80,000, primarily in tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually paid just minimum wage,'' Stein explains,
adding that dealers prefer the type of tip in which the player
makes a bet for the dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dealer might average between $120-$160 a day in tips plus
their salary,'' says Stein, who deals in two areas _ a low limit
$5,000 pit and a high limit ($5,000-$10,000) pit on weekends. Stein
works six hours a day, with 20 -minute breaks each hour.
</P>
<P>
   Employee cafeterias provide another perk: Casino employees eat
whatever they like free of charge when they're on duty. There are
also complimentary tickets to shows to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who has always dealt blackjack_ the nation's most popular
casino game _ says dealing isn't as easy as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You practice by pitching cards into a hat for hours,'' she
says. ``You learn to deal out of a shoe, how to cut the chips, what
the payoffs are.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dealing had traditionally been a man's profession, by the
time Stein attended dealers' school, women were dealing as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all by myself, scared but excited,'' she recalls.
``Everyone said I'd be back in Dayton in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing the course, neophyte dealers get their feet wet
by working at downtown casinos as apprentices, then move to the
strip.
</P>
<P>
   Stein practiced at El Cortez, then went to the Horseshoe .
</P>
<P>
   ``Every casino has a different costume,'' says Stein. ``At the
Horseshoe, we wore jeans and a bolero and cowboy boots.'' She
worked her way up to the Golden Nugget, the old MGM, then moved to
the prestigious Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're interviewed by the casino manager, other
times you are auditioned _ they watch you deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein suffered a temporary setback at the age of 30 when she was
diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fighter,'' she says. ``I kept my apartment here but
went back to Dayton for the chemo and radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits her dad with encouraging her to become a dealer when
she expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll earn a good living and meet a nice Jewish boy,'' he
assured her.
</P>
<P>
   Both predictions have come true. At 43, Stein met and married
Howard Stein, a pit boss at the Bellagio hotel. It was a first
marriage for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to get married but I was very picky,'' says
Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stein says his wife is an excellent dealer who's lots of
fun, always upbeat and brings out the best in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of dealers out here who are stone-faced and
don't talk, and you might as well go to a machine!'' he says.
``When you gamble most people lose money because that's what Las
Vegas is built on. People aren't exactly happy when they lose but
the hurt isn't so bad when you're with Nancy because you're having
fun. She gets everybody involved _ the people at the table are all
interacting with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein says Las Vegas has changed dramatically since she arrived
20 years ago. Then, she says, the town was known for cheap
all-you-can-eat buffets; today, gourmet restaurants abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all the concerts come here now,'' Stein says. ``Las Vegas
is a good value for a vacation and now people bring their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite Las Vegas acts currently include ``O,'' a Cirque du
Soleil show performed on a stage of water at the Bellagio;
impersonator Danny Gans, who performs at The Mirage, and
``Mystere,'' another Cirque show at Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   Any gambling advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Come knowing that gambling is for entertainment only,'' she
advises. ``Come to have a good time. Pick up a strategy card if
you're a novice ... it will tell you when to split, when to double
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't spend more than you can afford to lose.''

 &HT;    When your bones betray you
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The falling seemed interminable. Like Alice down the
rabbit hole.
</P>
<P>
   But the landing was hard, and Anita Stillman had no doubt that
she had broken her left hip.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly 79, this active woman was participating in a breast
cancer seminar at Boca Raton Community Hospital when her weakened
bones betrayed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting at the end of the table. I was getting up to get
a cold drink and somebody had put a pocketbook underneath,'' she
recalls, gesturing under her sofa to indicate how the errant object
had obstructed her path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught my right foot in it and I went flying, and . . .
believe me, as I came down, I could hear my doctor saying, `Your
left hip has nothing very much left there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit, I knew I cracked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing very much left there. Words that had caused the
grandmother to cringe when she had heard them only three days
before.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis: osteoporosis, a thinning of the bones that will
cause half the women over 50 to experience a fracture in their
lifetimes. And one in eight men over 50, as well, according to the
National Osteoporosis Foundation, (www.nof.org).
</P>
<P>
   Peak bone mass is reached in the 20s and 30s, so exercise and
calcium are extremely important then to build up strong bone mass.
At least 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily is advised. When bone
loss begins, as it will, in the 40s for women and in the 50s for
men, increased calcium is recommended _ about 1,200 milligrams a
day average _ along with continued exercise, moderate alcohol, and
no smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The message going out today is: Osteoporosis is both a
preventable and treatable disease.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman had very little bone density left when she fell, but
that was the second time she had gotten a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people her age, she thought that broken bones were a
consequence of aging and had tried and discarded treatment three
years earlier when the drug she was taking to build her bone mass,
Fosamax, gave her heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis? That hurt, and resulted in replacement of both her
knees.
</P>
<P>
   But osteoporosis is a silent disease that rarely alerts those
who have it.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman did have an indication, though, that all wasn't well.
</P>
<P>
   Her posture had deteriorated _ ``My children noticed I was
stooped, and my husband kept saying, `Stand up!' '' _ and she had
lost an inch in height, both signs of bone deterioration. Yet, she
didn't follow through on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't doing it consistently,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't suffer with osteoporosis. When I took my first (bone
density) test, I was surprised at the results. If it doesn't hurt,
you don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   FOCUSING ON CANCER INSTEAD
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem appears to be that women are more afraid of
cancer than of osteoporosis, even though the risk of a hip fracture
equals the combined risk of developing breast, ovarian and uterine
cancer, the National Osteoporosis Foundation advises.
</P>
<P>
   And 20 percent of those with hip fractures _ men and women _ are
dead within a year because of conditions like pneumonia that can
develop when people are bedridden with fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Some women are afraid, also, of Fosamax, the often prescribed
medication, which can cause intestinal problems or ulcers in the
esophagus if not taken correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon R. Sullivan of Greenaces is one of those. Even though her
mother had osteoporosis, and she herself had a bone density test
that showed she was losing bone mass, Sullivan quit taking the drug
four years ago after a four-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the drug disagreed with her, it's that she had
read about its possible risks _ which occur infrequently if
instructions are followed, according to the American Medical
Association _ and didn't want to take that chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there's got to be a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor showed her pictures of her weakened bones; he argued
with her to continue to take some medication. Eventually, she lied
and told him she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wanted to listen to him? I think he really truly believes
that I should and I didn't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows that medical tests showed Fosamax _ first introduced
in 1995 _ builds healthy bone at the spine and hip, but she prefers
to try a regimen of diet, exercise, and vitamins that is
recommended to prevent bone weakening.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, she walks 4 miles every other day, alternating with yoga
exercises followed by weight lifting. She also takes 1,200
milligrams of calcium plus vitamin D daily. (Doctors generally
recommend 1,500 milligrams daily for postmenopausal women not on
hormone replacement therapy.)
</P>
<P>
   And she eats lots of high-calcium foods.
</P>
<P>
   When she went back for her follow-up bone density test two years
after her initial exam, her condition was the same. She hadn't lost
bone density, but she hadn't gained any, either.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are other drugs that can be used for
osteoporosis, Sullivan is sticking with her routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the alternative method is far better for me. Not only
am I strengthening my bones by lifting weights, I'm eating foods
that have a lot more antioxidants in them. And I have lost a good
30 pounds!''
</P>
<P>
   She's scheduled to take another test this year (Medicare pays
for bone density tests every two years for people at risk) but
still hasn't decided whether she'd switch to drugs if her bones are
thinning further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking very positively at this point,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICATION CRUCIAL FOR SOME
</P>
<P>
   Doctors warn that waiting can be a dangerous game, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the early, early stages (of bone loss), chances
are you'd benefit from going on prophylactic care and not waiting
and seeing,'' said Dr. Richard Levine, an internist, who
specializes in geriatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you're downright osteoporotic, you should find a
medicine that works. Or watch your step!''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Ettinger, medical director of the Clinical Research
Center of South Florida in Stuart and Lake Worth, agrees that there
should be no doubt about taking medication if a patient already has
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   But there might be room for experimenting, such as Sullivan is
doing, if the patient is only mildly affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how low (in bone density) she is. If she's not
dangerously low, and maintaining (bone), fine. She needs to be
monitored on an ongoing basis. That's different from a woman going
down (in bone density) or already osteoporotic with a high risk of
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic number at which fracture risk increases. It's
an ever increasing continuum of risk. There are rapid and slow bone
losers. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he emphasizes, ``cleaning up lifestyles and taking calcium
pills are not enough for many women. An adequate diet and exercise
will certainly slow the rate of bone loss, but for some women it's
not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   CHANGES IN MOBILITY, ACTIVITIES
</P>
<P>
   Anita Stillman knows that truth.
</P>
<P>
   Since her fall, she has been using a nasal spray, Miacalcin, to
help retard bone loss, and is taking calcium and vitamin D daily.
</P>
<P>
   Her lifestyle, however, has been severely affected by her fall.
She has to use a walker and painkillers to get through her day, and
she no longer can dash out the door on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   She gazes at the ceiling fan she used to stand on a ladder to
clean and shakes her head, no. That's a task she won't try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a most debilitating thing. I must alter my lifestyle
because I know my bones are thin. I'll do my best to build them up
because I am aware of what is wrong. Once you know you have it, if
a person has any kind of intelligence, they have to know it doesn't
go away. Don't wait till you fall.''

 &HT;    WOMEN'S VOTE UP FOR GRABS THIS YEAR, TO GORE'S DISMAY
 &HT;    1100&AMP;add. With VOTERS-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories for release Sunday, July 23.

<P>
   VIENNA, Va. _ Shielded by a shade tree from the midday sun,
Nancy Luciani sits in a trim municipal park as her son and a gaggle
of other 6-year-olds chase a ball across a grassy field. Nearby are
all the trappings of life in the 'burbs: the jogging strollers, the
minivans, the fellow parents waiting to ferry their kids to their
next summer activity.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani is a 36-year-old mom watching her kid play soccer. But
do not call her a ``soccer mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The soccer-mom term is so derogatory. It suggests that all
women think and feel the same way,'' says Luciani, a former
corporate systems analyst and now full-time mother of three from
Oakton, Va., a suburb of Washington. ``Women care about a lot of
different things.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas care a lot about women _ and their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, soccer moms gained almost mythical stature among
campaign operatives and political commentators as a coveted swing
voting bloc that would re-elect President Clinton or give
Republican Bob Dole a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, as they had in '92, a majority of women voters handed
Bill Clinton a decisive victory, demonstrating their traditional
preference for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the neck-and-neck 2000 presidential campaign is a
different story. According to polls, Bush is cutting into the
conventional Democratic advantage with women, the very voters Gore
must have if he expects to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real clear that younger women, mothers, married women,
are key battleground groups,'' said pollster Andrew Kohut, director
of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the campaign illustrates just how hard Bush and
Gore are trying to appeal to the bloc _ each touting proposals for
education, children, health care and community values.
</P>
<P>
   But women voters are no monolith.
</P>
<P>
   Working women naturally are interested in the economy,
fair-labor issues and women's rights. Working moms care about those
things too, plus day-care and family leave. Stay-at-home mothers
pay attention to education and family values. For many but not most
women, abortion is a make-or-break issue, depending on which side
of the issue they are on.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms, suburb moms, mall moms _ by any other name, this
target group is mainly young, mainly white and mainly living in
suburbs and small towns. They represent anywhere between 5 and 20
percent of the electorate, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this group of women so important as a voting bloc are
men.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-Republican gender gap exists because men
abandoned the Democratic party during the Reagan era in the 1980s
and, to a greater extent, in the midterm elections of 1994 that
elected a Republican Congress. Since early 1999, surveys show that
Bush has consistently drawn greater support from men compared to
Gore, leading by an average of 20 percentage points in recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the battle for women, the stakes are greatest for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he holds what several recent polls describe as only a
slight lead among all women, and in some surveys he lags among
married women. A Pew Research Center poll in late June found Gore
trailing Bush among mothers, 45 percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, women have been a core constituency for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the presidency from Bush's father in 1992, Clinton
garnered 45 percent of the women's vote, compared to 37 percent for
the elder Bush. In 1996, Clinton doubled his victory margin to 16
percentage points, beating Dole among women voters 54 percent to 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Gore losing some of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is smart. He's talking about issues that women do care
about _ education, children's health, Social Security. He speaks
with a more credible voice on these issues than previous Republican
candidates have,'' said Anna Greenberg, a pollster at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for Al Gore to shore up the traditional base,
and the base includes important blocs of Democratic and independent
women voters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some pollsters and political analysts detect a potentially
more troublesome factor for Gore. Many women voters, when gauging
qualities such as character and trust, view him negatively.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show Bush out-polling Gore on character
evaluations and leadership qualities. Gore's poll numbers dipped in
June amid news reports that Justice Department officials had
recommended that an independent counsel probe the vice president's
1996 campaign finance activities.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Browning, a high-school teacher and 41-year-old mother
of three in Vienna, Va., voted for Clinton in 1992 and in 1996 and
considers herself a solid Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But she does not like Gore, and cannot bring herself to support
Bush. Instead, she'll vote for third-party candidate and consumer
advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want authenticity. Someone who seems genuine and not
sculpted by some marketing specialist,'' she said. ``I just don't
trust him (Gore) because he seems so contradictory depending on the
audience he's talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaigns for governor in Texas, Bush proved popular with
women voters. Running against a woman, Democratic incumbent Ann
Richards in 1994, Bush split the women's vote. In 1998, Bush won
re-election with 65 percent of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush thus far has
commanded the presidential campaign agenda and prevented Gore from
stressing the kinds of issues most appealing to women, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fashioned himself as ``the low-risk change,'' said
Thomas Mann, a scholar of government and politics at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center.
</P>
<P>
   Voters detect few differences between the candidates on bedrock
issues like health care and education. That has given Bush an edge
in appealing to both women and men as the anti-Washington candidate
by focusing ``on changing the way we conduct politics,'' Mann said
</P>
<P>
   Yet many pollsters and political scholars dismiss the notion
that Gore has been tainted directly by President Clinton and the
scandals that plagued his administration, most notably the affair
with Monica Lewinsky that led to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore and the Democrats may suffer a credibility problem when
campaigning on family values _ issues such as community, parenting
and morals that women in particular rank high among their
priorities, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, Clinton has given the Republicans those issues
and made it difficult for the Democrats to talk about them,''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in March asked women what factor is most important
in their vote this year. They were evenly split, with 47 percent
naming an issue or issues and 47 percent citing character and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani, the soccer mom who detests the label, ranks the
character of the candidate and issues involving the economy,
education and family values high on her list. A self-described
independent voter, she says Gore was never an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't know anything about him, if he were starting from
zero, I would consider him,'' she said. ``But knowing about him and
his connections to the Clinton administration, I'd say 'no.' ``
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican nominating convention, convening July 31 in
Philadelphia, the podium with be filled with ample evidence of the
GOP strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Day One: The candidate's wife, Laura Bush, and former Gen. Colin
Powell will address issues of health care, education and Bush's
``leave no child behind'' theme. Day Two: former presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole and GOP adviser Condoleeza Rice will
emphasize America's place in the world. Day Three: a focus on small
business, a traditional Republican theme and one that plays to a
current trend _ about half of all new small businesses are run by
women.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in Los Angeles in mid-August, Gore and the Democrats
will stress the important issues separating him and Bush: gun
control, abortion rights and the party's traditional role as a
defender of equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that, with four months remaining until the
election, much about the character of the race can and probably
will change. Many voters, women and men, have yet to focus on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, women appear much more likely than in the past to
consider the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in '96 the soccer moms, or what that meant, was
baloney,'' said the pollster Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those younger married women or young mothers were always for
Clinton, not for Dole. They thought Dole was out on another planet,
and they couldn't relate to him. But younger women are having a
real hard time choosing between Bush and Gore in a way that they
didn't have four years ago.''

FBI SEIZES COMPUTER DRIVE IN CHINA NUCLEAR INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: for all needing; this story is from Thursday's New York
Times)   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ FBI agents seized a computer hard drive from the
home of a former Energy Department intelligence official in an
effort to determine whether he had disclosed classified information
about the government's investigation into whether China had stolen
U.S. nuclear secrets, officials here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI agents removed the computer drive last Friday from the
home of Notra Trulock, the Energy Department's former director of
intelligence, after questions were raised about an unpublished,
62-page manuscript that he had written.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock, who resigned from the department last year and has been
a major critic of the government's handling of the espionage
inquiry, said the seizure of the computer drive was an effort to
intimidate him into silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to expect this kind of treatment while I was at DOE,''
he said in an interview. ``But I thought by leaving DOE and going
into the private sector, I would avoid it. Instead, it's only
gotten worse. I have no job, no benefits and I was trying to start
a consulting business and all my contact information was on the
computer the FBI seized. So I am dead in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Trulock was also questioned by the FBI agents about whether he
had kept any classified documents, and whether he believed there
was any classified material in the manuscript, Trulock said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told the agents that he had not had access to
classified material on the spy case since he left the government
and that there was nothing classified in the document.
</P>
<P>
   The agents also questioned the owner of the suburban Virginia
town house where Trulock lives who is an Energy Department
employee. She consented to the search of the house and agreed to
the removal of the computer, which she also owns. But the FBI
agents did not show a search warrant to either Trulock or the owner
of the town house, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock had acted as a whistleblower on the handling of the
nuclear espionage case, revealing that the investigation had not
been pursued aggressively within the government.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998 he was a secret star witness for the House panel
that investigated illegal technology transfers to China and
revealed the existence of the long-delayed espionage investigation
at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock became a lightning rod for criticism of the way the spy
case played out. Scientists and Asian-American groups attacked the
FBI and the Energy Department for prematurely making Dr. Wen Ho
Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos, the focus of the
counter-intelligence inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was never charged with espionage, but has been arrested on
charges of mishandling classified material.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI now says that the initial inquiry conducted jointly by
the bureau and the Energy Department into the possible theft of
nuclear data from Los Alamos was flawed, and has broadened the
espionage inquiry to look beyond the New Mexico lab.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock wrote the manuscript about the spy case earlier this
year, and then distributed a few copies to, among others,
congressional aides and former intelligence officials. One former
intelligence official who read it suggested that it be submitted
for possible publication in Studies in Intelligence, a CIA journal.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in Intelligence declined to publish the manuscript and
told Trulock that he should have it checked to determine whether it
contained classified material. But at the same time, a CIA official
also referred the matter to the FBI, informing the bureau that the
article represented an unauthorized disclosure of classified
material.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has begun what one official described as a preliminary
investigation to determine whether the manuscript revealed secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI received information from other government agencies
that classified information was subject to a possible compromise,''
said an FBI spokesman, John Collingwood. ``The FBI, working with
the Department of Justice, has an obligation to at least
preliminarily determine the facts and determine if further
investigation is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Trulock recently wrote a shorter article on the spy case for the
conservative magazine National Review, but that article did not
prompt the FBI inquiry, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left the government last year, Trulock had not
only become controversial with outside groups angered by the Wen Ho
Lee case, but his willingness to speak out and criticize senior
administration officials had made him plenty of enemies within the
government. He was given a $10,000 award last year by Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson for persevering in the espionage case.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Energy, Trulock moved to the Washington office of
TRW, a government contractor. But he was dismissed from his job in
June. He says that he was told by one official there that he was
being let go because TRW had a big contract with the Energy
Department, and company officials had received pressure from the
Energy Department to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   Both TRW and Energy Department deny the accusation.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Are investors looking at Alan Greenspan through
rose-colored glasses?
</P>
<P>
   They may have done just that Thursday, focusing on all the
positives of the testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman before
the Senate Banking Committee and sending stock and bond prices
sharply higher and interest rates lower. The Nasdaq composite index
jumped 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.4
percent, led by a 12 percent surge in IBM after it reported strong
second-quarter profits late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What investors and analysts saw, to their surprise, was
Greenspan offering encouragement for the view that the central bank
would be able to slow economic growth enough to contain inflation,
without risking a recession and, possibly, without any more
interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has captured the markets' attention here is that
Greenspan has raised the possibility that the Fed is done,'' said
Louis Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said the Fed's aggressive stance of last spring had
mellowed. ``The tone is one of a Fed that is going to be in a
watchful, waiting mode, but doesn't see any catalyst for acting,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But investors may be too optimistic, and this could trip up
markets in the days ahead, when the euphoria created by a mellow
Alan Greenspan wears off.
</P>
<P>
   First, even some Wall Street analysts who were surprised by
Greenspan's optimism still say more Fed rate increases will be
needed in the future to finally slow economic growth to a
manageable, noninflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   While the chances of a rate increase in late August, when Fed
policy makers next meet, are diminishing, Richard Berner, chief
U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, expects at least one
more rate rise before the central bank is finished.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be an even bigger problem lurking for investors if
Greenspan's remarks bring a lot of bulls back to the stock and bond
markets. Strong rallies in both markets, on the belief that the
worst of a yearlong series of Fed increases is over, could make
slowing economic growth much more difficult and require more
increases than now anticipated. Stocks rising to new highs could
set off a burst of consumer spending _ through what is known as the
wealth effect _ of the kind that has reignited economic growth in
the last several years. Declining interest rates will help spur
both businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to rally 15 percent or 20 percent from here, that
would negate some of the Fed's tightening pressure,'' Berner said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this threat to a successful slowdown, or soft
landing, ``most of us didn't expect him to be this
market-friendly,'' Crandall said. ``This was the surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also warned that a soft landing for the economy is not
assured. But that message seemed to be drowned out Thursday by the
market applause for Greenspan's unexpected optimism.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, the Nasdaq index jumped 128.93 points, to
4,184.56, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.61
points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,495.57. The Dow rose 147.79 points, to
10,843.87. IBM, which had announced a 12 percent earnings increase,
accounted for half the Dow's rise. IBM rallied in after-hours
trading on Wednesday, but that did not show up in the Dow until
Thursday, when the stock rose $12.84, to $117.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices were higher as yields, which move in
the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year
note fell to 6 percent, from 6.15 percent Wednesday, while the
price rose 1 3/32, to 103 19/32. The yield on the 10-year note has
been fighting to get back below 6 percent for five weeks. The yield
on the 30-year bond fell to 5.81 percent from 5.91 percent
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One key monitor of concern about Fed rate increases did ease
Thursday. The yield fell on the futures contracts on the federal
funds rate, the central bank's short-term interest rate target, for
August, October, November and December.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony on monetary policy, Greenspan pointed out
several factors restraining consumer spending, including rising
consumer debt, rising oil and gasoline prices and the flat
performance of the stock market so far this year. And he said that
this consumer slowdown, if it continued, might be enough to bring
economic growth down to the noninflationary pace Fed officials
want. That is somewhere around 3.5 percent, well below the 6
percent pace of last year's fourth quarter and this year's first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should this favorable outcome prevail,'' he said, ``the
immediate threat to our prosperity from growing imbalances in our
economy would abate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan also warned that it was too early to declare
victory. ``It is much too soon,'' he said, ``to conclude that these
concerns are behind us. We cannot yet be sure that slower expansion
of domestic final demand, at a pace more in line with potential
supply, will persist.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the economy has reaccelerated after slowing in
the second quarter, a fact that Greenspan mentioned. The next key
economic report is the Employment Cost Index, which measures worker
compensation and is one of the Fed's favorite inflation barometers.
It will be released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The next several days ought to indicate if investors have gotten
Fed-happy. The stock and bond markets have often responded nicely
on the day some positive news is released, only to settle back
after investors realize that they _ and the Fed _ still need to see
more positive data before they know they are out of the woods. But
if investors conclude too early that they are out of the woods,
their optimism, and the rallies it creates, may put them back in
again.  &QL;

MORE IS LESS IN HO-HUM, MORALISTIC `POKEMON 2000' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C   
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never having been a part of the Pokemon phenomenon or craze, I
was curious to experience its seemingly endless appeal to kids for
myself. The concept of Pokemon's Nintendo sensibility providing any
sort of catharsis seemed nebulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' is actually two films _ ``Pikachu's
Rescue Adventure'' followed by ``The Power of One.'' The press
notes say this is a sequel to last fall's hit, ``Pokemon The First
Movie,'' and the kids at a recent preview screening clamored for
their seats and appeared eager to revel in Pokemon magic.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the fad is beginning to wear thin. The theater
wasn't even full, and the young audience was contained and quiet
throughout, which can either be interpreted as a good _ or bad _
sign.
</P>
<P>
   To a neophyte, ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' is a decidedly mixed
bag. The films introduce six new Pokemon along with returning human
counterparts, including Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum. But audiences
must sit through ``Pikachu's Rescue Adventure,'' a 22-minute short,
before the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pikachu's Rescue Adventure'' chronicles the difficulties the
Pokemon face when a storm threatens their peaceful existence. It's
an immediately forgettable effort with little to distinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Power of One'' is decidedly better. It has a cohesive
storyline and is imbued with some semblance of mythology and
Pokemon lore. It mixes creatures similar to Stravinsky's ``The
Firebird'' with a quest to rebalance nature after a greedy
collector attempts to throw that balance off-kilter. The legend
foretells that a ``chosen one'' will come after three Pokemon
legends _ the creatures that embody ice, fire and lightning _
``wreak destruction upon the world in which they clash.'' This
havoc will force the ultimate Pokemon named Lugia, who lives deep
in the sea, to surface and face capture.
</P>
<P>
   If this doom comes to pass, the Earth ``shall turn to ash,''
which refers to Ash Ketchum himself, and the boy must muster the
courage to help ward off impending destruction.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly a metaphysical premise that may be too
sophisticated for smaller kids, but at least it attempts to create
some sense of the natural world and the chaos that human greed can
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may just be the Pokemon chatter, which is
indistinguishable, that kids like so much. Due to its
nonsensicalness, kids can find any meaning they wish. It just may
be that ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' will fare better with older kids
and adults, while smaller children will be bored by the lack of
Pokemon action and might prefer good old-fashioned fun over a
higher-minded moral.

   LONDON-CULTURE _ LONDON _ Take a walk in Brixton. Four miles
from the gray postcard propriety of Westminster, Brixton is a riot
of noise and color. It pulsates with hefty bass riffs and reggae
rhythms dancing from knee-high speakers on the sidewalks outside CD
stores and appliance shops. In the borough's lively street market,
you hear the melodious sounds of Yoruba, Shona, Arabic, Spanish ?
occasionally even English. No less than Parliament House with Big
Ben and Churchill's statue, however, Brixton now is a part of the
fiber of modern London, a city rapidly being redefined by its
ethnic variety. ``Multiracial London is coming of age, and it is
this that is igniting such energy, buzz and creativity,'' wrote
Yasmin Alibhair-Brown, a columnist for the Independent newspaper

   EDMONSON-COLUMN _ The Internet might be the greatest

could also be the unrivaled champion at spreading misinformation.
The most recent highly visible instance involves a group that
gathered about 200 years before e-mail: the signers of the
Declaration of Independence. A number of recent columns _ including
one by Ann Landers that ran July 4 _ recount what supposedly
happened to some of these men. The pieces are riddled with errors,
exaggerations and misinterpretations. (Edmonson, Atlanta

ELS IN LEAD AFTER FIRST ROUND OF BRITISH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Ernie Els opened his eyes Thursday
morning, turned on the television in his hotel room and got an
immediate wake-up call. He saw players with early tee times
pummeling The Old Course at St. Andrews with birdies. He saw Tiger
Woods make a back-nine surge and charge his way onto the leader
board.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Els reached the driving range to prepare for his
afternoon round, the pressure was inescapable. Either he would join
the leaders with a strong opening round at the British Open, or he
would face an early deficit that might be too large to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Els did more than join the leaders. He passed them. Shooting an
opening-round 6-under 66, including a rare birdie on the No. 17
Road Hole, one of the world's toughest par 4s, Els held a
one-stroke lead over Woods and Steve Flesch after Thursday's first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Both Woods and Flesch shot 67s, while seven players were tied at
68 just two strokes off the lead: Tom Lehman, the 1996 British Open
champion; Scott Dunlap and Ian Garbutt of England; Sergio Garcia of
Spain; Padraig Harrington of Ireland; Shigeki Maruyama of Japan,
and Dennis Paulson of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several players who expected to contend virtually eliminated
themselves with poor rounds. Hal Sutton shot 75, Nick Price and
John Daly both shot 76, and defending champion Paul Lawrie shot 78.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty of the 151 players in the field shot under par, as
afternoon temperatures were in the 70s, and there was not enough
wind to seriously affect ball flight or club selection. At times,
it felt more like San Diego than St. Andrews. If conditions remain
that way, it will be difficult for Woods or anyone else to run
away, because many players will continue to shoot under par.
</P>
<P>
   Remember last year's British Open at Carnoustie, Scotland, when
the winning score was 6 over ? This will be a far different
championship if the weather remains calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is firm and fast, but if you are playing well, the
course is there for the taking,'' said Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting precise and powerful drives that gave him great angles
into the greens, Els took the lead with the cool and calculating
style that has made him a two-time U.S. Open champion (1994 and
1997). He entered the tournament with momentum, winning last week's
Standard Life Loch Lomond Invitational in Scotland, and he has
played strong golf the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Els has been overshadowed and outplayed by Woods, just like
everyone else in golf. When Woods won the U.S. Open by a
record-setting 15 strokes last month, it was Els who tied for
second with Miguel Angel Jimenez. When Vijay Singh won the Masters
in April, Els finished second. And when Woods opened the year with
a thrilling victory at the Mercedes Championships, he had to beat
Els in a riveting battle that lasted until the second hole of
sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   If Els were to finish second this weekend, he would become the
first player in history to finish second in three consecutive
majors. But finishing second is not what Els is about. With people
looking for the latest rival for Woods, Els may be playing well
enough to assume that role shortly, perhaps this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a few players that can step up and be the rival,
whatever you want to call it,'' Els said. ``If I play well, I'm
probably going to play with Tiger sometime this week. He plays at
that level just about every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to think about it too much. Tiger is a
good friend of mine and he's one heck of a player. Whoever wins
this week is probably the next rival of Tiger Woods, if it's not
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woods wins, he will become the youngest player in history, at
age 24, to win the career Grand Slam. For Woods, it was important
to avoid an early deficit that would force him to play catch-up,
and Thursday's strong start put him in excellent position. After
dominating last month's U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, Woods entered
this tournament as the overwhelming favorite. Yet Woods will gladly
settle for any victory, whether it's by 15 strokes or one stroke.
And Thursday, he took the first step toward that mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened at the U.S. Open, you have to put it
behind you,'' said Woods, after a bogey-free round that included a
furious flurry _ five birdies in a seven-hole stretch beginning
with a 12-foot birdie putt on No. 9, and ending with a 10-foot
birdie putt on No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he had never played St. Andrews in more favorable
conditions. ``I don't think I've ever played any links golf like
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Els overtook Woods with a strong start, making four birdies
and just one bogey on the front nine. Then playing into the wind on
the back nine, Els added birdies on No. 10, No. 12, and No. 14,
followed by his final birdie on No. 17, which was world class. How
difficult is the par-4, 455-yard No. 17 at St. Andrews? There were
four birdies there Thursday, 70 bogeys, 21 double-bogeys and seven
scores worse than double-bogey.
</P>
<P>
   But Els had one of the four birdies. The tee shot at No 17 is
unnerving, forcing players to hit over a portion of the Old Course
Hotel into a fairway which they cannot see. Players chose their
line on the tee shot by using a sign that sits against the wall of
the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the word ``course', and you go over the letter
U,'' said Els. ``That's the exact line.''
</P>
<P>
   That works if you are as good as Els. After hitting a perfect
tee shot at No. 17, Els hit a gorgeous 6-iron from 183 yards that
landed six feet from the pin. The gallery in the stands adjacent to
the 17th green roared, then Els made the putt to take the lead. And
Els almost birdied No. 18 as well, missing a 12-foot birdie
attempt, before a tap-in par ended his day.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Els was not a big fan of St. Andrews. He
had begun to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple of blind shots, but if you start getting your
lines right off the tees, the golf course becomes a little more
fun,'' he said. ``As to where it ranks as my favorite courses?
Let's see after this week.''

COLUMN: PUZZLING INVESTORS WITH ACCOUNTING MYSTERIES IS POOR
PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analyzing financial reports can resemble detective work.
Sometimes a certain fact is crucial; sometimes it is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   One such fact is the trend in accounts receivable, the measure
of how much customers owe but haven't yet paid. A surge may
indicate that the company is having disputes with its customers
over how much they owe, or that customers are having problems
paying their bills. Or, it may reflect a more liberal credit policy
that is bolstering sales and profits. Either way, it is something
that American investors are used to being able to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   But what does it mean if a company leaps through accounting
hoops and comes up with a way to avoid disclosing what is happening
to accounts receivable, as well as other facts normally disclosed
on a routine basis?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question confronting investors in Modis Professional
Services, a company that used to be a hot stock when it was called
Accustaff. Modis was created in the early 1990s as a ``roll up,'' a
company that merged dozens of temporary help firms to create a
national operation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believed then that such combines somehow created
synergies that made the whole more valuable than the sum of its
parts. Now, roll-ups are out of fashion and Modis' stock price is
down 78 percent from its 1998 high. Modis is trying to get with the
current fashion. It has sold some operations and plans to cut what
is left into two pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The largest segment, the information technology division,
provides about two-thirds of Modis' revenues. But Modis says that
is the business being spun off to shareholders. So it treats it as
a discontinued operation, and its latest quarterly report gives no
details about its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   That is, to put it mildly, ridiculous. Not only is the division
by far the largest part of Modis, but it is not being discontinued
so far as the shareholders are concerned. They will continue to own
it when the spin-off is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Modis' lack of disclosure does, however, comply with the minimum
requirements of the current accounting rules. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board last week proposed a new rule that would
require complete disclosures in such cases, but that rule won't
take effect for some time. Still, even though the current rule
allows such treatment, nothing in it keeps Modis from telling its
shareholders what is happening to the balance sheet of its largest
operation. It just chooses not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Modis is run by accountants. Its chief executive, Derek Dewan,
and its chief financial officer, Michael Abney, are both former
managing partners of the Jacksonville, Fla., office of Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. I wondered whether they thought that it was fair to
investors to conceal such information. But the company's general
counsel, after being told what I wanted to ask them about, called
back to say they felt it would be improper to discuss such subjects
while the spin-off was being planned.
</P>
<P>
   So we return to the question. What does it mean? I don't know.
The fact that revenues at the information technology division fell
14 percent in the first quarter _ Modis did disclose that _ is not
good news. But the fact that Dewan bought stock at $10.25 a share
in April, or 25 percent more than the current price of $8.1875, is
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting mystery. But that is just the point. It
shouldn't be a mystery at all. Before executives with access to
such routine information make more trades, they should let the
other shareholders in on the facts.
</P>

JUDGE ALLOWS CONVENTION PROTESTERS TO GET CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The protesters, paraders, and puppeteers will now
be seen as well as heard by delegates to the upcoming Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the constitutional right to free speech against safety
concerns, a federal judge has struck down the city's plan to keep
protesters fenced out and far from the convention hall. US District
Judge Gary A. Feess called the plan, which included a large
``no-access zone'' around the Staples Center, unjustified and a
violation of the demonstrators' 1st Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, coming less than a month before the convention,
leaves Los Angeles police and other law enforcement agencies little
time to rework security arrangements. But Feess' decision was
heralded by the protest groups' leaders, who expect thousands of
demonstrators to take to the streets to highlight issues ranging
from corporate globalization to application of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just regular people who feel left out of the process by
both (major political) parties,'' said Margaret Prescod, a key
organizer of the protests. ``We just want to be out there with our
kids and our puppets and singing our songs and making our voices
heard. But there's practically a hysteria going on about protesters
and destruction of property and even biochemical weapons when,
truth be told, the only chemicals we know of are the tear gas and
pepper spray the police have.''
</P>
<P>
   Although organizers of the demonstrations and parades have
repeatedly stressed their commitment to nonviolence, images of last
year's mayhem in Seattle overshadowed security planning for the
convention. The city's now-barred plan would have kept
demonstrators with permits in a parking lot about 260 yards from
the convention site and prevented them from gathering on their own
in Pershing Square, which is opposite the Biltmore Hotel, where
many of the VIPs will be staying, and near the downtown business
district.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. John Pasquariello, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police
Department, said his agency is now meeting with Secret Service
officials to remap the boundaries and reduce the perimeter. He said
the closer proximity will present ``a few more challenges'' to
police, who protest leaders have charged as having an us-vs.-them
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the boundaries were put there for a reason, because
we believed they were best,'' Pasquariello said. ``We've said all
along that we are not in the business of deny anyone's 1st
Amendment right to protest. But we would be remiss if we didn't
prepare for the possibility that certain individuals or groups will
try to disrupt the convention and may use illegal means to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders, however, considered the no-access zone and
other rules isolating, and the American Civil Liberties Union sued
on their behalf. In turn, they asked to be allowed within 60-to-70
yards of the convention site, a distance that ACLU staff attorney
Dan Tokaji called close enough to get the attention of delegates
and VIPS, but far enough to address any security concerns. In
remarks Wednesday, with his written ruling expected to be issued
late Thursday, the judge implied demonstators might be allowed just
across the street from the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone in the legal or political
establishment has done the right thing on the convention by saying
people have the right to participate in democracy,'' said Lisa
Fithian, another protest organizer. ``Everything else they've done
_ from taking away the (downtown) square from us to visiting us at
our convergence center to surveilling us _ has been against
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Guinyard, press secretary for LA Convention 2000, insisted
that the city's goal was never to shut down democracy, only to
ensure the safety of President Bill Clinton, presidential candidate
Al Gore and others attending the mid-August convention.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said the city
recognizes citizens' rights to voice their opinions, but also wants
to avoid the trouble that plagued Seattle during World Trade
Organization meetings. While most of those demonstrations were
peaceful _ with protesters locking arms, sitting down on city
streets or chanting their cases _ police responded to the crowds
and a relatively few troublemakers with tear gas, pepper spray, and
rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks from the bench, Feess took his criticisms of city
plans even further, calling the 40-day application period for
parade and other permits excessive. So far, a handful of parade
permits have been issued. Don White, coordinator of logistics and
permits for the umbrella protest group known as D2KLA, said he
expected as many as 14 parades to be held during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge said, quite clearly, that the 1st Amendment takes
precedence over convenience or the image of the convention or
whether or not delegates have to walk a few more blocks to get
therem'' White said. ``We cannot be constrained by what police
might conjure up as a possible scenario of what might happen. We're
going to be peaceful, and we're going to be right there.''

WORLD WAR II DESIGN APPROVED BY ARTS PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The final design for a national World War II
memorial was unanimously approved Thursday by the federal
Commission of Fine Arts, despite outcries against the proposed site
on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The 7.5-acre site, at the end of the Reflecting Pool between the
Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument, came under fire from
critics who said the memorial would obstruct the view between the
two national symbols and ruin the original spacious layout that
symbolizes the country's philosophy of openness and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obstructing a great American vista meant to clear the mind and
evoke our oldest traditions tramples on our heritage, casts doubt
on our understanding of the link between the past and the future,
and makes a mockery of our guardianship of the nation's priceless
treasures,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's
nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was one of the last hurdles for the memorial,
which was approved by Congress in 1993 but has gone through several
designs and possible locations. A final OK is still needed from the
National Capital Planning Commission in September.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading supporters of the memorial, former senator
Robert J. Dole of Kansas, told the commission that the structure is
more than a tribute to the veterans who now because of age are
dying at a rate of about 1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reminder that someday, sometime in your life, your
child's life, your grandchild's life, they may be called upon to
make a sacrifice for their country, and that's what it's all
about,'' said the 1996 Republican presidential candidate who is
finance chairman for the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who was wounded in World War II, has raised more than $90
million from veterans groups, corporations and private citizens in
the past year for the $100 million project. Tom Hanks, star of the
war movie ``Saving Private Ryan,'' is campaigning to help fund the
memorial, while employees of Wal-Mart donated $14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, designed by Friedrich St. Florian of Rhode Island,
would feature a lowered plaza surrounding the Rainbow Pool, 56
pillars (one for each state and territory) and two 41-foot arches
(for the Atlantic and Pacific military theaters). A Freedom Wall
features 4,000 gold stars _ one for every 100 Americans killed in
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking is scheduled for Veterans Day, Nov. 11, and
construction could be completed for dedication ceremonies on
Memorial Day 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``When finished, the memorial will be a place for commemoration
and the celebration of the American spirit and national unity,''
said F. Haydn Williams, a member of the American Battle Monuments
Commission, which selected the site after the fine arts commission
rejected several other locations.
</P>
<P>
   Eden Rafshoon, one of the commissioners, said the current spot
was chosen because ``any lesser site would diminish the
significance of World War II on our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But veterans are divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want a part of my legacy to be part of the defacing
of the Mall,'' said Charles Cassell, who has been speaking out
against the location.
</P>
<P>
   Holden Jack, who was an infantryman in the war, said he wants to
be able to touch the memorial. ``It's an addition to this mall in
recognition of a generation that saved the world,'' he said.

 &HT;    Dell promises greater profits to come
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Michael Dell isn't bashful about getting
involved in Washington politics when technology policies are
concerned, but he prefers the role of confidant, not candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, an adviser to and fundraiser for Republican presidential
hopeful George W. Bush, said Thursday that he wouldn't trade the
chief executive's office for a cabinet seat.
</P>
<P>
   When Dell was asked the question by a shareholder at the
company's annual meeting, he deferred to his wife, Susan, who
shouted a decisive ``no'' from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Dell shareholders wondered about the company's
stock price, which has been locked stubbornly in the $40 to $50
range since splitting in March 1999, most praised the company and
its namesake chief executive. The stock was up $1.44 Thursday,
closing at $52.81 per share.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, Dell didn't have a stock split
to announce to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But he had plenty to say, noting that the company's $136.6
billion market capitalization _ the total value of its shares
outstanding _ was greater than that of rivals Compaq Computer
Corp., Gateway Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. combined.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell didn't dwell long on past success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just getting started,'' Dell told shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded to lay out a vision in which Dell would ride the
Internet to greater revenue and profits in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The company is banking heavily on higher-profit servers and
storage products, which are at the heart of corporate computer
networks as well as Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Dell plans to capture a large part of the spending on products
that make up the Internet infrastructure _ a market it expects to
grow 200 percent annually to about $370 billion in just three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also plans to use its reputation as an e-commerce
heavyweight to sell expertise in various new services, such as
Web-site hosting and consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell.com is one of largest, if not the largest, online
business in the world, doing $40 to $50 million a day in sales,''
Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell _ whose unofficial mantra for nearly a decade has been
liquidity, profitability and growth _ said with pride that ``unlike
Amazon, our online business is profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's comments Thursday didn't provide the same warm, fuzzy
feeling as a stock split, but sufficed for many shareholders, such
as Lee Weislow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, this thing was like a party, the stock was
splitting,'' she said. ``For a while, I felt maybe I should sell
the stock. But I'm glad I didn't. It's still a stock you need to
own _ like GE.''
</P>
<P>
   Two shareholders asked Dell about its purchase last year of
ConvergeNet, a small data-storage technology company, for $340
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray,
previously had questioned whether the deal would yield any useful
products. Others have since echoed his claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made too big a jump,'' John McArthur, a storage analyst
for research firm International Data Corp., said this week. ``I
don't know anybody who was positive on the ConvergeNet acquisition.
You didn't have to talk to too many people before you ran into some
ex-ConvergeNet folks who said: 'That's nice, but (the technology)
doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had one of the new products on display outside the
meeting hall and said it will begin shipping test versions to some
customers in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe everything you read because it's not necessarily
accurate,'' Dell said. ``You're going to see from Dell over the
next few quarters an array of products from this team.''
</P>
<P>
   And Vice Chairman Jim Vanderslice defended the technology,
saying it works and will offer significant cost and performance
advantages to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be the first time someone has written something
about us that's negative, and it wouldn't be the first time it was
wrong,'' Dell said. ``I don't think this game is over at all.''

SEGA SAYS WEB SITES, AUCTIONS SHUT DOWN TO HALT PIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music and movies aren't the only things being pirated and
distributed over the Internet these days.
</P>
<P>
   Video games are also big targets.
</P>
<P>
   Sega of America Thursday said it has shut down 60 Web sites and
125 auctions trafficking in pirated video games played on Sega's
Dreamcast console.
</P>
<P>
   Software pirating has existed for as long as software has been
around. What's new is the unprecendented ease brought by the
Internet for pirating and distributing software, leading to a crop
of new applications such as Napster for copying and sharing music,
and DivX, which can be used to duplicate movies.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming industry estimates that over $3 billion is lost every
year from piracy, a huge sum considering the industry itself pulled
in just $6.9 billion in 1999 from sales of both consoles and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Console makers earn a majority of their cash from licensing
software,'' said Michael Goodman, a senior analyst with the Yankee
Group. ``So piracy is literally a direct attack on their revenue
stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega, which is based in Japan and has operations in San
Francisco, is teaming up with other console makers and software
publishers to fight back. Their arsenal was considerably beefed up
when Congress this year passed the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, which allowed copyright holders to go after Web sites and
Internet service providers that host sales of pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest broadside, Sega last week began issuing cease and
desist orders to five auction sites, including those hosted by
Yahoo!, eBay, Lycos, Excite and Amazon.com, according to Charles
Bellfield, Sega's spokesman. In addition, the company asked
Internet service providers to shut down Web sites that sell pirated
games, as well as companies hosting virtual hard drives that are
used by their customers for storing pirated games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies that do not comply will face both civil and
criminal prosecution by both federal and state authorities with
whom we are working with,'' said Bellfield.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, all the companies Sega has approached have cooperated,
according to Bellfield. Sega continues to issue cease and desist
orders daily, he said. The company, which said it loses millions of
dollars a year to piracy, is working with European officials and
negotiating with Asian law enforcement on its crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Sega teamed up with game-maker Nintendo and
Electronic Arts, a large game publisher, to file a lawsuit against
Yahoo! to prevent pirated games from being sold on Yahoo's Web
site. The case, filed in U.S. District Court in California, is
still pending.
</P>
<P>
   But game industry analysts question how successful companies
will be in stamping out illicit copying of digital products via
Napster, DivX or a simple $200 compact disk ``burner'' that can
duplicate CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a bigger picture of piracy,'' said P.J.
McNealy, analyst with the Gartner Group. ``As more things become
digital, they will become more portable and easier to exchange,
particularly over the Internet. Instances like this will continue
to crop up more often.''

   ATLANTA _ ING Group NV's $7.7 billion acquisition of Aetna
Inc.'s financial service and international units may turn into more
business for the Dutch firm's American headquarters in the Atlanta
area, an ING executive said.
</P>
<P>
   The 600-employee operations can expect some growth as ING
doubles its U.S. business and triples its Latin American business
through the deal announced Thursday, said Keith Gubbay, executive
vice president for ING Americas.
</P>
<P>
   But like other units, ING's local corporate and investment
management offices could also feel some pressure as ING seeks to
squeeze $200 million in reduced expenses or additional revenues
from the combined entities in five years, Gubbay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect a lot of that will come from the revenue side,''
said Gubbay, adding that the acquisition will combine companies
with few overlapping businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some expense consolidation,'' he said, ``but I
think it will be measured.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated ING-Aetna deal along with ING's acquisition
of ReliaStar three months ago puts the finishing touch to its
recent goal to rank among the 10-largest insurance firms in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ING said it will pay $5 billion in cash, mostly from company
funds, and assume $2.7 billion in debt to acquire Aetna's financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   The company will grow to 50 million customers from about 30
million now. Such growth and scale of operations is ``absolutely
essential to maintain the lead in today's financial services
markets,'' said ING Chairman Ewald Kist.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Aetna's international businesses will transform
ING into the top international insurance company in Latin America,
with more than 13 million customers, and the second-largest in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ING said it will combine part of the Aetna Financial Services
and Aetna International units into its ING Americas headquarters in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta office employs about 100 people each in its
investment management and corporate staffs in Atlanta, and about
400 in its life insurance unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta office has ``a very small regional staff responsible
for Latin America,'' said Gubbay.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM BUYOUT OF ANY U.S. COMPANY FACES HARD SCRUTINY,
FCC WARNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission said Thursday that because Deutsche Telekom is
controlled by the German government, any offers it makes to buy an
American telephone company would face heavy regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In response to concerns raised by many Democratic and Republican
lawmakers, William Kennard, the FCC chairman, said that a merger
involving foreign government-controlled providers like Deutsche
Telekom raised important national security and competition
questions that would require close examination.
</P>
<P>
   For months, senior executives of Deutsche Telekom have been
exploring the possibility of a major expansion into the United
States. The company has made an offer to acquire the VoiceStream
Wireless Corp. for about $53 billion in cash and stock. Deutsche
Telekom has also made an unsuccessful run at acquiring Qwest
Communications International of Denver, and there has been
speculation that it could try to make another bid for the company
or others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, as you do, that the Commission's approach must
promote competition and maintain a secure telecommunication system
for our national security,'' Kennard wrote in a letter larded with
carefully-worded caveats.
</P>
<P>
   The letter replied to earlier correspondences sent by 30
Democratic and Republican lawmakers led by Sen. Ernest Hollings of
South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce
Committee. The lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., and his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, have moved to adopt legislation curtailing any deal.
They have raised objections because Deutsche Telekom is 57 percent
owned by the German government.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollings' urging, the lawmakers attached a provision to a
Senate appropriations bill this week that would have the effect of
prohibiting the FCC from approving any American license transfers
to Deutsche Telekom for a year. The measure is now pending on the
floor of the Senate. Hollings has also introduced separate
legislation that has gained the support of many top Democrats and
Republicans that would permanently bar a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But other senators, including John McCain, the Arizona
Republican who heads the Commerce Committee, have raised concerns
that efforts by the government to block a deal could lead to
retaliation against American companies doing business abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it would be easy to envision new foreign restrictions
on U.S. programming, satellite launches and the like, foreign
governments' retaliation would not necessarily be confined to the
telecom sector,'' McCain said in a letter to colleagues this week.
``Any foreign market in which American companies are vigorous
participants could be fair game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's letter does not suggest that he is predisposed to
outright rejection of such a deal. But it portends the prospect of
a lengthy regulatory battle should Deutsche Telekom complete an
acquisition of an American company.
</P>
<P>
   Because regulators might need more than a year to examine any
proposed deals, the outcome of a review is impossible to predict,
since it is not even clear who would have the final say. Kennard's
term is set to end next July and the next president might appoint a
new chairman even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any deal would be scrutinized by the office of the
U.S. trade representative, which would have to weigh whether trade
agreements might be violated by any attempt by the U.S. government
to block the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to allay growing concerns in Congress, Deutsche
Telekom has recently attempted to recruit some leading lobbyists
here, but has not been entirely successful. Several lobbyists said
they had turned the company down, in part because they represent
American telephone companies with competing interests. Among the
lobbying firms who recently spurned the German company is Quinn
Gillespie &AMP; Associates. Jack Quinn, the former White House counsel
who heads the firm, said last week that it was recently approached
but turned down Deutsche Telekom because it already does work for
two large regional telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings said in a recent interview that he is not opposed to
foreign investment in the United States, and in fact, has worked
hard to get foreign companies to open manufacturing plants in South
Carolina. But he said that at a time when the U.S. government is
moving to deregulate the telecommunications industry and foster
competition, it would be both inappropriate and unfair for American
companies to have to compete against a foreign government able to
subsidize the operations of its telecommunications business.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings has also taken his case beyond the FCC. He said that
last week he personally pressed John Podesta, the White House chief
of staff, to take steps to block any deal involving a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would study it,'' Hollings said. The White House
has not taken a position on the matter.

&HT;     GORE INVADES BUSH COUNTRY TO HIGHLIGHT HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT FLORES  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Flanked by San Antonio families he said epitomize
the problems with Texas' health care system, Vice President Al Gore
on Thursday attacked George W. Bush for his budgetary priorities,
saying the Texas governor placed more emphasis on tax cuts for the
rich than on medical needs of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Texas, faced with the largest surplus ever, Governor
Bush chose a different set of priorities,'' Gore, the Democratic
presidential hopeful, told a news conference. ``Instead of
addressing some serious problems involving families and children
who don't have health insurance, the governor made his top priority
_ the first bill he signed _ a large tax cut for special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the Lone Star State's record 1999 surplus of $6.4
billion, then said the state now faces a budget shortfall of up to
$750 million. He attributed the turnaround to Bush, whom he blamed
for putting too much emphasis on saving money to make room for a
$1.7 billion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's comments drew a sharp response from Bush's
presidential campaign, which accused Gore of blatantly distorting
Texas budget figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, taxes are low, the surplus is large, and spending on
education and health are up. The only shortfall to be found is in
Al Gore's credibility,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said, adding
that state Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander earlier in the day
released figures showing Texas with a $1.4 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander herself took exception to Gore's figures, saying: ``The
only partisan politics that is being played is being played by Al
Gore. When he starts questioning our financial credibility in the
state of Texas, I am going to continue to set the record
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democrats have been particularly critical of Bush because
of a projection of more than $600 million in cost overruns in
Medicaid and prison expenses. Gore's San Antonio visit was hastily
added to the vice president's campaign itinerary after news of the
overruns starting appearing in newspaper headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's staff finalized his appearance at about 5 a.m. Thursday,
said Maria Meyer, a campaign official in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee,
maintains a double-digit lead over Gore in Texas, the two are in a
statistical dead heat in some national polls.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the theme of his 30-minute speech, Gore pointed to
recent statistics that rank Texas second in the nation for number
of children living in poverty. He also said 1.4 million of the
nation's 11 million uninsured children reside in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing his remarks, Gore began a discussion with local
residents, including health care providers and mothers of uninsured
children who highlighted problems in obtaining adequate medical
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore charged that Bush fought efforts to expand health care
coverage to 220,000 low-income Texas children in the last
legislative session, and said 600,000 other children eligible for
Medicaid have not been enrolled because of cumbersome
administrative procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also noted the state could lose $449 million in federal
funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) because
it did not begin enrolling children in the program until May.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really wanted to address that problem, one way to do it
would have been to take that large surplus last year and address
the problem,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jeff Wentworth, a San Antonio Republican who stood
outside the Seven Oaks Conference Center and handed out handbills
denying Gore's remarks, reminded reporters that the last state
budget passed overwhelmingly by a Democrat-controlled state House.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we ignored everything else to give tax cuts is
ludicrous,'' Wentworth said.

</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Gore made an unexpected visit to the
Northeast YMCA Children's Greenhouse, where toddlers and
pre-schoolers were eating tacos.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made himself at home, sitting down with the children and
firing off questions: What were they having for lunch? Who was
going swimming that afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Peyton Pyle wiggled his way to the front. Richard
Rodriguez, 4, who was wearing what appeared to be a Tyrannosaurus
Rex on his red T-shirt, corrected the vice president at one point.
``It's not a dinosaur. It's a crocodile,'' Richard informed him.
</P>
<P>
   During the 20-minute visit, Gore also performed, balancing a
broom on his nose and forehead. The children also had a chance to
question the vice president.

TRADE GROUPS SUE SCOUR.COM FOR AIDING `THEFT' OF MUSIC, MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using strong rhetoric reminiscent of a public advocacy campaign,
trade groups representing the major movie studios and record labels
filed a copyright infringement lawsuit Thursday against Scour.com,
an Internet company that offers a file-swapping service similar to
the controversial Napster program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a simple case of theft,'' said Jack Valenti, president
of the Motion Picture Association of America, which along with the
Recording Industry Association of America is suing Scour.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the case as a moral crusade involving ``what is right
and what is wrong,'' Valenti added, ``We need to reinstate... the
once assumed social contract that says, `Stealing is wrong.' You
don't raise your children to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, filed in a Manhattan federal court, is the latest of
several suits initiated by the recording industry against Internet
companies including Napster and MP3.com. But it marks the first
time the movie trade group has joined forces with the music
business. Like the Napster case, the new suit alleges that Scour is
responsible for mass distribution and duplication of copyrighted
materials including music and videos.
</P>
<P>
   Scour.com, backed by Hollywood mogul and former top Disney
executive Michael Ovitz, offers an online search engine for music
and video files; like Napster, its Scour Exchange program enables
users to locate and download bootleg movie files as well as music
files.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Top Five Video Searches'' on the site Thursday included
the recently released summer blockbusters ``X-Men,'' ``Gladiator''
and ``Mission Impossible II.'' Unlike music files, however, movie
files can take hours to download, the system is hard to use, and
their quality is grossly inferior to seeing a movie at a theater or
on a legal videotape.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Thursday, the Beverly Hills-based Scour
claimed it was surprised by the lawsuit. Scour said it is
negotiating licensing rights with entertainment giants Sony, Warner
and BMG, and has license agreements with Miramax and Hollywood
Records; all of those companies are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scour has always positioned itself as a cooperative,
responsible and legally compliant partner within the entertainment
community, and is working hand-in-hand with record labels, film
studios and other entertainment companies to deliver licensed
entertainment content to the Scour consumer,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, the former Hollywood superagent, is known as a tough
negotiator who got his clients lucrative deals from the movie
studios. He had no comment about the suit. ``We don't comment on
litigation filed against third parties,'' said Mike Burns, a
spokesperson for Ovitz' firm, CKE Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the entertainment industry painted the case as a
battle to change public perception about the legality of
downloading free music and movies.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Pew Internet Project found that 13 million
people, or 14 percent of all Internet users, have downloaded free
music files from the Internet and that only 2 percent of online
users, fewer than 2 million people, have paid to download music.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like Napster and Scour Exchange create ``the impression
to users around the world that creative property has no value,''
said Carey Sherman, the RIAA's executive vice president and chief
counsel. The suit asks for damages of up to $150,000 per song or
movie downloaded from the Scour system.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to change the public perception is a deliberate
strategy on the part of the plaintiffs, but it is not likely to
work, said William Fisher, a Harvard Law School professor who
specializes in intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are correct that once these technologies take hold it is
going to be hard to get the next generation of consumers to pay for
this stuff,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The most relevant case is the 1984 decision in the Sony Betamax
case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that VCR manufacturers do
not violate copyright law when consumers record programs for home
viewing. By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, home
recording was a common practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher added that the heated rhetoric used in the case can be
misleading, since intellectual property is limited by duration and
by the fair use doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those things are obscured by this rhetoric of
shoplifting, stealing and theft, and the insistence that
intellectual property is no different than any other form of
property,'' Fisher said. ``They are hoping that intellectual
property rights will be perceived as real property rights, but I
think they will probably fail in that aspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recording industry has prevailed in the courts in its
case against MP3.com, which settled financially with some of the
companies that sued it. Its case against Napster continues next
week at a hearing set for Wednesday.

EARNINGS AT WARNACO, MAKER OF CALVIN KLEIN JEANS, PLUMMET AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time it appears that the Warnaco Group, the maker of
Calvin Klein jeans and underwear, has hit bottom, another shoe
drops.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Thursday that it would miss earnings
estimates by a wide margin, the third time it has done so this
year. Warnaco said operating earnings for fiscal 2000 will be 26
cents to 36 cents a share, almost $1.50 less than the average
estimate among analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
Last year, the company earned $1.90 a share. The company said there
would be a ``commensurate'' but unspecified reduction in
second-quarter net income to be announced in August.
</P>
<P>
   Distressed investors sent Warnaco's stock down $1.8125 a share
to an all-time low of $4.9375. It is now down nearly 60 percent
this year, and off 89 percent from its high of $44 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said that Warnaco's management team had already
lost its credibility on Wall Street and that they were not
surprised that the company's results were so far off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are analyzing the company as a distressed stock,'' said
Mathew Hershberg, who follows the company for S&AMP;P Equity Group,
adding that the manufacturer is in increasingly dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   The news put more pressure on Warnaco's already embattled chief
executive, Linda Wachner. When Warnaco announced a disappointing
quarter in May, Leon Cooperman, who owns almost 7 percent of
Warnaco privately and through his money management firm Omega
Advisors, sent a scathing letter to Warnaco's board of directors
blaming Wachner for the company's problems. So far, Wachner's board
has remained steadfastly loyal, but investor frustration, as
demonstrated by the plunging stock, is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Wachner cited a ``difficult business environment
affecting the apparel industry in general'' to explain the
company's shortfalls and asserted that Warnaco has ``more than
adequate cash flow to support our businesses.'' She was unavailable
for futher comment.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco blamed part of its financial woes on ``negative
publicity'' surrounding a legal battle with its largest licensor,
Calvin Klein. In May, Calvin Klein Inc. sued to break its licensing
agreement with Warnaco on the grounds that the manufacturer had
tarnished the designer's trademark by producing substandard
merchandise and was distributing it through unauthorized stores
like warehouse clubs. Warnaco has countersued Klein and his
company, citing defamation and breach of good faith, and is asking
for $1 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   A Warnaco spokesman said that the company now anticipated a $120
million decline in revenue this year related to the Calvin Klein
publicity problems.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the earnings warning, Warnaco said Thursday that it
had refinanced debt that was coming due later this summer. The
agreements with Warnaco's creditors will extend the maturity dates
of its $500 million trade credit and $600 million bridge loan until
August 2002. The company would not disclose the terms of the
financing. But the Warnaco spokesman said that the additional
interest costs for this year alone would be $30 million, accounting
for much of the estimated earnings decline.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced it would take a $60 million after-tax
charge in connection with closing its distribution centers in
Europe and reducing its worldwide work force by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many questions about the strength of Warnaco's core
business remain unanswered, at least until the company reports its
full second-quarter results on Aug. 4. It cited softening consumer
appetite for its sportswear as part of the reason for its earnings
drop, but it was unclear which of its many brands were weak.
</P>
<P>
   Wachner had said previously that she was counting on the Speedo
and ABS by Allen Schwartz brands to provide the company with
dynamic top-line growth, and numbers for those businesses were not
made available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock plunging, Warnaco may come under increasing
pressure to take the company private or to strike a deal with one
of its many suitors, most notably the VF Corp., the maker of Lee,
which is particularly interested in adding an upscale jeans brand
like Calvin Klein.

   ALADUMP _ LOWNDESBORO, ALA. _ The historic Selma-to-Montgomery
voting rights trail, U.S. Highway 80, runs through rural Lowndes
County, meandering past tracts of dusty farmland, boarded-up gas
stations and sacred civil rights-era ground. A racially mixed group
of developers and county officials, including some who hold office
thanks to the voting rights crusade, feel the 670-acre landfill is
just the thing to jump-start the economy of one of the state's
poorest counties. But landfill opponents, also a mix of blacks and
whites, say a dump near U.S. 80 would be an affront to the memory
of the marchers and hurt both the environment and a fledgling
tourist industry. Last week, the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management granted a permit for a landfill. We take a

   SHUTTERS _ CHARLESTON, S.C. - As he strolls amid the history of
this city where his family has lived for more than three centuries,
Pinckney Seabrook Wilkinson is alarmed by the declining population.
Not of people, but of shutters. ``You see how silly the house looks
without them,'' said the College of Charleston English instructor
and self-appointed guardian of the historic district's exterior
window dressings. Though few, if any, are so fretful, Wilkinson
said the shutters are disappearing as well-heeled out of towners
snap up historic houses and, during renovation, are not aware, or
do not care, about zoning rules that require shutters to be
replaced. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   BRUNSWICK _ BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ When Kendra McCrae stormed into the
Brunswick city manager's office recently and demanded an audience,
it was another sign of the continuing unrest in the coastal city
that has spawned violence, marches and calls for change. McCrae, a
28-year-old secretary, was upset over mistreatment she says she and
other blacks received at the hands of police during a July 4th
altercation. That holiday weekend confrontation, which eventually
turned violent, led to a subsequent protest march on Monday (July
17) with others planned. It has also revealed a wider set of
grievances. A loose coalition of residents and ministers is now
calling for sensitivity training for police, a community-wide forum
to discuss racial differences and better economic opportunities for
the city's black population. We examine the continuing evolution of
a city in transition. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Internet. The system seems simple and settled, but a global battle
is being waged this summer over how addresses will be assigned to
keep pace with rapid Internet growth. The

   stakes are enormous. If plans to establish private control over
the Internet's address system founders on technical details and

   VOTERS-SUBURBMOMS _ DATELINE TK _ Four years ago, ``soccer
moms'' gained almost mythical stature as the coveted voting bloc
that would reelect President Clinton or give Republican Bob Dole a
fighting chance. In a close presidential race in 2000 between Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the women's vote is all-important, but
</P>
<P>
   more difficult to define and to attract. So far, polls are
showing that more men are strong supporters of their choice, where
women tend to be more flexible _undecideds or soft supporters of
Gore or Bush. In addition to the gender gap, there is a
particularly large ``marriage'' gap. Clinton led Dole among married
women 53% to 43% in 1996; Gore trails Bush 42 percent to 50
percent. (Holmes, Cox News Service)

   SYDNEY _Sydney _ In going from Georgia to Australia, then, the
Olympics have gone from one British penal experiment to another.
This odd kinship of outcasts dawned on me as I was sitting at a
cafe beside Sydney Cove, the aquamarine inlet that sets off the
heart of the city like a jade pendant. Ferry boats were churning
through the whitecaps of crisscrossing wakes. On one side of the
cove, the Opera House roof loomed like the upturned prows of a
dozen giant rowboats. On the other side, blue Australian flags
streamed in the breeze atop the long steel arch of the Harbour
Bridge. It's hard to imagine now, but this postcard spot was where
the First Fleet landed in 1788 with a thousand convicts and
sailors. Ten thousand miles from home, they struggled and almost
starved yet somehow managed to transform their bitter exile into a
city and nation that will soon command the world's attention.

   FAT-SOUTHERNERS _We know that America overall has a weight
problem - by some measures, 50 percent of the population is at
least somewhat overweight. But what's the Southern piece of that
pie? According to a new AJC poll, Southerners are more likely than
people elsewhere in the US to admit to being ``moderately or
seriously'' overweight - even though they set the bar for what
constitutes ``overweight'' higher than residents of other states
do, and given even more latitude to men than they do to women. At
the same time, though, Southerners are more willing to blame their
own bad habits for their weight problems. Includes interviews with

GERMANY'S BERTELSMANN BUYS CDNOW FOR $117 MILLION TO EXPAND

<P>
   Bertelsmann AG, the German media conglomerate, will buy CDNow
Inc., the struggling online music retailer, for $117 million in
cash, Bertelsmann said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, worth $3 for each CDNow share, will give Bertelsmann a
recognized brand in online music sales as it attempts to expand its
electronic commerce business. For CDNow, the merger ends the
company's extensive search for a partner, which intensified in
March after a merger deal with Columbia House fell through.

<P>
   CDNow, which went public in February 1998 at $16 a share, has
stumbled in the face of increasing competition, losing $119 million
last year. Its stock, which reached a high of $35.50 a share in
April 1998, closed at $2.875 a share Wednesday, the day before the
merger was announced. The stock closed at $2.92 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a savior for CDNow,'' said Aram Sinnreich, an analyst
with Jupiter Communications in New York. ``It was clear it was in
dire straits and couldn't continue doing business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDNow service, which allows visitors to download music as
well as purchase tracks and CDs, was founded by twin brothers Jason
and Matthew Olim in 1994 and was an instant hit among music fans
and technology aficionados. But the site quickly lost market share
when Amazon and national music chains began selling CDs online.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its struggles, however, CDNow has managed to amass the
single largest database of qualified online music buyers, Sinnreich
said. For that reason, the acquisition instantly puts Bertelsmann,
which is based in Gutersloh, Germany, at the top of the online
music business. ``It gives them exactly what they haven't been able
to get through their own music properties, a large database of
customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Eierhoff, a Bertelsmann board member, called the merger an
``excellent fit'' with both the company's online and traditional
music assets, not only because of CDNow's music content but because
of its strength in new digital downloading technologies.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow, whose headquarters are in Fort Washington, Pa., will
continue its current operations after the merger, the companies
said, becoming Bertelsmann's primary online music sales effort
under the leadership of Andreas Schmidt, former chief executive of
AOL Europe and current president and CEO of Bertelsmann's new
e-Commerce Group. GetMusic, an online music service that is the
result of a venture between Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment and
Universal Music Group, will be featured on the CDNow Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Schmidt said that, among other things,
the acquisition of CDNow gives Bertelsmann a huge boost in the
emerging market for electronic music distribution, a hotly
contested subject that has pitted musicians and record companies
against Internet companies developing distribution technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to turn CDNow into a music commerce play and expand it
internationally, while we expand the brand onto other platforms,
like mobile and broadband,'' Schmidt said. ``Clearly, all music
content will be in digital form from here on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's acquisition of CDNow is the latest in a recent
series of deals, which include an alliance with America Online to
distribute Bertelsmann's brands over AOL, and a separate
distribution deal with Terra Lycos.

PEOPLE WITH GENETIC RISKS OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY INFORMING
RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As genetic testing becomes increasingly common, people who
choose to learn their genetic risks, and the health professionals
who treat them, are facing difficult decisions about how _ and
whether _ to share the results with family members who share their
genes.
</P>
<P>
   And the new genetic information is creating new kinds of rifts,
when one family member finds out what another family member does
not want to know, or when family members react differently to the
same knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman who'd had ovarian cancer was tested for the breast
cancer gene mutations mostly for the sake of her two adult
daughters,'' said Katherine Schneider, senior genetics counselor at
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ``But when she told
them she had it, they were so devastated that they didn't talk with
her for two years. They didn't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell that story a lot. There's nothing easy about any of
this. But before testing, it's important to talk not only about
what the information will mean for you, but what it might mean to
your sisters, your children, your cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests are now commonplace, what with prenatal tests
diagnosing hundreds of different syndromes, midlife tests for
mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer, and _ with the human
genome newly mapped _ more and more familial disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific advances have created intense debate about public
policy on genetic discrimination. But the private effects on family
dynamics are just as complex, as patients and health professionals
adjust to thinking about family not just as flesh and blood, but
flesh and blood and genes.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, patients are happy to share health information with
family members for whom it may be important, often asking the
doctor or genetic counselor for a written explanation to pass
along.
</P>
<P>
   But when patients want to keep the information to themselves,
health professionals may encounter situations that mix social
problem and soap opera, and be ethically and legally pulled into
uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A young man in Washington state called his genetics counselor to
confess a guilty conscience: Several months earlier, he told her,
he had made a sperm donation. And while he knew his test results
had shown that he had an inheritable syndrome that causes heart
trouble and, often, early death, he did not mention it to the sperm
bank. Troubled, the counselor called the sperm bank and found that
there had, indeed, been successful pregnancies with the man's
sperm. She offered to counsel those families but does not know
whether the sperm bank even passed on the information.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York family with three adult daughters, the two married
daughters know that their mother, who had breast cancer as a young
woman, has been tested and found to carry a gene mutation
associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The
mother has forbidden them to tell their unmarried sister, who has
always felt herself to be the least attractive, for fear that it
might make her less marriageable. They have obeyed, but want the
doctor urge their sister get frequent mammograms and screening.
</P>
<P>
   Two sisters who know their mother had genetic testing before she
died of ovarian cancer want to find out her test results. But the
Pennsylvania medical center that did the testing will not release
the results to the young women without the consent of their
stepfather, who has a dismal relationship with her daughters. The
center's ethics committee is now revising its consent forms to
require all patients tested to specify which family members should
have access to the results after their death.
</P>
<P>
   One California genetics counselor tells of her confusion when a
couple who had a child with cystic fibrosis came to discuss their
risks for future pregnancies, and in providing a family history,
the wife mentioned that her estranged half-sister had a baby who
died from a serious congenital defect. It was nothing genetic, she
assured the counselor. But the counselor knew otherwise: The sister
had been an earlier client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just rang a bell in my head,'' the counselor said. ``I
remembered the name, and I remembered telling her it was genetic,
and she should tell her relatives. I didn't know what to do. But I
didn't want to breach confidentiality for either one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she called the previous client on the pretext of a
routine records check. ``I played dumb, saying I just happened to
have her file on my desk,'' the counselor said, ``and I'd noticed
we'd talked about telling her family the results, and I was just
following up for the records, wondering if that conversation had
taken place, and she said, why, no, it hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I reminded her why it was important. And a few days later,
I had a call from the current client, who said the funniest thing
had happened, she'd had a call from her half-sister, and there was
a genetic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Often, the decision to pass on information is a delicate one,
depending not only on such factors as the relatives' closeness, age
and emotional health, but also the nature of the disease and the
severity of the risk. Where there is no treatment, or the risk is
small, the case for sharing painful knowledge becomes less
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Josephine Wagner Costalas, a genetic counselor at Fox
Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, has an unspoken worry whenever
she counsels a patient who has tested positive for the breast
cancer gene mutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst nightmare is the scenario where I might have a
patient who tests positive and doesn't tell her relatives,''
Costalas said, ``and a few years later her sister will discover she
has metastatic cancer, with a bad prognosis, and she'll find out
that there was this information showing she was at risk. And maybe
she'll sue me, saying I should have picked up the phone and told
her, `Your sister's positive, you should get tested.' This is all
so new, and there are no clear guidelines, so I worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Costalas does not pressure her patients to share their
results. ``If people aren't sure about sharing the information, I
ask them to think about what it would be like if the situation were
reversed,'' she said. ``Would they want to know? But I do believe
patients need to decide for themselves what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And when several family members come in together, there are
other issues. ``What if they have different results?'' Costalas
said. ``Who do you tell first? What if they have different
reactions?''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Shumsky, whom Costalas counseled recently, never had any
doubt about sharing her results. There has been a lot of cancer in
Shumsky's family: Her father had early-onset colon cancer, his
sister had early breast cancer, three of his other siblings had
colon cancer, and her grandfather had melanoma. Shumsky herself was
diagnosed with melanoma last year, on her 40th birthday, and the
breast cancer gene mutations she was being tested for are
associated with a higher risk of melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She listened intently as Costalas told her that the test was
negative, that there was no sign that the melanoma was genetic, but
that it might be worth pursuing further genetic testing for colon
cancer. Then Costalas asked about Shumsky's plans to share her
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister knows I'm here, and I'm going to tell her the
results as soon as I get home,'' Shumsky said. ``And I'm going to
tell her about the colon cancer. After walking around with a mole
for years, and then finding out it was melanoma, I want everyone in
my family to watch out for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got my diagnosis, I called her doctor myself, and told
him she needed melanoma screening. I know it's butting into her
life, but if she never talks to me again, and I save her life, it's
worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the American Society of Human Genetics, an
organization of doctors, counselors and others dealing with
genetics, adopted a position recognizing the conflict between the
health professions' duty to maintain confidentiality and the duty
to warn about serious health risks. Health professionals should
tell patients about potential genetic risks to their relatives, the
statement said, and in some cases, they may be allowed to breach
confidentiality to warn relatives at risk if the harm is ``serious,
imminent and likely'' and prevention or treatment is available.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little consensus on where to draw those lines.
Generally, genetic counselors are more concerned about
confidentiality and not pressuring patients, while physicians
specializing in genetics are more concerned about the duty to warn,
according to research by Dorothy C. Wertz, senior scientist at the
Shriver Center in Waltham, Mass. As a practical matter, though,
most health professionals cannot warn relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it's up to the patient, because in real life, we
don't have relatives' names and phone numbers,'' said Helen Hixon,
a genetic counselor in cardiology at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles. ``We do tell people pretty strongly that they should
warn their relatives, that they may have a legal duty to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers specializing in bioethics say that while patients may
have some moral obligation, they have no legal duty to warn
relatives. There have been at least two legal rulings, one in a
1995 Florida case and the other in a 1996 New Jersey case, giving
conflicting signals on whether doctors can be held liable for
failing to warn a patient's relatives about their risks of a
hereditary form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tensions involving family disclosure of genetic
risks are not new, the issue has become more complicated as genetic
tests proliferate, and it becomes possible to identify a person's
predisposition to common diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that most of these issues came up around rare
disorders, where there was a recessive gene that became a problem
only when it met up with another carrier,'' said Vivian Weinblatt,
president elect of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.
``With those, the risks are pretty clear, and you know who's
affected. Now we're talking about areas where it's all gray, where
it's a gene that predisposes you to some disease you might get
anyway in late middle age.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOws)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The breast cancer gene mutations are the latest case in point
and the fastest growing area of testing. While most cases of breast
and ovarian cancer are not hereditary, women with specific
mutations in the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes have a lifetime risk of
breast or ovarian cancer well over 50 percent, odds so high that
many women who test positive choose to have their breasts and
ovaries removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother died of breast cancer when I was 15, and my older
sister got it when she was 41,'' said a 43-year old New York woman
who recently had the preventive surgery, telling only three people
of her situation. ``I knew as soon as I tested positive that I
would do anything I could to get my odds down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's been awkward with my sister, who's against
prophylactic surgery. I think she's crazy, she thinks I'm crazy and
we don't talk about it anymore. Instead of it being a shared family
thing, it's made us less close.''
</P>
<P>
   In some families, particularly Ashkenazi Jewish families, which
are more likely to carry the mutations, the testing has become a
pressure point.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of our early research families, with a serious history
of cancer, there was a push from the family matriarch that anyone
found to have the mutation should get a mastectomy,' said Jill
Stopfer at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center. ``The push
was so strong that some of the younger women decided they wouldn't
get tested, not because they couldn't handle the results, but
because they were worried about the family pressure to have
surgery.''

BOEING ANGLING TO STAY IN SPOTLIGHT AT FARNBOROUGH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the world's aerospace industry gathers at the
Farnborough International air show outside of London next week,
much of the buzz will be about the Airbus A3XX super jumbo, which
could see its first firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing is planning a big show, too. And airline and
government customers won't be the only ones likely to find the
display compelling. Investors and the company's employees should
keep an eye on Farnborough.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing its hot pace of commercial airplane sales this year,
Boeing will announce several billion in orders _ including a flurry
of demand for its ne super long-range 777X jets, the 777-300X and
the 777-200X.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing could announce orders for as many as two dozen of the
jets, the sources said. Such an order would be worth $4 billion to
$5 billion, based on list prices.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't count a possible order from International Lease
Finance Corp. for more than a dozen 777s on which negotiations
continue.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the air show.
</P>
<P>
   Though both manufacturers deny it, Boeing and Airbus ask some of
their customers to save order announcements for either the Paris or
Farnborough air shows, which are held in alternating years. They
are the world's biggest air shows.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Paris Air Show, International Lease said it would
buy 50 next generation 737s and take options on 50 more. But it
took much of 1999 before the sales agreement was actually signed
for the first 50 planes.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Boeing is placing more importance this year
on the air show.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, this will be Boeing Chairman Phil Condit's first
appearance at either of the big European shows since 1992, shortly
after he was named Boeing's president.
</P>
<P>
   At past shows, Boeing and Airbus staged dueling media events on
the opening day. Top executives gave presentations and answered
questions.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Farnborough show will be different.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus will hold its big media event Monday, opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Condit will not follow with the Boeing briefing until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning Monday morning, Boeing will be conducting daily
informational briefings on products from the Super Hornet and Joint
Strike Fighter to the 747X stretch. The stretched version of the
747 could be launched within a year, depending on customer demand.
It would carry about 100 more passengers than the 416-seat 747-400.
</P>
<P>
   The company may be hoping to offset some of the attention likely
to be given to the probably star of the show, Airbus Industrie's
proposed new super-jumbo airplane, the A3XX. The huge jetliner is
seen as the first real challenge to Boeing's dominance of the jumbo
jet market with the 747.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing has not yet reached the stage where it is ready to
announce firm orders for its new jumbo jet _ a derivitive of the
747, Airbus may announce the first firm orders for the A3XX at
Farnborough.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus received permission just last month from its board to
begin offering the plane for sale. The first firm order for the
A3XX is expected to come from Emirates, which is one of several
airlines to publicly say they will buy the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   But even if there is no A3XX order announcement, the Europeans
are likely to capture a lot of attention because of a new aerospace
giant on the scene _ EADS, short for European Aeronautic Defense
and Space Co.
</P>
<P>
   EADS became the world's third largest aerospace entity behind
Boeing and Lockheed Martin earlier this month with the merger of
Germany's Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace (Dasa), France's Aerospatiale
Matra and Spain's Casa. Together, they own 80 percent of Airbus.
The UK's BAE Systems owns the remaining 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus itself is undergoing a dramatic transformation into a
single corporation to better compete against Boeing. Since its
creation in 1970, Airbus has operated an a consortium of European
aerospace companies. So EADS and a new Airbus will take center
stage on the opening day of the air show, against the backdrop of
the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will not have to wait for Condit's briefing Wednesday to
make its own noise at the show. The company has scheduled an event
for Tuesday, the second day, to ``honor'' customers for its 777X
jets.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced the launch of the two new versions of its
planes in February. They are targeted for Asian airlines looking
for 21st-century widebody jets that have the range to fly more than
300 passengers non-stop between Asia and the United States. The
301-seat 777-200X will be able to fly up to 10,100 miles before
refueling, and the 359-seat 777-300X will be able to fly up to
8,314 miles.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Boeing has only announced firm 777X orders from Japan
Airlines and from Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp. Sources said as many
as five or six more customers will be announced at Farnborough,
possibly as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the start of a very good week for Boeing. But one
that will exhaust its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing experience,'' Condit said in an interview last
week when asked about air shows. ``You get almost no sleep. You eat
way too much. And you end the week totally, completed exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he would like to see one air show held every four
years, just like the Olympics. Cities would bid for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would all go and it would be one heck of an event,'' Condit
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airshows were conceived when the technology rate was much
higher,'' he said. ``There were new programs every year. There were
always new things to see. That isn't the world we are in, either on
the defense side or the civil side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farnborough show will showcase the competition among
manurfacturers, all right. But, like most shows of the current age,
this one is less about competing new technologies than the
years-old race between Boeing and Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   And that's about market share.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: IT'S PARTY TIME AGAIN
 &HT;    Moving in the Washington (w) and political (p) categories for
release Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first time I attended a major national
political convention turns out also to be the last time the
delegates needed more then one ballot to decide on a nominee.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1956. The Democrats met at the Chicago stockyards,
tapping Adlai Stevenson of Illinois for a futile rematch against
President Dwight Eisenhower. As a copy boy for the old New York
Herald Tribune, I had a great seat as a final drama unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson decided to throw the vice-presidential nomination wide
open. In the ensuing free-for-all, Sen. Estes Kefauver of
Tennessee, Stevenson's bitter rival in 1952, beat an attractive new
political face, Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts, on the
second ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Says Reuven Frank, who produced NBC's pioneering gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the 1956 conventions: ``There are few who can still
recall _ and it is hard for the rest to recognize _ how important
and even exciting the conventions of (those) national political
parties were.''
</P>
<P>
   In their wake have come tightly scripted extravaganzas offering
what Frank calls ``ineffective windbaggery.'' But if these
gatherings have as died as news stories, the press stubbornly
refuses to bury them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the era of Huntley and Brinkley, whom Frank put together
in the NBC skybooth, wraparound convention coverage has been
relegated to the all-news cable channels. To bear witness as the
Republicans perform next week in Philadelphia, CNN alone plans to
send more than 500 people, including a slew of interns and Internet
mavens. Two weeks later, the parallel show opens among the
Democrats in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for such political theater has thinned appreciably
since 1956, when Frank first sought to mine news out the
proceedings by sending four reporters with portable mikes onto the
convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's also being split among a half-dozen cable news outlets.
Coverage plans by the likes of CNN, Fox, MSNBC, PBS and C-SPAN
include perpetual Webcasts. They'll be competing for scarce
eyeballs with their over-the-air siblings and with a dozen or so
online-only outfits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the convention handlers, who have alienated the
networks by depriving them of anything that even remotely smacks of
political warfare, will get into the news game themselves by
producing their own Webcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The old-line networks will make an appearance in both Philly and
L.A., if only a ghostly one.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the NBC peacock, which intends to skip the first two
nights, the Big Eye of ABC and ABC's Alphabet Soup are mounting
token efforts at coverage in the run-up to the sole ``must carry''
event: the major candidates' acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, CBS finds noteworthy the remarks of retired Gen.
Colin Powell. ABC will dispatch Peter Jennings to cover the Monday
sessions of both conventions. On reflection, it scrapped plans to
use the halftime slots at preseason NFL football games and pushed
up their kickoff times by two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive is also in: MSNBC will solicit questions for its
online audience from Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the rear, we in what the TV folks dub ``the pencil
press'' are coming in force as well. A good many will report on the
doings of media celebrities.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb, one of Lance Armstrong's main sponsors,
has picked up the tab for nine cancer survivors to take in the
final five stages of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers created the chemotherapy drugs that successfully
treated Armstrong's advanced testicular cancer four years ago. The
company's relationship with Armstrong also has evolved during the
past year into the company's sponsorship of the U.S. Postal Service
team.
</P>
<P>
   John Kouten, a Bristol-Myers spokesman, said the company
received numerous VIP passes for the Tour as part of its
sponsorship of the Postal team. Rather than giving the passes to
corporate executives, the company within the past eight weeks
selected nine people who have some connection to Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong will sign the Charter of Paris Against Cancer Sunday
night after his now expected Tour victory. The charter was started
at the World Summitt Against Cancer in Paris on Feb. 4. Armstrong's
signature will be among more than 100 other international leaders
and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody can sign the document, which calls for expanded
commitment to cancer, by logging onto www.CharterAgainstCancer.org.
</P>
<P>
   TOO MANY PEOPLE
</P>
<P>
   Local police estimated that up to 1.5 million people watched
Thursday's stage between Lausanne, Switzerland and Freiburg,
Germany. That would make the crowd the largest to watch a
non-mountain stage since the Tour visited Valkenbourg, Holland in
1992. In fact, the mayor of Valkenbourg was in Freiburg on Thursday
trying to talk Tour officials into bringing another stage back to
his city.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour typically draws about 11 million spectators each year.
Another 2 million fans in France watch the Tour coverage each day
on television. The coverage is not interrupted by commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular Tour stages are the ones in the mountains,
where people camp out days in advance to get a good viewing spot.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVELOGUE
</P>
<P>
   The Freiburg Cathedral is probably the most prominent landmark
in this 1,000-year-old town that once was part of France and
Austria. The cathedral is more than 700 years old, with its tower
going up almost 400 feet. It is called locally the ``Unser Liben
Frowen Bauw,'' which in German means ``Building of the Blessed
Virgin.'' It was one of the few churches of its kind built in the
Middle Ages. One historian described it as the most beautiful
cathedral of its kind in all Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral survived the intense bombing Freiburg received in
World War I. The city also was the site of accidental bombing by
German troops in 1940, in which 57 locals were killed.

 &HT;    Delta's record volume yields $1 billion profit
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Packed planes offset higher fuel costs to lift Delta
Air Lines' fourth-quarter profit 3 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier also finished its fiscal year, which
ended June 30, with a third consecutive annual profit of about $1
billion. It boarded a record 117 million passengers for the year,
more than any other airline in the world, although it remains
third-biggest as measured by revenue passenger miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamental demand for air travel is really terrific,'' said
Chairman and Chief Executive Leo Mullin, who has led Delta since
1997. ``Obviously everybody is seeing it in crowded airplanes, but
that translates into financial performance.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on CNBC, Mullin also said the government has
failed to deliver on promised improvements in the air traffic
control system, producing more weather-related delays this summer
in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we're in for a tough summer. Our delays are up
quite substantially, particularly in the Northeast,'' he said.
Unusually dry weather in the Southeast has spared Delta's Atlanta
hub somewhat, although delays in the Northeast affect the whole
system.
</P>
<P>
   For its fourth quarter, Delta posted net income of $376 million,
or $2.86 a share, excluding one-time items, compared with $364
million, or $2.40 per share a year earlier. The results top the
First Call consensus analysts' forecast of $2.72 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter increased to $4.47 billion vs. $3.92
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of a gallon of jet fuel rose to 60 cents from
51 cents a year earlier, a 17.6 percent jump. Operating profit
margin for the quarter slipped to 15.4 percent from 16.2 percent,
as unit costs rose 4.9 percent to 9.38 cents per available
seat-mile.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has been hurt less than other airlines by higher fuel
costs, as it negotiated ``hedging'' contracts prior to the runup in
oil prices. Those contracts begin lapsing later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Delta had a non-cash gain of $228 million related to stock
holdings in Internet seat-seller Priceline.com. It took an $86
million charge for an early retirement offer taken by 2,500
employees. With those items, quarterly profit was $460 million, or
$3.51 a share.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year, Delta posted a $1.02 billion profit
excluding special items, vs. $1.08 billion a year earlier.
Operating profit margin dipped to 11.7 percent, from 12.7 percent a
year earlier as unit costs rose 2 percent to 9.07 cents per
available seat-mile.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings
earlier this week, although a warning from United about weaker
third-quarter results sent airline stocks skidding Wednesday. Delta
shares regained some of the loss Thursday, rising 25 cents Thursday
to $53.88.

 &HT;    `West Wing' vs. mob as Emmy tries to sharpen edge
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer and Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of ``Survivor,'' Thursday's Emmy nominations
looked back on a television season in which not a single rat was
consumed in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   For the scorekeepers, freshman drama ``The West Wing'' and HBO's
``The Sopranos'' led all nominees with 18 each. HBO's movie ``RKO
218,'' about Orson Welles, had 13 nominations, ABC's musical
``Annie'' got 12, and HBO's ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'' and
NBC sitcom ``Will &AMP; Grace'' had 11 each.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had the most nominations with 97 followed by HBO (86), ABC
(64), CBS (41) and Fox (26).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal,'' which won best comedy last year, wasn't even
nominated this year. Shut out of major categories: ``The X-Files''
(once a favorite) and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (as always).
</P>
<P>
   We don't have a vote, but following are some thoughts on who
should win and who will win this year's Emmys. (Editor's note: our
critics had different thoughts in some categories, so their names
and comments accompany those picks.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, handicapping the winners this year is more difficult than
in the past. The Emmys are changing the voting process, a result of
building criticism over safe, repeat choices (Dennis Franz of
``NYPD Blue'' recently, and before that, Candice Bergen for
``Murphy Brown''), and last year's selection of ``The Practice''
over ``The Sopranos,'' which many called a travesty.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Emmy relied on volunteer members of the National
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences to screen submitted videos
at a hotel over a weekend. A frequent criticism was that only the
retired and unemployed members had time to do this and edgier shows
lost out.
</P>
<P>
   This year, volunteers will screen videos at home on their own
time. The academy says this will increase the pool of voters and
possibly yield more daring winners, but some wonder if members will
just vote for their favorite shows and skip the viewing.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    When it comes to shoes, the sky's the limit
 &HT;    By Erin Coyle
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta women, like women everywhere, can't have enough shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Take, as a possible example, Atlanta's former chief investment
officer, Theresa Stanford. Federal prosecutors said Wednesday that
in a kickback scheme involving her husband's company, she received
a credit card and charged $30,000 in shoes over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe any woman would need so many? Remember Imelda
Marcos?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have 150 pairs of shoes. I just love shoes,'' says
Carylon Brown, 58, of Atlanta. She generally buys one or two pairs
every two months for $75-$100 each, although she's already bought
three pairs in July. And she has several that still have price tags
on them.
</P>
<P>
   But $30,000 in four years? It's possible.
</P>
<P>
   A good pair at Bob Ellis Shoes, an upscale store in Phipps
Plaza, costs anywhere from $200 to $400, says Jim Whitlow, vice
president. Really high fashion shoes can go for more than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have customers that buy 20 to 30 to 40 pairs of shoes a
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Erna Martino of Atlanta just laughs when she's asked how many
shoes she owns. She says you never ask a woman that.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Has anyone told the federal prosecutor that?
</P>

 &HT;    Roundup of weekend TV options
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dateline NBC'' (9 p.m. on NBC) _ Correspondent Sara James
anchors an hourlong show on the aftermath of the Columbine High
School shooting, focusing on student Craig Scott and his family,
and how they have dealt with what happened.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sound Affects'' (10 p.m. on VH1) _ In the premiere of this
VH1 series, everyday folks talk about how a rock song or singer
inspired them to overcome adversity. I once played Cheap Trick's
``Surrender'' 28 times in a row in a small apartment but instead of
overcoming adversity, I created it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dennis Miller Live'' (11:30 p.m. on HBO) Kevin Bacon is the
guest, which instantly elevates Miller to a major player in the
``Six Degrees of ...'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hollywood Dream Jobs'' (3 p.m. on E!) _ For every guy who
gets to be part of Leo DiCaprio's posse, there's some poor schlub
who has to shave Tom Arnold's back.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ice'' (1998, 8 p.m. on ABC)_ Last Saturday, ABC's movie was
about a hole in the ozone that caused unbearable heat. This week
it's a movie about a new Ice Age, starring Grant Show (``Melrose
Place'') and Eva Larue (La Who?) Callahan. Somebody's been reading
their Robert Frost (``Some say the world will end in fire/ Some say
in ice'').
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story'' (9 p.m. on
WGTV) _ The final part of this beloved family-oriented trilogy
makes its PBS debut, returning Megan Follows to the role of Anne
Shirley, now an adult during the World War I era. It concludes July
30.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Strong Medicine'' (9 p.m. on Lifetime) _ Janine Turner,
still best known as bush pilot Maggie on ``Northern Exposure,''
returns to series TV. She looks startlingly different here, with
long dark hair and a more sculpted face. Anyway, she plays a
well-heeled Philadelphia surgeon who's dragged into helping at a
struggling women's clinic run by Dr. Delgado (Rosa Blasi). Whoopi
Goldberg, who co-produces this new series, guest-stars in the pilot
as the all-knowing medicine woman who brings them together.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ellen DeGeneres: The Beginning'' (10 p.m. on HBO) _ Yup,
she's on HBO. DeGeneres goes back to her stand-up roots with an
hourlong routine that she honed all over the country in recent
months, including a stop at Atlanta's Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Movies
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``There's Something About Mary'' (8 tonight on HBO) _ OK,
maybe it didn't deserve to win an Oscar for best picture. But
surely it should have at least been nominated for best makeup, for
Chris Elliott's hideous case of progressive hives. 118m.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Next Karate Kid'' (1994, 9 p.m. Saturday on the Disney
Channel) _ Five years before she was the toast of the film industry
for ``Boys Don't Cry,'' young Hilary Swank first came to attention
as the female replacement for Ralph Macchio in the ``Karate Kid''
franchise. She kicks some major, uh, you know. 104m.
</P>
<P>
   Best Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Brothers Garcia'' (8:30 p.m. Sunday on Nickelodeon).
</P>
<P>
   With the broadcast networks continuing to treat Latino
characters with all the open-armed welcome of a Pat Buchanan rally,
Nickelodeon comes along with this snappy little comedy that gets it
all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brothers Garcia'' is no mere sop to diversity, it's an
amusing comedy (with no laugh track!) that has the makings of a
``Malcolm in the Middle.'' Like ``Malcolm,'' it's about a large,
wacky family, told from the point of view of one young son, in this
case 11-year-old Larry, looking back as an adult (with narration by
John Leguizamo, a la Daniel Stern's voice-overs in ``The Wonder
Years'').
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic ``angle'' is present, but not emphasized very much
(in the pilot, we never learn the Garcias' specific heritage).
There's a reference to Dad's super-duper salsa (cut to stock
footage of an atomic bomb when the jar is opened) and such, but
``Garcia'' is accessible to families of any heritage, and enjoyable
enough that parents will actually want to watch this new Nick treat
with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Worst Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Getting Away With Murder: The JonBenet Ramsey Story''
</P>
<P>
   (9 tonight on Fox).
</P>
<P>
   Getting away with murder is what Fox is doing, re-running this
February sweeps piece of horse-hockey. Not even up to the standards
of a ``real'' docudrama, this rancid little show presents two
``detectives'' named Detective Guilty and Inspector Innocent, with
theories as to how Ramsey's parents did or did not kill her.

 &HT;    Killer virus under surveillance
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday
published explicit guidelines for areas where birds infected with
the West Nile virus are found.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that includes only the greater New York area,
where the imported African virus surfaced last summer, sickening at
least 62 people and killing seven. So far this summer, 26 infected
birds _ 21 crows, four blue jays and a hawk _ have been found in
five counties in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile has not yet appeared in Georgia _ the furthest south
that an infected bird has been discovered was a crow found dead in
Maryland last fall _ but public-health authorities predict that it
will inevitably arrive via birds flying south on migratory
pathways.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which was never seen in the U.S. before August 1999,
is transmitted by mosquitos from the infected birds to horses and
humans. In a small percentage of cases, the virus causes a
potentially fatal swelling of the brain and spinal cord for which
there is no known treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Areas where the virus has been found should take these steps,
the CDC said:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Intensify surveillance and tracking of the virus through
programs including mosquito trapping, analyzing dead birds, and
maintaining ``sentinel flocks'' of chickens whose blood is checked
periodically for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reinforce publicly funded mosquito-control efforts, including
killing mosquito larvae and ground spraying for adult mosquitos
within two miles of any area where infected birds or mosquitos are
found.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consider spraying insecticides from the air in areas where
transmission of West Nile to humans is confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Educate the public about the need to eliminate standing water
(which mosquitos use for breeding) near homes, and advise the
public to use insect repellents and protective clothing in areas
where the virus has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has already received CDC funding to set up a West Nile
surveillance program; the Division of Public Health has urged
residents to contact local health departments if they find birds
for whose death there is no obvious explanation (such as a
collision with a building).
</P>
<P>
   Though West Nile has not been found here, ``It is always
appropriate to look around your home to see if there are good
breeding sites for mosquitos present, such as stagnant water in
puddles or unused pools, or water in discarded tires,'' said Dr.
Stephen Ostroff, associate director of CDC's National Center for
Infectious Diseases and federal coordinator of the anti-West Nile
campaign. ``It is prudent for people to remove any standing water
to prevent mosquitos from breeding. And should they want to further
reduce their risk, it is appropriate for them to wear insect
repellents and protective clothing outside.''

ISRAELIS TAKE NEGOTIATIONS ROLLER COASTER IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (with MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For a moment early Thursday morning, when she heard
the announcement that the Camp David talks had ended with no
agreement, Gaby Bar-Zakai breathed easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt relieved,'' recalled Bar-Zakai, who lives in Maaleh
Adumim, a sprawling Israeli suburb of Jerusalem in the West Bank.
``I was very concerned that if the talks didn't break up, the
Israeli concessions would be total.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the news that the talks would continue after all, and
Bar-Zakai seesawed back to reality. By Thursday night she was more
sober.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that things would swing back and forth,''
she said as she savored a warm summer evening with friends at a
sidewalk cafe in downtown Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical,'' she said, ``because I don't think the
Palestinians are ripe for a comprehensive agreement. But I think
there will be a partial accord, because both sides have no other
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the last-minute reversal at Camp David,
Israelis kept a watchful eye on developments, but they were not
holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to the ups and downs of negotiations with the
Palestinians after years of tortuous talks, people seemed unruffled
by the latest cliff-hanger, as they tried to get on with ordinary
lives in extraordinary times.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed the same Thursday in Jerusalem, but it was
not. For the first time, an Israeli prime minister had negotiated
with the Palestinians on the future of the city, which Israel has
always claimed as its indivisible capital _ and it was going over
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are apathetic; they're too busy with their daily
lives,'' said Avi Mizrahi, 23, as he sat on a park bench with a
friend. He allowed that he was no fan of Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
who was ``just doing everything to earn a place in the history
books, without a coalition or proper support.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's efforts seem to have the quiet support of many
liberal Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting their views, the newspaper Haaretz said: ``Barak
should be congratulated for his readiness to smash the taboo on
negotiations over Jerusalem. The Camp David summit 2000 will be
recorded as the first occasion in which Israelis and Palestinians
tried to touch the dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Meron Benvenisti, an expert on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,
wrote in Haaretz that ``the very fact that the taboo has been
broken and Israel is holding a discussion on Jerusalem that means
division of the city'' is ``an act from which there can be no
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk shows were dominated by discussions on solutions for
Jerusalem, and some callers from the city said they supported plans
to put Arab neighborhoods under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Long-repeated assertions by Israeli politicians that Jerusalem
would remain Israel's united and eternal capital seemed to be
giving way to a more pragmatic public debate about the city's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the shift, Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition
Likud Party, accused Barak on Thursday of giving up too much,
creating ``impossible starting lines for any future negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had ``already given Arafat a deposit, and we will have to
work hard to erase the withdrawal lines drawn by Barak on the map
at Camp David,'' Sharon said. ``These will be the starting lines
for the next Palestinian demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, who left Barak's cabinet in protest over the
summit meeting, sent a letter to the prime minister, urging him to
submit any agreement on Jerusalem for approval by Jewish leaders,
as well as by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a tent near Barak's office, Sharansky is advocating
formation of a broad government that would include opposition
parties, in order to reach a wide consensus on peace moves.
</P>
<P>
   Founders of the Jewish settlement movement have set up their own
tent nearby, where they are holding a hunger strike for the
duration of the summit meeting. Thursday scores of settlers swayed
there in prayer on a religious fast day that carried added
significance for them.
</P>
<P>
   The fast commemorates the breaching of the walls of Jerusalem
before the destruction of the first Jewish temple by the
Babylonians in 587 B.C. and the second temple by the Romans in A.D.
70. Barak's plans for the city, the settlers assert, are tantamount
to another destruction.

<P>
   Addressing a longstanding debate among scientists over how much
of the brain is activated to perform a difficult task like taking
an IQ test, researchers have found that a surprisingly small and
specific region of gray matter may be the brain's master problem
solver.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that the venerable ``seat of human
intelligence'' is less of a throne in dimensions than a footstool.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Duncan of the Cognition and Brain Science Unit of the
Medical Research Council in Cambridge, England, and his colleagues
are reporting their results in Friday's issue of the journal
Science. In their research, the team conducted brain scans of
people who were asked to solve diverse IQ-type questions, including
spatial problems that required looking at four geometric images on
a display monitor and trying to figure out which did not fit with
the others. They were also assigned verbal tasks that involved
finding patterns to complex sequences of letters.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists wondered whether large areas of the brain would
light up on their scans as the subjects sweated and figuratively
gnawed on their No. 2 pencils, or whether a limited locus of the
brain would prove to be the intellect's central headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the same confined region was activated whether
the subjects were tackling verbal or spatial problems. The region
in question, called the lateral prefrontal cortex, comes in pairs,
one for each hemisphere of the brain. It is somewhat above the
outer edge of the eyebrow, and corresponds roughly to where someone
would rest his head in the palm of the hand when cogitating or
daydreaming.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same region of the brain that previous neuroimaging
studies had shown to be important for solving novel tasks, keeping
many things in mind at once, and screening out irrelevant
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing here seems to be a global work space for
organizing and coordinating information and carrying it back to
other parts of the brain as needed,'' Duncan said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   It is the relative performance of this cerebral work space, he
said, that intelligence tests appear to measure, and that
determines how deft a person is at solving a broad array range of
cognitive problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are blessed with a work space that functions very,
very well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he and his colleagues see this region of the brain as so
crucial to high-level thinking that they boldly titled their report
``A Neural Basis for General Intelligence.'' But their neuroimaging
studies do not answer incendiary questions like whether current
standardized tests ``really'' measure intelligence, or are
culturally or otherwise biased. Nor does the research say anything
about whether the performance of the lateral prefrontal cortex is
largely innate or is heavily influenced by learning and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and his co-workers have yet to see if there are
detectable differences in the response of the lateral prefrontal
cortex in people who tend to score high on standardized tests
compared with those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a misinterpretation of this paper to say, `There's
a genius spot in the brain,' '' said Dr. Marie T. Banich, a
cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. Sternberg, a psychologist at Yale who wrote a
``Perspectives'' essay to accompany the new study, said in an
interview: ``This is a very narrow view of intelligence. Many
psychologists are obsessed with IQ-type tests, but such tests don't
tell you who is going to be successful in life and who isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out in his Perspectives piece that Vice President Al
Gore, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and former Sen. Bill Bradley all
scored just middling-well on the verbal portion of the College
Boards, yet all, he said, would be considered exceptionally
successful Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Many neuroscientists said they were impressed with the Duncan
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intriguing study,'' said Dr. Jonathan D. Cohen, a
professor of psychology and director of the Center for the Study of
Brain, Mind and Behavior at Princeton. ``Duncan asks the question,
is there some kind of underlying common mechanism that is
`intelligence,' or is intelligence a fractionable set of cognitive
processes that differ according to different skills, domains, or
talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he found was very similar brain areas were engaged in
what appear to be very different problem-solving tasks,'' Cohen
said. ``This draws our attention to a relatively well-defined area
over the vast expanse of the brain.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Duncan's research specifically tested two hoary and competing
hypotheses of general intelligence by two British psychologists.
One, formulated by Charles Spearman in the early 1900s, proposed
that there was a general factor, dubbed the ``g-factor,'' that
allowed a person to perform well in a diverse array of cognitive
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, Godfrey Thomson suggested that any difficult
cognitive task required the contribution of multiple
``information-processors'' in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The Duncan team tested 60 participants ages 29 to 51 on a range
of tasks, some requiring intensive problem-solving skills _ the IQ
test questions _ and others simpler in nature.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked, the subjects' brains were scanned with positron
emission tomography, or PET scan devices. Such scanning technology
is considered an older method of neuroimaging than the now
fashionable fast magnetic resonance imaging technique, but Duncan
said that the studies were begun before the advent of fast MRI, and
that their future research, including efforts to detect differences
in the lateral prefrontal cortex between high-IQ and low-IQ
subjects, will be based on MRI scans. Neural scans measure relative
blood flow in the brain, an indication of how vigorously a region
is being recruited into action.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan admitted that he anticipated the Spearman hypothesis
would be borne out by neural imaging, and that therefore he was not
terribly surprised by his results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say I was prejudiced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the spatial problems, the lateral prefrontal
cortex was activated in both hemispheres of the brain, whereas for
verbal problems, only the left kicked in. Scientists cannot say
whether this reflects the fact that verbal ability is thought to be
mostly left-hemispheric in nature, or because the average person
has an easier time thinking verbally than spatially and therefore
needs to use only half the cortical energy to attack the verbal
challenge. Additionally, the spatial problems recruited some spots
of the brain thought to be involved in visual analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists said the most striking result was the activation
of the same patch of the left hemisphere lateral prefrontal cortex
for both verbal and spatial tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important is that you see very nice convergence in
this area for two different types of problems,'' said Banich.
</P>
<P>
   The results lend weight to the idea that the brain is modular in
its construction, built of various regions or loci that carry out
highly specialized functions, like recognizing faces or large
landmarks in the environment, or categorizing apples, bananas and
grapes as fruits. At the same time, the lateral prefrontal cortex
appears to be a master integrator of tasks and input _ a cognitive
lumper rather than a splitter, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lateral prefrontal cortex is a region that receives a lot
of converging information, both external and internal,'' said Dr.
Earl K. Miller, a professor of neuroscience at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``It's the most well-connected part of the
brain. If there is going to be a general mechanism for
intelligence, you'd expect it to be in a region where a lot of
information converges.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists also emphasize that, despite its modularity, the
brain is extremely plastic and dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to think of intelligence as static, and the
g-factor as something fixed and immutable,'' said Dr. William T.
Greenough, a neuroscientist at the University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign. But his research with rats has shown that putting
them in a stimulus-rich environment improves their performance on
all sorts of tests that might be thought of as the rodent
equivalent of the College Boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is very responsive to experience,'' Greenough said.
``It is an ever-changing place.'' &QL;

LEADERS' DECISION TO STAY SEEN AS A COMPLIMENT TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The first sign of unfolding drama flashed across
a police scanner. ``Prepare for POTUS movement,'' warned a Secret
Service agent at Camp David just after 10 p.m., using shorthand to
say the President of the United States was on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade was up and running. President Clinton was leaving
for Japan. By 10:30 p.m., US officials informed the Middle East
leaders in their cabins, and within half an hour it was broadcast
around the world: Despite nine days of intensive negotiations, the
peace summit called to end more than a half-century of conflict had
fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden turnabout that followed stunned even veterans of the
tumultous politics of the Middle East. Yet early Thursday, as
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat took the remarkable step of remaining at Camp David in
Clinton's absence, it appeared the two men had reached the same
conclusion at once: Going home empty-handed would be worse than
staying put.
</P>
<P>
   And in a brief one-hour window, as Clinton changed clothes and
packed, Arafat and Barak made a last-minute decision that could yet
decide the course of the Middle East peace process. To many
involved, it was not only a relief but also a surprise, capping a
chaotic day of brinkmanship and verbal crossfire that included
Barak packing his bags and announcing he was storming out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit, this is like riding a rollercoaster,'' Israeli
Immigration Minister Yuli Tamir said Thursday. ``Every minute is
different from the last.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides, under intense domestic pressures not to cede too
much, had made progress on certain issues during more than a week
and a half of meetings. In particular, officials said they had
found common ground on two of the four core issues at stake: How to
handle some 3 million Palestinian refugees and their descendents,
and the return of some portion of the West Bank that Israel
captured in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton's departure loomed late Wednesday, they were
reportedly deadlocked on the most explosive subject, control over
the holy city of Jerusalem, and even a ``last push'' from Clinton
could not bring the leaders closer to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While Israeli delegates packed their bags and loaded them onto
trucks, Clinton shuttled between the two camps for three to five
hours, using ``every ounce of his power of persuasion that he had
available, and then some that he didn't know he had'' to persuade
the leaders to reach an agreement, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said. Clinton ultimately gave up at around 9 p.m.,
retreating to his own cabin as negotiators stayed on to complete a
final round of talks with Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates bid each other farewell over dinner, one US official
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called his wife and
said he'd be home by midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton changed into a dark suit and a blue tie, preparing to
drive to the White House to announce that talks had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luggage was loaded. The motorcade was assembled in front of
the President's cabin,'' Lockhart said. ``We were ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was still a lingering possibility. According to US
officials, the decision for Arafat and Barak to stay was not
initiated by either side, nor the result of harsh arm-twisting by
Clinton in the 11th hour. Lockhart said ``the notion of staying had
been kicked around throughout the evening,'' implying the idea came
from both Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't march into a room and say, `Here, we've got an
idea, let's try this,' '' Lockhart said. ``Conversations continued.
And in the period in which we were preparing to leave I think
there, in the President's mind, was an opportunity and an
opportunity to be seized.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamir, the Israeli Cabinet minister, who has been in Washington
over the past week, said the decision on the Israeli side came not
out of a belief that any progress had been made, or because of any
sign that Arafat might make concessions. Instead, it was ``really
out of respect and deep appreciation for what Clinton had done in
order to convene the summit and negotiate a peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a decision on the part of the Israeli delegation to
give it another chance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although both leaders could gain support among hard-liners by
standing firm in their positions, Barak had said all along he would
remain at Camp David for up to two weeks to reach a real
compromise, and Arafat indicated he would consider staying longer
at the beginning of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all staying at Camp David. I don't know for how long,
but we are hopeful they would reach agreement,'' Hassan
Abdel-Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
representative in Washington, told Reuters. ``As long as there are
negotiations, there is hope to clinch a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to return on Sunday night from Japan, where
he is attending the G-8 summit of industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as the atmosphere relaxed at Camp David, US
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright Thursday took charge of
the talks, holding meetings with negotiating teams all day.
Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said ``the same pattern
and intensity will be maintained'' during Clinton's absence,
although several officials said they expected the teams to now work
at a somewhat slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is looking to put together, as much as we can, the
positions of the parties and see how we can move all the issues
forward,'' he said. ``So the determination is there. . . . She's
here to carry the ball forward.''

YANKS FEEL THEY GAVE ONE AWAY
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thursday's visitors to Yankee Stadium would be
forgiven if the baseball game passed unnoticed, if they were
distracted by the parade of soft snow-white clouds outlined in
blue. Midsummer felt like early fall, incredibly.
</P>
<P>
   But the ballgame passed by the New York Yankees, as well. One
moment they had a comfortable lead and their pitcher was
dominating. Soon they were in their clubhouse, puzzled, trying to
understand how they lost to the Detroit Tigers, 5-3. It is a
recurring theme for the Yankees, who have repeatedly failed to
break away from other contenders in the mediocre American League
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like our pockets were picked,'' said Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager.
</P>
<P>
   Being the object of theft is a passive act. The Yankees played
an active role in this defeat, their 41st in 90 games this year; it
should have never, ever come to that.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (43-49) is without Tony Clark and Juan Gonzalez _ both
sluggers are on the disabled list _ and the Tigers are playing
mostly with journeymen. They came to New York on a 36-hour road
trip, a poor team that could be taken out easily. Roger Clemens
struck out 11 Tigers over eight innings on Wednesday and won by
9-1, and Thursday David Justice and Jorge Posada ripped home runs
in the second inning to give the Yankees and Andy Pettitte (9-6) a
3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees flubbed a scoring chance in the fifth inning, when
they had runners at first and second and one out, and could not add
anything. Still, their advantage was three runs, Pettitte's
fastball had sizzle _ he was on the way to striking out 10 batters
_ and there was nothing to suggest the Yankees might lose this
game.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte walked Damion Easley, the Tigers' leadoff hitter, to
open the sixth inning, a mild problem that became something of a
crisis when Pettitte threw two pitches out of the strike zone to
the next hitter, Shane Halter, who had drawn exactly five walks
this season. Posada, the Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound,
where he was joined by Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach. But
Pettitte was panicking a bit, overthrowing, trying too hard. He
walked Halter. He had a three-run lead in the sixth, and he walked
two batters to start an inning. He felt himself overstriding, felt
his mechanics falling apart, ``and I just didn't make the
adjustment,'' Pettitte said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson hit a ground-ball single, driving home one run,
before Pettitte struck out Dean Palmer and Wendell Magee; just one
more out, and the Yankees would survive with a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Deivi Cruz singled to left, where Felix Jose _ making his
third start of the season _ charged the ball. ``I was trying to
throw the guy out at home, and I didn't have a chance,'' Jose said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than glove the ball and throw home, Jose fumbled Cruz's
hit, then hurled the ball toward home plate, rather than second
base. Halter scored on the hit, Higginson took third on Jose's
error, and Cruz rambled into second on the poorly directed throw.
Two runs in, two runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte tried jamming Juan Encarnacion with a cut fastball but
missed his target _ the ball was too far over the plate _ and
Encarnacion laced a single through the middle, two runs scored. As
the inning ended, one batter later, Pettitte removed his hat, wiped
his brow and spat on the ground disgustedly.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no reprieve. Chuck Knoblauch doubled leading off
the seventh, and following that hit, Derek Jeter tried to roll the
ball to the right side of the field _ and hit a soft, harmless
lineout instead, failing to advance the runner. Knoblauch never
made it past third. The Yankees had runners at first and second and
one out in the ninth and Paul O'Neill smacked a hard grounder off
Detroit's closer, Todd Jones, but right to the second baseman,
Easley, who started a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill ran through the bag, turned and headed for the Yankees'
dugout on the first-base side of the field, head down, the
realization of defeat sinking in. ``This is a game that you've got
to win,'' Pettitte said. ``The two walks led to it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neill: ``This is a game where you look back and you'll
think we definitely should have won.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and Tino Martinez and others spoke positively of the
current direction of the team. It has four victories in the last
six games, 11 victories in the last 16 games. The Yankees are in
first place in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the perfect lineup continues, even after the
acquisitions of Justice and the left-handed pitcher Denny Neagle.
The Yankees' front office is seeking a right-handed power hitter to
bat eighth and play left field _ those are the specifications _ and
might swap a top prospect in return. The current craving is for
another big hitter, the thinking being that if only they could get
another star, perhaps that will put them over the top. Or perhaps
the players already in pinstripes must start performing
consistently. Perhaps they need to win games like the game they
gave away Thursday. &QL;

NEW PARLIAMENT, SHARED BY GOVERNING PARTY AND OPPOSITION, OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ The cameras flashed, the crowds cheered and
the bitter rivals strode in side by side. One month after this
country's momentous elections, Parliament officially opened
Thursday with the governing party forced to share space and power
with a formidable opposition for the first time in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But as the foreign affairs minister, Stan Mudenge, marched
alongside Evelyn Masaiti, a teacher who was attacked by supporters
of Mudenge's party during the harsh and bloody campaign, he bowed
graciously to the new reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He greeted me,'' marveled Masaiti, who braved the political
violence to win a seat for the opposition. ``He said, `How are
you?' He said he was lucky to be standing near me because the
cameras would all concentrate on the man next to such a smartly
dressed woman. And I just laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   With nervous glances and awkward handshakes, President Robert
Mugabe's ZANU-PF party formally ceded its near total monopoly on
power Thursday. And as the opposition party members took their
seats in the chamber, thousands of flag-waving, singing supporters
danced in the streets and welcomed a new, raucous era of
multi-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a single opposition party _ the Movement for
Democratic Change _ now controls 57 seats in the 150-member
Parliament, a share large enough to block Mugabe's party from
unilaterally changing the constitution. His party, the ZANU-PF,
which won 62 seats, had controlled all but three seats since the
late 1980s. Mugabe also appoints 30 members of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   As the president entered Parliament Thursday afternoon and saw
the new faces in the chamber that his party had overwhelmingly
dominated for two decades, he clearly knew the political landscape
here had dramatically shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of the elections are here, fully reflected in this
significantly changed composition of this august house,'' Mugabe
said Thursday in a markedly conciliatory speech to the new
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``To you, all honorable members, I say congratulations while
expressing the fervent hope that you will shoulder your weighty
responsibilities in this house with dignity, a sense of
responsibility and seriousness of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains its majority in Parliament, but the
political realignment is still unprecedented here. And as cannons
boomed and fighter jets whizzed over the capital, thousands of
people flocked to see the spectacle with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took off from work; I had to see it for myself,'' said
Theresa Macheche, 18, a manicurist. ``We voted for change. We are
fed up. Now we finally have a mixed Parliament with different
parties.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his speech, Mugabe promised to address some of the concerns
of the disenchanted urban electorate. He promised to focus on the
ailing economy and move quickly to withdraw thousands of soldiers
from the civil war in Congo, as well as step up the pace of land
redistribution to poor black farmers, an issue that appeals to his
rural support base.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have also tempered their fiery statements
against the white minority and black supporters of the Movement for
Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   And last Saturday, Mugabe announced the formation of a new
Cabinet that has been widely praised across the political spectrum.
The key ministries of finance and industry, for instance, are now
run by Simba Makoni and Nkosana Moyo respectively, two highly
regarded businessmen who have sometimes been at odds with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   That move was a critical first step in the effort to woo back
Western donors, who have withdrawn desperately needed financial
assistance from Zimbabwe, saying the economy is severely
mismanaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inclusion of private-sector business leaders to head the
key economic ministries is in itself a powerful signal that this is
the time for fundamental change,'' said Kumbirai Katsande,
president of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries.
</P>
<P>
   But two Western officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said financial rescue will not come soon. They fear the new
ministers will lack the political clout to make painful, but
critical economic decisions. And they point to the government's
continuing threats to seize white-owned land without compensation
as a continuing source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there is likely to be no change at all to the
system of management and the style of leadership,'' said John
Makumbe, a political analyst at the University of Zimbabwe and a
frequent government critic.
</P>
<P>
   But the political shift is nothing short of extraordinary for
many opposition legislators who are still learning parliamentary
rules and how to wend their way through a building most had only
seen on television. They are teachers, lawyers, students and
businessmen who feel bewildered by government budgets and
committees. And some are scrambling to find money to rent offices
or print business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Masaiti, 35, whose car was burned in the political violence that
swept the country before the elections, had to squeeze into a
public bus to make the four-hour journey from her rural district in
Mutasa for the opening of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the new legislators took their oaths of office in a
festive ceremony marked by dueling chants. ``Zimbabwe's
independence was won through bloodshed!'' chorused the ZANU-PF
members.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition members shouted back, startling their opponents into
silence. ``ZANU-PF is rotten!'' they cried.
</P>
<P>
   But their jubilation faded as they promptly lost their first
battle over the choice of the new speaker of Parliament. The
governing party closed ranks and selected its preferred candidate,
reminding the downcast opposition of the limits of their newfound
power.

   Jonathan Moyo, the chief of information in Mugabe's office, said
Movement for Democratic Change members must learn to work with the
majority or risk becoming ``noisemakers not lawmakers.'' And some

   Masaiti says she is undeterred by challenge. She said she got
into politics because she was tired of struggling to feed her
family. And Thursday morning, on her big day, when she looked at
her reflection in the mirror, she finally believed she had made it.
``That woman,'' she said she told herself, ``is an M.P.''
</P>
<P>
   And by 9 a.m., hours before the opening ceremony, the new M.P.,
or member of parliament, was already at work, meeting with women's
groups and taking careful notes in her tiny spiral notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying they want development, roads, schools,
irrigation, health facilities,'' she said, as she rushed off to her
next meeting. ``I know it won't be easy. I just promise I will try
my best.''

RED SOX CAN'T IGNORE EVERETT'S NEED FOR HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the record, the official press box over/under was 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to take the Rod Beck route and call it five a
bump, that's fine, but 10 games simply seemed to be the minimum
number of lost games Judge Frank Robinson could assign to Carl
Everett for his tempestuous outburst at Fenway Park last Saturday
afternoon. Only one person I talked to thought there was even a
(itals)chance(unitals) the punishment would be anything less, while
just about everyone believed anything in excess of 15 would be
punishing the Red Sox themselves to excess. Most people accurately
predicted that Robinson would make it 10, and so he has. As for the
appeal process, who knows? Anything can happen, of course, but it
would be wise to assume that when all the harrumphing and all the
legal wrangling is complete Carl Everett will wind up being sat
down for 10 games _ whenevah.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Carl is fortunate his fate wasn't in the hands of
Judge Ryan. I would have given him at least 20. I might have
entertained 30.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw this thing (except, of course, his agent) knows
that the 10 games were a no-brainer. He (itals)did(unitals)
head-butt umpire Ron Kulpa, not once, but twice. He did continue to
act like a fool, long after the fact. But the big thing was that no
one can go around even thinking about head-butting an umpire.
</P>
<P>
   The problem I have with a 10-game suspension is that Carl
Everett is a multiple offender who must be made aware of a
zero-tolerance approach for the future. I'm not sure that this
10-game suspension will send that messsage, especially since there
is no evidence that the Boston Red Sox as an organization have any
intention of addressing Carl Everett's core problem, which is a
propensity for excessive outrage, no matter how small, or even in
two interesting cases, how nonexistent the provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the most telling aspect of last Saturday's
incident was the reaction of Mets right fielder Derek Bell, who
came running in from his position to intercede, a direct violation
of all known baseball etiquette. He did so because, alone among all
people in Boston last Saturday, he truly (itals)knew(unitals) Carl
Everett, and he feared the worst. Derek Bell has been a friend of
Everett's since the age of 8. He has seen his buddy in good times
and in bad. He came running in from right field because he believed
in his heart of hearts that Everett was capable of committing an
act that would end his baseball career, right then and there, and
that could conceivably lead to his incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Bell indicated he feared his friend of two decades might get
into ``serious, serious, serious trouble.'' That is why he was
willing to risk the wrath of his teammates by involving himself
with the actions of an opposing player toward the umpire, something
that would ordinarily have amused them, more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what Carl Everett is capable of doing? Any
professional athlete who would go into a swearing fit at the
expense of a fellow airline passenger who had placed a briefcase on
his suit coat (a simple ``Excuse me, but I wish you wouldn't do
that'' would suffice) and who would overreact with another
profanity-laden outburst to a thoroughly innocuous item in a
baseball game story in which he was accurately quoted as saying ``I
have nothing to say'' is, if not mentally unstable, frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doesn't think there is cause for worry with this man
should dig out last Sunday's Globe (July 16) and scour Gordon
Edes's wonderfully researched story on the turbulent life and times
of one Carl Everett. When you've finished wading through the data,
you have the answer to the question, ``Why is such a talented
player now with his fifth organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Red Sox are now liable for $30 million worth of
Carl Everett, and given that they will be very happy to pay that
money if he continues to play baseball the way he has this season
for the next four campaigns, the issue now is ensuring that he is
in a position to play approximately 140-150 games a year between
now and 2005. What would you say are the odds of him doing this?
I'd say that as things stand there is a better chance of him going
off on somebody in a road rage incident, or throwing a bat at a
pitcher he feels has violated his turf, than there is of him
proceeding peacefully through a seven-month baseball season. The
fact is it doesn't take much to turn Carl Everett, Great
Ballplayer, into Carl Everett, Menace To Society.
</P>
<P>
   We know already that he has learned nothing from this affair,
given that his initial reaction to the suspension was to blame the
media for making this an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Dan Duquette's move. This incident has brought out the
worst in Jimy Williams, whose apparent position is that he's still
available for me to write his name in the lineup, so
(itals)what(unitals) anger issue? You'd hope that the
ever-inscrutable GM, Amherst grad that he is, would identify
Everett's problem in a long-term context and take steps to get him
the professional help he obviously needs, simply to cover his own
executive butt.
</P>
<P>
   But I long ago conceded that Dan Duquette marches to his own
unique drummer. On more than one occasion he has given strong
indications that he believes this game is played with baseball
robots, not actual men who breathe and feel. (It doesn't help in
this particular matter that his greatest creation, the shortstop,
really (itals)is(unitals) the closest thing to a factory-ordered
baseball machine in the game today.)
</P>
<P>
   It is beyond dispute that the Red Sox need Everett in their
lineup. It is likewise beyond dispute that, absent a strong
preemptive strike on their part, this will not be the last time
they'll be sitting around awaiting Judge Robinson's decision in the
wake of an irrational Everett blowup.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox are very lucky he will only be out for 10
games. If they don't address this situation, the next suspension
will be much longer. That is an ultra-mortal lock.

NEW PARLIAMENT, SHARED BY GOVERNING PARTY AND OPPOSITION, OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ The cameras flashed, the crowds cheered and
the bitter rivals strode in side by side. One month after this
country's momentous elections, Parliament officially opened
Thursday with the governing party forced to share space and power
with a formidable opposition for the first time in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But as the foreign affairs minister, Stan Mudenge, marched
alongside Evelyn Masaiti, a teacher who was attacked by supporters
of Mudenge's party during the harsh and bloody campaign, he bowed
graciously to the new reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He greeted me,'' marveled Masaiti, who braved the political
violence to win a seat for the opposition. ``He said, `How are
you?' He said he was lucky to be standing near me because the
cameras would all concentrate on the man next to such a smartly
dressed woman. And I just laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   With nervous glances and awkward handshakes, President Robert
Mugabe's ZANU-PF party formally ceded its near total monopoly on
power Thursday. And as the opposition party members took their
seats in the chamber, thousands of flag-waving, singing supporters
danced in the streets and welcomed a new, raucous era of
multi-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a single opposition party _ the Movement for
Democratic Change _ now controls 57 seats in the 150-member
Parliament, a share large enough to block Mugabe's party from
unilaterally changing the constitution. The ZANU-PF, which won 62
seats, had controlled all but three seats since the late 1980s.
Mugabe also appoints 30 members of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   As the president entered Parliament Thursday afternoon and saw
the new faces in the chamber that his party had overwhelmingly
dominated for two decades, he clearly knew the political landscape
here had dramatically shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of the elections are here, fully reflected in this
significantly changed composition of this august house,'' Mugabe
said Thursday in a markedly conciliatory speech to the new
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``To you, all honorable members, I say congratulations while
expressing the fervent hope that you will shoulder your weighty
responsibilities in this house with dignity, a sense of
responsibility and seriousness of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains its majority in Parliament, but the
political realignment is still unprecedented here. And as cannons
boomed and fighter jets whizzed over the capital, thousands of
people flocked to see the spectacle with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took off from work; I had to see it for myself,'' said
Theresa Macheche, 18, a manicurist. ``We voted for change. We are
fed up. Now we finally have a mixed Parliament with different
parties.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his speech, Mugabe promised to address some of the concerns
of the disenchanted urban electorate. He promised to focus on the
ailing economy and move quickly to withdraw thousands of soldiers
from the civil war in Congo, as well as step up the pace of land
redistribution to poor black farmers, an issue that appeals to his
rural support base.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have also tempered their fiery statements
against the white minority and black supporters of the Movement for
Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   And last Saturday, Mugabe announced the formation of a new
Cabinet that has been widely praised across the political spectrum.
The key ministries of finance and industry, for instance, are now
run by Simba Makoni and Nkosana Moyo respectively, two highly
regarded businessmen who have sometimes been at odds with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   That move was a critical first step in the effort to woo back
Western donors, who have withdrawn desperately needed financial
assistance from Zimbabwe, saying the economy is severely
mismanaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inclusion of private-sector business leaders to head the
key economic ministries is in itself a powerful signal that this is
the time for fundamental change,'' said Kumbirai Katsande,
president of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries.
</P>
<P>
   But two Western officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said financial rescue will not come soon. They fear the new
ministers will lack the political clout to make painful, but
critical economic decisions. And they point to the government's
continuing threats to seize white-owned land without compensation
as a continuing source of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there is likely to be no change at all to the
system of management and the style of leadership,'' said John
Makumbe, a political analyst at the University of Zimbabwe and a
frequent government critic.
</P>
<P>
   But the political shift is nothing short of extraordinary for
many opposition legislators who are still learning parliamentary
rules and how to wend their way through a building most had only
seen on television. They are teachers, lawyers, students and
businessmen who feel bewildered by government budgets and
committees. And some are scrambling to find money to rent offices
or print business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Masaiti, 35, whose car was burned in the political violence that
swept the country before the elections, had to squeeze into a
public bus to make the four-hour journey from her rural district in
Mutasa for the opening of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the new legislators took their oaths of office in a
festive ceremony marked by dueling chants. ``Zimbabwe's
independence was won through bloodshed!'' chorused the ZANU-PF
members.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition members shouted back, startling their opponents into
silence. ``ZANU-PF is rotten!'' they cried.
</P>
<P>
   But their jubilation faded as they promptly lost their first
battle over the choice of the new speaker of Parliament. The
governing party closed ranks and selected its preferred candidate,
reminding the downcast opposition of the limits of their newfound
power.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Moyo, the chief of information in Mugabe's office, said
Movement for Democratic Change members must learn to work with the
majority or risk becoming ``noisemakers not lawmakers.'' And some
opposition legislators admit that they will be repeatedly
outnumbered unless they find allies across the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Masaiti says she is undeterred by challenge. She said she got
into politics because she was tired of struggling to feed her
family. And Thursday morning, on her big day, when she looked at
her reflection in the mirror, she finally believed she had made it.

</P>
<P>
   And by 9 a.m., hours before the opening ceremony, the new M.P.,

next meeting. ``I know it won't be easy. I just promise I will try
my best.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten years ago Michael Smith, an accountant with the
Ohio state government in Cincinnati, couldn't get into many
buildings, eat in many restaurants or navigate many hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Smith found barriers everywhere because he has used a wheelchair
since a 1972 car accident left him paralyzed from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which
former President George Bush signed July 26, 1990, a lot of the
barriers have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says, ``Before the law, there was a large part of everyday
life that was out of reach for me. It's still a challenge being
disabled, but at least now, I feel like the world isn't working
against me.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the nation's 54 million people with disabilities are
celebrating the transformation of America into a place where they
can ride buses, use bathrooms in public buildings and reach
drinking fountains _ all because of the ADA, which was aimed at
giving them access to places previously off limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It quite literally is a different world today for people with
disabilities,'' says Helena Berger, chief operating officer of
American Association of People with Disabilities, a
Washington-based advocacy group. ``The physical changes in
America's buildings and transportation have been tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger says the ADA helped make people aware that people with
disabilities were being discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, most businesses just didn't think about people
with disabilities or about the fact that their restaurant or store
was completely inaccessible to the disabled,'' she says. ``Now,
most people think about these things, which makes all the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, hundreds of technical rules devised to implement the
law have brought ramps, wider aisles, lower counters and drinking
fountains, automatic doors, special elevators, more accessible
restrooms, listening devices and wheelchair lifts.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the anniversary, the AAPD is sponsoring a 24-city torch
relay. The torch was lit June 7 at the grave of Martin Luther King
Jr. in Atlanta and will arrive in Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By beginning the relay at Dr. King's grave, we wanted to show
people that our struggle, like his, is about equality,'' Berger
says.
</P>
<P>
   She and other advocates argue that the struggle for equal rights
continues, particularly in the area of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Fiedler, chairman of the Washington-based Disability Rights
Council, says economic independence remains the ultimate goal for
people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement is maturing,'' he says. ``Now it's about jobs,
careers and participating in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey conducted by the National Organization on
Disability here and the New York-based Harris Poll, 56 percent of
people with disabilities who are able to work currently hold full-
or part-times jobs compared with 80 percent of those without
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released last week, also showed a significant income
gap between people with and without disabilities. Twenty-nine
percent of those with disabilities live in households with incomes
of $15,000 or less. Ten percent of people without disabilities live
in such households. Conversely, 16 percent of people with
disabilities live in households with $50,000 or more annual income.
But 39 percent of those without disabilities live in such
households.
</P>
<P>
   Berger says that the high unemployment numbers stem from an
entrenched prejudice against people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to put in a ramp or widen a hallway,'' she
says. ``It's another thing hire a person with a disability to come
into your office every day and to really be around that person.''
</P>
<P>
   She says that removing the ``mental barriers'' faced by people
with disabilities could take decades. ``These stereotypes die hard,
and no legislation can change attitudes overnight,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she says, disability groups must turn to the courts
to ensure that employers comply with the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   But as disability groups push to open doors, businesses are
complaining that the burdens placed on them have become too great.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eide, a spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
charges that predatory lawyers are seeking to enrich themselves
more than help people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the case of a California woman, who claims a plaintiff
sued her and 19 other restaurant owners after driving up and down
streets targeting everyone whose parking signs for the disabled
were not visible from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Grover of the National Restaurant Association, who
oversees the industry's compliance with the ADA, says, ``There is a
simmering anger among some disability-rights groups who just want
to drag people into court. And there is opportunistic behavior
among some attorneys who see this as a way to make some money.''
Grover argues that ``the ADA was designed for access, not to put
money in the pockets of lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce and the restaurant association are
supporting a bill, recently introduced by Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.,
that would give businesses 90 days to comply with the ADA after a
complaint has been lodged. Foley says retailers in Florida and
California are being harassed by what he calls ``drive-by
lawsuits'' initiated by lawyers who find ADA violations and seek
out people with disabilities to complain about them.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger argues that business owners have had 10 years to
comply with the ADA. ``The guidelines are clear and have been
around for a decade, so why do they need an extra 90 days?'' she
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Berger says the ADA should not be weakened. ``We've come a long
way in a short time, but we still have far to go, and we're going
to need all the help we can get,'' she says.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George Bush has always touted his record of
working with Texas Democrats, even basking in the endorsement of
the late Lt. Gov Bob Bullock, a Democratic icon who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the spotlight of a presidential campaign _ usually with
a nudge from the Democratic National Committee and the Al Gore
campaign _ is trying to recast the governor's role with the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mario Gallegos Jr., D-Houston, has appeared on CNN
twice and MSNBC, attended a press conference in Chicago and
accompanied Gore in San Antonio on Thursday _ and that's just this
week. Earlier this month, Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin, and
State Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, had press conferences on
Bush's record at the National Council of La Raza in California and
the NAACP national convention in Baltimore, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Bush's selling points has been it's hard to find a
(Texas) Democrat to criticize him,'' said University of Texas
political professor Bruce Buchanan. ``By highlighting a few of them
cuts Bush down a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNC underwrites the out-of-state travel and the Gore
campaign encourages out-of-state reporters to interview the handful
of Texas Democratic officials willing to criticize the popular
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they need a Latino from Texas, they call me or Gonzalo
(Barrientos),'' Gallegos said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By taking the fight to Bush in his home state, Buchanan said
Gore is trying to hammer both ends of the governor's compassionate
conservatism. While Gore questions the health of state finances
after Bush's property tax cut, Buchanan said the Democrat also
raises again the state's traditionally low national rankings in
health care and other social spending.
</P>
<P>
   Using Texas Democrats in the message also helps, Buchanan said,
although it runs counter to Texas tradition of bipartisanship in
the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gallegos and Barrientos said they are only telling
the truth _ Democrats had to push Bush to give more children health
insurance, expand kindergarten and raise teacher salaries. In
typical legislative trade-off, they said Bush's got his property
tax cut despite misgivings by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Few elected Democrats have been willing to tackle Bush head-on
in the presidential campaign. Buchanan said a lot of Democrats in
the pro-business coalition that runs the Legislature like Bush and
supported the budget Gore is criticizing. Others seeking
re-election _ from Speaker Pete Laney and on down the ballot _
don't want to make Bush a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Texas chauvinism also helps the governor. State Rep. Garnet
Coleman, D-Houston, said he was swamped with calls from national
reporters when he was quoted in his hometown newspaper saying
Bush's tax cut will make it harder for Texas to make ends meet next
year. He said he got a lot of reaction from his colleagues who fear
criticizing Bush is seen as criticizing Texas _ and the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts you in a tough spot if your loyalty to Texas is
equated with loyalty to Bush,'' he said. ``It is not my desire to
be an on-going spokesperson for the Gore campaign. My priority is
to help my constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly Beth Malcolm, Texas Democratic Party chairwoman, said
Democratic officials will follow their own political instincts in
addressing Bush's record. She urged voters to remember one thing:
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is not Texas. When we criticize his record, we are
not criticizing our state.''

   WASHINGTON _ At a get-together at a Washington think tank this
week, officials from Mexico walked up to Roger Noriega, a Capitol
Hill staffer, shook his hand, and lamented what a blow this week's
tragedy would be to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   The news was that Georgia's senior senator, Republican Paul
Coverdell, had died unexpectedly the day before, following a stroke
and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, who in Washington would help them push for democracy in
Mexico and throughout the Caribbean, the officials wondered. They
shared their grief with Noriega, who worked with Coverdell on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a number of people came up to me and said, 'Oh my God.
This is terrible,' '' said Noriega, the senior professional staff
member for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coverdell felt the Americas were special and different and
that we needed to work together more,'' Noriega continued. ``There
were people who recognized that the guy really cared. A lot of
people were worried about the vacuum it might leave.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Coverdell's drive to crush the drug trade and
nurture democracy in Latin America that has hit a snag.
</P>
<P>
   There were his plans to probe unusual travel activities among
members of the Small Business Administration, the federal agency
charged with making loans and offering training to small
businesses. There was his upcoming role as National Caucus Team
co-chair for the Republican National Convention starting July 31 in
Philadelphia. There, Coverdell's job would have been to speak with
reporters when Texas Gov. George W. Bush, his friend and the
presumptive Republican nominee for president, could not. There also
was Coverdell's work with the leaders of America's Fortune 500
companies to ensure that the Senate passed a bill granting
permanent, normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is all left hanging.
</P>
<P>
   The people who make up the nuts and bolts of Washington _ the
lobbyists, consultants, policy analysts and others _ described
Coverdell as one of those driven people whose mind was always on
the 10 things he still needed to do, and whose respect was so
sweeping that he affected every project working its way through the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a single activity that leadership was pushing
that didn't involve Sen. Coverdell,'' John Czwartacki, spokesman
for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), said. Though
Coverdell had given up his seat on the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee to fill a vacancy on the Senate Finance Committee, he
remained involved in Caribbean affairs, Noriega said.
</P>
<P>
   And as secretary of the Senate Republican Conference, it was
Coverdell's job to negotiate legislation strategy with The Business
Roundtable, a Washington-based association of the heads of the
country's largest companies. Just last Thursday, Coverdell met with
the group to bandy about strategy to get the Senate to approve the
China trade bill, which passed the U.S. House in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was actually a wonderful example of the senator in
that he was absolutely honest about the chances coming up. He was a
wonderful political handicapper,'' Johanna Schneider, roundtable
spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the group is waiting to see whom Lott names as a new point
person on the issue, Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell also was making progress getting answers for concerns
he had about the day-to-day operations of the Small Business
Administration, Emilia DiSanto, majority staff director for the
Senate Small Business Committee, said. Coverdell, a committee
member, had just begun looking into allegations about unusual trips
taken by SBA employees. On Thursday, he was to help run the first
of a series of hearings that would have followed a new method of
monitoring SBA operations, DiSanto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, Senator Coverdell was excited about this
hearing,'' she said. She hopes his concerns about travel among SBA
workers will find a new home too. ``We're hopeful that another one
of the senators picks up interest.''

THE BIG EASY GOES ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music, comedy and animation have filled the Net with several
notable Webcasts in recent days that are definitely worth checking
out.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the music site Riffage.com (at www.riffage.com),
which is showing 50 hours of this year's New Orleans Jazz &AMP;
Heritage Festival. Among the acts are Big Easy stalwarts the
Neville Brothers, the Radiators and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, and
national acts such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddies, Ani DiFranco, the
Allman Brothers and Better Than Ezra. The Webcasts end Friday.
</P>
<P>
   E! Online (at www.eonline.com) is running a weekly Interactive
Comedy Course featuring chats between the American Film Institute's
Jim Hosney and prominent directors among much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty Woman'' director Garry Marshall will participate
Wednesday, followed by ``Airplane'' co-directors David Zucker and
Jim Abrahams, ``Tootsie'' director Sydney Pollack and ``Big Daddy''
director Dennis Dugan.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, fans of the epic Final Fantasy videogames can
download a 53-second, 8-megabyte trailer of the first movie based
on the series. Go to www.finalfantasy.com to see the sleek site.
</P>
<P>
   The futuristic animated film _ featuring Alec Baldwin, Steve
Buscemi, Peri Gilpin, Ming-Na, Ving Rhames, Donald Sutherland and
James Woods _ is set for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   Final Fantasy creator Square Inc. is known for wonderful
animated cut scenes and cinematic story-telling in its games. I,
and I suspect many other Final Fantasy players, can't wait to see
how subsidiary Square Pictures applies those talents to the big
screen. The trailer provides promising evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming giants
</P>
<P>
   Little noticed in the big Vivendi-Universal Studios purchase was
what it may mean for the fast-growing, fast-changing videogame
business.
</P>
<P>
   Universal is home to some of the PlayStation's biggest
franchises, creating both the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon
series.
</P>
<P>
   And Vivendi already owned Havas Interactive, whose Torrance
headquarters oversees divisions such as Blizzard Entertainment _
the maker of million- selling PC games such as Diablo, Warcraft and
Starcraft _ and Sierra Online, maker of PC hit Half-Life (coming
soon to the Dreamcast, by the way).
</P>
<P>
   To welcome in the deal, in fact, Blizzard announced that Diablo
II sold 1 million units in its first two weeks. To put it mildly,
there had been a bit of pent-up demand.
</P>
<P>
   And add in rumors that Havas may next buy Eidos, who made a mint
off Tomb Raider but is struggling financially despite some good
recent titles, and you have the possibility of a gaming powerhouse
of truly grandiose proportions, especially when you throw in access
to many of the entertainment franchises generated by Universal's
TV, animation and movie operations.
</P>
<P>
   Small pictures, big bucks
</P>
<P>
   Who says there's no money in small films? iCAST (at
www.icast.com) doled out $100,000 to five directors for their short
films in a just-concluded contest judged by a panel of show-biz
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, getting $40,000 for his piece about a spurned lover
finding romance at the end of his rope, was Alex Weed. Four other
filmakers _ John Hargrave, Tom Birmingham, David Cassidy and Kenny
Meehan _ each received $15,000. That'll buy a lot of digital
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Lehman, one of the judges, said the excellent
submissions overall showed that ``even with limited budgets,
independent filmmakers using the digital format can create really
good content for the Web. As the technology gets better, making
films will become as easy as writing poetry.''

ELS TAKES EARLY, 1-SHOT, LEAD OVER WOODS, FLESCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ They call it the luck of the draw and
professional golfers understand that it comes with the job. They
don't ask for sympathy, just that good and bad fortunes share equal
time.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els got the slate wiped clear Thursday, which is why he
was able to vault to a one-shot lead over Tiger Woods and Steve
Flesch in the first round of the 129th British Open at sun-baked
St. Andrews. Admittedly in a struggle with his confidence of late,
Els offset bogeys on both par 3s with eight birdies _ the last of
which came at the near-impossible Road Hole, the par-4 17th _ in a
6-under-par 66 effort that silenced some efficient work put in by
Woods earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Low scores were the order of business on a course that continues
to play harder and faster than anything these gentlemen have
experienced. Obviously, the golfers have adjusted, because 50 of
them posted red numbers. A seven-player group at 68 included former
champ Tom Lehman and 20-year-old Sergio Garcia, and at 69 there
were 15 players, ranging from the red-hot Notah Begay to Ireland's
beloved Christy O'Connor Jr., at 52 enjoying perhaps his last
go-round in this championship.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke, Nick Faldo, David Duval, and Fred
Couples were among 14 who posted 70s, and Colin Montgomerie logged
in with 10 others at 71.
</P>
<P>
   None of them, it seems, was anxious to see Woods run from view,
a sentiment that was expressed quite well by Els.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see Tiger at 5-under and you have not even started your
round,'' said the two-time US Open champ, whose trip began after
Woods had finished. ``You know you have your work cut out for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knew he had been here before, just a month ago in the US
Open. Woods had sizzled to a 5-under 65, carving up Pebble Beach in
benign weather conditions, when Els journeyed off the first tee and
into cold, foggy, windy weather. ``I was 1-under par playing the
11th,'' said Els, ``and then it was called off.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning re-start proved difficult, Els finished with a 74,
inherited a nine-shot deficit, and became just one of 155 punching
bags for Woods's 15-shot victory.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching early Round 1 action in his hotel room
Thursday, the gracious South African with the sweet swing
discovered that the golf gods were smiling on him and the other
late starters. ``For once,'' he said, ``I got fortunate with my
draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon weather was virtually a carbon copy of what Woods
and the morning crew had faced, and it made the ever-present smile
on Els's face even wider. The front nine was practically all
downwind and when he turned for the demanding home stretch, Els
discovered that the wind had settled down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take advantage of that,'' said Els, who has four
Top 10s in nine British Open starts.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Els, with a frontside power surge which can deliver
to the same area code as Woods. At the 397-yard third, Els drove it
close to the green, pitched to 15 feet, and got to 1-under. He
reached the 568-yard, par-5 fifth in two and made birdie, then
drove the 412-yard sixth hole and got to 3-under.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day like this, you can shoot anything,'' said Els, who
drilled a 2-iron at the 388-yard seventh, then pitched to 20 feet
for birdie No. 4 and suddenly the bogey-free round Woods had
scripted wasn't as impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Woods thought it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a few loose shots here and there,'' said Woods, who
started the round as if he were out merely to work on his
lag-putting. Without a good birdie chance in his first eight holes,
Woods was two-putting from across greens at every step and staring
at a hefty deficit because Begay was pushing deep into the red.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was an 18-hole tournament, I would have been in
trouble,'' said Woods. ``Since there's 72 of them, I had a long way
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Five shots behind Begay through eight holes, Woods ripped off
five birdies in a seven-hole stretch, highlighted by his own power
supply. He drove it to the fringe on the 379-yard 10th, onto the
green at the 314-yard 12th, then reached the 581-yard 14th in two.
After Begay (he got to 7-under when he chipped in for an eagle-2 at
the 12th) had fallen from the top spot with a triple-bogey, bogey
finish, Woods saved par with a shot only he can hit _ a wedge out
of impossible heather down the left side of No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to open up the face because you know the grass is not
going to grab the club head, it's going to grab the shaft,'' said
Woods, who muscled his ball to the front of the green, then
navigated the two putts for par.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, but Els did him better in the afternoon, making one
of the four birdies yielded by that demanding 17th. ``I hit some
pretty awesome drives today, but that must be the shot of the day
(for me),'' said Els of his 6-iron from 184 yards that set up his
final birdie of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Though Flesch (seven birdies, two bogeys) also had put up a 66
to share second and a flock of marquee names had great afternoons,
Els faced questions about only one lurking presence, Woods.
Fortunately, he is used to it, though he's more like The Big
Un-Easy when the tired subject comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play good enough, I'm probably going to play with
him,'' said Els, who was trying to enjoy his 65. ``So let's leave
it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite true _ at least not for Round 2, because Els goes out
early, Woods tees off late. The luck of the draw has another chance
to get involved.

 &HT;    Els is one shot up on Tiger
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Ernie Els has been saying golf needs
someone to take on Tiger Woods. Someone like, say, him.
</P>
<P>
   Els positioned himself for another run at Woods with a
six-under-par 66 Thursday to take the first-round lead in the 129th
British Open. Els led Woods and Steve Flesch by a shot on a day
when a lack of wind made the Old Course a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   Els has had perhaps the best view of Woods' dominance this year,
losing in a brilliant playoff with Woods at the Mercedes
Championships. Moreover, Els is coming off consecutive runner-up
finishes in the past two majors, though he was a distant 15 shots
back in last month's U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Els was more content to let his clubs do the talking Thursday
when asked about whether he can be the man to take on Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I play good enough, I can play with him,'' Els said.
``Let's just leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the subject, Els got testy and said: ``I just shot
66, guys. Let's talk about me. Get on the phone with Tiger if you
want to talk about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Alrighty.
</P>
<P>
   Els' best statement came on the devilish 17th hole when he hit a
6-iron from 184 yards to 8 feet. He made the putt to take the lead
on a hole that yielded just four birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who can become the youngest player (24) to complete the
career grand slam with a victory here, didn't make much noise early
as he struggled for pars on the first eight holes. But almost on
command, he had five birdies in a seven-hole stretch to do all the
day's damage.
</P>
<P>
   That's how dominant Woods has become: Even when he doesn't have
a so-called ``A game,'' he finds himself within a shot of the lead
at a major. Not that Woods was worried, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long championship,'' he said. ``Seventy-two holes. If
it was an 18-hole tournament, I would have been in trouble. Any
time you start a major with eight straight pars, I don't care what
major that is, I'll take that start.''
</P>
<P>
   Flesch is trying to become just the second left-hander to win a
major (the other was Palm Beach Gardens resident Bob Charles, who
won the 1967 British Open). But Flesch was more impressed with the
company he was keeping Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're around him (Woods), you know something is going
right,'' Flesch said. ``But you can't worry about him. If you do
that, you're going to make bogeys so fast you're going to be home
watching everyone else play.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven players tied for fourth, two shots back, constituted
quite an eclectic group. They were Sergio Garcia, who was supposed
to be Woods' chief rival after he finished second in last year's
PGA Championship; fellow Ryder Cuppers Tom Lehman and Padraig
Harrington; rising Japanese star Shigeki Maruyama; first-round
Masters leader Dennis Paulson; Florida native Scott Dunlap; and a
player Woods had never heard of _ Ian Garbutt.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's 68 was noteworthy because it represented a 21-shot
improvement over the 89 he shot in last year's British Open at
Carnoustie. The Spaniard added an 83 to finish at the bottom of the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be something to go from last to first, wouldn't
it?'' Garcia said. ``Twenty-one shots isn't that big of a
difference, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Garbutt was the lone player to get to seven under (after 12
holes), but he bogeyed three of his final six holes. Still, that
was an unexpected showing for the 28-year-old Englishman who has
made just eight-of-20 cuts on the PGA European Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a funny year for me because I'm normally
consistent,'' Garbutt said. ``But it was nice to look up on the
leader board and see I was on top of names like Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's other big development regarded the rare combination of
little wind and warm, sunny skies at St. Andrews. That enabled 50
players to break par and the field to average 73.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was the big story today,'' Lehman said. ``The
course played as easy as it's going to play. She doesn't have much
of a defense without the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, Flesch and Garcia were the only players among the top 10
who played Thursday afternoon, which should bode well for them when
they go out this morning. But sooner or later, Els knows he'll have
to deal with a force as irresistible as the weather if he wants to
add another major to his two U.S. Open titles.
</P>
<P>
   Els wasn't about to guarantee a victory, but he's confident he
won't need binoculars to find Woods by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he beats me by 15 from now,'' Els said, ``there should be
an inquiry.''

 &HT;    Forest consortium locating in Atlanta

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta will be home to a business-to-business
Internet venture being created by the country's largest forest
products companies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Georgia-Pacific Corp. teamed with its two
largest rivals, International Paper and Weyerhaeuser Co., to form
an electronic trading post for pulp, paper and wood products. The
partners said Thursday they had picked a headquarters and a name,
forestexpress.com.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people will be hired in the next several months, and
the company is looking at office space north of the Perimeter, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Forestexpress.com, designed to cut costs by making ordering
easier for business customers and suppliers, said it raised $51
million for the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Four other companies _ Boise Cascade, Louisiana-Pacific, Mead
and Willamette _ recently joined as strategic partners.

   So guess who's gonna have to work together? Tonight's pilot
takes its time setting up its premise. In the meantime, it concerns
itself with Delgado's run-ins with a homeless woman and an abusive
couple and their son, as well as Stowe's insistence that a woman at
risk for ovarian cancer take preventive measures, when all the
woman wants is to have a child.
</P>
<P>
   It's all melodrama of the sort we've seen on ``ER'' or any other
recent medical drama. Hollywood Square Whoopi Goldberg, one of the
show's executive producers, appears as a kindly doctor in a
glorified cameo reminiscent of the easy paycheck she picked up for
her nothing role in ``Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong Medicine's'' premise isn't fatally flawed, but it is
awfully familiar, and other dramatic elements will no doubt need to
be added to maintain viewer interest.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QL; 
The show: ``Strong Medicine.'' &QL; 
What: Drama about dissimilar doctors working together for a women's
free clinic. &QL; 
The stars: Janine Turner, Rosa Blasi, Whoopi Goldberg. &QL; 
Where: Lifetime. &QL; 
When: 9 p.m. Sundays.

 &HT;    Investors like Greenspan's softer stance
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. economy appears headed for a soft landing,
but it's not there yet, and still higher interest rates may be
needed to contain inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft landing'' is the term analysts apply to the Fed's goal of
slowing the economy from the 4 percent-plus annual rate of the last
four years to less than 3 percent, without a recession and while
holding inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   That's the logic behind the Fed's policy of raising its
short-term federal funds rate by a total of 1.75 percent since June
1999 to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Recent economic reports suggest that these rate increases have
begun to slow the economy, and Greenspan agreed in his semiannual
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``growth in household spending has slowed noticeably
this spring from the unusually rapid pace observed late in 1999 and
early this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time,'' he cautioned, ``inflation has picked
up _ even the core measures that do not include energy prices
directly.'' Despite his caution, Greenspan's comments were
considerably less threatening than they were in his February
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took that to mean the Fed's string of rate hikes is
nearing an end, if not over, igniting a buying rally that sent all
major stock market averages higher. Investor spirits also were
buoyed by stronger-than-expected IBM earnings and a rally in
financial and other rate-sensitive stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan sounded considerably less grumpy than we and most
investors had been expecting,'' Dain Rauscher senior economist
Vincent Boberski told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   But Bank One chief economist Diane Swonk said Greenspan ``left
himself completely open for (another rate hike in) August and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared testimony, Greenspan attributed the economic
slowing to a combination of factors: the spring stock market
correction, the ``rising debt burden of households,'' higher oil
prices and the fact that Americans may have bought all the houses,
new cars and other big-ticket items they need for now.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``even without the rise in interest rates, an
eventual leveling out or some tapering off of purchases of durable
goods and construction of single-family housing would be
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan reiterated his thesis that the economy's unexpected
strength comes from business investment in computers and
productivity-enhancing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem, he said, is that consumer demand for
goods and services _ fueled, in large part, by stock market wealth
_ has expanded faster than the economy's ability to produce those
goods and services, threatening inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The principal risk is that America's strong economy has created
a tight labor market that threatens to produce wage inflation if
businesses are forced to raise wages to attract the workers they
need. So far that hasn't happened, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the outlook for the economy this year is ``a
little stronger'' than anticipated in his February forecast. He
said it is likely to expand at a 4 percent to 4.5 percent annual
rate despite slower second-half growth.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 2001 growth rate is expected to moderate to 3.25
percent to 3.75 percent, with the unemployment rate likely staying
close to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's markets, the technology-loaded Nasdaq composite
jumped about 3 percent to pace the trading, while the blue-chip Dow
Jones industrial average rose 1.5 percent and the broader S&AMP;P 500
about 1 percent. Treasury yields also dipped as optimistic bond
traders cheered Greenspan's remarks.

SECRET STATUS EYES THE TOP FILLY SPOT
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Triple Tiara, New York's version of the Triple Crown for
fillies, reaches a climax at Belmont Park Saturday with the
$300,000 Coaching Club American Oaks at a 1 1/2 miles. For Secret
Status, the race presents a chance to clinch her claim to be
recognized as the nation's leading 3-year-old filly.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Status drew the outside post position Thursday when
entries were filed for the Oaks, but that seemed to be no problem
for a filly with her record, especially in a short field of seven.
She comes into the Oaks with six victories in 10 starts, and she
has run in the money nine times.
</P>
<P>
   She leaped to the head of this year's class by winning the
Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs by 6 3/4 lengths, and the Mother
Goose Stakes at Belmont, the second jewel of the Triple Tiara, by a
neck over Jostle, who will break from the No. 5 slot in Saturday's
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had some things to overcome in the Oaks, and she did,''
said Neil Howard, who trains Secret Status for her owner, Will
Farish. ``I think she settles a lot better around two turns. It's
been a maturity thing with her. The breeding says she should get
better with time.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret Status comes with stars in her breeding: She is a
daughter of A.P. Indy and a granddaughter of Seattle Slew and
Alydar. She also comes with a star jockey in the saddle: Pat Day,
who is riding her for the sixth straight time. Day also rode
Commendable in the Belmont Stakes at a 1 1/2 miles last month,
staying close to the pace before charging to the front to win in
the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pat riding,'' Howard said, ``you always feel like you
have an edge. My only concern, as with every other trainer, is
whether your horse can get a mile and a half. She's got the
pedigree to do it, but until she actually does it, the jury is
still out.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret Status did not run in the first race in the Triple Tiara
series, the Acorn, which was won by Finder's Fee. Winning two of
the three races should be good enough to propel her toward the
Alabama at Saratoga on Aug. 19. But few fillies in this country
have been asked to run a 1 1/2 miles, so the Oaks is a major
hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mother Goose, Secret Status got into a duel down the
stretch with Jostle, who had spun six furlongs in a snappy 1:09
4/5. And Jostle, owned by Fox Hill Farms, won three stakes last
year as a juvenile and the Black-Eyed Susan this year. In the
Mother Goose, she gamely tried to withstand the late rush by Secret
Status, who prevailed by the length of her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Mother Goose was her best race,'' said John
Servis, who trains Jostle. ``She never got a breather. When Secret
Status ran up to her, she dug in. She had every opportunity to
chuck it, and she didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Secret Status and Jostle, the field for the Oaks
includes John Peace's Sound of the West on the rail; Zoftig, who
lost the Ashland by a nose; Polly Jo, a New York-bred filly; Miss
Chief, a turf runner for Bill Mott and Jerry Bailey, and Resort,
trained by Shug McGaughey.
</P>
<P>
   The Coaching Club American Oaks will be run on the next-to-last
day of the Belmont meeting. Racing ends on Sunday before switching
north for the annual summertime season at Saratoga, starting next
Wednesday and continuing through Labor Day, Sept. 4. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE VALUE OF CLEAR BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When you drive east from Jerusalem today, and cross
the border from Israel into Palestinian-controlled Jericho, the
only armed policeman you are likely to see is an Israeli cop with a
radar gun, trying to catch Israelis speeding to the Palestinian
casino in Jericho _ where Israelis gamble away about $1 million a
day at Yasser Arafat's blackjack tables. (For now, Israel makes
microchips, the Palestinians make poker chips, and all the money
gets neatly recycled.)
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with another traffic story that happened here
Sunday. Four Israeli Egged buses were heading to the Israeli Jewish
settlement of Beit-El, near the Palestinian town of Nablus _ where
there has been two decades of tension between Jewish settlers and
Palestinians and the boundaries are still ambiguous. The Israeli
buses, which were picking up settlers to attend a protest rally
against Camp David, missed the turn for Beit-El by 50 meters and
ended up inside the Kalandia Palestinian refugee camp. The Israeli
buses were immediately pelted with stones by the Palestinian
refugees, three of the buses were set on fire and the drivers fled
into the fourth bus and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   What's the point? Simple: When you have a clear border between
rival peoples, when each community is secure in its own space, no
wrong turn is dangerous and the border can be easily erased by the
opportunities and demands of daily life. When you don't have a
clear border between people, when neither is secure in its own
space, the border is everywhere and any wrong turn can cost you
your life.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it is no accident that Israeli civilians today are
much more comfortable visiting the Palestinian areas that are
totally under Arafat's control than they are visiting the
Palestinian areas that Israel controls. Many Israelis will tell you
that they never go to the Arab districts of Jerusalem _ even though
the Israeli army today controls them all _ because they are afraid.
Yet so many Israelis drive each weekend to buy furniture in the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank village of Biddya that the traffic
flow to Biddya always makes the Israel radio traffic-jam report.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening in real life, and everyone here knows
it. And what the peace talks at Camp David are really about is how
to get the negotiations down from the mythic Jerusalem, and the
mythic Palestine _ where no one really lives and where no sharing
is possible _ into the real world, where everyone knows Jerusalem
is a multi-ethnic city, and where both sides know they won't be
able to take their shoes off and relax until the other is secure in
his own space.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the talks down to daily life is obviously hard.
Israelis will tell you that when the Arabs controlled all of East
Jerusalem, they did not share the Jewish holy sites with them, so
why should Israelis share now? Palestinians will tell you that even
if they get all of the West Bank back, they would still control
only about 22 percent of Mandatory Palestine and the Jews would
have all the rest, so how can they be expected to give up still
more territory? And what they will both tell you is that this is a
land where if you come home from negotiations with 98 percent of
what you set out for, someone will kill you for the 2 percent you
gave away.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, neither side has prepared its public for concessions.
While it may seem as if they have been talking about Jerusalem and
a Palestinian state for decades, they have just been talking to
themselves, repeating mantras. This is the first time they are
really talking concessions to the other. The real peace process,
the real divorce proceedings, just started _ and they still haven't
told the kids yet, their own peoples.
</P>
<P>
   But talking to both Israelis and Palestinians, it's clear that
the kids have an inkling of what's coming, and a majority are
ready. Deep down, both leaders sense that, which is why they don't
want to come home empty-handed. The leaders know that their people
know _ from their own lives _ that only when they share Jerusalem
and Israel-Palestine in some fair manner will both of them actually
be able to go everywhere in this remarkable land. And there is no
pleasure in owning a house where you can't stretch out and relax.
</P>
<P>
   These are the enduring truths of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. The only question is not if, but when, they will prevail.

A KEY TO THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER, THE TAU NEUTRINO IS DETECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
   What many physicists consider to be one of the last pieces of
the theoretical puzzle that explains the structure of matter has
been detected at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A international team of scientists will announce Friday that
they have detected the tau neutrino, considered to be the most
elusive member of nature's most ghostly family of particles, the
neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   The team of 54 physicists from institutions in the United
States, Japan, South Korea and Greece used the world's most
powerful particle accelerator, Fermilab's Tevatron, to fire an
estimated 100 trillion tau neutrinos into an advanced emulsion
similar to photographic film.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those neutrinos produced minute but clearly recognizable
streaks in the emulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Although their existence had been suspected for 25 years, tau
neutrinos had escaped detection because it takes a large amount of
energy to create them and because neutrinos pass through most
matter almost without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been accepted that this guy exists,'' said Regina
Rameika, a physicist at Fermilab and a member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrinos are particles _ with no electrical charge and probably
little mass _ that rarely interact with other matter. They are
created by some of the most basic physical processes of the
universe, such as the decay of radioactive elements and fusion
reactions that power the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the tau neutrino remained one of two major undetected
particles in the vast theoretical structure called the standard
model of particle physics. The theory describes the properties of
all the known building blocks of matter, from quarks, protons,
neutrons and electrons to the neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining unseen particle, called the Higgs boson, is
considered a linchpin of the entire structure. The new finding
clears the way for a race between Fermilab and a European
laboratory, CERN, to detect the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Langacker, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania
who was not part of the group, called the neutrino experiment
``very subtle and difficult'' and said that as recently as five
years ago, many physicists believed that such a detection of the
tau neutrino would be all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining piece of the standard model itself is the Higgs
particle,'' Langacker said. ``There are strong indirect indications
that it is right around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is also a step toward clearing up some of the
remaining mysteries concerning neutrinos themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to the standard model, neutrinos have no mass. But two
years ago, a Japanese experiment called Super-Kamiokande found
evidence that neutrinos do have at least a small mass, without
determining what that mass is.
</P>
<P>
   So the detection of the tau neutrino was a crucial prerequisite
for planned experiments at Fermilab and CERN to help determine the
mass of the neutrino.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments involve shooting beams of neutrinos hundreds of
miles underground to distant detectors to see if one type of
neutrino changes into another en route. According to advanced
theories, any such transmutation would be an indication of the
mass.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the value of the mass could help settle several cosmic
mysteries, including how much swarms of neutrinos in space might
contribute to the weight of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to make tau neutrinos and detect them directly is
going to be very important in this whole new world of neutrino
physics,'' said Martin L. Perl, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
</P>
<P>
   The physicist Wolfgang Pauli first postulated the existence of
neutrinos in the 1930s to account for energy and momentum that
seemed to vanish during the radioactive decay of various elements.
So weakly do the particles interact with matter that physicists had
to wait nearly 30 years for the first detection of any neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   The first two types of neutrinos to be seen are closely
associated with electrons and muons, much less bizarre particles
that are grouped in a classification called leptons within the
standard model. Leptons are a class of particles that do not
interact strongly with matter.
</P>
<P>
   So when Perl and colleagues discovered a new lepton, called the
tau particle, in 1975, they assumed that the electron neutrino and
muon neutrino would soon have company.
</P>
<P>
   But making a tau neutrino requires first making a tau particle _
and because it is much more massive than the other leptons, that
requires an accelerator with much greater energies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neutrino experiments are very difficult to begin with,'' said
Roger Rusack, a physicist at the University of Minnesota who is a
member of the team, ``and we're looking at a neutrino that's very
hard to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The team did produce them in bulk by smashing protons
accelerated to nearly the speed of light at the Tevatron into
tungsten. Tau particles created in the maelstrom decayed into tau
neutrinos, which streamed through thick layers of shielding that
blocked most other particles and reached the emulsions.
</P>
<P>
   There, very rarely, a tau neutrino collided with an atomic
nucleus and produced other particles, including a tau particle,
that left a characteristic, kinked trail in the emulsion. The
crucial part of that trail was only about a millimeter long, and
the technique for finding such subtle features was developed at
Nagoya University in Japan, one of the partners in the experiment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It means that we've finally seen the interactions from the tau
neutrino, which was assumed to exist in 1975,'' said Byron
Lundberg, the Fermilab physicist who, with Vittorio Paolone of the
University of Pittsburgh, is a spokesman for the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   David O. Caldwell, a physicist at the University of California
in Santa Barbara, said that it would have been ``an incredible
surprise'' if the tau particle did not have its own neutrino, as
the electron and the muon do.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that some speculative theories beyond the standard
model postulate yet another neutrino _ a so-called sterile neutrino
that would be associated with no other particle _ and that it was
important to confirm the existence of tau neutrinos before
physicists ranged further afield.
</P>
<P>
   Particle physicists are likely to turn their immediate attention
to the search for the Higgs boson. The first experiments with a
chance of finding it are scheduled to begin next spring at
Fermilab's Tevatron. If the particle is not seen there, it could
turn up at a much more powerful accelerator called the Large Hadron
Collider, which should begin operation at CERN in 2005 or 2006.

BNSF, CANADIAN NATIONAL OFFICIALLY JUNK MERGER PLANS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By DAN PILLER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Canadian
National railroads officially scrapped plans for a $5.8 billion
merger on Thursday, saying regulatory delays of more than two years
are not worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the two railroads said their decision was
predicated on concern for stockholders, who have seen the value of
their shares drop since the merger was proposed last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``BNSF and CN are shareholder-driven organizations,'' said
Robert Krebs, chairman of Fort Worth-based BNSF. ``We have
concluded that it is not in the best interests of our shareholders
to assume the risks of waiting up to 2 1/2 years for a decision by
regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger would have created a 50,000-mile railroad system
connecting BNSF's network in the western U.S. with Canadian
National's system extending from Chicago to Halifax on the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes a week after a federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C., upheld a 15-month moratorium on merger
applications imposed in March by the U.S. Surface Transportation
Board.
</P>
<P>
   When that ruling was released, analysts speculated that the deal
was dead. Because mergers take 18 months by law to be decided by
regulators, the delay in filing a merger plan until next summer
would push back the effective date of any merger approval into late
2002.
</P>
<P>
   CN chairman Paul Tellier said from company headquarters in
Montreal that ``the delay and uncertainty caused by the moratorium
and proposed rulemaking made it impossible for us to continue with
our combination efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies stressed on Thursday that they won't have to pay
breakup fees because ``the companies have mutually agreed to unwind
their transaction.'' The original agreement called for payments of
$350 million by BNSF and $150 million by CN if either pulled out of
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate headquarters for the newly merged North American
Railways would have been located in Montreal, but the operations
center would have remained in Fort Worth. Matthew Rose, BNSF
president, would have become chief operating officer of the new
entity. Rose was named on Thursday to the BNSF board.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs said earlier this year that he would likely retire after
the merger was completed. The BNSF chairman was not available for
comment beyond his written statement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The merger had attracted widespread opposition from rival
railroads and shipping groups. The STB said it needed more time to
study all railroad mergers in light of serious service problems
following the last two mergers, the combination of Union Pacific
and Southern Pacific in 1997 and the collaborative breakup of
Conrail last year by Norfolk Southern and CSX.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors had gotten scared of these big mergers because of
the previous problems,'' said Tom Burnett of Merger Insight, a New
York-based investment firm that follows major mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulators had made it clear that this was a merger
proposal that was going down the wrong track,'' Burnett added.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's announcement, following a BNSF board meeting, was
made after the stock markets had closed. BNSF shares closed at
$24.75 a share, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs had contended that because the 1995 merger of Burlington
Northern and Santa Fe which created BNSF had gone relatively
smoothly, his company deserved the chance to enter another merger.
</P>
<P>
   The two railroads had sued the STB in federal court, arguing
that the moratorium violated federal laws requiring prompt action
on mergers. But in a two-to-one decision last Friday, a federal
appeals court upheld the STB's right to impose a moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Rival railroads warned that approval of the BNSF-CN merger would
touch off other big mergers that would reduce competition. And
major shippers joined the opposition, led by chemical manufacturers
who were hurt badly by traffic tieups after the Union
Pacific-Southern Pacific merger.
</P>
<P>
   BNSF did not enter into the CN merger out of financial
necessity. The company earned $238 million on revenues of $2.19
billion last year. The company is the nation's largest hauler of
coal and grain, and has greatly expanded its trailer-on-flatcar, or
intermodal, service in recent years. BNSF also is a major hauler of
new automobiles, with many of them shipped through its operation at
Alliance Airport north of Fort Worth.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said
Thursday that there is not yet enough evidence to conclude that the
economy has slowed to a non-inflationary pace, and he left the door
open to further interest rate increases as soon as next month.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan
delivered an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand assessment of the
economic outlook, noting clear signs of slowing in recent months
but warning that growth could rebound and that inflation by some
measures appears to be creeping up.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertainties, Greenspan said, it was ``much too soon
to conclude'' that the threat of a destabilizing surge in prices
and wages had receded. His remarks suggested that Fed officials
will continue to focus on incoming economic data before deciding
whether to raise short-term interest rates again at their next
meeting, on August 22.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that the economy is still characterized by a
combination of steady growth, low unemployment and an expanding
trade deficit, he said the Fed would ``need to be alert to the
risks that high levels of resource utilization may put upward
pressure on inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he kept his options open, Greenspan indicated that
he saw no need for a prolonged series of rate increases that might
leave the economy flirting with recession. Asked if achieving price
stability would require the Fed to drive the unemployment rate up
toward five percent from its current level of 4.0 percent,
Greenspan said he did not think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the evidence indicating that we need to raise the
unemployment rate to stabilize prices is unpersuasive,'' he said.
He quickly added, however, that he was not sure and the issue is
the subject of considerable debate among economists and Fed
officials.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the steam having gone out of Wall Street during the
winter and spring, Greenspan hardly mentioned the stock market,
which he had singled out early this year as a prime source of the
imbalances in the economy that could lead to higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, perhaps being over-optimistic but apparently relieved
that Greenspan had not explicitly called for higher interest rates,
sent stock prices up. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 147.79
for the day to finish at 10,843.87. The Nasdaq composite closed at
4,184.56, up 128.93.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was relief in the markets because he said nothing very
severe in terms of future rate increases,'' said Richard J.
DeKaser, chief economist at National City Bank in Cleveland. ``But
in terms of what he actually said, he left his options completely
open.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The central bank has raised its benchmark short-term interest
rate by 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent, in six steps over
the last year. After growing at a torrid pace earlier this year,
the economy has cooled off considerably, but the Fed has left the
financial markets guessing whether the slowdown has been sufficient
for it to declare an end to this cycle of interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   If analysts and investors were hoping for a clear answer from
Greenspan Thursday, they were disappointed. Because his testimony
was intended to reflect the thinking of the Fed's entire policy
making committee, what they got instead was a glimpse at the debate
within the central bank about the economy's path and how many more
rate hikes, if any, it would take to squelch the emerging
inflationary pressures and assure the continuance of the long
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in general and consumer spending in particular have
``slowed noticeably this spring from the unusually rapid pace
observed late in 1999 and early this year,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   From one perspective, he said, it would be a mistake to put too
much stock in the slowdown, since previous episodes of cooling
during this business cycle have been followed by sharp
accelerations in growth. But from another viewpoint, he said, there
are bits of evidence that this slowdown could be longer lasting.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is no longer rising at a rate that will lead
consumers to spend freely. Households are burdened by rising debt
levels. Higher oil prices are putting the brakes on the entire
economy. And after buying homes, cars, refrigerators and other
big-ticket items at a prodigious pace for the past several years,
consumers could be expected to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not say which camp he puts himself in. But he said
that the real question might prove to be what happens to the
economy's improving efficiency if the slowdown proves to be real,
and on that score he gave an optimistic assessment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, slowdowns in growth were often accompanied by a
falloff in the growth rate of productivity, or output per hour of
work. As productivity drops, inflation tends to rise, putting
pressure on the Fed to continue raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   But if productivity growth should remain strong as the economy
slows, it would help keep inflation in check, giving the Fed more
leeway to hold rates down. Greenspan said the evidence is that
productivity is holding up well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far there is little evidence to undermine the notion that
most of the productivity increase of recent years has been
structural and that structural productivity may still be
accelerating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan appeared before the banking committee under an
agreement that calls for the Fed to continue reporting twice a year
to Congress on monetary policy despite the expiration of a legal
requirement to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The written report he submitted Thursday forecast a slowdown in
growth this year from the 5.4 percent annual pace of the first
quarter, with gross domestic product for the year projected to run
at 4 to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also included a more pessimistic inflation
forecast than the Fed had provided to Congress in its last report,
in February. It projected that inflation this year would run at a
2.5 percent to 2.75 percent rate, compared with 1.75 percent to 2
percent under the old projection. Although the report said
inflation would decline to 2 to 2.5 percent next year, it warned
that at those projected levels inflation would have edged up from
where it was in 1997 and 1998, when it was consistently under 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a trend, were it not to show signs of quickly stabilizing
or reversing, would pose a considerable risk to the continuation of
the extraordinary economic performance of recent years,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fielding questions from senators, Greenspan repeated his call
for Congress and the Clinton administration to use the federal
budget surplus for debt reduction rather than for tax cuts or
spending increases. The surplus, he said, provides an important
buffer should the economy run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the health of the banking system and its ability to
weather a recession, Greenspan said the system could ``resist
fairly significant economic disruption without a major problem,''
although he said he was concerned that some banks have grown too
lax in assessing credit risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman said he was concerned about the expansion of
the trade and current account deficits. But he said the United
States had not had any problem financing those deficits with
investment from abroad because the country offered higher rates of
return than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, he criticized legislation sponsored
by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., that would link China's access to
U.S. capital markets to the Chinese government's record on the
spread of weapons and weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he said, the legislation would be ineffective
because capital markets essentially operate without borders and if
Chinese companies were unable to raise money in New York, they
would be able to borrow in dollars in London or Paris.

 &HT;    UT scholars develop use for junk genes
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _Researchers at the University of Texas have
turned seemingly useless, or junk, DNA into a gene-delivery vehicle
that might one day be used in gene therapy and genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   If the scientists succeed in making their discovery work in
humans, the implications could be enormous. The process could be
used to knock out AIDS, cancer and other diseases. The military
could use it to protect soldiers from biological weapons. And wine
producers could tap into the technique to engineer a better grape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a novel way of manipulating DNA ... in a way that hasn't
been done before,'' said UT professor Alan Lambowitz, director of
UT's Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology and a lead
researcher in the discovery being published today in the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   The work comes as scientists finish mapping the human genome _
the 3 billion base pairs of DNA and the 80,000 to 100,000 genes
that make human beings what they are. Though scientists now know
the locations of most genes, the genes' functions are largely
unknown. Lambowitz and his colleagues said they expect their work
to produce a greater understanding of how genes work.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle they discovered could be used to turn off a bad
gene, such as a cancer-causing gene, or to introduce a helpful one,
such as a tumor-suppressing gene, into the body, Lambowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   But manipulating genes also is controversial. That's partly
because the same kind of genetic manipulation that could cure
diseases could also cause them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can always turn technology around to be destructive,''
said Marlene Belfort, director of genetics at the Wadsworth Center
at the New York State Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, the research is an important first step that
could lead to potentially life-saving therapies. ``I think it's
lovely,'' said Belfort, a member of the prestigious National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   There are obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists have not yet proven that their pioneering
procedure will work with human chromosomes. That might take another
year to demonstrate, Lambowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has a lot of potential,'' said Dr. HaigKazazian,
chairman of the genetics department at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine. But ``don't blow it up too much,''
he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early, Kazazian said, to predict what might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Lambowitz is cautious but optimistic. He already has created a
company to commercialize the technology and has five patents.
Others are pending. He shares the existing patents with other
inventors and Ohio State University, where he worked before coming
to UT in 1997. UT will share in the new patents.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Lambowitz's graduate students, Michael Karberg and Huatao
Guo, who recently earned his doctorate, also authored the Science
paper, as did Duke researchers Meredith Long, J.P. Jones III and
Bruce Sullenger.
</P>
<P>
   What they describe in the Science article is a method to convert
junk DNA from bacteria in the laboratory into a vehicle that can be
used to introduce genes or disrupt specific genes in human cells.
The cells in the experiment are outside the body, floating in a
culture dish. The researchers used the same procedure to target DNA
_ the material in cells that have the genetic instructions for
making living organisms _ in bacteria they wanted to manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, scientists could not steer genes, which are pieces of
DNA, to a specific site. Other procedures for introducing genetic
material into cells did not work well because the vehicles insert
randomly and can be dangerous if they disrupt the wrong genes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``magic bullets,'' as Karberg called them, are group II
introns, or junk DNA, found in bacterial cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think group II introns are ancestors to human introns,''
Guo said.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of the DNA in humans is believed to be junk,
Lambowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For gene therapy or genetic engineering, what you're trying to
do is create an organism with a specific gene function,'' Lambowitz
said. ``You also can insert something into a harmful gene or virus,
causing it not to function.''
</P>
<P>
   If the scientists succeed in making the process work with human
chromosomes in the lab, they will move to human trials. Lambowitz
and his colleagues will work on HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to remove T-cells from HIV patients, put the cells in
a laboratory dish, modify them so they are resistant to the virus
and reintroduce the cells into the body. That would produce a
healthy population of T-cells, the ones that get wiped out by HIV.
If it works, the HIV should not develop into full-blown,
potentially deadly AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a reasonable shot of working, but it hasn't worked
yet,'' Lambowitz said. ``I don't want to encourage someone that
there will be a cure for AIDS in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambowitz has been working on some form of the research since
1993, while he was still a professor at Ohio State. The concept of
targeting genes with junk DNA was born in 1997, and the
possibilities of what could be done have escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just limited to humans,'' Karberg said. ``We can
work with people's pets, too.''

BOTH SIDES TAKE DAY TO CATCH THEIR BREATHS AND REASSESS POSITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ With President Clinton's departure for Japan,
the energy drained from the Israeli-Palestinin peace summit on
Thursday as the exhausted delegations slept late and then worked
with the American team to determine how to move beyond the impasse
and the mutual accusations of bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Squirreled away in their cabins in the woods, the Israelis and
the Palestinians tried to recover from the roller-coaster drama of
late Wednesday night when, within the span of an hour and a half,
the summit died and was reborn.
</P>
<P>
   After teetering on the edge of a collapsed peace process, and
contemplating an uncertain future with the potential for renewed
violence, they voluntarily returned on Thursday afternoon to the
same stumbling blocks, the same frustrations, the same elusive
prospects for a final accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis said that they remained at Camp David, unpacking
their bags and reclaiming their golf carts, only because Clinton
had asked that they stay until his return on Sunday or Monday.
``When the president asks, you can't say no,'' a senior Israeli
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Israeli official said that the president made the
request after the White House announced that the talks were over.
He said the Israelis believed that the announcement at 11 p.m. on
Wednesday night was a gambit meant to provoke some eleventh-hour
decision-making. And when no decisions were provoked, the Israeli
said, Clinton decided to prolong the summit.
</P>
<P>
   American officials contest this account, saying that Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel took the initiative and, facing a
return home empty-handed, asked that the negotiations continue.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said that Shlomo Ben Ami, a popular Labor Party
politician and an effective negotiator, helped talk Barak into
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, however, Israeli officials said on Thursday, on the
10th day of the summit, that they did not see anything left to
discuss. They said they were awaiting answers from the
Palestinians, who, they claim, have hedged their responses to
American compromise proposals on most issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is now in Arafat's court,'' Yitzhak Herzog, the
Israeli Cabinet secretary, said in an interview referring to the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. ``My uncle Abba Eban once said
the Palestinians never miss a chance to miss a chance, and I hope
and pray for all our children that they don't miss this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials denied the Israelis' interpretation of
where things stood, saying the Israelis were simply trying to
portray themselves as flexible and the other side as intransigent.
It was the Israelis who wanted to leave, they said, and they wh
wanted to remain so as to leave no stone unturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be held responsible for the failure of the
talks,'' said Samir Ghousheh, a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's executive committee. ``If we hang tough, it will
become clear that it is the Israeli side that is insincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians believe that the Americans are permanently
biased toward Israel, even if Clinton himself has diligently
nurtured a relationship with Mr. Arafat, and they contend that the
summit is inherently built to disfavor them.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, they say, has the ultimate power to say no, but, after
seven years of building an international consensus for a
Palestinian state, he wants to reserve that power so as not to
endanger what he has created.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried about the failure of the summit,'' said
Sulaiman al-Najjab, a member of the PLO executive committee. ``We
are worried, too, about the bias of the United States. Any failure
will be as a result of such bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of pressuring Israel to respect international
resolutions, they are pressuring us to make more concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``So far, the American and Israeli proposals haven't
met our expectations, but we must keep trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television, reflecting its delegation's line, reported
that the Israeli delegates would be ``resting'' until Clinton
returns from the Group of Eight meeting in Japan to try to persuade
the parties to end their 52 years of bitter conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said the delegations would do more than
rest; they would return to the tables to tackle once more the
division of the West Bank, the future of Jewish settlements, the
fate of Palestinian refugees and the thorniest issue, the status of
Jerusalem. Indeed, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held long
meetings with both leaders on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Day 10, and the success is that they're still
talking,'' Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said on
Thursday.

</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the peace camp and the members of the silent majority
that supports peace voiced relief that Barak had decided to stay at
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Rightist leaders expressed anxiety about the concessions that
Barak seemed prepared to make turning over Palestinian
neighborhoods in Jerusalem to Palestinian control, for instance, as
well as any that might go even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak has set a dangerous precedent,'' Ariel Sharon, leader of
the Likud Party, said in a television interview. ``We'll have to
work hard to reverse the decisions he made in the last nine days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, a number of Palestinians said they were
relieved that the talks were continuing because they fear a
disintegration of the region into chaos and violence.
</P>
<P>
   And several analysts in the Arab world said that while they were
heartened that substantive talks had taken place, they believed
that the stumbling blocks _ particularly, the disagreement over
Jerusalem _ might be insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the outcome of this summit is zero,'' Abdel
Barri Utwan, editor of a London-based Arabic newspaper, said in an
interview on al-Jazeera satellite television. ``They wouldn't keep
going for nine days if there was no understanding. Maybe there are
some unresolved details on Jerusalem. Nevertheless, these details
have the power to destroy the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat reportedly told the Americans that he does not believe
that he has a formal mandate from the Arab and Muslim world to
recognize the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem and cede
sovereignty forever. That kind of recognition is what Israel is
seeking, in exchange for giving the Palestinians control over
Palestinian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat has to worry not only about his constituency at home,
but his constituency in the Arab world as a whole,'' said a senior
Western diplomat in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid what is seeming like an irresolvable issue and a
potential deal-breaker, the Americans have crafted a draft
agreement that leaves the issue to the side but still pronounces an
end to the conflict, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   But both the Israelis and the Palestinians are extremely
reluctant to back a partial deal.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the news blackout, it is impossible to know precisely
what is on the table. But, at its core, analysts and diplomats in
contact with the parties believe that an accord would establish a
demilitarized Palestinian state on about 90 to 95 percent of the
West Bank, with the rest being annexed to Israel. The territory
would be transferred gradually to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials acknowledge that Barak has gradually
agreed to give more and more land, from a starting point of 50
percent of the West Bank. But they say it is hard to talk about
land without talking about Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials argue that the Palestinians should not reject
what the Israelis consider a generous offer that goes beyond what
any politician who comes after Barak would be prepared to make. A
rightist politician, they say, would never contemplate it, and
those doves who are Barak's political rivals do not have the his
security credentials, as a career general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to think history will judge the Palestinians harshly if
they miss the Barak moment,'' said David Makovsky, a senior fellow
at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has chronicled
the peace effort for the last decade. ``I don't think they'll find
a more accommodating Israeli leader, or one with equal clout. I
think he's Israel's DeGaulle and this is the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   An American official, however, said that a letter Barak sent to
Clinton on Wednesday revealed an imperiousness that would serve to
rally the Arab world around Arafat. In the letter, Barak said that
the Palestinians were negotiating in bad faith.

HOW MUCH IS THAT LADY IN THE WINDOW? TIPS BY AMSTERDAM POLICE COVER
CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Foreign Journal) (ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic
clients. Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling
888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM _ Rule No. 1, according to the new police guide for
tourists to Amsterdam's red-light district, is: Have FUN, but act
in a NORMAL manner. _ Tolerant. Within limits. How very Dutch. _
Rule No. 6: PROSTITUTION. No pictures of the women. _ Rule No. 8:
Soft drugs, NOT UNDER 18. _ And No. 10: Parking is NOT FREE.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brochure is NORMAL,'' insisted Superintendent Klaas
Wilting, chief police spokesman, who must have repeated the word
``normal'' 30 times in an hour-long conversation about the brief
brochure. He denied that the police felt defensive about publishing
it. But he was distinctly irked that the FOREIGN press had taken
such an interest. Here we go again, he implied: the old stereotype
of Amsterdam as SIN CITY.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the guide is fairly subdued. Most of it is the kind of
common-sense advice dished out by the police everywhere: Watch out
for pickpockets; don't play balletje (Amsterdam's three-card
monte); resist those drunken impulses to take off all your clothes
and jump into the canals. (Well, OK, it's not all normal.)
</P>
<P>
   And although it contains a map, it is not a guide, per se. It
doesn't say which ``coffee shops'' sell the best marijuana, which
live-sex shows are liveliest or which bordellos have the prettiest
women.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is virtually impossible to find such information in
print here. Most tourist guides to the Netherlands devote pages to
the Vermeers in the Rijksmuseum, but scant sentences to the
red-light district, even though it is unlikely the Vermeers get 5
million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the most common inquiry at the Amsterdam Tourist
Service on Damrak Street?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the red-light district?'' answered Djawehly
Pelupessy, who works behind the counter. ``They blush, we tell
them, then they walk away fast. They're shy. They don't want to
admit they want to see the women in the windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Toine Rodenburg, who manages the Banana Bar, the Erotic Museum,
Theater Casa Rosso and other district landmarks, accuses the city
of being ``ambivalent or even hypocritical'' toward the reality
that sex lures far more visitors than culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take the taxes without saying thank you,'' he complained.
``They put up signs everywhere saying `Rijksmuseum' or `Anne Frank
House,' but there's only one for the red-light district, like it's
something horrible. As if Amsterdam was all about tulips and wooden
shoes. It's not. It's about freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   If it seems hard to tell whether the guide was written by a
police officer or by a fed-up resident, it is because the answer to
both questions is yes. The author, Officer Willem Schild, has
patrolled this libertarian Arcadia for 12 years and, like
Rodenburg, lives there. ``That's me on the cover,'' he said
proudly, pointing to the grinning policeman on a motorbike beside
an Erotic Museum sign.
</P>
<P>
   The guide reflects neighborhood thinking, repeated by everyone
from Schild to Erik Blom, a law student who sells tickets to the
Moulin Rouge show, to Theodoor van Boven, founder of the Condomerie
condom boutique. If the district has a problem, they say, it is not
the law-abiding women sitting in pink windows wearing only fetching
smiles and eye-popping underwear. Nor is it the mellowed-out
hashish dealers who sit giggling with their coffee shop customers,
debating which of Bob Marley's tunes was his chef-d'oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, if there is a problem in this district of 300-year-old
gabled buildings and expensive real estate housing doctors, lawyers
and plenty of families, it is the street drug dealers who sell
heroin _ or cough drops ground up to look like heroin _ and those
tourists, American spring break kids or English stag party louts
who jump into the canals, howl their drunken lungs out at 4 a.m.
and punch each other silly.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really minds the middle-class tour groups that fill the
sex shows in theaters that are cleaner and better lighted than many
off-Broadway houses. Rodenburg seems to revel in the groups _ often
featuring blue-rinse grandmothers and other unexpected spectators _
that flock to his Theater Casa Rosso. By prior arrangement with
tour guides, he confided, the loudest-mouthed man in each group is
the person selected by a leather-clad lady with whips to join her
on stage _ to his embarrassment and the general hilarity of his
fellow tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Wilting's guide seems to be written in the same spirit of
tolerance for human indulgence, while noting that despite popular
notions about Amsterdam, the place does have rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cocaine, heroin, LSD, ecstasy, etc. are strictly forbidden,''
the guide notes. ``These drugs are always FAKE. (Washing powder,
sugar, rat poison, vitamin C.) On top of that, you may be forced to
hand over your wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   A small amount of marijuana for personal use can legally be
consumed in a coffee shop, the leaflet says, adding, ``When you
feel sick after smoking, or eating space cake, drink lots of water
with sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a discreet hint about prostitutes: ``If you visit
one of the women, we would like to remind you they are not always
women.''
</P>
<P>
   But, here too, the guide demands decorum: ``Don't shout or use
bad language toward these women. SHOW SOME RESPECT.''
</P>
<P>
   That section was the most heavily edited by the department,
Officer Schild said. He had advised tourists that the women charge
$25 to $50 for 20 minutes, paid in advance. ``So make a clear deal
at the door and don't be too drunk to get things done,'' he had
written. ``Time is money for the ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   The department felt that was a bit TOO helpful, he said,
although his precinct house's biggest headaches are frustrated
drunks who get angry.
</P>
<P>
   All the women have alarm buttons, and the police then have to
run or bicycle over to sort out the fight.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a warning about ``smart shops,'' which sell herbs
that supposedly boost intelligence or virility, along with
hallucinatory psilocybin mushrooms, which can mix badly with
alcohol. ``People think they're eagles and try to fly out of their
hotel rooms,'' Schild said. But the department is trying to ban
smart shops, which also sell drug paraphernalia, so it did not want
them included.
</P>
<P>
   Schild said he got to put in 95 percent of what he had hoped
for, and takes the pamphlet around himself to bars and restaurants
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Netherlands,'' noted Wilting, ``we talk about the
problems. We don't put them away.''

 &HT;    Hotels catering to tech-savvy travelers
 &HT;    By Robert W. Gee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts Inc. purchased the
partly renovated Stephen F. Austin Hotel in January, the company
made sure of one thing: that the 1924 building be wired and fitted
with the latest communication technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The historic hotel at Seventh Street and Congress Avenue
reopened in May as the most technologically advanced among the
company's 41 upscale Inter-Continental hotels in the Western
Hemisphere. All guest rooms and four meeting rooms boast T1
high-speed Internet connections _ the standard in large
corporations, about 90 times faster than 56K modem _ and 250
direct-dial telephone numbers are rotated among the 189 rooms. Each
room is equipped with three telephones that provide voice and data
options. Guests can review charges and check out on the 29-inch
televisions in the rooms. Even the mini-bar is high tech: Infrared
sensors and pressure switches send messages down to the front desk
when an item is removed, and the guest is automatically charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to have an impact in a high-tech city, we have to
come with the best technology,'' says Manrique Rodriguez, general
manager of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, the Stephen F. Austin had no choice: To compete
for the tech-savvy business traveler visiting Austin, a hotel must
offer more than a pants press in the rooms and free shuttle service
to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of hotels, Austin is the most wired city in the
nation,'' says Brett Stewart, the co-founder and CEO of
Austin-based Wayport Inc., one of the leading Internet service
providers for hotels across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, at least 14 hotels advertise high-speed Internet access
in all guest rooms, and several others plan to offer the service in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the nation is quickly catching on. In a report
released this week by technology market research firm Cahners
In-Stat Group, 48.2 percent of more than 300 hotels surveyed
nationwide said they plan to install high-speed Internet access in
all rooms over the next year. Another 34.1 percent said they plan
to offer it within two years. That's compared to just five percent,
or about 1,400 hotels, that offer high-speed access today.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts predict that in three to four years, fast
Internet access will be found even in roadside motels.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the Four Seasons Hotel Austin and the Driskill Hotel,
have upped the ante. They offer fast wireless Internet access in
public areas _ the lobby, the bar, the restaurant, many of the
conference rooms, and at the Four Seasons, even the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons, as a test case for Wayport, was the first
hotel in the world to have a wireless Internet network, in 1997.
But only now do some guests come equipped with wireless Ethernet
cards that allow them to use the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way cool,'' says Richard Paine, advanced computing
technologist for The Boeing Co. in Seattle, who attended a meeting
at The Four Seasons three weeks ago where nearly all of the 225
attendees used the wireless network. ``This makes it much more
convenient because you're connected all the time. You don't have to
wait until you get to your room.''
</P>
<P>
   Paine said he used the connection during the conference,
sponsored by communications technology consortium The Open Group,
to log into Boeing's secure internal Web site and to check
corporate sites to verify information during presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Paine, who spends about half his time traveling around the
country and to Europe and Asia on business, said it was the first
time he used wireless Internet in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the latest technology offered in hotels was voice
mail. Now, at the Driskill, for example, WebTV with a wireless
keyboard is available for $9.95 a day. ``It's almost as if you're
outdated as soon as you put it in,'' Britt Meylan, conference
services director at the hotel, says of new technology. That's why
the hotel, midway through a major renovation last year, decided to
wire half the building with Category 7 cable, the latest in
high-speed networking, but more than the hotel needs for its
current T1 connections.
</P>
<P>
   NO LONGER 'LAGGARDS IN TECHNOLOGY' Technology is rapidly
changing the experience of staying in a hotel. A hotel in
Vancouver, British Columbia, features a remote bedside console that
can adjust the lighting and room temperature, illuminate the ``Do
Not Disturb'' sign and, in some rooms, open and close the window
drapes. Other hotels are testing new frequent traveler ID cards
that would serve as keycards and provide personalized access to a
WebTV unit. An upscale hotel set to open in New York next month is
secretly working out the kinks of a plan that would eliminate the
front desk and instead equip bell hops with Palm Pilots to check in
guests.
</P>
<P>
   This frenzy for the latest in high-tech is remarkable for
hoteliers, who ``historically have been laggards in technology,''
says John Paul Nichols, executive vice president for the hotel
division of Cendant Corp. The corporation is in the process of
wiring all 6,400 of its hotels _ eight brands that include Super 8,
Travel Lodge, Howard Johnson and Wingate Inn _ for high-speed
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adoption rate in the industry is exploding and a lot of
that is driven by the explosion of the Internet,'' Nichols says.
``If you've got it in your house, you've got it in work . . . you
better darn well have it in your hotel room.''
</P>
<P>
   Even landmark hotels like the 114-year-old Driskill Hotel in
Austin are finding that a historic renovation alone won't attract
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to stay in old hotels,'' says Jeff Trigger,
managing director of the Driskill. ``They love history and a sense
of place, but they want the modern world and all the amenities that
brings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Victorian hotel, however, presents technology in subtle
ways. In many cases, it's hard to tell it's even there. LCD
projectors are hidden in ceiling molding in the conference rooms
and, in one meeting room, a faux fireplace with a gilded-framed
mirror rolls to the side to make room for a pull-down screen for
PowerPoint presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business, we're constantly balancing the high-tech and
the high-touch world,'' Trigger said. ``Guests expect high-tech.
(But) we don't want that sort of in-your-face way of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD AGAIN, AND AGAIN Travelers like Dexter Henderson,
director of product introduction and deployment at Austin-based
Tivoli Systems Inc. have come to expect fast Internet connections
on the road. Henderson, who is away from the office for 10 days
every month, only stays at hotels with broadband access. He doesn't
have a wireless Ethernet card _ which costs about $200 _ but
figures it's only a matter of time. He uses the Internet in hotels
to load up different elements for multimedia presentations. ``You
can actually get a lot accomplished on the road,'' Henderson says.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more business is conducted over the Internet,
workers say without fast and ubiquitous access on the road, they
fall behind. The number of people who access the Internet while
traveling increased 190 percent over three years, to 85 million in
1999 from 29 million in 1996, according to a February report of the
Travel Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gorman, director of wireless programs at the Menlo Park,
Calif., office of The Open Group, lives on the Internet and
wireless networks when he is on the road, which is most of the
time. In Europe, where he has been traveling the past two weeks, he
is constantly connected by cellular phone. And in many places,
notably Scandinavia, he can connect to his company e-mail account
on his laptop through his cell phone. That sort of service will
slowly arrive to the United States, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will revolutionize travel,'' he said over his cell phone
during a cab ride to London Heathrow Airport, where he was catching
a plane to France.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Gorman settles for wireless access on his
laptop at the few hotels that offer the service and at some
airports, like Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, which last
month became the first airport in the nation to offer the service
in all public areas. Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
launched wireless service last week. Wayport installed wireless
Internet in those airports and is a big reason why Austin is one of
the most wired _ and wireless _ cities in the nation. The company
recently signed a contract to provide wireless service in Katz's
Deli &AMP; Bar and is courting other local eateries.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, chief executive at Wayport, sees a vast market for
wireless Internet in what he calls ``high-loiter retail,'' like
coffeehouses and bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, his biggest focus is hotels. Since the middle of
last year, Wayport has installed or has been contracted to install
high-speed Internet access in nearly 600 hotels. This month, the
company says it plans to install high-speed Internet access in 125
hotels, the most of any month.
</P>
<P>
   As hotels become bastions of high-tech, some in the industry are
left wondering if all of this technology will one day make hotels
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dominguez, director of sales and marketing at the
Sheraton Austin, has received rave reviews for the hotel's new
business conference center, wired for high-speed Internet access
and capable of hosting any kind of high-tech meeting. A local
company, Shield Networks LLC, is setting up a broadband Webcasting
service for future meetings. Anyone with the proper pass code could
log into a meeting and watch it on a computer from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   While Dominguez predicts it will be a popular feature, he
admits, ``that's actually frightening as a hotelier. Because if you
don't need to go to the meeting, people are going to stop
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little far-fetched right now, but I can see it
happening,'' he says of virtual meetings. ``Why travel if you can
sit at home?''

INSPIRED BY VICENTE FOX, EX-WORLD BANK OFFICER HELPS STEER MEXICO'S
FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Few economists put their faith in pipe dreams,
much less the visions of politicians looking toward higher office.
But Luis Ernesto Derbez _ a World Bank manager who had served in
Africa, Asia and Central America _ said he let his emotions take
the lead when he decided to join the improbable quest of Vicente
Fox for the Mexican presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Derbez was living in Washington when he
received the invitation from Fox. He had met Fox, then a state
governor and a prominent aspirant for his center-right party's
presidential nomination, a year earlier while guest teaching at the
Technological Institute of Higher Studies in Monterrey. The
meeting, Derbez said, left him inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision that Vicente Fox proposed, of what needed to be
done in Mexico, of the changes that he thought needed to be carried
out, was a vision that at the time sounded like a dream, but it was
a great necessity for the country,'' Derbez said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a decision that was part emotional and part rational,''
he said about joining the Fox campaign. ``It was professionally
rational in that it meant working with someone like Vicente Fox.
And emotional because he really was a person that stirred my
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Fox stirred the nation when he became the first
candidate in 71 years to wrest the presidency from the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party. Earlier this week, Fox announced
the leaders of his transition team _ 18 men and two women
responsible for seeking out the best ideas, programs and people for
his administration, which will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Derbez was named co-chairman of the economic committee with
Eduardo Sojo, an economist and a former student. But members of the
transition team say that to the president-elect, the 53-year-old
Derbez ranks first among equals.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Derbez said, he served as a kind of movie
director _ working behind the scenes with a brain trust of hundreds
to develop ideas for government reform and then turning them into
themes for campaign speeches. Since Fox's triumph, Derbez has been
more prominent in public.
</P>
<P>
   He has held Wall Street teleconferences and meetings with
reporters as part of the president-elect's effort to signal a new
openness in government. He has helped calm concerns that Mexico, as
in 1994, could plunge into an election-year financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and his advisers promise to increase economic growth to 7
percent midway through the six-year presidential term and to create
1.4 million jobs a year. Derbez and Sojo, who has a master's degree
from the University of Pennsylvania, will work with the current
administration of President Ernesto Zedillo on next year's budget
with the aim of increasing spending on education and small-business
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Derbez himself is the product of a small family business _ his
parents ran a clothing factory that employed 20 workers. A husband
and father of three, he earned a master's degree in economics at
the University of Oregon and a doctorate in industrial organization
at Iowa State University.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Fox campaign in 1997, he had worked 14 years
managing economic adjustment programs for the World Bank, served as
an independent consultant to the Inter-American Development Bank
and was a visiting professor at the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Derbez said he had been looking for years for some kind of work
to bring him back to Mexico, but had not been inspired or intrigued
until he met Fox. Upon joining the president-elect, Derbez began
seeking out the best Mexican minds, at home and abroad, for advice
on how to manage the next government.
</P>
<P>
   This is an approach, he said, that the Fox administration hopes
to incorporate into its regular activity, allowing smart and
talented Mexicans living abroad to serve as advisers to government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Derbez said that the creation of such advisory groups, along
with giving Mexicans abroad the right to vote in elections, are
some of the steps the new team hopes to take to inspire Mexican
expatriates. ``There are people that send us messages, that want to
participate,'' he said, ``and so the challenge right now is to
gather the information and to organize some kind of programs with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are rough and politically sensitive
conversations headed Derbez's way. Among some of the new
government's plans are wide-ranging fiscal changes to help raise
money for increased social spending in areas like education and
health care. The changes would include an end of some corporate tax
exemptions and the imposing of taxes on food and medicine. The Fox
advisers will also explore opening the electric power and
petrochemical industries to private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Previous privatization attempts in those industries have failed,
largely because of strong union opposition to the sale of
businesses related to oil. Since Fox's election, the union stance
has hardened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever controls petrochemicals, controls the oil,'' said
Victor Garcia, a spokesman for the Mexican oil workers union.
``Whoever controls oil, controls the economy. Whoever controls the
economy, controls politics. And whoever controls politics controls
the country. That is why we will not support privatizing
petrochemicals. It puts our sovereignty at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Derbez has had experience in navigating politically sensitive
matters. As a division chief in West Africa for the World Bank from
1992 to 1994, he supervised negotiations between France and 14
former colonies regarding the devaluation of their currency, the
CFA franc. The currency's value was cut in half overnight, causing
outrage among many Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Derbez managed the storm, satisfying all sides, his boss at the
World Bank in those years, Olivier Lafourcade, said. ``It was one
of the most delicate and highly complicated issues we had ever
dealt with at the bank,'' said Lafourcade, who is now director of
the World Bank office in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he plans to handle opposition to Fox's plans, Derbez
invoked that same spirit. ``What cannot be done is to make abrupt
decisions and impose them from above,'' he said. ``And what must be
done is conversing with all the groups affected, to learn their
point of view and their worries.''

AIRLINES POST LARGE PROFITS FOR QUARTER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ |Delta and Northwest airlines on Thursday
capped a three-day period in which the nation's nine largest
airlines reported a whopping $1.7 billion quarterly profit by
capitalizing on record passenger demand to more than offset a 50
percent jump in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine, only US Airways and America West Airlines failed to
exceed analysts' profit estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Delta topped United and American airlines with a June quarter
profit of $460 million. In the same period a year ago, the company
earned $364 million.
</P>
<P>
   Delta outperformed United and American even after excluding its
own one-time accounting charges. Delta earned $376 million in the
quarter, excluding unusual items. Meanwhile, before adjusting for
one-time accounting items, United parent UAL Corp. earned $370
million and American parent AMR Corp. earned $321 million.
</P>
<P>
   Each share of Delta stock earned $3.51 in the quarter, compared
with $2.40 per share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also exceeded analysts's expectation of a 98
cent-per-share quarterly profit by earning a net profit of $115
million, or $1.26 per fully diluted share in the quarter ended June
30. Revenues rose 12.7 percent to $2.9 billion. Through the first
six months of the year, Northwest earned $118 million, or $1.29 per
share. The company's six-month revenues rose 12.7 percent to $5.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the positive earnings report, Northwest shares lost
$1.4375 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where they
closed at $33.25. Delta stock, however, gained 25 cents to close at
$53.875 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of their rivals, both Delta and Northwest reported
unprecedented levels of demand. Delta recorded a record 77.5
percent load factor for the quarter, while Northwest filled an
average of 79.7 percent of its seats, its all-time highest
quarterly load factor.

 &HT;    Gore, Bush trade jabs in Texas
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight and Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO They stood 90 miles apart and took turns swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore flew into San Antonio Thursday to accuse
Gov. George W. Bush of squandering a state budget surplus by
favoring the oil industry and special interests with $1.7 billion
in tax breaks even as he resisted paying for health insurance for
poor children. Two hours later, Bush emerged from the governor's
mansion to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that Gov. Bush is a popular and well-liked
governor here, and I want to give him some credit on that score,''
Gore said. ``I think he has a warm and engaging personality. But,
you know, the presidency is more than just a popularity contest. It
involves whether or not you're willing to fight for what's right,
whether or not you're willing to spend some popularity to do
difficult, hard things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore called Texas, ``a wonderful state,'' but said it should
also be ``a state where it 's just as easy to raise a child as it
is to set up an oil rig.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended his record, saying he cut taxes ``in a fiscally
responsible way,'' and that the state now has a $1.4 billion
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Vice President Gore to claim otherwise for his own
political purposes is a travesty,'' Bush said. ``He should be
ashamed. Texas doesn't need the vice president to lecture us on
balanced budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued pounding Bush's two terms as governor, saying the
state leads the nation in industrial pollution, ranks second in
child poverty, third in deaths from asthma and last for women with
health insurance. And he sliced at Bush's efforts to attract Latino
voters, saying that half the children in Texas without health
insurance are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The two went mano -a -mano as the Bush campaign unveiled three
new campaign advertisements slated for the key swing states of
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Washington in the days leading up
to the Republican National Convention, which begins July 31 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's was the toughest direct criticism Bush's legislative
record has had in years here _ even if few Texas Democrats showed
up Thursday to help Gore make his point. State Sen. Mario Gallegos,
D-Houston; and state Reps. Carlos Uresti and Ruth Jones McClendon,
both San Antonio Democrats, appeared with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has spent almost two weeks attacking Bush for
pushing through a $1.7 billion tax cut last year after news reports
that cost overruns in the Medicaid and prison programs have left
the state budget $610 million short.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Republican state Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander held a press conference to say that the state now has a
$1.4 billion surplus _ more than enough to cover the shortfall and
a rosier projection than the $1.1 billion she unveiled five days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said there is ``a rush by the governor's political allies
to try to put a gloss on it. And the governor told one of the
newspapers represented here last week that he hopes to not to be
around to have to deal with it next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Bush, campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush
was joking when he made the remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, his sense of humor, other people don't always
understand it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that every state budget is balanced.
</P>
<P>
   `` I'm proud that under my leadership, working with Republicans
and Democrats, Texas has increased spending for education,
increased spending for health care, built and funded prisons and
cut taxes by record amounts,'' he said. ``And we still have a large
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes offered to sit down with Gore to explain the state's
budget numbers, an offer the Gore camp declined.
</P>
<P>
   ```She's no Alan Greenspan; she's a Republican partisan,'' Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane said, adding that Gore preferred to talk to
``real families in this state who have been impacted by (Bush's)
wrong-headed decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Dick Armey, (R-Irving) also got into the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another example of Al Gore not wanting to let the
facts get in the way of making a good argument,'' Armey said in an
e-mail sent to political reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, amid a plunge in oil prices that made it more costly
to operate numerous low-producing wells than to shut them down,
Bush strongly backed a temporary suspension of the severance on oil
and gas production. He gave the bill emergency status, and it was
the first measure he signed into law during the session. The tax
breaks were capped at $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, legislators pushed to expand the Children's
Health Insurance Program, a federal-state effort to help low-income
families who make too much money to get Medicaid coverage but not
enough to afford insurance coverage on their own. Democratic
lawmakers wanted to set the threshold for families to qualify at
200 percent of the federal poverty level; the governor's office
favored 150 percent. In the end, the Legislature approved the 200
percent cap and Bush agreed.

 &HT;    Austin center part of Lucent spinoff
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lucent Technologies Inc., the big maker of
communications equipment, said Thursday it will spin off its $4
billion microelectronics business, which includes a promising chip
development center in Austin formerly known as Agere Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff, which also includes Lucent's business for
developing components used in high-speed optical networks, is
expected to take place in the first quarter of next year. The new
company, which is still unnamed, plans to offer 20 percent of its
shares in an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dividing Lucent in order to accelerate growth,'' said
Richard McGinn, chairman and chief executive of Lucent, which is
based in Murray Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Lucent said it would spin off another part of its
business devoted to corporate networking equipment later this year.
That business, which Lucent named Avaya, has not been spun off yet.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent made the announcement at the same time it released its
second-quarter financial results. Net income was $1 billion, or 30
cents a share, on revenue of $8.7 billion. Net income was up 30
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed the stock downward Thursday when management
forecast that the company's growth will slow in the second half of
this year. The stock closed down $10.06 a share, or 15.6 percent,
at $54.44 in New York Stock Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's operations in Austin develops high-speed communications
processing chips.
</P>
<P>
   A top manager locally said the spinoff will help the chip
business. ``It's definitely good news,'' said Eric Rothfus,
director of the Austin business unit. ``Here in Austin we will
expand more aggressively what we do. This gives us the opportunity
to recruit more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, which acquired Agere Inc. in April for more than $400
million in stock, employs more than140 people in Austin and expects
to expand to 180 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, based in Allentown, Pa., will have 16,000
workers, including a share of the famed Bell Laboratories research
center. It will concentrate on chips for wireless and wireline
communications equipment, going up against rivals such as Motorola
Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Conexant Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent was the world's 16th largest semiconductor maker in 1999
with sales of $3.3 billion, up 18 percent from the year before. The
company said it had $4 billion in sales in the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a force to be reckoned with,'' said analyst Will
Strauss with Forward Concepts of Tempe, Ariz. ``And now they are
let loose on the world.'' Cutting its ties from Lucent should help
the spinoff win more sales with equipment makers that formerly were
reluctant to do business with a major competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The communications components business will now be given the
opportunity to achieve its full potential as it becomes freed from
the strategic conflict if faced as part of Lucent,'' McGinn said.
``And Lucent will now be totally focused on the largest network
buildout in history, a $225 billion market opportunity this year.
We will be able to streamline our operations, increase investments
in the market for broadband and wireless Internet infrastructure.''

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Congress has agreed on a plan to eliminate the
``marriage penalty'' long embedded in our tax laws _ the tax
advantage that the Internal Revenue Code now confers on couples who
choose to live together outside of marriage, or who get divorced.
The House has voted to double the standard deduction and the
ceiling on the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples, and the
Senate is expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Though President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill because
most of its benefits go to relatively well-off couples, in the end
he may find it hard to resist signing a measure that is popular and
is advertised as family-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a big flaw in this supposed erasure of the marriage
penalty: It doesn't erase the marriage penalty. Lawmakers have
barely touched one of the tax law's biggest and most socially
damaging taxes on matrimony _ the penalty for people eligible for
the earned-income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   This credit, which benefits the working poor, has done more to
reduce poverty than almost any other federal program. But as
workers' earnings rise, the tax code imposes a heavy fine on
marriage for millions of low-income workers with children.
</P>
<P>
   The earned-income tax credit pays workers a maximum of $2,353,
or $3,888 if the worker has two or more children, but this payment
is gradually reduced once earnings increase above $12,690, going
down by 16 to 21 cents for each extra dollar earned. The credit
phases out entirely at $27,432 in earnings, or $31,152 if there are
two or more children.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty arises because the tax credit calculations
use family earnings, not individual earnings. If a single mother
lives with her boyfriend, his wages aren't included in figuring her
tax credit, since he is not officially a part of her family. Should
she marry him, their real joint income will stay the same, but her
official family earnings will rise, and her tax credit will go down
or disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The earned-income tax credit's marriage penalty can be huge.
Imagine a young woman and the father of her two children, living
together as one household, unmarried but hoping to wed. She earns
$12,000; he earns $20,000. Under the tax rules, her credit is the
maximum: $3,888.
</P>
<P>
   If they marry, the mother's ``family earnings'' will rise from
$12,000 to $32,000. Her credit will go from $3,888 to zero _ a big
loss of income for a couple of such modest earnings.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress is serious about eliminating the marriage penalty in
the tax code, it must fix the earned-income tax credit as
dramatically as it is fixing the standard deduction and the tax
brackets. This low-income marriage disincentive probably turns away
far more individuals from wedlock than are discouraged by the other
disincentives. Low-income workers, who count every penny, are much
more likely to avoid marriages that will cost them dearly than are
the high-salaried live-ins that Congress has its eye on helping.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and House have agreed to trim the earned-income tax
credit's marriage penalty somewhat, for some couples, by increasing
the income levels where it applies by $2,000. But most of the
marriage penalty remains. The only real solution is to reduce
significantly the rate at which the tax credit decreases as income
goes up _ in other words, to expand the upper limit of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change would cost the Treasury more money, but it would
make the distribution of benefits more equitable. Why thwart the
marital aspirations of those who work for McDonald's and Walgreen's
while rewarding the ties that bind the middle class and rich?
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's arrival in Okinawa for the
Group of 8 meeting of big industrial nations calls attention to
something beyond the international economic issues that the leaders
there will discuss: the debate about whether the time has come to
end the American military presence on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The Okinawans who have used the visit of the world leaders as a
stage for demonstrating in favor of American withdrawal are
protesting acts like a hit-and-run incident involving an Air Force
staff sergeant and the molestation of a 14-year-old Okinawan girl
in which a Marine was accused. The Japanese government, however,
shows no interest in a removal of the Americans, because Japan's
defenses are bolstered by the American base.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, the issue is most often framed as
a debate between isolationists who want us to get out of Asia and
champions of maintaining our presence in Okinawa as a sign of
American resolve in that part of the world. Both have it wrong. The
United States can afford to pull its troops out of Okinawa with no
loss of our commitment to Asian security. In fact, America's
position would be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the fall of the Soviet Union, the challenges to
America in Asia are a Chinese military buildup, the China-Taiwan
conflict and North Korea. Yet in Okinawa, 20,000 Marines remain as
a relic of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the status quo argue that the Marines on Okinawa
could help move supplies in the event of a war in Korea or Taiwan
and that they provide ready reinforcements for possible rapid
deployment to other regions, like the Persian Gulf. The Clinton
administration codified this consensus in the Nye report, when it
declared that America would keep a minimum of 100,000 troops in
Asia until at least 2015, explicitly including the 20,000 on
Okinawa in that total.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the United States can not only retain but
improve upon these goals by removing its forces from Okinawa. Over
the past decade the Pentagon has been moving toward a new strategy
based on getting American troops to global hot spots by sea and
air, a strategy known as maritime pre-positioning force.
International seas offer complete and expeditious freedom of
movement, and the Marines already have the equivalent of a division
stationed on ships around the globe. The Navy is also working to
improve the replenishment of ships already at sea with missiles,
cannon rounds, bullets and fuel. The Marines in Okinawa might be
redeployed to bolster this strategy.
</P>
<P>
   There are disadvantages, after all, in keeping them where they
are. Okinawa is what is known as an unaccompanied tour, which means
the Marines cannot bring their wives. The small Okinawa base also
has no room for large-scale battle training.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, as the military expert Paul Bracken points
out in his recent book, ``Fire in the East,'' maintaining a string
of bases in Asia has rendered the American military dangerously
vulnerable to chemical and ballistic missile attacks. The United
States, he says, needs to restructure the military to allow it to
operate at greater distances from home and become ``less reliant on
vulnerable forward bases.''
</P>
<P>
   One step would be to shift the basing of fleets so that
destroyers can remain permanently stationed in the Pacific rather
than trundling to and from the West Coast. Facilities in Japan are
already being built up, Guam could be expanded, and most
intriguingly, Vietnam might be willing to consider leasing Cam Ranh
Bay back to the United States, especially as it fears growing
Chinese military strength.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of tight military budgets and limited manpower, such
measures would improve the speed with which American firepower can
reach Asia, and they would have none of Okinawa's drawbacks.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Has there ever been a presidential campaign
headquarters more boring than George W. Bush's? The Bush people
don't have staff shake-ups. They haven't had to move the offices so
the candidate could find himself. They don't even spend their days
gossiping on the phone or backbiting their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is they are grinds. The atmosphere in Austin is dull
and professional, according to people who spend a lot of time
there. The offices look like they belong to a corporate law firm,
and the Bushies squirrel away in their cubicles from dawn till
dark. They operate like a White House in waiting, with
sophisticated paper routing, West Wing-style briefings, and
multilayered speech vetting. One gets the impression that if they
ever did have a late night pizza bash, they'd use knives, forks and
cloth napkins.
</P>
<P>
   This is a long way from the war room atmosphere of the Clinton
crowd in 1992, when you had twentysomething know-it-alls who had
never mentally left the college dorm and Carville-like gurus going
gonzo. In fact, this is a long way from most presidential
campaigns, especially those trying to oust an incumbent party that
has been in office for eight years. At this point in the political
cycle, we're normally due for an insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960 election brought us the fresh blood of the Kennedy
crowd after eight years of Ike. In 1976, Jimmy Carter's outsider
campaign promised a break from the scandals of Watergate. In 1980,
Ronald Reagan led his own insurgency, staffed by movement
conservatives _ some so fresh off the farm they wore white socks
with their suits _ vowing to sweep out the stables. Twelve years
later came the Clintonites _ baby boomer Rhodes scholars presenting
their generation as God's gift to government.
</P>
<P>
   But this season there are no outsiders. The Bush campaign is
about as insurgent as General Electric or IBM. If the Bushies win,
they can cancel the White House orientation because everybody will
have already worked there. The foreign policy team is like a Desert
Storm reunion tour: Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice,
Paul Wolfowitz and Robert Zoellick all worked for President George
Bush. One exception is Richard Perle, and he worked in the Reagan
administration. On the domestic side are prominent Bush
administration alumni like Lawrence Lindsey, Josh Bolton and
Michael Boskin. The Bush campaign looks as much like an incumbent
campaign as the Gore one. Measured by governing experience, the
edge actually goes to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago that the Republicans were neck-deep in
populism. In the Gingrich era, this was the party of term limits.
But now the GOp is enthusiastic about a campaign of seasoned
veterans. This really does represent a Risorgimento of the
establishment. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the New Right adopted
some of the mindset of the New Left. It was better to be an
anti-establishment rebel than an insider or a member of the
mainstream. It was cool to call yourself a radical and a
revolutionary. But since the Gingrich revolution flamed out, the
establishmentarians have reasserted themselves. They saw George W.
Bush as their vehicle for retaking their party. They chose him as
much as he gathered them.
</P>
<P>
   So now we have a situation in which the challenger looks like a
steadier hand than the sitting vice president. Even as Bush has
been getting gravitas implants from the GOP elder statesmen, Al
Gore has adopted the pose of a protean outsider, first moving his
headquarters to Nashville from Washington and then posing as a
populist to counter the challenge of Ralph Nader. Worse, whereas
Bush has accumulated the 1927 Yankees of foreign policy advisers,
Gore relies on one person, a semi-obscure aide named Leon Fuerth.
Whereas Bush stands at the head of a phalanx of sober experts,
corporate buddies and GOP bigwigs, Gore keeps his own counsel.
</P>
<P>
   There may not much romance in the Bush campaign. There will be
no ``bliss to be alive'' moments. But after a few decades of
anti-establishment rhetoric, a little prosaic dullness may fit the
national mood.

   INVESTING-GREENBERG-BUFFETT (Undated) _ One plays the hayseed,
the other the New York tough guy, but Warren E. Buffett of Omaha
and Maurice R. Greenberg of Manhattan _ have a lot in common. Each
has built an empire that has delivered tremendous value to
shareholders. Greenberg, 75, and Buffett, nearly 70, are giants in
the same game. Though both Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway and
Greenberg's American International Group have other operations,
each is mainly in the insurance business. ``We think alike,''
Buffett said recently. ``If you showed us 10 deals, we would
probably come to pretty similar conclusions on most of them.'' That
makes all the more extraordinary this fact: For 10 years,
Greenberg's company has been the better bet for investors. By

   PESYSTEMS-HUNKAPILLER-GENOME (Foster City, Calif.) _ PE
Biosystems has emerged as the leading supplier of equipment to the
exploding genomics industry. The company controls at least 70
percent of the market for gene sequencers. It is the leading
supplier of equipment used for one of the fundamental processes in
biotechnology, the amplification and detection of DNA by polymerase
chain reaction. It is in the early lead for machines used to
analyze proteins. Competitors often refer to PE as the Microsoft of
genomics equipment, for its commanding position and its aggressive
tactics. If PE is the Microsoft, then Dr. Michael J. Hunkapiller is
the Bill Gates, a nerd at heart, who has transformed himself into a
respected, shrewd and tough businessman. By Andrew Pollack.

   INVESTING-CHARTING (Undated) _ For years finance professors have
held chartists in contempt. The problem has been one of translating
chartists' visual pattern recognition into the mathematics on which
academics rely, according to a new study, in which the authors, all
academics, gauge which charting techniques work. After defining the
chart patterns mathematically, the researchers back-tested the
patterns' predictive prowess for 750 stocks over 35 years ending in
1996. One of their findings is that the patterns predict the future
direction of Nasdaq stocks better than they do exchange-listed
issues. By Mark Hurlbert.

<P>
   INVEST-REITS (Undated) _ It might not be realistic to expect a
Real Estate Investment Trust to be the next Cisco Systems, but a
significant new law is leading some money managers to suggest that
investors look to REIT's as technology plays. They point to REIT's
that are either actively investing in technology to improve
businesses, or that cater to the real estate needs of e-commerce
companies. These companies are poised to benefit from the federal
REIT Modernization Act of 1999, which, in January, will allow
REIT's to offer services like landscaping, parcel delivery, and
telecommunications _ to tenants and other parties. The new law is
``probably the biggest development in the REIT industry since 1986,
when REIT's were permitted to both own and manage real estate,''
says Anthony R. Davis, an analyst at UBS Warburg Dillon Read. By
Sana Siwolop.

   INVEST-WHITCOMB (Undated) _ Roland P. Whitcomb, the lead manager
of the $799.1 million First American Technology &UR;  &LR; fund, says that in
a technology cycle, value investors get confused by the high
valuation of the stocks, because they underestimate the coming
innovation. Growth investors often have trouble selling, because
they take the growth rate and project it forward, he says. Whitcomb
gives each new technology cycle time to run, an inisght that has
helped the fund return 66.6 percent a year for the three years that
ended July 14, compared with 53.8 percent for its technology peers.

finally said, ``Goodbye.'' The New Jersey man also said,
``Goodbye.'' This was followed by a chorus of ``goodbyes'' from

   FRIDGE-CHINA (QINGDAO, China) _ The Haier Group has become
China's largest appliance maker, with sales of $3.2 billion last
year. It is also one of China's largest exporters, selling $1.4
billion of products in 160 countries. Earlier this year, Haier
opened a $30 million refrigerator factory in Camden, S.C. Why make
fridges in South Carolina when China is so much cheaper? Zhang
Ruimin, Haier's chief executive, said he wants to learn to compete

   BIKE-POST-OFFICE (Undated) _ Cheering on professional cyclists,
Gail Sonnenberg has one thing in mind: increasing sales at the U.S.
Postal Service. As senior vice president of sales, Sonnenberg began
overseeing the Postal Service's cycling-team sponsorship in 1997
just as Lance Armstrong emerged from his bout with cancer to join
the squad. Last year, the team with its uniforms emblazoned with
the Postal Service logo was the first American squad to win the
Tour de France, a morale raiser at the post office. It also brought
the post office $10 million in revenues from other sponsors, she
said, and the association with Armstrong brings glamour to an

DaimlerChrysler's category-defying minivan-sedan, owes much to the
'37 Plymouth, the late '30s Ford sedans with a 1950 Chevy Panel van
and a little Willys Overland thrown in. But Dan Niel, reviewing the
vehicle, says its charismatic retro design camouflages a supremely
efficient box-on-wheels. The PT won't tempt hot-rodders, but on
balance, he says, complaints are few and compliments abound. &QL;

   BIKE-POST-OFFICE (Undated) _ Cheering on professional cyclists,
Gail Sonnenberg has one thing in mind: increasing sales at the U.S.
Postal Service. As senior vice president of sales, Sonnenberg began
overseeing the Postal Service's cycling-team sponsorship in 1997
just as Lance Armstrong emerged from his bout with cancer to join
the squad. Last year, the team with its uniforms emblazoned with
the Postal Service logo was the first American squad to win the
Tour de France, a morale raiser at the post office. It also brought
the post office $10 million in revenues from other sponsors, she
said, and the association with Armstrong brings glamour to an
otherwise bland brand. By Greg Winter.

   ABOUT-CARS-PTCRUISER (Undated) _ The 2001 PT Cruiser,
DaimlerChrysler's category-defying minivan-sedan, owes much to the
'37 Plymouth, the late '30s Ford sedans with a 1950 Chevy Panel van
and a little Willys Overland thrown in. But Dan Niel, reviewing the
vehicle, says its charismatic retro design camouflages a supremely
efficient box-on-wheels. The PT won't tempt hot-rodders, but on
balance, he says, complaints are few and compliments abound. &QL;

TEXANS RESENT GORE'S CRITICISMS OF THEIR STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For months, Vice President Al Gore and other national
Democrats have depicted George W. Bush's Texas as all but a Third
World country. Pollution? Gore says Texas is the most polluted
state in America. Poverty? Gore says that too many of Texas' people
are poor and that the state does too little for them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore even came to Texas on Thursday to continue his criticisms,
questioning Bush's handling of the state budget and his priorities
as governor. Lagging schools, children without health insurance,
pockets of disease _ Gore's ever-expanding list of Texas woes
leaves out mosquitoes and big hair, but it does go on.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Texans, a prideful lot who take a brighter
view of things, are offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas isn't nearly as backward and Third World as the Gore
campaign would make us out,'' protested Michael Levy, the publisher
of Texas Monthly magazine. ``I personally am starting to get
offended.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a divergence between the view others hold
of Texas and the view Texans hold of themselves, with cliches
abounding in both. But the crucible of a presidential campaign
seems to have exacerbated the gap and pricked at the old
resentments of many Texans, who believe that most outsiders have
never understood the state and never will.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just jealous,'' said Phyllis K. Griggs, the mayor pro
tem of McAllen. ``Texas is bigger than life. People feel they can
make fun of it. Have you ever heard anybody make fun of, say,
Nebraska?''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Levy and four other Texans, none of them unfamiliar
with politics or publicity, declared themselves the Proud of Texas
Committee. They wrote to Gore, pledging to defend the honor of
their state against his ``misrepresentations.'' In another era,
that might have involved pistols; in modern Texas, a news release
sufficed. (The release neglected to mention, however, that four of
the committee's five members are campaign contributors to Bush, a
fact Democratic officials happily pointed out.)
</P>
<P>
   The Proud committee has pledged to rebut political attacks on
Texas, and it had better get busy. Earlier this month the
Democratic National Committee, ever helpful in an election year,
issued a travel advisory warning that visitors entering the state
should check their immunization shots. Why? Because below-average
immunization rates in Houston and elsewhere made Texas ``ripe for
epidemic'' _ a playful political swipe that angered local health
officials. Bush campaign officials pointed out that Houston's
mayor, Lee Brown, is a Democrat and a Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the e-mail message that flashed onto the computer
screens of political reporters across the country in May: ``Texas:
most manure in America.'' Not exactly the makings of a state
slogan, but a report issued by the Sierra Club and Consumers Union
showed that farms in Texas generated more animal waste than those
in any other state. ``We're definitely No. 1 in No. 2,'' said
Reggie James, the director of Consumers Union in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning across the country, Gore regularly blames Bush for
statistics that show Texas leads the nation in many pollution
categories, has one of the highest numbers of children lacking
health insurance and still lags in many national education
rankings. In recent days, with state spending overruns causing
headlines here, Gore has denounced Texas' fiscal ``mess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Governor Bush ran America the way he has run the state of
Texas, our prosperity would vanish and our progress would be
blocked,'' Gore said in San Antonio on Thursday at a meeting with
parents of children who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his staff have aggressively contested Gore's attacks,
accusing him of misrepresenting some facts and taking others out of
context. They say that pollution has declined during the five and a
half years of the Bush administration, a very debatable contention,
and that the state is doing more to insure poor children. They
point out national studies showing educational gains in the state
and fiercely rebut Gore's fiscal criticism, noting that the state
on Thursday announced a budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Others rising to the defense of Texas point to the large number
of immigrants, legal and illegal, coming across the Mexican border,
an influx that often skews state poverty statistics even as cities
like Austin, Dallas and Houston are booming.
</P>
<P>
   They note, too, that Texas has traditionally been a low-tax,
low-service state; outsiders may disapprove of that philosophy,
they say, but that is a separate debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore does have some admirers in Texas, and they maintain that
regardless of any bruised feelings, the criticism is unavoidable
and necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to have your own family point out that you have
an ugly house, it's another to have someone else say it,'' said Jim
Hightower, a liberal Democrat and former state agriculture
commissioner who now writes books and is host of a radio talk show.
``But there it is. It seems to me that we're not in a very good
position to whine about what Gore is saying.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore, of course, is not indulging in some radical new political
tactic. In fact, his role model could well be Bush's father. In
1988, Vice President George Bush toured Boston Harbor to harangue
his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts,
about pollution.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1992, when the elder Bush, as president, belittled Bill
Clinton's Arkansas as a ``small state,'' Ross Perot, the Reform
Party's nominee and himself a Texan, found the theme hard to
resist. ``I could say that I ran a small grocery store on the
corner,'' Perot offered as an analogy. ``Therefore I extrapolate
that into the fact that I could run Wal-Mart. That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Texas is a big place; the debate is over
what sort of place it is. Insiders and outsiders have always had a
different take. The old stereotype of cowboys and wildcatters is
badly dated; modern Texas, with more than 20 million people, is
characterized by urban sprawl and increasingly populated by
computer processors, lawyers and office workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless many Texans still hold dear the self-image that Ann
W. Richards spoke of several years ago when, as governor, she
dedicated an enormous roadside statue of one of the state's icons,
Sam Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is now, as he was then, the image of a Texan,'' she said,
``the image we all believe of ourselves: courageous, strong,
ambitious, shrewd, eccentric, sentimental and just a little too
rowdy for his own good.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of grandeur and of a larger destiny does not always
translate to visitors. Some outsiders never seem to get past the
hot weather. The Chicago Tribune once described Houston as ``a hot,
humid, swampy, colorless flatland metropolis that may already be
beyond physical or social redemption.'' In 1994, for the pro
basketball finals between the New York Knicks and the Houston
Rockets, The New York Post dispatched a sports columnist to offer
its own account of the nation's fourth-largest city. ``This Place
Is a Hellhole,'' the Post headline concluded.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other affronts are subtler. Gregory Curtis, who recently stepped
down as editor of Texas Monthly, recalls that guests at a cocktail
party in New York seemed genuinely surprised that he had bought his
tailored suits in Texas. Curtis used one of his final columns
before leaving the magazine to excoriate the national media,
especially The New York Times, accusing them of portraying Bush and
Texas unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a suspicion, at least _ or certainly some kind of
discontent _ between the East and Texas,'' Curtis said in an
interview. ``There is an assumption that things in Texas are bad
and backward and on and on. You find yourself being held
accountable for the presumptions of the way that Texas is.''
</P>
<P>
   T.R. Fehrenbach, an author who is an authority on Texas history,
sees an eternal tension between Texans and anyone trying to tell
them what to do. ``I don't think Easterners understand the
territoriality of the native Texan,'' Fehrenbach said. ``This isn't
new. It goes back to before the Civil War. We are always being
pressured by outsiders to get more like them.''
</P>
<P>
   The outside criticism has in recent weeks spurred a modest tizzy
in the state media, spilling from news accounts of the latest Gore
broadside to editorial musings about what it all means to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. George W. Bush has more than a presidential campaign at
stake,'' wrote William McKenzie of The Dallas Morning News in an
editorial last week. ``The idea of Texas itself also is at play in
his race for the White House.''

STICKER SHOCK: RAISING ONE CHILD FOR 17 YEARS COSTS $290,000 
</HEADLINE>
 C-COST-CHILDREN-$ADV23-NYT   (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my daughter, Marian, turned 13 in May, I asked her what she
wanted for this special birthday. ``Anything within reason,'' I
said. She thought about it a bit, then replied, ``I want to see a
show on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Then she asked if she could bring a couple of friends. She also
wondered if we could go out to dinner before the show. Finally,
shortly before the event, she told my wife that she really didn't
have anything appropriate to wear to a night on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Reason went out the window. By the time the evening was over,
the birthday party cost about $600. I suppose I should be happy
that she didn't ask for a pony.
</P>
<P>
   Marian has been a teen-ager for only a couple of months, but I
am already wondering what the next few years will be like. After
all, while children are undoubtedly expensive to raise, teen-agers
are the most expensive. Their clothing costs jump, as do their
costs for entertainment and, of course, food. Did I mention
birthday parties?
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a family with pretax income of more than $61,900 will
spend an average of about $290,000 to raise an only child through
age 17, with the heaviest expenses _ $85,000 _ during the teen
years, the Agriculture Department says. And that money, of course,
just gets parents to the start of the horrific college years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, children have many benefits, but they are
expensive,'' said Mark Lino, an economist at the department.
``Teen-agers are the most expensive because they are very
food-intensive, and they have the highest transportation expenses.
These are the years they begin to drive. The average 16-year-old,
Lino said, consumed about $3,000 in food in 1999, compared with
about $2,320 for an 8-year-old. When it comes to clothing, he said,
parents spent almost $1,300 for the 16-year-old, versus $855 for
the 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Distler, 50, a high school teacher in Shawnee Mission,
Kan., said she was amazed at what she spends on her 16-year-old
daughter, Kate. ``I wasn't used to paying $60 for a pair of jeans
that looked like they were already worn out,'' Distler said. ``My
husband has sticker shock. We spend about $2,400 in clothes a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the hobbies. Another mom from Kansas, who asked
that her name not be used, said she had spent about $5,000 on
fencing lessons, equipment and trips for her 18-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take them shopping once a week and you get a little
outfit,'' this mom said. ``Then there's the video and DVD rentals,
about $15 a week. That adds up. We keep telling ourselves that we
would be rich if we hadn't had kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some weeks it can be overwhelming,'' she said. ``Like the
prom: that was a lot of money. You think it's not going to be a big
deal, and it snowballs.'' She said the total bill for prom night
was about $570.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Humbolt, the author of ``I Want to Be Rich: A Teen-ager's
Modem to Money'' (Reynolds Publishing, 1998), says there are ways
to mitigate the costs. For one, she said, parents should get their
teen-agers financially involved in the family. She said a child who
works or gets an allowance should be encouraged to chip in, maybe
by paying for entertainment expenses. The children should also
understand where the family's money is coming from and what it
takes to support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they realize what it takes to get up day after
day, punch that time clock and deal with work,'' Humbolt said.
``Tell them how much it does cost to support the family. The child
will be able to relate to that, and understand why he won't be able
to afford that $100 pair of Nikes.''
</P>
<P>
   I think that is why my daughter understands that we're not
sending her to boarding school in Europe for the eighth grade. That
surprising request came soon after the Broadway trip. She wanted an
adventure, she said, and being an ``A'' student in Spanish, wanted
to immerse herself in another language.
</P>
<P>
   A commendable request, and I admire her maturity, but the school
she had picked out, in Switzerland, costs $35,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how people are doing it, because it's such a
struggle and it's so expensive to raise a teen-ager today,''
Humbolt said. ``Parents really have to plan. It takes a fortune and
six credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if Marian would settle for a pony.

VANDALS TAKE AIM AT EXPERIMENTAL CROPS AND GENETICS EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Maine, Ore., Calif., Mich., Colo.)   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLD SPRING HARBOR, N.Y. _ On a police blotter, it might not
look like much: a small cornfield vandalized, a few acres of ears
trampled and uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not just any cornfield. The patch that was damaged
here last Thursday was part of a research project at the Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, a field with a distinguished scientific
heritage. It was where Barbara McClintock studied Indian corn in
the 1940s to learn about genes _ work that won her a Nobel Prize in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they believe that the field was attacked for that
very reason. The destruction, they said, appears to be the latest
of several recent incidents across the country in which
experimental crops have been destroyed and research centers
vandalized by militant environmentalists who oppose the genetic
modification of plants. Graffiti denouncing genetic engineering
were found near the trampled rows of corn.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 acts of sabotage against genetic research have been
reported in the last year, according to both law enforcement
officials trying to combat the practice and radical environmental
groups that encourage it. Vandals have trampled experimental grass
fields in Oregon, pruned pinot noir vines and uprooted strawberry
fields in California, and hacked down cornfields in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the destruction goes well beyond crop damage. On New
Year's Eve, arson destroyed a suite of offices in Michigan State
University's Agriculture Hall. No one was hurt, but the fire caused
hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of damage. A radical
environmental group, the Earth Liberation Front, later claimed
responsibility, saying it had focused on the program because of the
program's ties to biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said that last week's
vandalism was not only misguided, but misdirected. The corn that
was trampled was not genetically modified, they said, but rather
was the result of natural plant breeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that these individuals chose illegal means
and intimidation to promote their point of view,'' said Bruce
Stillman, the director of the laboratory, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and businesses have been working on genetically
modified crops for years. In recent years, though, opposition to
the practice has grown among a broad range of environmentalists and
others who fear the unknown effects of manipulating nature.
</P>
<P>
   This opposition soon led to organized protests and vandalism,
first in Europe, where fear of so-called Frankenfoods is more
common, and now in the United States, where groups with names like
the Cropatistas, the Strawberry Liberation Front, the Anarchist
Golfing Association and Reclaim the Seeds have claimed
responsibility for acts of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be on the rise, and we are quite concerned about
it,'' said Michael J. Phillips, the executive director for food and
agriculture at the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade
organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It has attracted the attention of law enforcement officials as
well, from campus police departments to the FBI. ``We are very
aware of these incidents of eco-terrorism, and when they do occur,
the FBI considers them to be serious violations of federal law and
investigates the matters thoroughly and vigorously,'' said Steven
Berry, a supervisory special agent for the FBI in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Those who claim responsibility for the attacks dislike the term
vandalism, preferring to call what they do direct action.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the activists are concerned, it is the genetic
engineering itself that is the vandalism,'' said Denny Henke, a
spokesman for Genetix Alert, a group that uses the Internet to
publicize actions against genetic modification. ``The activists
that are doing this aren't doing it for fun. They feel passionately
that this is a very real danger, and they are willing to risk
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   California has seen such a spate of vandalism at its
universities and private businesses that one lawmaker,
Assemblywoman Helen M. Thomson, introduced a bill this year to
stiffen the civil penalties for destroying crops used in research.
Thomson, whose district includes Davis, where the state university
has been the target of frequent attacks, said her bill had been
nicknamed the Hate Crimes Against Vegetable Crops law. She said she
decided to increase the civil penalties because of the lack of
success officials in her area had had building criminal cases
against the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year a number of graduate students had their research
projects upended, pulled up, cut,'' she said. ``It's all because of
the overall issue of biotech. Now, that's a good debate, biotech,
but without the research, the data and real understanding, there
isn't very much to go on other than what your biases are.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the Biotechnology Industry Organization would like
to see a similar federal law intended to protect crops.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have been taken aback by the attacks, saying
they have been working on projects that will benefit the
environment by reducing the need to clear-cut forests or use deadly
pesticides, or by helping developing countries grow crops more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Ives, the director of the Agricultural Biotechnology
Support Project, a federally financed group at Michigan State that
helps developing countries learn to use biotechnology, was shocked
when her offices were gutted. A few weeks later, the Earth
Liberation Front _ which has also claimed responsibility for the
1998 arson at a ski resort in Vail, Colo., that caused $12 million
in damage _ said it had set the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, its unconscionable,'' Ives said. ``We're so fortunate
to live in a country where you have the right to protest. It is
unconscionable that you have to resort to violence and skulking
around in the middle of the night and setting fires. Picket me,
debate me, I'd salute you. But you don't have the right to destroy
property.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the cornfields here at Uplands Farm stunned
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   To some researchers, it was like vandalizing Mendel's pea patch.
This is, after all, where McClintock did her groundbreaking studies
of Indian corn, analyzing the patterns of kernels to learn about
the breaking and joining of genes and chromosomes inside the cells.
</P>
<P>
   But lab officials were reluctant to discuss the vandalism in
detail, fearing that publicity would encourage copycat attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, although a two-year research project paid for
by the National Science Foundation was damaged, lab officials said
the vandalism had set experiments back only a few weeks. And a new
generation of scientists here is continuing the research McClintock
began, using a new species: the mouse-eared cress, a small plant in
the mustard family that takes less time to grow than corn.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a five-year climb, the number of legal claims
accusing New York City police officers of using excessive force or
other misconduct has dropped sharply, by 25 percent over the last
year, according to city statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction brings an abrupt end to a period, since 1995, when
the number of claims had grown and suggests officers may be showing
greater restraint on the streets in the aftermath of infamous
incidents like the police shooting of Amadou Diallo and the
station-house torture of Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The decrease in legal claims coincides with two other downturns
that have been little noticed amid the sustained public outcry over
high-profile cases of police use of force: The number of police
shootings has declined, as have the n the number of complaints
submitted to the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Civilian
complaints have decreased by 14 percent over the past six months,
officials said, while police shootings last year were down to 31
from the 43 recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when federal prosecutors are arguing that the Police
Department does such a poor job of curbing brutality that it may
require outside oversight, the city can be expected to tout these
decreases as clear evidence that its own reforms, however belated,
have begun to show results. Critics have other explanations: City
lawyers, they say, may have scared off complainants with tougher
negotiating positions, or perhaps the numbers are simply a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   But the decrease is striking: Legal claims against police
officers, which are a precursor to police brutality lawsuits,
declined to 1,766 claims for the 12-month period ending in June
compared with 2,386 filed for the one-year period that ended in
June 1999.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a dramatic one-year reduction,'' said Comptroller Alan
Hevesi, whose office keeps track of all legal claims. ``If the
leadership of the Police Department focuses on the necessary
reforms, it could be the beginning of a meaningful and important
trend that would save the city enormous costs in lives, injuries
and dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials were quick to credit their innovations for the
reductions, citing improvements in training and reforms in the
disciplinary process that they said had rewired attitudes and made
officers more wary of misconduct. Two years ago, for example, the
department began integrity testing, in which undercover officers
pose as angry citizens in elaborate sting operations intended to
weed out officers with a propensity for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is occurring is that police officers are much more
cognizant of their responsibility to act with courtesy,
professionalism and respect,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics remained unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, New Yorkers have seen an historical spike in
police action claims,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of
the New York Civil Liberties Union. ``In light of this history, we
should not jump to any quick conclusions based on one year of data
as to whether this means there is a decrease in police
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in legal claims is significant by itself, but it is
particularly interesting in light of the reduction in misconduct
complaints filed with the civilian review board. In the past, when
civilian complaints have declined, critics said the downturn did
not constitute evidence of police restraint but of public mistrust
in the process. In many cases, they said, people mistreated by
police chose to bypass a complaint process they viewed as
ineffectual in favor of simply filing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the number of legal claims filed each year has been
carefully scrutinized as a second barometer of public
dissatisfaction with the police. The claims, technically known as
notices of claim, must be filed with the comptroller's office. They
serve notice on the city that it is about to be sued by someone who
claims to have suffered as a result of police misconduct or error,
such as the failure to provide proper police protection. Most of
the cases are filed by people who say they were victims of police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the number of claims alleging police misconduct or
mistakes has risen each year except one, 1998, when it dipped by 8
percent. Last year's total of 2,386 claims appears to have been the
highest number ever filed.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the 25 percent drop this year, Siegel said, the number
of claims is still higher than the 1,500 claims typically filed
annually a decade ago. But police officials said that comparison
was unfair because those numbers were recorded before the merger of
the transit and housing police into the Police Department, a 1994
event that added 7,000 officers to the force.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction this year in claims may present a budgetary bonus
for the city as well. Settling police misconduct cases in recent
years has become a major financial headache. Last year, the city
paid out a record $40 million to resolve claims and lawsuits in
police cases, up from $28 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Berger, a lawyer who monitored police misconduct cases for
the city and now represents plaintiffs in brutality cases, said
that he believes a large part of the decline in claims is
attributable to new strategies the city is employing to control
these settlement costs. In the past year or so, he said, city
lawyers have adopted a much tougher negotiating stance in
misconduct cases and are offering much smaller settlements. The
tactic, he said, has scared off some lawyers who in the past might
have taken on less sensational, less lucrative, but legitimate
misconduct cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not necessarily mean that those cases are not
arising,'' he said. ``It's just that my segment of the bar is
becoming more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Berger said one client he represented in 1998,
whose home had been mistakenly searched based on a faulty warrant,
received a $200,000 settlement. In a very similar case he has now,
Berger said, the city has offered only $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Connolly, a lawyer who supervises the city's
litigation in police misconduct cases, said he agreed with Berger
that the city's negotiating stance is firmer these days. But he
said that stance does not dissuade people with legitimate claims
from suing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who get scared away,'' he said, ``are the people
who did not have meritorious claims to begin with.''

LETTERMAN INVITES GORE AND BUSH TO DEBATE ON HIS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Candidates are used to sharing the stage at
presidential debates with television anchors and print reporters.
But this year, they may also be joined by Paul Shaffer and the CBS
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman said on his late-night talk show this week that
he had asked Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas to appear on his program for a full-scale debate, and that
Gore had immediately accepted.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bush, Mindy Tucker, said Thursday that the
Bush campaign had just received the invitation and was ``happy to
consider the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Pope, the executive producer of ``Late Show with David
Letterman'' and the on-air presenter of the program's
tongue-in-cheek ``Campaign 2000'' segments, said that Letterman was
serious about the offer, even if he also disclosed that he would
award points for the candidates' responses and declare a winner at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Dave's idea,'' Pope said. ``He issued the challenge on
Tuesday night's show, and threw the gauntlet down to the
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The political role of late-night television is not
insignificant. In a recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press, roughly one in 10 Americans said they
routinely gleaned information about the presidential race from
late-night talk shows like Letterman's.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Gore, in particular, to consent to such an encounter is
not an enormously heavy lift. Chris Lehane, his campaign press
secretary, said that the vice president has already accepted about
40 invitations to debate Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``No real Texan would duck such a challenge,'' Lehane said.
``Davey Crockett didn't run away from the Alamo. Then again, he was
a Tennessean.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush have already been guests on Letterman's show,
though Bush made an uncomfortable appearance on the program by
satellite during the primaries that was widely viewed as a
political minus for him.
</P>
<P>
   Pope remains very optimistic. ``We think this will pretty much
decide the election,'' she said.

TWO SALT LAKE CITY OLYMPIC BID ORGANIZERS INDICTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After rejecting plea deals in recent days, the two chief
organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to win the 2002 Winter Olympics
were indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury on charges of
conspiracy to commit bribery, fraud and racketeering related to the
vote-buying scandal that erupted in late 1998 and threatened the
future of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-count indictment alleges that Thomas Welch, 55, the
former president of the Salt Lake City bid committee, and David
Johnson, 41, the former vice president, paid $1 million to
improperly influence the votes of more than a dozen delegates of
the International Olympic Committee, which awards the host sites
for the Winter and Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The two former officials also secretly paid an official of the
U.S. Olympic Committee to assist in Salt Lake City's bid, drew up a
series of bogus contracts, falsified books, records and other
documents to conceal their activities, and diverted $130,000 in bid
committee money for personal use, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson became the fourth and fifth persons to be
prosecuted in the Salt Lake City scandal, and according to the
indictment were the ones most directly involved in the plan to win
votes through lavish spending and gift-giving to IOC delegates. A
series of revelations about the scandal in late 1998 and early in
1999 severely damaged the Olympics and the credibility of the IOC,
and threatened to topple the committee's president, Juan Antonio
Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Ten delegates either resigned or were forced out in the wake of
the scandal. Late last year, acknowledging that the bid process had
become corrupted, the IOC instituted a policy that prohibits its
members from visiting cities seeking to host Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Welch and Johnson rejected a plea deal they described
as too sweeping in what they would have to admit to. Subsequent
efforts by their lawyers and prosecutors to reach a deal were
unavailing. In Thursday's indictment, they were charged with one
count of conspiracy, five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire
fraud and four counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
Each charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the charges have been reported previously in great
detail. The one new charge that has surfaced in recent days
concerned money that Welch and Johnson allegedly used for personal
purposes. Jet Set Sports, a New York-based ticket and travel agent,
acknowledged in a statement on Wednesday that it was cooperating
with federal authorities regarding $130,000 in a series of cash
payments that it made to the Salt Lake City bid officials in 1994
and 1995, before the 2002 Games were awarded. At the time, the
company was seeking to become an official Olympic sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Max Wheeler, Johnson's attorney, had told reporters in Salt Lake
City that the company made the donations because it stood to make a
significant profit as an official Olympic travel broker, which it
later became. Wheeler said the money was spent on bid activities,
not personal enrichment. The indictment describes a series of cash
payments totaling $130,000 made by a potential Olympic sponsor to
Welch and Johnson at airports and hotels between August of 1994 and
May of 1995. The 2002 Games were awarded on June 16, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued through his Washington-based attorney,
Welch denied that he and Johnson had committed any wrongdoing.
Wheeler has said repeatedly that the two Olympic officials were
being made scapegoats for participating in what had become a common
practice among bid cities of providing exorbitant favors for
members of the IOC in order to secure their votes. Both men have
denied bribing any delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to assure everyone,'' Welch said in the statement,
``that David Johnson and I committed no crime. I took no pay from
the bid effort. I did not ask for or receive anything personally
from the (bid) committee or from anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   An independent ethics panel investigating Salt Lake City's bid
concluded that officials had given more than $1.2 million in cash
payments, scholarships, jobs, medical treatment, shopping sprees,
excessive travel and expensive baubles to IOC delegates and their
families. The panel pointed most of the blame at Welch and Johnson,
who, in turn, have said that there was widespread knowledge and
approval of their activities in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Ten delegates of the IOC either resigned or were forced out in
the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal, which became public late in
1998. Since then, it has been revealed that similar bidding
practices also occurred in Atlanta's securing of the 1996 Summer
Olympics, Nagano, Japan's hosting the 1998 Winter Games and Sydney,
Australia's bid to win the 2000 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 of the IOC's 114 delegates have been linked to various
bidding improprieties, both major and minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we defrauded the bid committee or anybody else
is preposterous,'' Welch said in his statement. ``So is the charge
that we bribed anybody. But that does not change the fact that we
will be photographed and booked like common criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, who is Johnson's attorney, called the charges ``ill
advised'' and said they may ``jeopardize the effective presentation
of the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both men seemed to rule out accepting any further plea offer
that might come from federal prosecutors. Current Salt Lake City
Olympic officials have expressed concern that the specter of a
trial will further cloud their efforts to prepare and continue to
raise sponsorship money for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said: ``We and our families must go through the agony of a
criminal trial on the eve of the Games because we did what we, and
many other people, thought was absolutely necessary and in keeping
with the ideals of the community. We will defend ourselves and we
will be acquitted, but no one can possibly understand the
heartbreak and disappointment I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   David Simmons, a Salt Lake City businessman, had pleaded guilty
to tax offenses related to an alleged sham telecommunications job
provided to Jung Hoon Kim, the son of a powerful IOC delegate from
South Korea named Kim Un-Yong. The son, known as John Kim, has been
indicted but has left the country and is considered a fugitive by
the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Alredo La Mont, formerly in charge of international relations
for the USOC, had also pleaded guilty to tax charges related to
payments he secretly received from the Salt Lake bid committee for
his effort as a consultant to help secure the 2002 Winter Games.

 C-CELLPHONE-NUISIANCES-$ADV23-NYT  
 (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Cell phones, mobile radios, faxes
and tiny digital assistants were supposed to make life better in
this brave new world of communications, . But sometimes, it seems,
they have only made it more of a trial.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I use e-mail and a fax machine and own a cell phone, but I
guess I'm not beeper-literate,'' writes Phyllis Spiegel of
Plainsboro, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls some unseasonably cold days in May, when she agreed
to stay in Princeton with children of some friends who were taking
a short trip to London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noise started the very first night I tried to sleep in the
master bedroom _ the sound of what I could have sworn was a
foghorn, at regular short intervals without letup,'' she writes.
``I thought it might have been the heating system in the lovely old
house. The children had no idea. It was driving me nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound continued for two more nights (and days). After the
second night, I moved into the den.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystery was solved when my friends came home. It was a
beeper, put in a basket on top of a dresser among a bunch of papers
and other materials.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a mobile radio operator and as president of Pro-Tec Mobile
Communications, a wireless communications company in Casa Grande,
Ariz., Catherine E. Sutter has heard a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Her store of anecdotes about communications equipment doesn't
stop with the one about the fellow who, while installing a two-way
radio in a new John Deere tractor, drilled four perfect holes into
a $900 fuel tank. Or the one about the installer who forgot to bolt
down the front seat of a new truck after installing a radio
underneath _ when the customer flipped the seat forward to store
some papers, it went through the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter has this one to add: A married customer, partying with
the boys, met a woman in a local bar. ``Knowing he needed to buy
himself some more time as they drove off in his truck to the next
bar, he proceeded to call his wife from the truck phone, using the
hands-free speaker,'' Sutter writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wife answered, he said he was still out with the
boys, and everyone was heading out to eat dinner and he would be
home later. Of course the wife complained, but she accepted his
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his drinking, he forgot to push the `end' button on
the phone. He then started romancing the girlfriend, suggesting a
hotel and complaining about his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over 20 minutes, the wife listened to their conversation,
never letting on that the hands-free speaker was still in the
active mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, the great benefits of cellular service caused
a divorce.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A day after Jay Leno complained on ``The Tonight Show'' about
the shouting of cell-phone users, Walter J. Hamilton, a retired
General Electric sales representative in New Milford, N.J., went
out to dinner with his wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   In the restaurant, a cell phone rang, and a man answered and
started talking loudly enough to disturb the chef in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   When the man completed his call, he said, ``Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton then said, ``Goodbye,'' too, and a chorus of other
``goodbyes'' sounded from around the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wave of laughter followed,'' Hamilton writes, ``much to the
discomfort of the cell-phone user.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Rosenberg, a sales director at Snowball.com, an Internet
company in San Francisco, was sitting out a long delay at the Los
Angeles International Airport by immersing himself in a book when a
woman within 10 feet of him initiated a cell phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next 10 minutes involuntarily listening to a
conversation about her date the previous night with a much older
man, and whether it made sense to see him again. Adding to his
torture was the woman's incessant use of ``anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   When the call ended, Rosenberg decided to speak up. ``Excuse me,
Miss,'' he said, ``but that was incredibly rude to subject us to
your personal conversation for such an extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   She shot back, ``My call is no different than two people having
a conversation next to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg is now philosophical. ``What I learned through my
experience at LAX airport is that there are two sides to this
issue, much like smokers and nonsmokers. And each side is convinced
its perspective is correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of smokers, however, public-space etiquette has
forced them to be more considerate of those around them. The
message is that it's not wrong to smoke, but it is wrong to force
your smoke on others in shared public space.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it may not be wrong to initiate a private cell phone
conversation while sitting in a public place, but from the looks of
it, it is inconsiderate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   June Lazerus of Manhattan says she was starting to believe that
she had integrated the cell phone into her experiential vocabulary.
Like so many other people, she was past the point where she thought
people were talking to themselves on the street, in an elevator or
on a bus when, in fact, they were talking on cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a long time to get to this point, and I admit to
some pride in having reached it,'' Lazerus says. ``Informed by my
new reality, I walked past a Starbucks a few days ago and barely
noted the young woman outside who was speaking to no one in
particular. I was halfway across the street before I realized my
mistake. She was not talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was asking politely for passers-by to help her out with
some change.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now for the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Theatergoers are now accustomed to the pre-curtain instruction
from the management to turn off all cell phones and beepers. But
Geoffrey W. Jackson, a retired banker from Manhattan, says he was
attending a New York City Ballet performance at the New York State
Theater in Lincoln Center when he encountered a memorable version.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcer's own beeper,'' he said, ``went off while he was
speaking.'' &QL;

LUCENT SAYS EARNINGS WILL MISS EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

or 888-346-9867.) By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies said Thursday that its financial results
would fall short of expectations for the next two quarters, at
least in part because the company had been caught off guard by
slower demand for traditional communications systems and the rising
importance of newer technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was the second major disappointment this year
for Lucent, North America's biggest maker of communications
equipment, and it sent the company's shares down about 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed a previous warning about its results
largely to a failure to fully exploit surging demand for optical
communications gear, which transmits information using pulses of
light.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that failure could be considered a one-time
mistake. But Thursday the company disclosed a deeper set of
problems, led by slowing demand for the company's core telephone
switches, a product line that has consistently made a big
contribution to Lucent's bottom line. In addition, sales of more
advanced systems have not picked up the revenue slack as quickly as
the company had expected, even as the new products generate smaller
profit margins than the old.
</P>
<P>
   The new chief financial officer of the company said Thursday
that many of the company's internal systems were antiquated and
that the company could take significant reorganization charges as
it attempts a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   And the chairman, Richard McGinn, said Thursday that significant
changes in Lucent's executive ranks could be announced by the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But not everything is looking down at Lucent, which is based in
Murray Hill, N.J. For its third quarter, the company announced
earnings that slightly beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the unit that makes semiconductors and internal
components for optical systems is doing well, and the company said
Thursday that it would spin off that division as a separate
company. Lucent said it would sell up to 20 percent of the newly
independent operation to the public early next year and distribute
its remaining stake in the unit to Lucent's shareholders next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   That distribution could prove a windfall for Lucent's holders,
but Thursday provided anything but. The company's shares fell
$10.375, to $54.25, shaving more than $33 billion from Lucent's
market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disappointment to us,'' McGinn said Thursday morning
in a conference call with financial analysts. ``This isn't in a
sense in keeping with the `contract' we have with our investors. No
one is more disappointed about this than I am, and I take this
personally. I'm accountable for what happened and for what we need
to do to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most visible part of Lucent's troubles is slowing demand for
traditional telephone switches and for the software that powers
those switches. Companies like Lucent usually made a lot of their
money by selling new software for features like Caller ID, call
waiting and three-way calling.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many communications carriers are placing more emphasis on
developing new data and Internet products than on developing new
voice features. And when they do introduce new voice features, they
are finding ways to do so without being locked into the proprietary
software traditionally sold by Lucent and its brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lucent's new breed of optical and data communications
products are taking longer than expected to come to the market in
force. The company is also feeling pressure on its earnings because
of its cat-and-mouse relationship with some of its own customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going to a car dealer at the end of the month,''
said Steven Levy, a communications equipment analyst at Lehman
Brothers. ``Customers behave the way you train them to behave. When
you're struggling to make a very aggressive sales target, the
customer might not be ready to buy a certain product, so you go to
them and say: `OK, I need to make my number so I'll give you better
terms, or I'll finance it, or I'll discount it.' That's one reason
why Lucent's gross margins have been disappointing for four
quarters in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent also said it lost a big chunk of a major overseas
contract but would not identify the customer. Some analysts
speculated that it was the Saudi Arabian communications monopoly,
while others suggested it was a Chinese communications company.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, underlying all the problems are internal systems
that Deborah Hopkins, who was named Lucent's chief financial
officer in April, describes as largely inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways we are probably still running with AT&AMP;T
processes,'' Hopkins said in an interview Thursday, referring to
Lucent's legacy as part of AT&AMP;T. ``We can now rethink how we do
everything. An example would be billing. Why isn't billing on the
Web? The more you can simplify billing, the easier it is to
collect. That goes to procurement. Why don't we use e-procurement
so we can minimize the layers of handoff and the number of people
involved?''
</P>
<P>
   To get back on track in its next fiscal year, the company will
probably announce a reorganization within the next few months.
``There could be a sizable charge, but there will be a payback and
a business case behind it,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said that one arena for structural change could be the
unit that serves big communications carriers. If that happens, one
prime candidate for reorganization would appear to be Patricia
Russo, an executive vice president who runs that group.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said Thursday that its earnings from continuing
operations in its fourth quarter, which ends in September, would
grow about 15 percent compared with figures in the period a year
earlier, leading analysts to say that the company would earn about
$1.10 a share this year. The consensus estimate by analysts polled
by First Call/Thomson Financial had been $1.27 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Lucent's other guidance, analysts said the company was
now projecting to earn about $1.32 a share for its 2001 fiscal
year. The consensus estimate had been $1.55.
</P>
<P>
   For the most recent quarter, Lucent Thursday reported revenue of
$8.7 billion, up 18 percent from $7.4 billion in the period a year
earlier. Including special charges, Lucent reported a loss of $301
million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a gain of $763 million,
or 24 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it would have earned $1 billion, or 30 cents a
share, without the charges. Analysts had expected the company to
earn 29 cents a share on that basis, according to First Call.

 &HT;    `I've decided it's time to do something different. To stretch my
wings.'
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kenny Leon, the artistic director and actor who
ignited a sputtering Alliance Theatre Company and moved it toward
the front rank of regional theaters in the 1990s, is stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Leon _ a rising star of the national theater
scene who has brought whites and blacks together over idealistic
plays _ dropped the bombshell announcement Thursday. He will leave
the Alliance at the end of the upcoming season, around June 30,
2001. The director seemed almost as stunned as his staffers by the
decision he had reached Tuesday night, while on a golfing vacation
in Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an emotional day,'' Leon said. ``I decided it's
time to do something different. To stretch my wings. I'll finish
this season _ and I'm excited about it _ but then I have no idea
what I'll do. I have faith that when word gets around,
opportunities will present themselves. I hope theater will be at
the heart of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon, who next month opens his 11th season as artistic director,
leaves the Alliance with its national profile at an all-time high.
And its finances _ not his direct responsibility _ at a new low, $1
million in the red. The 32-year-old theater co-produced the 1998
tryout of ``Aida,'' the Disney hit musical on Broadway, and
premiered the nationally acclaimed Pearl Cleage's ``Blues for an
Alabama Sky'' and Alfred Uhry's ``The Last Night of Ballyhoo''
(winner of the 1997 Tony Award for best play).
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny's talent created an identity for that theater,'' said
Ben Cameron, executive director of Theatre Communications Group,
the New York-based service organization for regional theaters.
``But 11 years is a long time to run a theater these days. Kenny's
decision fits the pattern _ especially for younger directors _
feeling that they can't make the lifetime commitment of that
earlier generation of founding directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Leon never used the word ``burnout,'' the
syndrome lurked like a shadow over his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I gave the news to Debbie Shelton (Alliance board chair)
the other night, I felt like a great weight was lifted from me, and
yet I was saddened,'' said Leon, who grew up poor in rural Florida
and rose through the Atlanta theater scene after graduating from
Clark College in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a common refrain among those who have left similar
posts in recent years, Leon added, ``The administrative part of
this job is a big drain, it takes me away from the art that I love.
I would like to spend 60 percent of my life directing, and the
other 40 percent either acting, or producing new work, or getting
into independent films . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Leon gave what sounded like a weary laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, I'm going to need a job, man! Maybe McDonald's
has some openings.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone was more somber in the Alliance offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dumbfounded and haven't had time to digest this,'' said
board chair Shelton. ``Kenny has articulated so beautifully our
mission of bringing the community together. The growing diversity
of our audience (about 3-to-1, white to black) and our position on
the national stage is due to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Beauchamp Carr, vice president of the Woodruff Arts Center:
``Sometimes I feel a little amazed that we have managed to keep
Kenny here as long as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon's announcement comes exactly 10 years after the Alliance
board's equally surprising choice of the director, who had no
administrative experience but had dazzled local audiences with his
talent as the theater's associate director. He remains one of just
two African-Americans to lead a flagship regional theater. The
timing of his departure is ironic, for Leon won his hard early
battles for black plays and players; the biracial ``Christmas
Carol'' is a perennial smash. Indeed, recently Leon's drifted
toward more crowd-pleasers on the main stage, though audience
numbers have been erratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a challenge to get people in seats _ it's the same
in New York or anywhere,'' Leon noted. ``Was the deficit a burden
on me? Not particularly. No one was pressuring me to do anything
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   `ONE OF THE LAST PLAYERS'
</P>
<P>
   With Leon's departure, the Atlanta talent drain becomes a
hemorrhage. Those making exits in recent months _ often for greener
cultural pastures _ have included Ned Rifkin of the High Museum of
Art, Chris Coleman of Actor's Express, Yoel Levi of the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra and Harriet Sanford of the Fulton County Arts
Council. Their common laments: not enough financial support,
audience apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Leon told the Journal-Constitution last November that he felt,
``I am one of the last players left on the team, and that's a scary
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The director then claimed to be staying put. Ken Bernhardt,
then-Alliance board chairman, said the specter of losing Leon
``scares the hell out of me,'' but that the director was ``morally
and contractually obligated to stay through the 2001-2002 season.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the ramifications of breaking that contract _
whether, for instance, his salary (believed to be around $100,000)
might now be open to renegotiation _ Leon said, ``I don't think
there will be a problem.'' Shelton said there has been no time to
consider that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Leon will be ``intimately involved in the national, or even
international, search for a successor,'' Shelton added, but would
not mention any candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pushing the panic button,'' said Gus Stuhlreyer,
Alliance managing director. ``We have time for a smooth transition,
and with David Bell (associate director) and Rosemary Newcott
(children's theater director) on board, we're at no loss for
leadership. But there's no question Kenny is our inspirational _
not just artistic _ leader.''
</P>
<P>
   And Leon is at no loss for opportunity _ burger-flipping jokes
aside. He's a superb actor (1998's ``The Blood Knot'' at Theatrical
Outfit) with movie-star looks. He's in steady demand for freelance
directing at such leading regionals as the Goodman Theatre of
Chicago and New York's Joseph Papp Public Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   NO DEFINITE PLANS
</P>
<P>
   Following his collaboration on ``Aida,'' Disney hired Leon to
develop a basketball musical called ``Hoopz'' with Broadway
dancer-choreographer Savion Glover (``Bring in 'Da Noise . . .'').
Although the project was shelved, it sparked speculation that
Disney, film studios or commercial theater producers might be
dangling even bigger offers.
</P>
<P>
   Leon waved the rumors away.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's knocking on my door right now,'' he said. He added
that there were no overriding personal factors in his decision; no
children, for example, from his marriage to Carol Mitchell Leon,
which ended in divorce in 1998. Leon would like to keep ties to the
Alliance and Atlanta, but doubts that there will be enough local
opportunity to allow him to remain here after the close of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been praying and thinking for a long time to know what
kind of change I need in my life,'' Leon said. ``I hope in the next
year to have a clearer idea of what I was put on this planet to
do.''

 (For release Sunday, July 23)  
 By MARK HURLBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Finance professors are by their
nature a skeptical group, but their contempt for the market
forecasting practice known as ``charting'' has been especially
notable.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charting is the branch of technical analysis that tries to
predict price changes in a stock on the basis of certain visual
patterns in a chart of its historical prices or volume data. In
some academic circles, charting is dismissed out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a new study, much of this scorn may have
resulted from a simple breakdown in communication between the
academics and the chartists. The study was prepared by Andrew W.
Lo, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Jiang Wang, a professor of
finance at MIT; and Harry Mamaysky, a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, academics didn't comprehend the chartists' argot,
which is filled with terms like ``double top'' _ the pattern that
is formed after two successive rallies end at more or less the same
price, which is supposed to signal weakness in a stock's share
price.
</P>
<P>
   If academics had only understood what the chartists were talking
about, the study contends, they might have found much with which
they could agree.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following sentence: ``The presence of clearly
identified support and resistance levels, coupled with a one-third
retracement parameter when prices lie between them, suggests the
presence of strong buying and selling opportunities in the near
term.'' That mouthful is crystal clear to a chartist but is
inscrutable, if not ridiculous, to an academic.
</P>
<P>
   How about this one, written in professor-speak: ``The magnitudes
and decay pattern of the first 12 autocorrelations and the
statistical significance of the Box-Pierce Q-statistic suggest the
presence of a high-frequency predictable component in stock
returns.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lo and his co-authors, the two sides' sentences say
essentially the same thing: that past prices contain information
that may be useful in predicting future movements.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it take so long to discover that chartists and finance
professors may at times be basically in agreement? In part, it is
because of the difficulties of translating chartists' visual
pattern recognition into the mathematics on which academics rely.
</P>
<P>
   The professors believe, however, that recent advances make the
translation easier. Because charting patterns can now be expressed
in terms that academics can understand and measure, they say,
researchers can now focus on gauging which charting techniques
actually work.
</P>
<P>
   The authors have done so with five popular but previously
elusive chart patterns, known as head and shoulders, broadening
tops (and the related bottoms), triangles, rectangles and double
tops (and the related bottoms). After defining them mathematically,
the researchers back-tested the patterns' predictive prowess on
price data for 750 stocks over 35 years ending in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One of their findings is that the patterns predict the future
direction of Nasdaq stocks better than they do exchange-listed
issues. Some that seemed to work well as buy or sell signals for
Nasdaq shares failed utterly when applied to exchange-listed
stocks. More research is needed to determine why that should be so.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five patterns studied, two worked particularly well with
both kinds of stocks in forecasting price weakness: double tops and
the so-called head and shoulders _ a pattern in which a stock
rallies and falls back again three successive times, with the
second of the three rallies (the head) advancing further than
either the first or the third (the shoulders).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Lo and his colleagues did not calculate the
returns that would have been garnered had investors bought and sold
stocks based on signals from the chart patterns. The results, they
conclude, simply suggest that charting ``can add value to the
investment process.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, from a team of academics, that's a remarkable
endorsement. &QL;

 &HT;    Banged-up Mets vow to make a late push
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To be fair about it, the New York Mets are a wounded
team, with three every-day players currently on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   They are finishing up the longest road trip of the season, an
11-game, 12-day voyage that has kept them away from Shea Stadium
since July 9.
</P>
<P>
   They also are in the year's most brutal segment of the schedule,
with 53 of 58 games coming against winning teams. Sixteen of those
dates pit New York against first-place clubs.
</P>
<P>
   So much for fairness. Now the question that is being asked in
two National League cities this weekend: When does the contending
start?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who open a weekend series at Turner Field tonight,
have never let the Braves out of arm's length, chasing them from
second place every day since June 8. They have gotten as close as
one game back, and have lagged as far back as 6 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long summer. But the Braves continue to brace themselves
for a rush, forecast before spring camp opened, that has yet to
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good,'' said Mets reserve third baseman Lenny
Harris. ``We're keeping the torch lit until we get healthy. And
then we push.''
</P>
<P>
   That Harris was speaking on behalf of the Mets explains some of
the situation. A five-team journeyman over his 13 seasons, Harris
is currently starting for Gold Glove third baseman Robin Ventura,
who is out with a bruised rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Harris starts next to Melvin Mora, who is subbing for Gold Glove
shortstop Rey Ordonez, out for the year with a broken arm. Starting
behind them in center field is Jay Payton, who has taken starter
Darryl Hamilton's spot while he recovers from foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed starter Rick Reed just got off the DL, three weeks
after Andruw Jones broke his wrist with a line drive. The club has
had to call up seven players from Class AAA Norfolk in the past
month alone. The call for a deal for Cincinnati's Barry Larkin,
fanned by the New York tabloids, has taken on religious fervor.
</P>
<P>
   When last they met, the Mets split a four-game series with a
pair of stirring victories _ recall the seven-run comeback _ but
given the chance to seize a share of first place on July 2, New
York fell to Tom Glavine 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, the Mets are 6-9, having won just one series in
five. Since the All-Star break, while the Braves have gone 6-1
through the first game of Thursday's doubleheader, New York has
managed a 4-4 record, the second-place deficit going from three
games at the break to 5 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend could tighten things back up. But to be fair about
it, the opposite could happen, too.

<P>
   Racing through the Alps in a teetering bus, cheering on packs of
professional cyclists jockeying for position at 50 miles an hour,
Gail Sonnenberg has one thing in mind: increasing sales at the
United States Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   As senior vice president of sales for the quasi-independent
agency, Sonnenberg began overseeing its sponsorship of the United
States cycling team in 1997. That was just as Lance Armstrong
emerged from his bout with cancer to join the squad _ whose
uniforms are emblazoned with the Postal Service logo.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sonnenberg, based in Arlington, Va., treks to races in this
country and abroad, drumming up new business _ especially from the
team's many other corporate backers. ``Like any other sponsorship,
it's about building our brand,'' she said last week over the blare
of loudspeakers announcing that the team still had the lead in the
Tour de France, which ends Sunday. ``This is not something we do
because it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Postal Service landed the title sponsorship for the
team in 1996, it hoped to grab international business away from
competitors who operate overseas, where cycling is adored. But the
team's success _ last year, it was the first American squad to win
the Tour de France _ has also been a point of pride at the post
office, a place historically short on morale.
</P>
<P>
   The tour gives Sonnenberg access to executives of sponsors like
Nike and Bike.com _ companies whose online sales can be shipped
through the post office _ as well as Visa, which does much of its
marketing by mail. In 1999, relationships with sponsors brought the
post office $10 million, she said, more than offsetting the cost of
being the team's title sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory last year, the Postal Service slapped its logo
on biking paraphernalia and started selling it over the Internet.
But that extra revenue may pale in comparison with the exposure
that its best-known cyclist, Armstrong, brings to an otherwise
banal brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like traveling with the Beatles,'' Sonnenberg said,
referring to the crowds that encircle Armstrong at races. ``This
was an awfully lucky venture for us.''

<P>
   It happened 30 years ago, but it's still one of David T. Link's
favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
   He was a partner at the Chicago law firm Winston &AMP; Strawn, and
the Greyhound Corp., his biggest client, had struck a deal to buy a
small company. Link discovered that the target company had
undervalued its inventory by nearly $1 million. He persuaded
Greyhound, which was at first reluctant, to increase its bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many law schools teach that a lawyer's obligation ends at
maximizing the client's profits,'' Link said. ``I say there's a
moral obligation to get justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Link was content to promulgate that idea at the
Notre Dame Law School, where he had been the dean for 24 years. But
then, the Rev. Dennis Dease, president of St. Thomas University in
Minneapolis, asked him to design and run its new faith-based law
school, to open in September 2001. He jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a challenge!'' said Link, who is 63. ``I get to start a
new Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   As Link sees it, doctors heal the body, ministers heal the soul
and lawyers heal society. ``I don't think there is a legal question
that doesn't have a moral facet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not _ but should lawyers act on those moral facets?
Definitely not, said Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor who
is now a lawyer at Wilkie, Farr &AMP; Gallagher. He remembers once
bridling when an appeals court applied concepts of morality to a
breach-of-contract suit. ``The chief judge wrote, `The result was
unjust; the case is reversed,''' Cuomo recalled. ``My reaction was,
what standard is he applying? The Koran? The Talmud? How can anyone
use the law to make people behave in ways that are not required by
the law itself?''
</P>
<P>
   To Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard Law School professor, Link's
concept of lawyer as healer is a pragmatic impossibility. ``Clients
will say, `You are not my priest, you are not my mother; I've
decided to make money, and if you won't help me, I'll get another
lawyer,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are all  &UR;  &LR; professors at Catholic law schools in tune with
Link's approach. Here is how John Q. Barrett, an associate
professor at St. John's University School of Law in New York,
reacted to the Greyhound story: ``It's the seller's lawyer's
responsibility to notice that assets were undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Link does not agree. ``You can't teach law as though
it's value-free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is setting up St. Thomas to reflect that idea. He has signed
up local lawyers whose values he likes as mentors to St. Thomas'
students. St. Thomas will help pay off the loans of students who go
into public service jobs. It will offer joint degrees in law and
social work, divinity, education or business, and will staff its
law clinic with people from those disciplines as well. ``If
someone's problem has more than a legal aspect, we can walk them
across the hall,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has 183 accredited law schools _ three in
Minneapolis alone _ and 25 Catholic law schools, but Link is
garnering converts nonetheless. Dease says that St. Thomas has
received more than 500 letters of inquiry from prospective
students, and more than 360 letters from would-be faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   ``David believes so strongly in faith-based law that he is an
apostle,'' Dease said.
</P>
<P>
   David Link grew up in Sandusky, Ohio, the youngest of six
children in a strict Catholic home. He often visited his father, a
car dealer, at work. Early on, he was struck by how well his father
treated customers _ and how much repeat business he got.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom taught us that ethics were necessary even if they
hurt,'' Link recalled. ``My father showed me that ethics could help
make you successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Link attended Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., and majored in
advertising and philosophy. He had expected to take over his
father's dealership with his brothers; the plan was scrapped when
his father sold the business.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time he toyed with becoming a journalist _ after
all, he met Barbara, now his wife of 42 years and mother of his
four children, while working on his high school newspaper _ but
wound up attending Notre Dame Law School.
</P>
<P>
   When he graduated in 1961, he became a lawyer for the Internal
Revenue Service. He became friends with the IRS chief counsel,
Crane Houser _ ``He liked my JFK imitations,'' Link recalled _ and
when Houser joined Winston &AMP; Strawn, Link followed him. He took a
leave in 1970 to help Notre Dame set up a program for teaching tax
law. He never came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, I'm in my 31st year of leave,'' said Link, who
became the dean of the Notre Dame Law School in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has' stayed put since then. In the late '80s he took
a leave to set up a Catholic law school in Australia. He visits
South Africa three times a year, to consult for a law school he
helped set up there.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Link has helped to build houses for homeless people in
South Bend. He was a mentor to Notre Dame's minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of African-Americans balk at going to a Catholic school
in the Midwest, but Dean Link helped us recruit,'' said Elton
Johnson, a second-year law student at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Even former students who have gone into politics _ a profession
not always known for its ethical stances _ say they have been
influenced by Link's willingness to walk the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Durant, a 1976 Notre Dame law school graduate, consulted
with Link before running unsuccessfully for a Michigan seat in the
U.S. Senate in 1990. ``I always valued David's counsel, his belief
that being a leader goes beyond just teaching law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Cari Jr., another of his former students at Notre
Dame, was Sen. Joseph Biden's campaign manager in his bid for the
Democratic nomination for president in 1988, and when his candidate
got crushed, his first reaction was to leave politics. ``But I kept
hearing David's voice, saying you must do constructive things in
times of pain,'' Cari said.
</P>
<P>
   Cari is now finance chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. Last year, when Cari was named chairman of the Woodrow
Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, he invited
Link to the swearing-in ceremony. ``It just wouldn't have felt the
same without David,'' he said. &QL;

DNA INNOVATION ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO DISRUPT AIDS VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ohio)   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists at the University of Texas have invented a novel and
apparently far-reaching method of singling out precise regions of
DNA. The method can be used both to disrupt particular genes and to
add new genetic material at a specific site.
</P>
<P>
   As a first use, the biologists have shown that they can disrupt
both the AIDS virus and the human gene for the receptor that the
virus uses to gain access to human cells.
</P>
<P>
   The chief inventor, Dr. Alan M. Lambowitz, said that if further
laboratory tests succeeded, he wanted to take T-cells from AIDS
patients, disrupt the cells' receptor gene and return the cells to
the patients, in the hope that the cells resisted further attack
just like those of people naturally unaffected by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   T-cells are the infection-fighting cells of the immune system
that are a principal target of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Lambowitz's method could also boost gene therapy, the concept of
inserting corrective genes into patients to treat a wide variety of
diseases. That field still has many obstacles, and one major
drawback is that the viruses now used to deliver new genes to human
cells insert their cargo at random sites in the chromosome. In
delivering new genes to a precisely designated site, the new
method, if it works, would be safer and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of being able to insert new genes into a ``safe
harbor'' in the genome ``would be very important for future gene
therapy,'' said Dr. Ronald Crystal, a gene therapist at New York
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Savio Woo, a gene therapist at Mount Sinai Medical School,
said the new method was ``in principle very exciting, because it
provides a specific means of inactivating a particular gene in a
human genome.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique was developed by Lambowitz and Dr. Huatao Guo at
Texas and by colleagues at other institutions, and is described in
Friday's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Their work is based on a discovery about introns, pieces of DNA
that are found inserted in between the working parts of genes in
many species. The cell strips out the intronic DNA and splices the
remaining segments together before using the information to make a
protein.
</P>
<P>
   Lambowitz had been working with a kind of intron found in
bacteria. The intron did not always sit passively in the
bacterium's chromosome but would instead sometimes spring free and
reinsert itself at another site in the bacterial DNA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Lambowitz found that in choosing its new site, the
intron looked for a string of 14 DNA letters that matched 14
letters in its own structure. He realized that by changing some of
these 14 letters in the intron's own structure, he might be able to
make it insert itself at any desired point in a DNA molecule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were carrying out basic research on Group II introns and
how they related to gene structure,'' he said. ``Any kind of
practical applications was the furthest thing from our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's article, he and colleagues described how they
designed introns that disrupted the human CCR5 receptor, a protein
that studs the surface of human cells and is exploited as a
trapdoor by the AIDS virus to gain entry to the cell. People with a
certain variant form of the receptor are immune to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial introns all inserted themselves in the intended
position in the receptor gene, the scientists reported. Other
introns attacked specified points in the form of the AIDS virus
that lay latent in cells.
</P>
<P>
   These experiments were conducted in human cells grown in the
laboratory. The receptor gene and the AIDS virus were not in their
usual position in the chromosomes but rather, for ease of
experiment, were carried in small rings of DNA known as plasmids.
Lambowitz said he now needed to test whether the attack introns
worked as well against targets in the chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State University, where work on the new method started, has
applied for a patent on it, as has the University of Texas. A
company, InGex, has been formed to exploit the method. Lambowitz,
who is a scientific adviser to the company, said practical
applications included disrupting deleterious genes in the microbes
used to make wine and cheese and making new vaccines by knocking
out the pathogenic genes in harmful bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Besides disrupting target genes, the introns can be used to
insert new genetic material into DNA. The longest piece of inserted
material so far is 2,000 DNA letters in length. Most human genes
are far longer, but Lambowitz said the full carrying capacity of
introns had not yet been assessed.
</P>
<P>
   He said the method should be useful in any kind of genetic
engineering where genes must be inserted at a specific site, and in
any genome project where the function of an unknown gene could be
ascertained by disrupting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have designed a better way of inserting DNA,''
Lambowitz said. ``If you set out to do it, you never would have
thought of it. But nature did it in the course of evolution.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the confidence displayed by Gov. George W.
Bush's campaign, the presidential election today stands as a very
competitive contest, with ample time and opportunity for either him
or Vice President Al Gore to surge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At a first glance of the electoral map, Bush is leading in
enough states to assure him an electoral college victory. But in
many of those states, the governor's margin is quite slim.
Moreover, Election Day is more than three months off, and the
contest is entering a crucial phase where the choice of running
mates and the message the conventions deliver could define the
race.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of opinion polls state by state, along with
interviews with Republican and Democratic strategists in the
campaigns and around the country, found enough crucial states that
are so competitive that those midsummer events, and the fall
debates to follow, could overturn the current standings in state
after state. Or they could solidify Bush's position.
</P>
<P>
   No dominant national issue is defining the race. So if the
contest remains relatively tight, the outcome in crucial states
could be decided by local considerations such as Republicans in the
Philadelphia suburbs deserting their party over abortion _ or by
Democrats in Michigan rallying to the Green Party banner of Ralph
Nader.
</P>
<P>
   For all the emphasis in the press on national polls, where Bush
has maintained long-standing but narrowing leads, both campaigns
are paying closer attention to the outlook in individual states,
because the goal for each side is to plot a path to collect the 270
electoral votes needed for victory.
</P>
<P>
   The state-by-state considerations are so vital that, to a large
degree, they are driving the campaigns' advertising budgets and the
candidates' travel schedules.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gore's top lieutenants held a conference call to
make important decisions about which states they should pump more
resources into _ or not. Gore campaign officials said they had
decided, for instance, not to spend as much in Illinois as they had
planned because they feel confident in Gore's prospects there.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, one Bush campaign official said that Bush was
doing better than he expected in Arizona, Colorado and Montana and,
as a result, the campaign could scale back its spending in those
states.
</P>
<P>
   The state-by-state analysis shows that Gore is most potent along
the coasts, while Bush has an inland foundation in the South and
mountain states. That leaves the race to turn on several states in
the industrial Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bush appears safe in 18 states with 140 electoral
votes, from Texas to Alaska to Virginia. Another 11 states,
including Florida, Michigan and Oregon _ with a combined 138
electoral votes _ seem to be leaning his way, though many of them
could easily change quickly. If all these states went for Bush, it
would give him 278 electoral votes, 8 more than needed for
election.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president looks safe in 8 states, from New York to
California to Hawaii, and the District of Columbia, with 134
electoral votes. Another 4 states, from Connecticut to Illinois,
with 39 electoral votes, appear to be leaning his way.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves 9 states, including such powers as Pennsylvania and
New Jersey, as tossups. Combined, they account for 87 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, if Bush won all the states that are safe or
lean his way, with a total of 278 electoral votes, he could win
without taking any of the tossups. But while many more states are
leaning toward Bush, polls and politicians agree that in several
important states, the governor is barely ahead. It would not take a
shift of too many voters to deny him Ohio, Missouri and Florida,
and then his total would drop precipitously, to 221 electors.
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign agrees with this analysis. The Bush camp still
insists that the governor is comfortably ahead. Karl Rove, Bush's
chief strategist, said in an interview that Gore had made some
progress in drawing support from Democrats who had been reluctant
to support him. But he said there was no sign that he was pulling
any support from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some tightening, you bet, because he's bringing
the Democrats home,'' Rove said. ``But nationally, this race has
been essentially stuck at five or six points for the last four
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also been encouraged that Nader has siphoned
some support from Gore in several states, and by Bush's strength in
some historical Democratic pockets, like Minnesota. The race there
is a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Daley, chairman of the Gore campaign, disputed the
idea of even a tentative Bush advantage. ``I think it's basically a
dead heat, basically where it's been for months,'' Daley said.
``People aren't into it. There's a whole slew of states out there
because people aren't focused. Nothing has grabbed them yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the competitiveness came through in interviews in state
after state, where local party heads and strategists described
match-ups that they said were more competitive than in years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Graber, the chairman of the Republican Party in
Wisconsin, marveled at polls in his state showing Bush slightly
ahead. ``There is a different energy and a different feel from what
we had four years ago,'' Graber said. ``We were written off very
early in the process. There was no money in this state. There was
no TV. It was really free ride for Clinton. That's not the case''
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., agreed. He said the race in his
state _ where the last Republican to win was Ronald Reagan in 1984
_ was shaping up to be the most competitive in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be terribly close, and I think it could end up
being one of the two or three decisive states,'' he said.
``Everybody should fight like heck to win this state because it's
up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The competitiveness of Wisconsin helped explain why that is one
of 26 states Bush has campaigned in since May. (He was there for
two days.)
</P>
<P>
   Candidates spend very little time in states they expect to lose.
Gore has popped up in Indiana, for example, not once since May, or
about as often as Bush has traveled to Massachusetts (once).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes candidates take an occasional tactical foray designed
to befuddle the opposition. Gore traveled to Bush's home state of
Texas on Thursday not because he thinks he has a chance there but
to draw free national publicity as he condemned the governor's
record.
</P>
<P>
   And except if there is money to be collected, candidates do not
venture into states that they consider sure wins.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They campaign, in person and on television, in the states where
they think they lead or trail narrowly. For example, starting last
month, Gore began spending heavily on television ads aimed at 18
states: Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Georgia,
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Kentucky, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Missouri,
New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said the Gore commercials had no impact. ``There are now
seven states where we have polling that took place before their
advertising and polling that took place after,'' he said. ``And in
all seven of the states, we've held ground or moved up. The only
way it may have helped is to keep us from moving ahead.'' He said
the advertisements were ``based on a flawed assumption that people
are going to pay a lot of attention to advertising during the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School at the
University of Pennsylvania, disagrees with the Bush camp. She is
conducting the largest polling operation of the year, 100,000
interviews in key states night after night.
</P>
<P>
   She studied the eight states where Gore (through the financial
fig leaf of the Democratic National Committee) spent at least
$300,000 more than Bush (through the Republican National
Committee). Those states were Florida. Illinois, Louisiana,
Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, she found that Gore had gained 10 percentage points on
average in those states. ``He was closing substantially,'' she
said. ``It is reasonable to say the ads worked.''
</P>
<P>
   After months in which Bush seemed to have the advantage,
national polls made public this week showed the race closer than
previous surveys by the same organizations. Those national polls,
with their consistent methodology, provide a rough guidelines to
the contours of any presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close now, and the movement mainly is on Gore's end,''
said John Zogby, an independent pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts say today's electoral snapshot should hardly be
considered definitive since the public really is not paying much
attention to the campaign in midsummer. Professor Thomas Patterson
of Harvard, a student of public involvement in politics, said his
surveys showed that if people are not given a name but only asked
if they have presidential choice, half say they do not.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls, which offer names, find the undecided numbers as
low as 10 percent. As for the numbers reflecting people's
preferences, Mr. Patterson said, ``I think they are soft.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Here is an analysis of the outlook in several important states:
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN: Leans Bush. He has campaigned hard in the state, and
almost all of Nader's support, 8 percent in one recent poll, is
coming out of Gore's base. Hostility from the auto workers and
teamsters are making it harder for the vice president to capitalize
on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   MISSOURI: Leans Bush. This is always a swing state, and one that
has picked a presidential winner every time since 1960 Bush is
well-organized, and Gore has not solidified the union support that
is central to Democratic successes in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Leans Bush. But this is a wild card. Gov. Jeb Bush,
George W. Bush's brother, said in an interview he is determined not
to let his state slip through. ``I'm certainly not going to be
embarrassed and have the state go the other way,'' Jeb Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Al Cardenas, the state Republican chairman, said
he feared that Gore could pick Bob Graham, the popular senator from
the state, as his running mate, which would force a competition
there. ``If Graham gives him a couple of points in Florida, in a
tight race we obviously would have to work a little harder,'' said
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS: Leans Gore. Brad Goodrich, the Republican Party's
executive director, argues that Bush holds a slim lead and that
Gore's ads have had no effect. But Sen. Richard Durbin, a Democrat
and a potential running mate, said polling information he had
received from Gore headquarters showed the vice president now
leading by a few points. Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago is
expected to work hard for the Gore campaign now that his brother
William is in charge of it. He cannot do as much for Gore as the
legendary effort his father made for John F. Kennedy, but he still
matters politically.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO: Leans Bush. Polls in this state, which has a history of
close outcomes, have see-sawed. Robert Bennett, chairman of the
state Republican Party, said that while his candidate is ahead, it
is not by much. He is well aware that the dynamic could change as
the convention opens at the end of the month. ``We could have a
blow up at the convention of some sort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But David Leland, the state Democratic chairman, said it was no
accident Gore has ventured to the state at least nine times since
the campaign began. ``We won't lose this race for lack of
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY: Tossup. For most of the century, New Jersey has been
a close state in presidential campaigns _ and usually supports the
winner. Democrats say their only sure shot in the state would have
been if Sen. Bill Bradley had won the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA: Tossup. Gore is cutting into Republican strength
in the Philadelphia suburbs, while Bush is strong in the
southwestern mining counties, and has a strong state organization.
Bush would be strongly favored if he chose Gov. Tom Ridge to be his
running mate, but Sen. Arlen Specter fears the Texas governor could
lose support if it seems his only reason for rejecting Ridge is the
abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON: Tossup. Gore got a boost this week when the Clinton
administration decided not to blow up a dam on the Lower Snake
River to improve the salmon habitat. The issue had been killing him
in Eastern Washington where farmers depend on hydroelectric power.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ On Thursday, Arab residents of East Jerusalem had
been following the reports from Camp David for 10 days with rising
anticipation _ and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 33 years, it appears, Israel has signaled
a willingness to give up some control of the Arab neighborhoods it
annexed here after the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   What that means in practical terms is still moot. But far from
being welcomed as a victory for Palestinian nationalism, the
development has roused fears in East Jerusalem of a compromise that
would fall short of Palestinian aspirations for full sovereignty,
while putting at risk their current jobs, social services and
access to Palestinian and Israeli areas alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very hard time, because people don't know what is
going to happen to them,'' said Ahmed Libekert, the Palestinian
manager of the largest Israeli-run public health clinic in East
Jerusalem. ``My staff keeps asking me. But we just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, liberal editorialists praised Prime Minister Ehud
Barak for ``smashing the taboo'' on discussing a redivision of
Jerusalem. But in East Jerusalem, home to 210,000 Arabs, the
Israeli offer was widely scorned, as Barak reportedly refused to
consider ceding any Arab neighborhoods to a Palestinian state,
offering only limited autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, the demand for sovereignty in East Jerusalem
is practical as well as ideological. Barak's talk of ``high
fences'' between Israel and an independent Palestinian state has
aroused fears of an East Jerusalem severed from its West Bank
hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   There is also much quiet ambivalence about radical political and
economic change here.
</P>
<P>
   Since being involuntarily absorbed into Israel after the 1967
war, the residents of East Jerusalem have overwhelmingly refused to
opt for Israeli citizenship. But by Israeli law they are entitled
to the same benefits as other city residents.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hanan, who would not give her last name, is a 38-year-old mother
of six and a regular visitor to Libekert's clinic. She lives in
Beit Hanina, one of the East Jerusalem neighborhoods Israel is said
to be willing to cede to Palestinian rule. She says she worries
about the possible loss of her Israeli health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Ramallah,'' she said, citing the biggest nearby
Palestinian-ruled city. ``There are no health services there like
here. There is no proper social welfare system. The Palestinian
Authority didn't prove itself in Ramallah, so we are afraid of what
they would do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Randa, a young mother of two whose husband suffers from mental
illness, quietly agreed. ``My husband gets treatment in an Israeli
hospital,'' she said. ``If he was in Ramallah, they would not have
been able to provide him with the proper care.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Arab residents of East Jerusalem look forward to the
day when they can fly their own flag, answer to their own courts
and even pay taxes to a country that they consider their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think that because of the few shekels I get from the
national insurance, I want to give up my homeland?'' said Khader
Jabsheh, 70, from Shufat, an Arab neighborhood that Israel annexed
after the 1967 war. ``The insurance I get is my right. It is not a
gift from Israel. I have been paying taxes for over 30 years, and I
am entitled to get some of this money back.''
</P>
<P>
   But economic problems are not the only reason some Jerusalem
Arabs have misgivings about Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Jerusalem intellectuals and political activists,
fervid supporters of Palestinian independence though they may be,
have been openly critical of what they perceive to be the corrupt
and autocratic nature of Palestinian Authority rule.
</P>
<P>
   And some Christian Arabs were alarmed by reports this week that
Israel and the Muslim leader of the Palestinians were debating
control of Christian churches and residential districts in
Jerusalem's Old City. By one account, Arafat's negotiators were
pressing for the area around the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, but
were willing to concede to Israel the ancient Armenian Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual joint statement, the three patriarchs of the major
Christian churches in Jerusalem lodged a protest against any such
division. They called for ``a system of international guarantees''
of access to the Old City holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Most concerns, though, are not spiritual or political, but
economic. Many here who adamantly favor a full transfer of
sovereignty to a Palestinian state say they expect that change to
bring financial hardships.
</P>
<P>
   Arab residents have long complained about the inequities between
municipal services and educational spending in East Jerusalem and
Jewish West Jerusalem. Now, with nearby towns in the West Bank
under Palestinian rule, the disparities between East Jerusalem and
much poorer Palestinian areas have also come into sobering focus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ziad Abu Ziad, who oversees the Palestinian Authority's growing
operations in Jerusalem, notes that his department already runs 12
schools with about 15,000 students in East Jerusalem. By next year,
Palestinian officials say, they will control the administration and
curriculum of most schools in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Palestinians ``should copy the Israeli system'' and
put into effect a similar national health insurance plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, said Ibrahim Shami, a patient at an Israeli
clinic here, Jerusalem Palestinians should be prepared for
sacrifices. ``We may lose services, but we will gain a homeland,
and this is more important than any loss,'' he said.

 &HT;    'We're going to resurrect those glory days of yesteryear'
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ These days the only thing on the corner of Fifth
and Washington is a parking lot. So the closest thing to boxing
that happens here is a couple South Beach partiers squaring off for
an impromptu 3 a.m. bout.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time when the boxing universe revolved around
this spot. Until the bulldozers came in 1993, this was the home of
the Fifth Street Gym. During its 42-year life, at least 30
champions, from Sugar Ray Robinson to Sugar Ray Leonard, worked out
here. Both Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston trained here. Even the
Beatles once stopped by.
</P>
<P>
   Not that, even in its heyday, the gym was some sort of 1960s
Planet Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the second floor. No air-conditioning. Just big fans
stirring up the smell of sweat and rotting walls.
</P>
<P>
   A dive? Some might call it that. Others would say it was the
most beautiful place they ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here from north London seven years ago, the first
thing I did was make a beeline for the Fifth Street Gym,'' Trevor
Cedar says. ``You could feel the history.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedar, 34, is standing in the gym he opened two years ago at 715
Washington Ave., a couple blocks from the site of the Fifth Street
Gym. Sweat is pouring down his face, partly because he has just
finished moving some boxes and partly because the place doesn't
have air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough to bring back some of the old ``Guys and
Dolls'' ambience, the South Florida Boxing gym is on the second
floor, above the ``Vegas Cabaret.'' And to get to 7,000-square foot
former gymnastics studio, you enter a door on the ground floor and
walk through a hall with a giant mural on both sides. To your left,
a 10-foot Ali towers over you in a pose that instantly brings to
mind the famous photo from his upset of Liston in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   And where is Liston?
</P>
<P>
   On the right wall. Down by the ground. Lying on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to feel like you're entering the ring,'' Cedar
says. ``I wanted to bring back the feel of the Fifth Street Gym, of
that era.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Cedar hopes, is what will begin to happen Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 20 years since South Florida's last major
title fight: Aaron Pryor vs. Alexis Arguello in the Orange Bowl on
Nov. 12, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   And although some will argue that the matchup Saturday night at
AmericanAirlines Arena _ Felix Trinidad defending his WBA
superwelterweight title against Mamadou Thiam _ is too much of a
mismatch to rate as a ``major'' title fight, there is little
question this is the biggest boxing event South Florida has held in
years.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether it is a blip on the screen or, as people
such as Cedar hope, the revival of the golden era of boxing in
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never going to happen,'' said Steve Shepherd of West Palm
Beach's Spartan Boxing and Kickboxing.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Shepherd wouldn't like to see the top bouts return
to South Florida. He just believes that the current centers of the
boxing universe _ Las Vegas and Atlantic City _ have something to
offer that South Florida can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The casinos,'' he says. ``They pay fight fees to bring the
shows there. They bring in the high-rollers. You can't compete with
that. ... But it will be good (for South Florida boxing) if Don
King can get something started here.''
</P>
<P>
   King, the promoter of the Saturday's bouts, insists that the
fights are only a taste of what is to come to South Florida _
including West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the people of Palm Beach, that this is a precursor, a
harbinger so to speak,'' King said after a two-hour press
conference Thursday in downtown Miami. ``This is what will be
coming to Only in America Arena.''
</P>
<P>
   That, King says, is the tentative name for the former jai alai
front on 45th Street that he and his wife, Henrietta, paid $6.25
million for in June 1999. At the time, King, who owns a
14,000-square foot mansion in Manapalan, not only pledged to turn
the 300,000-square foot facility into a 10,000-seat venue that
would be like a ``miniature Madison Square Garden,'' he said it
could be done by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   By last October, Dutch Bliss, the Boca Raton-based contractor
handling the project, backed off that and said the arena more
likely would open by the end of 2000. Now, one year after the
purchase, some of King's associates predict it likely won't be
ready until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timetable is more or less in the hands of the county
fathers,'' King said. ``It has taken over a year of just going
through the due diligence. They've been very cooperative, very
supportive. But we move at a snail's pace up there.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, the commission voted to exempt King's project from rules
that would have required the widening of 45th Street. Several
county commissioners contacted this week said they are leaving it
up to King to set the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for the lack of progress, the commissioners
and King say they believe the project will come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to resurrect those glory days of yesteryear,''
King said Thursday, the cadence and volume of his voice rising.
``We're going to bring sports and entertainment together. It's
going to be a marriage made in heaven, and it only can be presented
by Don King in Only in America Arena in West Palm Beach. So get
ready y'all.''
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for boxing fans to hope that this is more than
hot air from the man with the hot hair. In the last couple years,
some fights have been held in arenas that normally play host to
other sporting events. Madison Square Garden in New York. The
Staples Center in Los Angeles. Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.
The Fox Theater in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most refreshing trends in the sport is the number
of fights being held in arenas rather than casinos,'' said HBO vice
president of programming Kerry Davis, one of the sports
movers-and-shakers. ``And if this fight does well here, other
fights are going to gravitate to this market.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Cedar, the transplanted Englishman who owns the
boxing gym in South Beach, hopes this fight will do. Help bring
more fights here. Maybe even help bring back memories of when this
place was the center of the boxing universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali ran down this street,'' he says, pointing at Washington
Avenue as if it is not a street but a shrine. ``I can't believe
they torn down the Fifth Street Gym. When that happened, you lost a
piece of American history.''

MCCAIN RE-EMERGES, AS POSSIBLE BUSH RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Months after John McCain adamantly closed the
door to accepting his party's vice presidential nomination, a
Republican close to the Arizona senator said Thursday that he would
take the No. 2 spot on the ticket if Gov. George W. Bush offered
it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's turnaround, which was described as reluctant, came as a
growing number of Republicans lobbied for him as the best possible
addition to the ticket. Some House Republicans, looking for help in
holding the House majority, were circulating a petition to Bush
saying he and the Arizona senator would make the best ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The senator signaled his willingness to be Bush's running mate
earlier this week in a telephone conversation with Pennsylvania
Gov. Tom Ridge, according to the Republican official close to
McCain. The officials said that Ridge telephoned McCain on Tuesday
to say that he felt he himself was no longer in the running for the
No. 2 slot and to urge McCain to put his name into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's new willingness to take the job, several
advisers to Bush were skeptical that the governor would consider
him. Karen P. Hughes, the governor's spokeswoman, said simply,
``Governor Bush has said all along that he takes Senator McCain at
his word that he does not wish to be considered for the vice
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Reeves, Ridge's spokesman, said the governor spoke with
McCain by telephone this week. But he would not divulge the
contents of the conversation. He said their discussion was ``not an
unusual event _ they've known each other for 20 years.'' Reeves
described their talk as ``a private conservation between them''
that he could not discuss.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long been considered an unlikely choice for Bush
because of the premium that the Texas governor places on loyalty
and the sometimes strained relations between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The attention that focused on McCain today may have been nothing
more than the wishful thinking of his loyalists. It also reflected
the frenzy of speculation among political insiders about what Bush
will do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain was among a number of politicians whose phone
numbers were collected Thursday by aides to Richard B. Cheney, the
former defense secretary who is heading Bush's search team, so that
the Bush campaign can let them know in the coming days of the Texas
governor's final decision.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not the only one being promoted. Bill Powers, the
chairman of the New York Republican Party, announced at one point
in the day that ``good sources'' had indicated to him that Gov.
George Pataki of New York was on the short list. But Pataki's aides
said immediately that they did not have such information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ridge, other possible candidates include: Govs.
Frank Keating of Oklahoma and James Gilmore III of Virginia; Sens.
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of
Tennessee; and Rep. John Kascih of Ohio. Former Sen. John Danforth
of Missouri, who pulled himself out of the running more than a
month ago, is drawing renewed speculation as well.
</P>
<P>
   Keating on Thursday said he submitted information on his
finances and health to Cheney several weeks ago and has not heard
from him since. ``That's why I'm not holding my breath,'' he said.
But later, a Republican strategist close to Keating said that the
Oklahoma governor's office had also been asked to provide Cheney
with weekend phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans believe Cheney himself is a contender. Bush
himself was asked about Cheney several times Thursday and did not
answer.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden indications that McCain would agree to be vice
president if asked were part of a strange dance that has been going
on for months, and even Thursday the McCain camp was sending mixed
signals. A Republican who knows McCain well insisted that he still
hoped he would not actually be asked to become the No. 2. ``It's
not something he would prefer to happen,'' said a close associate.

PANEL BACKS WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL ON MALL IN WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The old soldier, his voice cracking with emotion
and his battle-shattered right hand held against his chest, pleaded
with a federal panel Thursday to finally approve the first national
World War II memorial before all his aging comrades died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We earn a lot of titles in our lives,'' said the veteran, Bob
Dole, the Republican candidate for president in 1996 and longtime
senator from Kansas. ``The one that I am most proud of is
veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his wish. The panel, the Commission of Fine Arts, voted
6-0 to approve the memorial on a spot between the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   There was emotion on both sides. Opponents of the memorial,
which is to cost $100 million by the time it is scheduled to open
on Memorial Day 2003, challenged its design and its location.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture, they contended, was of the style favored by
the forces defeated by the United States and its allies in World
War II. One critic, Judy Scott Feldman, chairwoman of the National
Coalition to Save Our Mall, complained that the design was
``imperial and triumphal'' and was ``unacceptably reminiscent of
Fascist and Nazi regimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Helen Fagin, who settled in the United States after
being liberated by U.S. soldiers in Poland and who serves on an
advisory board that endorsed the memorial, said that it was ``very
offensive, egregious and disingenuous'' to compare the design with
Nazi architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics complained that its location blocked the grand
vista between the Washington and Lincoln monuments. John Graves, a
corporal in the war, said he represented veterans who wanted a
memorial, ``but not on that particular spot.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the members of the commission had their turn to
comment, all spoke in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The monument was designed by Friedrich St. Florian, an architect
in Providence, R.I. It is of stone and bronze, an oval pool flanked
on two sides by semicircles of 56 pillars, one for each U.S. state
and territory during the war, which ended in 1945. It has open
arches on the north and south sides, named Atlantic and Pacific,
for the two areas in which the war was fought.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who lost an arm in the war, called
himself ``a small participant in that great war'' and urged the
commission to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   About 16.3 million Americans served in the war, and earlier this
year the Department of Veterans Services said 5.7 million veterans
were still alive, but dying at the rate of 1,000 a day, a factor
mentioned by many advocates who call for quick construction.
</P>
<P>
   F. Haydn Williams, who headed the panel that selected the site,
urged the commission to vote approval for ``the veterans for whom
the clock is ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   The session began with J. Carter Brown, chairman of the Fine
Arts Commission, foreshadowing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be on the Mall and it has to be central,'' he said,
eliminating the opponents' argument against its location. He said
that St. Florian had addressed complaints about the design by
placing openings in the pillars and arches, creating what he called
more transparency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, who introduced legislation calling
for construction of the monument, said the location was
``appropriate and historically coherent,'' coming between the
monument to the president who was the hero of the Revolutionary War
that created the nation and the memorial to the president who held
it together in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action was the most important step in the approval
process. The last remaining hurdle is action by the National
Capital Planning Commission, but it generally follows the lead of
the arts commission on matters of aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   One advocate was Luther H. Smith, of Villanova, Pa., who was one
of the Tuskegee airmen, the black aviators who had their own unit
in the segregated Army and downed 10 German aircraft in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the surviving World War II veterans, he said,
is 80, and he added: ``We have the right site. We have the right
design. What we don't have is a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole spoke with the emotion of an old soldier when he mentioned
the sacrifices of his comrades but leavened with the irreverent
humor for which he was noted in public life.
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off the contributors to the project and then, glancing
out at the veterans in the audience, added that he had been
successful in getting donations from funeral homes. ``Probably not
a good thing to raise with this group,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   He paused and waited for the laughter to end before adding,
``Sort of a layaway plan.''

several deaths last year during human gene therapy experiments, the
National Institutes of Health came to Harvard University this week
as part of a national campaign to ensure that campuses conduct
federal research properly.
</P>
<P>
   NIH officials said Thursday that Harvard had only a few
problems, but that bigger failings remained in university research
facilities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not apparent that a culture of compliance is universally
present in the biomedical research enterprise,'' said Gary
Thompson, who led the NIH team.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Thursday permitted a reporter to attend a closed NIH
forum for faculty and staff there. During the session, university
officials said they had increased compliance efforts, creating a
risk-management committee to defuse financial, legal, and health
threats that grow out of research and other work on campus. The
university also has a hot line for whistle-blowers concerned about
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the public doesn't have the trust, it just feeds on
itself,'' said Elizabeth Huidekoper, Harvard's vice president for
finance. ``We want to be much more proactive in how we deal with
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the NIH review is a large amount of money for
university scientists nationwide. The agency's road show, which
will take it to six other universities by October, is intended
partly to reassure Congress about federal research spending at a
time when NIH is seeking a huge budget increase.
</P>
<P>
   NIH now receives $17.8 billion a year, making it the largest
federal sponsor of university research. In June, the Senate voted
to increase that budget by $2.7 billion. But the House of
Representatives has voted for only $1 billion more. A compromise
budget is now being worked out, and NIH officials are maneuvering
to get as much money as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the nation's universities are now on the spot:
About 80 percent of NIH's funding, more than $13 billion, goes to
outside grants, mostly to campuses. But the research-related deaths
and other embarrassments have stung schools over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   In September, 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger died during a
gene-therapy experiment led by a University of Pennsylvania
researcher who had a stake in a biotechnology company sponsoring
the trial. A Tufts University scientist, Jeffrey M. Isner, lost two
patients in a gene study at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, though
neither death was a direct result of the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of these deaths, both federal and university
officials are realizing that they cannot take government funding of
clinical research for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the nods and winks in the interchanges between the
university people and the government people, there's a realization
that there's a great deal of laxity in compliance,'' said Daniel S.
Greenberg, a science analyst and writer whose new book, ``Science,
Money, and Politics,'' will be published next year. ``The fear on
the part of NIH is that if you go too far with this, you end up
with a calamity.''
</P>
<P>
   While they aren't investigating campuses, the NIH teams are
quizzing researchers and officials on their activities and
policies, and turning up some problems.
</P>
<P>
   NIH officials would not comment Thursday on the Harvard review,
but none of the issues appeared to raise major problems. For
example, one university administrator said, some scientists have
taken too long in charging research costs to their grants.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH's Thompson told the Harvard group that the agency and
universities need to show that grants are well managed and that
research is safe and free of serious conflict of interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress says to us, `Where is the oversight of the $13
billion grant program?' We say that mainly lies at the
institutions,'' Thompson said. ``They say, `Well, what's the
oversight of the oversight?' And we need to do a better job at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School, for one, recently ended a year-long
study of its conflict-of-interest policy, considered to be among
the most stringent. The school's dean opted to keep limits on how
much money faculty researchers can earn from their experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some Harvard representatives at Thursday's forum said they hope
NIH encourages other institutions to adopt tough
conflict-of-interest codes. But one medical school professor, Alan
M. Zaslavsky, said campuses need to balance research safeguards
with breathing room for entrepreneurial faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping this line too tight,'' Zaslavsky said, ``draws too
strong a line about whether people can work in a university and
enjoy benefits.''

HORNADAY, HARVICK NOT YOUR NORMAL ROOKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's safe to say the rookie class on the NASCAR Busch Series
this year is not your average class of drivers.
</P>
<P>
   At the head of this group is 42-year-old Busch Series rookie Ron
Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale, Calif., who Sunday at Nazareth Speedway
became the first rookie to win a race since Steve Park in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But even with his first career Busch win, Hornaday trails fellow
rookie Kevin Harvick in the Busch Series standings. Harvick is
fourth and has a 28-point lead over Hornaday, who is sixth. The
rookie-of-the-year race is even tighter, with Harvick having a
six-point lead over Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, Harvick and Hornaday could be the
first pair of rookies to finish in the top 10 in points since
Johnny Benson and Dennis Setzer did it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate not to have these guys in my rookie class,''
said 1998 Busch Series Rookie of the Year Andy Santerre. ``But it's
fun to get to race with them now.''
</P>
<P>
   But ask Hornaday about his being in the hunt for
rookie-of-the-year honors and he doesn't get too excited. He has
his sights set on the Busch championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big deal is to catch Jeff Green,'' Hornaday said. ``We're
not going to lay down and let him win any more.''
</P>
<P>
   With four wins, six poles and a 499-point lead in the standings,
Green has been the driver to catch this year on the Busch circuit.
And for one day, Hornaday and his Dale Earnhardt-owned NAPA Auto
Parts team did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy for the NAPA team. They've been working their
guts out,'' Hornaday said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching victory lane is nothing new for Hornaday. The two-time
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series champ won a record 25 races in his
five years on that circuit. Before his Truck Series career, he has
been NASCAR Winston West and Saugus (Calif.) Speedway Late Model
champion. Even though Hornaday's career reaches back to the
bump-and-grind days of Late Model racing at Saugus, he says every
race on the Busch Series is a new experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like a rookie,'' Hornaday said. ``I go to places
and race on tracks I haven't been to before. And I'm learning every
time I'm racing.''
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Busch Series is NAPA Auto Care 250 at Pikes
Peak International Raceway on Saturday. Hornaday won at the
Colorado Springs, Colo., track in 1998 while with the Truck Series.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether having raced and won at Pikes Peak before
would help him this weekend, Hornaday said: ``If you asked me three
weeks ago, I would have said it wouldn't have helped at all. The
trucks and the Busch cars are totally different. But now I know I
can run the cars just like a truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty pumped up. And I'm going to drive the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   JR. ON THE HORIZON: Hornaday announced Tuesday that his son,
Ronnie, will be following in his father's footsteps by running a
limited NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series schedule, which will include
the Powerstroke 200 at Indianapolis Raceway Park on Aug. 3 and
possibly the California Speedway race in Fontana, Calif., to end
the season Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hornaday also said his son is preparing to run a full Truck
Series schedule in 2001 and is searching for sponsorship for a
team.
</P>
<P>
   TOP 10: Bill Sedgwick of Acton, Calif., driver of the Arrowhead
Mountain Spring Water Chevrolet, was sixth in the NASCAR Winston
West Coors Light 200 at Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, Wash., on
Sunday. Sedgwick, who is also sixth in the Winston West standings,
earned $3,590 for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Gaughan, who drives the NAPA/Martin Senour Chevrolet,
won the race at Evergreen Speedway. It was his second victory of
the season. Gaughan and Bobby Dotter are the only drivers with two
wins this season on the Winston West Series.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Winston West schedule is the Home Depot 250
at Irwindale (Calif.) Speedway on Aug. 19. &QL;

 &HT;    ``WHAT LIES BENEATH'' WILL RAISE YOUR HAIR(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can always rank a horror movie by how high you jump during
its really scary parts.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath (enditalic)has just raised the
bar.
</P>
<P>
   This taut supernatural thriller is the scariest movie since
(beginitalic)Poltergeist(enditalic), building suspense throughout
with sly camera work and a creepy, claustrophobic feel. Michelle
Pfeiffer is brilliant in the leading role, elevating her already
formidable game to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer plays Claire, wife of Dr. Norman Spencer (Harrison
Ford), a respected researcher with a hidden past. But Claire begins
to learn the truth after she sees the wraithlike figure of a young
woman and hears mysterious sounds echo through the couple's
rambling two-story lake house.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just where this slam-bang ghost story starts. You'll
have to put your head on a swivel to keep up with the twists and
turns in this expertly constructed tale of distrust, betrayal and
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath (enditalic)also contains one of
the most terrifying sequences since the two priests entered the
bedroom in (beginitalic)The Exorcist(enditalic). The movie should
include one of those sensational warnings from the '50s: ``No one
will be admitted in the last 10 minutes of this film!'''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the movie isn't that different from others of the
genre, except in its execution. You could have taken the same story
and filmed it with different actors and another director, and you
would have some sad (beginitalic)Amityville Horror
(enditalic)sequel.
</P>
<P>
   But director Robert Zemeckis ((beginitalic)Forrest Gump, Who
Framed Roger Rabbit) (enditalic)takes a simple horror story and
turns it into something special. He steers away from the
slasher-film formula, concentrating instead on Claire's
psychological deterioration during her ordeal, which is
particularly torturous because the ghost looks just like her.
</P>
<P>
   To keep us on our toes while Claire unravels, Zemeckis employs
well-worn cinematic devices: spooky mirrors, billowing steam and
those tight camera shots that have the whole audience yelling,
``Look out behind you!'' He pays homage to several Hitchcock films,
including (beginitalic)Rear Window (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Psycho(enditalic), but that doesn't distract from or
interrupt the movie's flow.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, you start to get nervous anytime a character
walks into the house and flips on a light switch. There's just no
telling what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen all these moves before, but the camera work, pacing
and acting put this film on a higher plane. The story is quirky and
creative enough to keep the audience interested, even during the
setup.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actors - especially Diana Scarwid, who portrays
Claire's wisecracking best friend - play their roles with
enthusiastic vigor. Scarwid helps the movie maintain a wry sense of
humor, and Zemeckis uses that light tone to meticulously build
Pfeiffer's character throughout the first hour. When things start
to fall apart, the audience is clearly rooting for her.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, who is on the screen in almost every scene, deserves
plenty of credit for the movie's success, and perhaps even an Oscar
nomination. Her performance runs the gamut from silly to sultry,
from confused to terrified. She smoothly handles her transformation
from all-American mom to haunted woman.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the first hour, Ford is almost window dressing,
though there is clearly chemistry between Pfeiffer and him while
they cavort as a happily married couple. As Pfeiffer's paranoia
builds and strange things start happening, Ford's character plays a
more pivotal role.
</P>
<P>
   The final 30 minutes are as frightening as it gets. If you're
not scared, you're probably covering your eyes. As far as that
goes, I can hardly blame you.

<P>
   In (beginitalic)Loser(enditalic), Jason Biggs plays a character
from a small town.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more like he's from Mars. His character, Paul, is so
unfamiliar with common phrases (he's apparently never heard of a
six-pack), it's like he just stepped off a spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   Though supposedly the winner of an academic scholarship, Paul is
an incredible dope. He gets duped by his sleazy roommates so many
times you have to wonder if he has short-term-memory loss. Fool me
once, shame on you. Fool me 27 times, and we're doing a CAT scan.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is a contrived, tangled mess, following Paul as he
leaves home and goes to college in New York. Because he's such a
darn nerd, he's not accepted by his moronic, sadistic roommates
(big loss there), and ends up sleeping in a veterinary clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dora (Mena Suvari), a street-smart kid trying to work her
way through college. She's also having an affair with her
literature professor (Greg Kinnear), who treats her like a doormat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we've just got to get those two crazy kids together.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, there's really no one to root for in this movie.
Both Paul and Dora are professional victims, and Paul's roommates
are drug-dealing date rapists. Kinnear's character is equally
creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Paul and Dora stumble through a bunch of scenes
ripped off from other movies. The plot dredges up this old
chestnut: He loves her, but she's oblivious despite the fact he
buys her flowers and hangs on her every word. Unlike, of course,
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise ending is in the credits: This film was
directed by Amy Heckerling, who also did the delightful
(beginitalic)Fast Times at Ridgemont High(enditalic) as well as
(beginitalic)Clueless.

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The posters for (beginitalic)The In Crowd (enditalic)are tagged
with the line: ``What would you do to get in?''
</P>
<P>
   After the first 45 minutes, you'll be asking: ``What can I do to
get out?''
</P>
<P>
   It's really not clear what they're trying to accomplish with
this movie, a poor man's (beginitalic)Cruel Intentions
(enditalic)without Sarah Michelle Gellar or even the slightest
shred of a script.
</P>
<P>
   The first half plays like an extended episode of
(beginitalic)Baywatch(enditalic), as we watch snobby
twentysomethings frolic on the beach and make catty remarks to each
other. They're led by Brittany (soap star Susan Ward), a poor
little rich girl who likes to manipulate her friends while she
romances the local tennis pro.
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't sound familiar, I want to congratulate you for
escaping from the gulag.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half the movie turns dark, as Brittany clashes
with Adrien (Lori Heuring), a country club worker who has been just
been released from a mental hospital, where she suffered from
something called ``erotomania.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the movie's only claim on the erotic thriller genre,
since most of the film is neither erotic nor thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany has a dark secret, which we figure out in the first 20
minutes of the movie. She spends the rest of the time scheming
about this and that, but after awhile, we don't care anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The film also suffers from a bad case of (beginitalic)Chariots
of Fire (enditalic)syndrome: Many of the male characters look
alike, so it makes the silly plot that much harder to follow.
</P>
<P>
   And just when we think we'll escape, the movie gives us a
drawn-out ending, punishment perhaps, for trying to join
(beginitalic)The In Crowd(enditalic).

COAST GUARD CHECKED SEN. KENNEDY WHEN YACHT STRAYED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The 361-foot Japanese schooner Kaiwo Maru was sailing
out of Boston Harbor on Sunday after its triumphant Tall Ships
visit when a 50-foot yacht crossed into its path.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiwo Maru sounded its horns in warning. The Coast Guard
rushed over to check the credentials of the wayward skipper.
</P>
<P>
   What they found was US Senator Edward M. Kennedy, an honored
guest of the Tall Ships pageant, piloting his yacht, the Mya, with
his wife Victoria. After a brief conversation, the Coast Guard
allowed Kennedy's boat to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard issued a statment saying Kennedy had not caused
a safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast guard approached several vessels to ensure that the
Tall Ships had a clear path on their arrival July 11 and their
departure July 16,'' the statement from the Boston-based First
Coast Guard district said. ``Senator Kennedy was aboard one of
those vessels. All vessels complied including Senator Kennedy and
moved to a safe area. At no time was there any threat to the safety
of the events.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of the senator's sailing zigzag raced over the Internet,
and media inquiries began trickling in, the senator's office noted
that Kennedy had received permission to join the Parade of Sail and
that he had cooperated with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese signal to the Mya came when he was moving out of
the way,'' said Will Keyser, Kennedy's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of Sail Boston 2000 said Thursday Kennedy was fully
credentialed to be in area where he was sailing and was displaying
the necessary Coast Guard flag.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's Washington office stressed that the senator had not
violated any Coast Guard rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``When approached by a Coast Guard vessel, the senator displayed
his Coast Guard-issued flag demonstrating he was part of the
festival,'' said Keyser. ``He was invited to continue to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Commander M.A. Cicalese, who was in charge of safety
and security for the event, told boston.com Thursday that Kennedy
had sailed into a restricted area under heavy fog. The Coast Guard
had ordered the ships to leave the harbor without sails, powered by
their engines, because of the fog.
</P>
<P>
   Cicalese, who was on the bridge of the USS John F. Kennedy at
the time of the incident, told boston.com the incident was under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Coast Guard statement said the incident is not part
of any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, an avid sailor like many in his family, was
instrumental in bringing naval vessels that participated in Sail
Boston 2000, including the aircraft carrier that bears his late
brother's name, to the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, he was merely another sailor, who apparently
forgot one rule of life on the high seas _ and national politics:
Stay out of the way of the bigger boat.

MOVIE AND RECORDING BUSINESSES SUE SCOUR.COM FOR INFRINGING
COPYRIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Expanding their legal attack on the exchange of
copyrighted works on the Internet, the motion picture and music
industries Thursday sued to shut down Scour.com, a venture the
industries say permits the free trading not just of music but of
movies, in some cases as soon as they open in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   In invoking the film issue, the lawsuit adds a wrinkle to a
story that has focused largely on music, in particular on the
embattled Napster service. It also puts the motion picture industry
at odds with one of its own stalwarts, given that Michael Ovitz,
the former Disney president and an agent who represents some of
Hollywood's biggest stars, owns 20 percent of Scour.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
more than 30 of the world's largest movie and record houses contend
that their copyrighted works are being freely exchanged by tens of
thousands of users of Scour.com, which is based in Los Angeles.
Started by several UCLA students, the site points users to
multimedia content on the Internet, including music and video,
serving in part like a focused search engine.
</P>
<P>
   But the site also includes a feature called Scour Exchange,
which allows users to trade music and movie files they keep on
their computers. In that way, the feature is like Napster, which
has been sued by the recording industry for permitting users to
exchange music files.
</P>
<P>
   Scour issued a statement expressing surprise at the lawsuit. It
said that it had been negotiating business agreements with the
record companies, and that it already had deals to present content
on its site from two plaintiffs in the case, Miramax and Hollywood
Records.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not address the legal questions raised by the
suit. But in interviews earlier this year, company officials said
they should not be held accountable if some people use the service
to trade copyrighted material, an assertion also made by Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials countered that the company was knowingly
permitting, even encouraging, the exchange of copyrighted
materials, and seeking to profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit is about stealing,'' said Jack Valenti, president
of the Motion Picture Association of America. ``It's a harsh word,
but it's the only one that fits the definition.''
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the lawsuit underscores unresolved
copyright-infringement issues raised by the advent and growing
popularity of the Internet, which provides an unprecedented ability
to trade and copy data. The issue could face a crucial test next
week when a federal judge in San Francisco is scheduled to consider
whether to grant the Recording Industry Association of America's
request to shut down Napster.
</P>
<P>
   The Scour lawsuit does not say how many copyrighted works are
available on Scour Exchange, but says there are 1.8 million files
available through Scour, ``most of them unauthorized and infringing
copies.'' Industry officials said it was typical for 25,000 people
to be using the service at any given time. And documents filed with
the court said that some of the works traded freely were popular
music and first-run movies like ``Gladiator'' and ``Mission:
Impossible 2.''
</P>
<P>
   One additional twist in the case comes from the presence of
Ovitz, who read about Scour in the UCLA campus newspaper and bought
a stake in the company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts have said that Ovitz's stake in Scour is
a conflict of interest because his talent management agency,
Artists Management Group, represents some of the very artists whose
works are traded on Scour Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry
Association of America, wrote a letter to Ovitz contending that
Scour was engaged in unlawful activities.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Artists Management Group said Ovitz had grown
increasingly uncomfortable with his association with the company.
In June, Ovitz sent letters to Dan Rodrigues, the president of
Scour Exchange, and to the Scour board expressing concern about the
copyright implications.
</P>
<P>
   The person also said that Ovitz felt he was not in a position to
control the company's direction, and that Ovitz had hired an
investment banker to sell his stake. Officials from Scour declined
to comment on Ovitz's position. A spokesman for Artists Management
also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The position stands in contrast to statements made earlier by
officials from Artists Management Group. In May, James Ellis, the
agency's general counsel, said the company stood behind Scour
Exchange and the concept of file sharing. ``In the face of a
rapidly changing marketplace, Scour had to respond to maintain and
grow its audience and give them what they wanted,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Scour does not specify the amount of damages
sought.

SEGA SAYS WEB SITES, AUCTIONS SHUT DOWN TO HALT PIRACY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Music and movies aren't the only things being pirated and
distributed over the Internet these days.
</P>
<P>
   Video games are also big targets.
</P>
<P>
   Sega of America Thursday said it has shut down 60 Web sites and
125 auctions trafficking in pirated video games played on Sega's
Dreamcast console.
</P>
<P>
   Software pirating has existed for as long as software has been
around. What's new is the unprecendented ease brought by the
Internet for pirating and distributing software, leading to a crop
of new applications such as Napster for copying and sharing music,
and DivX, which can be used to duplicate movies.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming industry estimates that over $3 billion is lost every
year from piracy, a huge sum considering the industry itself pulled
in just $6.9 billion in 1999 from sales of both consoles and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Console makers earn a majority of their cash from licensing
software,'' said Michael Goodman, a senior analyst with the Yankee
Group. ``So piracy is literally a direct attack on their revenue
stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega, which is based in Japan and has operations in San
Francisco, is teaming up with other console makers and software
publishers to fight back. Their arsenal was considerably beefed up
when Congress this year passed the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, which allowed copyright holders to go after Web sites and
Internet service providers that host sales of pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest broadside, Sega last week began issuing cease and
desist orders to five auction sites, including those hosted by
Yahoo!, eBay, Lycos, Excite and Amazon.com, according to Charles
Bellfield, Sega's spokesman. In addition, the company asked
Internet service providers to shut down Web sites that sell pirated
games, as well as companies hosting virtual hard drives that are
used by their customers for storing pirated games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies that do not comply will face both civil and
criminal prosecution by both federal and state authorities with
whom we are working with,'' said Bellfield.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, all the companies Sega has approached have cooperated,
according to Bellfield. Sega continues to issue cease and desist
orders daily, he said. The company, which said it loses millions of
dollars a year to piracy, is working with European officials and
negotiating with Asian law enforcement on its crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Sega teamed up with game-maker Nintendo and
Electronic Arts, a large game publisher, to file a lawsuit against
Yahoo! to prevent pirated games from being sold on Yahoo's Web
site. The case, filed in U.S. District Court in California, is
still pending.
</P>
<P>
   But game industry analysts question how successful companies
will be in stamping out illicit copying of digital products via
Napster, DivX or a simple $200 compact disk ``burner'' that can
duplicate CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a bigger picture of piracy,'' said P.J.
McNealy, analyst with the Gartner Group. ``As more things become
digital, they will become more portable and easier to exchange,
particularly over the Internet. Instances like this will continue
to crop up more often.''

 &HT;    AS INTERNET GROWS, CAN HARDWARE KEEP PACE?
 &HT;    1030&AMP;add. With HARDWARE-DATA and INTERNET-SOFTWARE. Moving in
the (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for release Sunday,
July 23.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the Internet expands the horizons of
millions of users and energizes the world economy, fears have
arisen that it could fall victim to its very success.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the World Wide Web offers about 2.1 billion pages and
growing by more than 7 million pages a day. A new study by
Cyveillance, an Internet research company, sees the number of pages
doubling by early 2001. Likewise, the community of users, now 275
million people around the globe, is projected to reach 1 billion by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the amount of information traveling across the
Internet is doubling every three months. But such growth rates pose
the very real nightmare that this massive online structure,
representing a $650 billion investment, could come crashing down in
gigantic cyber-traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the system has remained a going concern because key
service providers keep installing more and better hardware. The
question is, how long will this solution work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think that adding capacity will solve the
problems,'' said Paul Segan, president of Akamai Technologies. ``It
simply will not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagan, whose firm distributes online data through 4,000 servers,
told an industry conference in Chicago this month that the
Internet's backbone is already taxed to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   As high-speed broadband services become increasingly available,
he predicted, content providers will offer more streaming media and
users will spend more time on line, canceling out the hardware
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Sagan added, ``was never designed to be a
business-critical, 7-by-24 marketplace where real-time commerce,
entertainment and information is exchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, at least, online activities are safe from
catastrophic failure for much the same reason that they remain
vunerable to hacker attacks. Since the Internet was designed as a
decentralized network, it can ``repair'' itself by automatically
re-routing of data to ``healthy'' hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with keeping nightmarish failures in check are the
unsung people _ part cybercops, part cyberdocs _ who manage the
hardware that undergirds the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly employees of private companies rather than government,
they monitor traffic patterns to see where the load is increasing
fastest, so that new data lines and switching equipment can be
installed before the system can be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   At its physical core, the Internet is vast network of copper
wires and optical fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttling packets of data across these ``pipes'' to their proper
destinations are tens of thousands of special-purpose computers
known as routers, all programmed with same protocol, or addressing
language. Backing up those machines are simplified routers, known
as switchers.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet use continues to mushroom, so does the demand for
more sophisticated routers and switchers and higher-capacity pipes.
The technology is moving so rapidly that the $100,000-plus routers
that manage the Internet's ``backbone'' need to be replaced with
more powerful units every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the upgrades resemble the way today's PCs are improved:
through more sophisticated processing chips and caching techniques,
coupled with larger storage and transmission capacities.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet's rapid convergence with telecom, video and
wireless devices are making ever more massive demands on the
network. A few years' hence, the only way to avoid gridlock may be
through now-experimental technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, experts see promise in ``photonic'' switches.
If such optical devices replaced electronic switches, there would
be no need to covert the light pulses carring data swiftly through
fiber-optic cables into electrons at central router hubs, a current
choke point in the data flow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another future prospect: Integration into the network of
Internet II, a blazingly fast closed system now being tested at
more 170 U.S. universities.
</P>
<P>
   Internet II is a four-year-old partnership among academia, the
government and industry. Its huge bandwidth, routed through some
some 30 dedicated hubs known as gigapops, make for both reliable
and efficient links that enable distant researchers to routinely
perform tasks that would be impossible to achieve on the public
system.
</P>
<P>
   They can, for example, watch full-motion video images _ in real
time, in full color and on large screens _ from a telescope in
Arizona and to simultaneously steer that huge tube around the
cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation helping the Internet keep up with growing
demands are ``server farms,'' huge data centers that consolidate
many high-volume Web operations in one location.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of these ``engine rooms'' of the Internet is one run by
IBM in the western Chicago suburb of Schamburg, Ill. It powers the
Web sites and electronic commerce operations of more than 500
companies and organizations, including BankAmerica, Macy's,
Goodyear Rubber and the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to own their own information but they don't want
to maintain it, and that is driving the shift back toward
centralization,'' said Adele Goldberg, a member of the team at
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center on the Stanford campus in the early
1970s that eventually spawned today's pervasive network-friendly,
PC-oriented computing universe.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike prior commercial revolutions _ telephones, power lines,
railroads, highways and airplanes _ government regulators play no
role in making sure the Internet keeps pace with explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those tasks are being largely met by Cisco Systems
Inc., a Silicon Valley hardware giant with a current valuation of
some $460 billion. Cisco, which sells its products in some 115
countries, enjoys an effective lock on the world's high-speed data
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fiber (optical cables) are the railroad tracks, and Cisco
makes the trains,'' said Hal Varian, dean of the School of
Information Management at the University of California in Berkeley.
``There's been a lot of investment putting fiber into the ground.
But if you want to use that fiber, you need Cisco routers.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Once users are connected to the Internet, routers serve as an
``intelligent device that works almost like a post office,'' said
Kevin DeNuccio, Cisco's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It understands where you're trying to get to and where that
is, and what's the easiest way to get you there, and it actually
directs your question, your request, to a server.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's clear dominance over the Internet networking scene _ the
company controls 65 percent of all Internet routers and continues
to grow at the rate of 40 percent a year _ raises the question of
whether it is likely to become a future target in the government's
antitrust gun sights.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has managed to avoid the fate of Microsoft
Corp., which has been branded in a federal court as a predatory
monopolist that needs to be split into two competing firms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, at about the same time as the Justice Department filed
its civil suit against Microsoft, the Federal Trade Commission
began to probe charges that Cisco had illegally colluded with two
other big players in the telecom hardware market: Lucent
Technologies and Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency subsequently dropped its inquiry. Since that
time, Cisco general counsel Dan Scheinman and other key executives
have meeting regularly _ on their own initiative _ with antitrust
chief Joel Klein and other Justice Department officials to contend
that Cisco lacks a monopoly choke hold on the Web and should be
left alone by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's ``pipes'' present yet another facet of intense
market concentration. On July 10, the two largest fiber-optic
firms, JDS Uniphase and SDL, announced merger plans. If their $41
billion deal goes through, it promises to be the largest technology
merger ever.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by industry-watching Red Herring magazine noted
that ``three vendors _ JDS Uniphase, SDL, and E-Tek _ own their
market now and for the foreseeable future.'' In late June, after
the report was published, JDS acquired E-Tek.

 &HT;    When your bones betray you
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The falling seemed interminable. Like Alice down the
rabbit hole.
</P>
<P>
   But the landing was hard, and Anita Stillman had no doubt that
she had broken her left hip.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly 79, this active woman was participating in a breast
cancer seminar at Boca Raton Community Hospital when her weakened
bones betrayed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting at the end of the table. I was getting up to get
a cold drink and somebody had put a pocketbook underneath,'' she
recalls, gesturing under her sofa to indicate how the errant object
had obstructed her path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught my right foot in it and I went flying, and . . .
believe me, as I came down, I could hear my doctor saying, `Your
left hip has nothing very much left there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit, I knew I cracked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing very much left there. Words that had caused the
grandmother to cringe when she had heard them only three days
before.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis: osteoporosis, a thinning of the bones that will
cause half the women over 50 to experience a fracture in their
lifetimes. And one in eight men over 50, as well, according to the
National Osteoporosis Foundation, (www.nof.org).
</P>
<P>
   Peak bone mass is reached in the 20s and 30s, so exercise and
calcium are extremely important then to build up strong bone mass.
At least 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily is advised. When bone
loss begins, as it will, in the 40s for women and in the 50s for
men, increased calcium is recommended _ about 1,200 milligrams a
day average _ along with continued exercise, moderate alcohol, and
no smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The message going out today is: Osteoporosis is both a
preventable and treatable disease.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman had very little bone density left when she fell, but
that was the second time she had gotten a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people her age, she thought that broken bones were a
consequence of aging and had tried and discarded treatment three
years earlier when the drug she was taking to build her bone mass,
Fosamax, gave her heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis? That hurt, and resulted in replacement of both her
knees.
</P>
<P>
   But osteoporosis is a silent disease that rarely alerts those
who have it.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman did have an indication, though, that all wasn't well.
</P>
<P>
   Her posture had deteriorated _ ``My children noticed I was
stooped, and my husband kept saying, `Stand up!' '' _ and she had
lost an inch in height, both signs of bone deterioration. Yet, she
didn't follow through on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't doing it consistently,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't suffer with osteoporosis. When I took my first (bone
density) test, I was surprised at the results. If it doesn't hurt,
you don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   FOCUSING ON CANCER INSTEAD
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem appears to be that women are more afraid of
cancer than of osteoporosis, even though the risk of a hip fracture
equals the combined risk of developing breast, ovarian and uterine
cancer, the National Osteoporosis Foundation advises.
</P>
<P>
   And 20 percent of those with hip fractures _ men and women _ are
dead within a year because of conditions like pneumonia that can
develop when people are bedridden with fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Some women are afraid, also, of Fosamax, the often prescribed
medication, which can cause intestinal problems or ulcers in the
esophagus if not taken correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon R. Sullivan of Greenaces is one of those. Even though her
mother had osteoporosis, and she herself had a bone density test
that showed she was losing bone mass, Sullivan quit taking the drug
four years ago after a four-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the drug disagreed with her, it's that she had
read about its possible risks _ which occur infrequently if
instructions are followed, according to the American Medical
Association _ and didn't want to take that chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there's got to be a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor showed her pictures of her weakened bones; he argued
with her to continue to take some medication. Eventually, she lied
and told him she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wanted to listen to him? I think he really truly believes
that I should and I didn't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows that medical tests showed Fosamax _ first introduced
in 1995 _ builds healthy bone at the spine and hip, but she prefers
to try a regimen of diet, exercise, and vitamins that is
recommended to prevent bone weakening.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, she walks 4 miles every other day, alternating with yoga
exercises followed by weight lifting. She also takes 1,200
milligrams of calcium plus vitamin D daily. (Doctors generally
recommend 1,500 milligrams daily for postmenopausal women not on
hormone replacement therapy.)
</P>
<P>
   And she eats lots of high-calcium foods.
</P>
<P>
   When she went back for her follow-up bone density test two years
after her initial exam, her condition was the same. She hadn't lost
bone density, but she hadn't gained any, either.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are other drugs that can be used for
osteoporosis, Sullivan is sticking with her routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the alternative method is far better for me. Not only
am I strengthening my bones by lifting weights, I'm eating foods
that have a lot more antioxidants in them. And I have lost a good
30 pounds!''
</P>
<P>
   She's scheduled to take another test this year (Medicare pays
for bone density tests every two years for people at risk) but
still hasn't decided whether she'd switch to drugs if her bones are
thinning further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking very positively at this point,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICATION CRUCIAL FOR SOME
</P>
<P>
   Doctors warn that waiting can be a dangerous game, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the early, early stages (of bone loss), chances
are you'd benefit from going on prophylactic care and not waiting
and seeing,'' said Dr. Richard Levine, an internist, who
specializes in geriatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you're downright osteoporotic, you should find a
medicine that works. Or watch your step!''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Ettinger, medical director of the Clinical Research
Center of South Florida in Stuart and Lake Worth, agrees that there
should be no doubt about taking medication if a patient already has
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   But there might be room for experimenting, such as Sullivan is
doing, if the patient is only mildly affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how low (in bone density) she is. If she's not
dangerously low, and maintaining (bone), fine. She needs to be
monitored on an ongoing basis. That's different from a woman going
down (in bone density) or already osteoporotic with a high risk of
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic number at which fracture risk increases. It's
an ever increasing continuum of risk. There are rapid and slow bone
losers. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he emphasizes, ``cleaning up lifestyles and taking calcium
pills are not enough for many women. An adequate diet and exercise
will certainly slow the rate of bone loss, but for some women it's
not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   CHANGES IN MOBILITY, ACTIVITIES
</P>
<P>
   Anita Stillman knows that truth.
</P>
<P>
   Since her fall, she has been using a nasal spray, Miacalcin, to
help retard bone loss, and is taking calcium and vitamin D daily.
</P>
<P>
   Her lifestyle, however, has been severely affected by her fall.
She has to use a walker and painkillers to get through her day, and
she no longer can dash out the door on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   She gazes at the ceiling fan she used to stand on a ladder to
clean and shakes her head, no. That's a task she won't try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a most debilitating thing. I must alter my lifestyle
because I know my bones are thin. I'll do my best to build them up
because I am aware of what is wrong. Once you know you have it, if
a person has any kind of intelligence, they have to know it doesn't
go away. Don't wait till you fall.''

 &HT;    After 44 years, former Georgia teacher's stands by her remarks
on race
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Colleen Wiggins hasn't said much about
it these 44 years. She'd rather not think about it, ever. But twice
now, her husband, Jim, has written to the newspapers and gotten
them to dredge it all up again.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he's the one who was bitter for so long. And
maybe that's because it hurt him more, watching helplessly as she
went through all that.
</P>
<P>
   She is tempted to tell this fine man to hush-up once and for all
and throw away what's left of the old letters and crumbly news
clippings, except that she can't really be sure that what happened
to her in small-town Georgia in 1956 was really peculiar to that
place and time.
</P>
<P>
   So she takes the box out of the closet and spreads all of those
scraps across the sofa in their house, wondering aloud if some
other teacher, somewhere, someday will suffer as much for the
mistake of answering a student's question without stopping to think
about who might be offended by the answer.
</P>
<P>
   No one wrote down what she said that day in front of her
10th-grade world history class at the Bethesda School _ some of
what got back to her later was just plain crazy _ but she's sure of
this much: She said that she would continue teaching even if the
school took in black students.
</P>
<P>
   Then she said she would not stop her daughter from marrying a
black man.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that there were no black children living anywhere near
the school. No matter that her daughter wasn't yet 2. Colleen Marie
Wiggins, Southern by birth, minister's wife by choice and nobody's
idea of a liberal firebrand, knew right away that she was in for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came home and said, `Jim, I think I opened my big mouth a
little too much today,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She'd opened it wide enough to lose her job. Wide enough that,
eventually, people all over the country knew what she said. The
furor did not die for a long time, until she was gone from that
town and that state and from the South.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than cultural dissonance that caused her now
tepid-sounding remarks to grate on so many people in then-rural
Bethesda and Lilburn and the other communities clustered around the
Gwinnett County seat of Lawrenceville, 20-or-so miles northeast of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fear,'' she says. ``Fear of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Change, enormous and irreversible, was occurring throughout the
South when the Wigginses arrived in Georgia in 1955. Colleen, born
in North Carolina, and Jim, born in North Florida, could feel the
change in themselves after three years of Methodist missionary work
in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up seeing water fountains at the bus station that said
`white' and `colored,''' Colleen says. ``And, of course, the white
people sat in the front of the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her childhood, black people passed in silence,
standing in their own lines and disappearing through their own
doorways. She found no reason to challenge racial conventions
during her studies at all-white, all-girl Greensboro College in her
home state, where she got a teaching degree. From there, the
Methodist Church sent her to Kansas City for missionary training.
</P>
<P>
   That's where she became friendly with a black person for the
first time, a missionary student her age. She learned firsthand
that nothing awful would happen if they drank from the same
fountain or sat together on a bus.
</P>
<P>
   It's also where she met Jim, another missionary student. They
fell in love and finagled a common missionary assignment in Hawaii,
where they were married. ``In Hawaii, there were people of many
races,'' she says. ``They all came and went together. No one
thought anything of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Their three-year assignment ended just as Jim's brother was
leaving his job as student pastor at Bethesda Methodist Church. Jim
was invited to take his place. It was a job that would help support
Colleen and their daughter, Sandi, while he studied for a master's
degree in theology at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda wasn't really a town, ``just a couple of stores, a gas
station and the church,'' but it had a school. Grades one through
12, maybe 200 kids in all, with a pot-bellied stove in each
classroom. Although her degree was in religious education, Colleen
was hired to teach English, history, geography, typing.
</P>
<P>
   Her salary was $233 a month. Jim's was about $150. Together, the
two 26-year-olds earned enough to get by. They lived in the old
brick parsonage. They ate fresh vegetables and sausage and chicken
that their farmer-parishioners eagerly shared. ``It was a wonderful
community,'' Colleen says. ``Just wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   It was especially wonderful if you were white, which was true of
nearly everyone for miles around. There wasn't much need to worry
about separate fountains or waiting rooms. But people worried just
the same. Everyone was worried about Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   A few months before Jim and Colleen moved to Bethesda, a black
bus rider named Rosa Parks was arrested in Montgomery because she
refused to move to the back. Other black people in Montgomery
reacted in a way white people could not understand, much less
abide: They quit riding buses.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery Bus Boycott was the talk of the South for nearly
a year. A lot of the talk in places like Bethesda was angry. Jim
and Colleen heard it but didn't say much. ``We were no longer
comfortable with the way we grew up, but we felt things had to
change slowly,'' Jim says. ``We weren't radical reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen got through most of the school year without trouble,
except for the one visit from Gertrude Stephens, a parent who
objected to a lesson about the United Nations. ``She wanted me to
teach Americanism, not about one world,'' Colleen says.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen might have avoided further controversy if it hadn't been
for a countywide, end-of-the-year essay contest. The theme: Is
interposition the answer to segregation?
</P>
<P>
   Most students found the question puzzling. They understood
segregation, and they understood why it was an issue. The Supreme
Court had ruled two years before in Brown vs. the Board of
Education that separate schools were unconstitutional. Then it
ordered Topeka, Kansas, to integrate its schools ``with all
deliberate speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia politicians were among the first and most enthusiastic
proponents of ``interposition'' as a way to avoid similar
consequences. It was a highfalutin but constitutionally cockeyed
theory that a state had the authority to ignore any federal ruling
it didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students couldn't figure out what it meant, so they
started asking teachers,'' Colleen says. ``Well, the other teachers
had sense enough to say, `Look it up,' even though there was no
information in our little library.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Colleen Wiggins. She didn't see the harm in helping kids
prepare for an essay contest sponsored by the county. One question
led to another. She was surprised that most of her students thought
integration might not be so bad. How could she keep quiet when one
asked what she thought? She does not remember who started all this
_ the names are a bit hazy now _ but one of the girls asked what
she'd do if black children were admitted to Bethesda School.
Colleen hesitated. ``My feelings were: Shall I say, `I'm not going
to answer?' Being young, I answered. I said I'd teach any
student.''
</P>
<P>
   Her students could not let such a remarkable statement pass.
More questions followed. The most pointed: What if your daughter
wanted to marry a black man? Colleen measured her words: ``I said
my daughter could marry whomever she pleases.'' She tried to
insulate herself with ``ifs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If'' she loves him. ``If'' that's what she really wants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she knew what she'd done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude then was what I call colonialism,'' she says.
``You are not bad to other races. You take care of them. But you
don't mix with them. When I said my daughter could marry a black
man, I might as well have said I wanted her to marry a black man.
That's what people heard.''
</P>
<P>
   She did her best to wrap up the discussion quickly. She hoped it
would end with the class bell. ``Don't go home and tell your
parents that I'm teaching integration,'' she said. But some did.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, her principal and two other friends came calling at
the Wiggins home. They said a group of parents wanted her fired.
The most insistent were G.W. and Gertrude Stephens. Colleen and Jim
decided to go straight to the Stephens' home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very nice people,'' Colleen says. ``They said they'd
prayed over this. But she was adamant about what she believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   The school year was about to end, but not before the Stephenses
and others had asked for a formal investigation. The school board
held up Colleen's contract. A petition for her removal was signed
by 124 people.
</P>
<P>
   The petition noted that the state's loyalty oath required
teachers ``to refrain from directly or indirectly subscribing to or
teaching any theory of government or economics or of social
relations which is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of
patriotism and high ideals of Americanism.'' The petition charged
that she had lost the respect of students and parents ``due to her
advocacy and teaching of integration... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurt was that these parents thought I was encouraging
students to go against them,'' she says. ``I would never do that.
But a student has a right to form an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The school board took statements throughout the summer. In
August, it concluded that she should be rehired. Colleen went back
to the Bethesda School for the fall term expecting her second child
and a more tranquil school year. That wasn't likely anywhere in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   When September arrived, black students attempted to enroll at
white schools in Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee and other states. The
National Guard had to hold back angry crowds. Many school districts
were determined to fight any change.
</P>
<P>
   In Gwinnett County, Ga., the school board found it could not
quickly dispose of the complaint against Colleen Wiggins. The
parents who wanted her fired took their complaint to the state,
which cut off its portion of her salary until the local board held
another hearing. The state's portion was nearly all of it: $225.
</P>
<P>
   The local trustees dipped into their own budget to keep paying
her. Colleen went on teaching, certain that the people who wanted
her to leave were a minority: More than 400 people signed a
petition in her favor. The parishioners at church raised $200 so
she could hire a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to find one who would take the case. ``It was
the hot political item,'' she says. Even people she knew well were
cautious. Most said nothing at all. ``The silence was the worst
part,'' Colleen says.
</P>
<P>
   A 3 1/2-hour hearing was held on Oct. 9, 1956. Again, the board
voted to keep Colleen. It was not the end of her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings, the petition, the state's action all generated
more publicity. The stories jumped to papers far and wide,
including the New York Times. Someone even sent her a clipping from
Paraguay. Phone calls came day and night _ frightening, vulgar
calls. One bomb threat. A couple of crossed sticks burned on the
lawn. Hate mail came, too, mostly unsigned. She got plenty of
letters of support, but many of those were also unsigned, even
letters from the North.
</P>
<P>
   The note that made her angriest was presented in person. Before
the state would step aside, Colleen would have to sign an oath that
she did not believe in integration and would not advocate it
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got me,'' she says. ``I'd already agreed not to teach
integration in school. What right did anyone have to tell me what I
could or could not believe? I refused to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly all her strength to do that. She finally woke up
one November morning and couldn't get out of bed. ``I was paralyzed
by the stress,'' she says. Jim worried about her health. Both
worried about her pregnancy. Instead of the oath, Colleen signed a
letter of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I'd made my impact,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even that didn't satisfy the state, which set a hearing to
revoke her license. James A. Mackay, the one lawyer willing to take
up Colleen's cause, was not surprised. ``Demagoguery is hard to
fight,'' says Mackay, now 81 and retired. ``But good teachers like
Colleen could not be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   The state eventually backed down, but Colleen and Jim had
already decided to leave. He took a youth-director's job at a
church in California in the spring of 1957 and finished his
studies. They continued their church work with migrants in New York
and then moved to Eatonville, Fla., where Colleen got back to the
classroom as a Head Start teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen was hired to teach at Lincoln Elementary in Riviera
Beach, Fla., in 1968, when the county was in the throes of
integration. There were no white students in her class. The school
board's refusal to integrate in 1956 resulted in a federal
desegregation order that remained in force for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen, later an environmental science teacher at Palm Beach
Gardens High School, retired from teaching in 1991 but she hasn't
left the classroom entirely. She travels to schools throughout
South Florida with a butterfly exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Her former lawyer, Mackay, was elected to Congress in 1964. The
following year, he bucked the Southern bloc to vote for the
landmark Voting Rights Act. He was defeated in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Black students were eventually admitted to Bethesda School.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Stephens died in 1998. ``I wonder if she ever changed
her views, even just a little,'' Colleen says.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen, now 70, says the experience changed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me a stronger person,'' she says. ``I think of the
people who supported me. How brave they were. It helped me believe
in the good of people.''

 &HT;    WOMEN'S VOTE UP FOR GRABS THIS YEAR, TO GORE'S DISMAY
 &HT;    1100&AMP;add. With VOTERS-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories for release Sunday, July 23.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Va. _ Shielded by a shade tree from the midday sun,
Nancy Luciani sits in a trim municipal park as her son and a gaggle
of other 6-year-olds chase a ball across a grassy field. Nearby are
all the trappings of life in the 'burbs: the jogging strollers, the
minivans, the fellow parents waiting to ferry their kids to their
next summer activity.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani is a 36-year-old mom watching her kid play soccer. But
do not call her a ``soccer mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The soccer-mom term is so derogatory. It suggests that all
women think and feel the same way,'' says Luciani, a former
corporate systems analyst and now full-time mother of three from
Oakton, Va., a suburb of Washington. ``Women care about a lot of
different things.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas care a lot about women _ and their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, soccer moms gained almost mythical stature among
campaign operatives and political commentators as a coveted swing
voting bloc that would re-elect President Clinton or give
Republican Bob Dole a fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, as they had in '92, a majority of women voters handed
Bill Clinton a decisive victory, demonstrating their traditional
preference for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the neck-and-neck 2000 presidential campaign is a
different story. According to polls, Bush is cutting into the
conventional Democratic advantage with women, the very voters Gore
must have if he expects to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real clear that younger women, mothers, married women,
are key battleground groups,'' said pollster Andrew Kohut, director
of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the campaign illustrates just how hard Bush and
Gore are trying to appeal to the bloc _ each touting proposals for
education, children, health care and community values.
</P>
<P>
   But women voters are no monolith.
</P>
<P>
   Working women naturally are interested in the economy,
fair-labor issues and women's rights. Working moms care about those
things too, plus day-care and family leave. Stay-at-home mothers
pay attention to education and family values. For many but not most
women, abortion is a make-or-break issue, depending on which side
of the issue they are on.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms, suburb moms, mall moms _ by any other name, this
target group is mainly young, mainly white and mainly living in
suburbs and small towns. They represent anywhere between 5 and 20
percent of the electorate, pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this group of women so important as a voting bloc are
men.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-Republican gender gap exists because men
abandoned the Democratic party during the Reagan era in the 1980s
and, to a greater extent, in the midterm elections of 1994 that
elected a Republican Congress. Since early 1999, surveys show that
Bush has consistently drawn greater support from men compared to
Gore, leading by an average of 20 percentage points in recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the battle for women, the stakes are greatest for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he holds what several recent polls describe as only a
slight lead among all women, and in some surveys he lags among
married women. A Pew Research Center poll in late June found Gore
trailing Bush among mothers, 45 percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, women have been a core constituency for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the presidency from Bush's father in 1992, Clinton
garnered 45 percent of the women's vote, compared to 37 percent for
the elder Bush. In 1996, Clinton doubled his victory margin to 16
percentage points, beating Dole among women voters 54 percent to 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Gore losing some of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is smart. He's talking about issues that women do care
about _ education, children's health, Social Security. He speaks
with a more credible voice on these issues than previous Republican
candidates have,'' said Anna Greenberg, a pollster at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for Al Gore to shore up the traditional base,
and the base includes important blocs of Democratic and independent
women voters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some pollsters and political analysts detect a potentially
more troublesome factor for Gore. Many women voters, when gauging
qualities such as character and trust, view him negatively.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show Bush out-polling Gore on character
evaluations and leadership qualities. Gore's poll numbers dipped in
June amid news reports that Justice Department officials had
recommended that an independent counsel probe the vice president's
1996 campaign finance activities.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Browning, a high-school teacher and 41-year-old mother
of three in Vienna, Va., voted for Clinton in 1992 and in 1996 and
considers herself a solid Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But she does not like Gore, and cannot bring herself to support
Bush. Instead, she'll vote for third-party candidate and consumer
advocate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want authenticity. Someone who seems genuine and not
sculpted by some marketing specialist,'' she said. ``I just don't
trust him (Gore) because he seems so contradictory depending on the
audience he's talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaigns for governor in Texas, Bush proved popular with
women voters. Running against a woman, Democratic incumbent Ann
Richards in 1994, Bush split the women's vote. In 1998, Bush won
re-election with 65 percent of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush thus far has
commanded the presidential campaign agenda and prevented Gore from
stressing the kinds of issues most appealing to women, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fashioned himself as ``the low-risk change,'' said
Thomas Mann, a scholar of government and politics at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center.
</P>
<P>
   Voters detect few differences between the candidates on bedrock
issues like health care and education. That has given Bush an edge
in appealing to both women and men as the anti-Washington candidate
by focusing ``on changing the way we conduct politics,'' Mann said
</P>
<P>
   Yet many pollsters and political scholars dismiss the notion
that Gore has been tainted directly by President Clinton and the
scandals that plagued his administration, most notably the affair
with Monica Lewinsky that led to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore and the Democrats may suffer a credibility problem when
campaigning on family values _ issues such as community, parenting
and morals that women in particular rank high among their
priorities, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, Clinton has given the Republicans those issues
and made it difficult for the Democrats to talk about them,''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in March asked women what factor is most important
in their vote this year. They were evenly split, with 47 percent
naming an issue or issues and 47 percent citing character and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Luciani, the soccer mom who detests the label, ranks the
character of the candidate and issues involving the economy,
education and family values high on her list. A self-described
independent voter, she says Gore was never an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't know anything about him, if he were starting from
zero, I would consider him,'' she said. ``But knowing about him and
his connections to the Clinton administration, I'd say 'no.' ``
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican nominating convention, convening July 31 in
Philadelphia, the podium with be filled with ample evidence of the
GOP strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Day One: The candidate's wife, Laura Bush, and former Gen. Colin
Powell will address issues of health care, education and Bush's
``leave no child behind'' theme. Day Two: former presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole and GOP adviser Condoleeza Rice will
emphasize America's place in the world. Day Three: a focus on small
business, a traditional Republican theme and one that plays to a
current trend _ about half of all new small businesses are run by
women.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in Los Angeles in mid-August, Gore and the Democrats
will stress the important issues separating him and Bush: gun
control, abortion rights and the party's traditional role as a
defender of equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that, with four months remaining until the
election, much about the character of the race can and probably
will change. Many voters, women and men, have yet to focus on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, women appear much more likely than in the past to
consider the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in '96 the soccer moms, or what that meant, was
baloney,'' said the pollster Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those younger married women or young mothers were always for
Clinton, not for Dole. They thought Dole was out on another planet,
and they couldn't relate to him. But younger women are having a
real hard time choosing between Bush and Gore in a way that they
didn't have four years ago.''

TRADE GROUPS SUE SCOUR.COM FOR AIDING `THEFT' OF MUSIC, MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using strong rhetoric reminiscent of a public advocacy campaign,
trade groups representing the major movie studios and record labels
filed a copyright infringement lawsuit Thursday against Scour.com,
an Internet company that offers a file-swapping service similar to
the controversial Napster program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a simple case of theft,'' said Jack Valenti, president
of the Motion Picture Association of America, which along with the
Recording Industry Association of America is suing Scour.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the case as a moral crusade involving ``what is right
and what is wrong,'' Valenti added, ``We need to reinstate... the
once assumed social contract that says, `Stealing is wrong.' You
don't raise your children to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, filed in a Manhattan federal court, is the latest of
several suits initiated by the recording industry against Internet
companies including Napster and MP3.com. But it marks the first
time the movie trade group has joined forces with the music
business. Like the Napster case, the new suit alleges that Scour is
responsible for mass distribution and duplication of copyrighted
materials including music and videos.
</P>
<P>
   Scour.com, backed by Hollywood mogul and former top Disney
executive Michael Ovitz, offers an online search engine for music
and video files; like Napster, its Scour Exchange program enables
users to locate and download bootleg movie files as well as music
files.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Top Five Video Searches'' on the site Thursday included
the recently released summer blockbusters ``X-Men,'' ``Gladiator''
and ``Mission Impossible II.'' Unlike music files, however, movie
files can take hours to download, the system is hard to use, and
their quality is grossly inferior to seeing a movie at a theater or
on a legal videotape.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Thursday, the Beverly Hills-based Scour
claimed it was surprised by the lawsuit. Scour said it is
negotiating licensing rights with entertainment giants Sony, Warner
and BMG, and has license agreements with Miramax and Hollywood
Records; all of those companies are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scour has always positioned itself as a cooperative,
responsible and legally compliant partner within the entertainment
community, and is working hand-in-hand with record labels, film
studios and other entertainment companies to deliver licensed
entertainment content to the Scour consumer,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, the former Hollywood superagent, is known as a tough
negotiator who got his clients lucrative deals from the movie
studios. He had no comment about the suit. ``We don't comment on
litigation filed against third parties,'' said Mike Burns, a
spokesperson for Ovitz' firm, CKE Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the entertainment industry painted the case as a
battle to change public perception about the legality of
downloading free music and movies.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Pew Internet Project found that 13 million
people, or 14 percent of all Internet users, have downloaded free
music files from the Internet and that only 2 percent of online
users, fewer than 2 million people, have paid to download music.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like Napster and Scour Exchange create ``the impression
to users around the world that creative property has no value,''
said Carey Sherman, the RIAA's executive vice president and chief
counsel. The suit asks for damages of up to $150,000 per song or
movie downloaded from the Scour system.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to change the public perception is a deliberate
strategy on the part of the plaintiffs, but it is not likely to
work, said William Fisher, a Harvard Law School professor who
specializes in intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are correct that once these technologies take hold it is
going to be hard to get the next generation of consumers to pay for
this stuff,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The most relevant case is the 1984 decision in the Sony Betamax
case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that VCR manufacturers do
not violate copyright law when consumers record programs for home
viewing. By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, home
recording was a common practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher added that the heated rhetoric used in the case can be
misleading, since intellectual property is limited by duration and
by the fair use doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those things are obscured by this rhetoric of
shoplifting, stealing and theft, and the insistence that
intellectual property is no different than any other form of
property,'' Fisher said. ``They are hoping that intellectual
property rights will be perceived as real property rights, but I
think they will probably fail in that aspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recording industry has prevailed in the courts in its
case against MP3.com, which settled financially with some of the
companies that sued it. Its case against Napster continues next
week at a hearing set for Wednesday.

FLORIDA CANDIDATE HOUNDS PEOPLE TO VOTE _ FOR SOMEONE ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Like most candidates for public office, Douglas
Couvertier needed a clear, strong message, something that would cut
through the other candidates' talk about what they would do for the
voters, if elected.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a catchy slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't vote for me, please,'' seemed about right.
</P>
<P>
   Couvertier, whose name will be on the ballot Tuesday when voters
go to the polls to elect a city council for the newly formed town
of Southwest Ranches in Broward County, is running hard, and
running to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to civic leaders asking them not to vote for me,''
or provide other support in any way, said Couvertier. ``I've sent
out letters saying, `Please don't vote for me.' I've talked to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood a real good chance of being elected,'' he said,
forlorn. ``In fact, my fear is I still stand a real good chance of
being elected.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, he said, he will resign from the council
without serving.
</P>
<P>
   It did not start that way, of course. He ran because he wanted
to help shape the future of the town, one of the last mostly rural
places in South Florida that is neither park land, nor under water
in the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the 54-year-old Couvertier, a battalion chief
for the Miami-Dade Fire Department, was told by his boss that the
Miami-Dade County charter prohibits employees from holding elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the charter, candidates must go on leave when they begin
campaigning, and must quit their job if they win. Couvertier could,
his superiors told him, lose a big part of his pension if he
resigned from the fire department now.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know the charter had such a provision, and it came to
his bosses' attention too late. He wanted to bow out, but was told
by election officials that it was too late to have his name removed
from the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   So he is campaigning fast and furious, as dedicated as anybody
who is trying to win, to derail his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He has stopped short of name-calling and character
assassination, but there is no telling how low he may have to stoop
if things keep going the way they are going.
</P>
<P>
   He hears he is the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   With eight candidates seeking four at-large seats, he has a
50-50 chance at least, but early indications are that Couvertier, a
27-year veteran of the fire department and a popular figure in his
community of 7,000 to 9,000 people, has been pulling ahead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, in what seemed like a good thing at the time, he
won the endorsement of The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   His home bustles with anti-campaign activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God you called,'' said a friend, Sara Horowitz, when
told it was The New York Times on the line. ``We're trying so
desperately not to get him elected.''
</P>
<P>
   With no budget for television advertising _ if he just had some
television money, he could blow himself right out of contention _
he must try other tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But it is tricky.
</P>
<P>
   He could post signs that read ``Vote for anybody but me,'' but
that could backfire. In the attention span of many voters, it might
be just enough information to trip their memories on election day
and cause them to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in this area,'' he said. ``I've lived here
for over 20 years and I love it here. I thought it was important
for my town for me to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But now is not the time.
</P>
<P>
   Couvertier is three years from retirement. If he is elected and
then resigns, he will probably be able to save his pension. But he
would prefer not to go through that bureaucratic ordeal, and not
have friends and neighbors elect him to a job that he immediately
rejects.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to quit the race came too late to just take him off
the ballot, said Jane Carroll, the Broward County elections
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to correct them at this point,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four absentee ballots are already in. With Couvertier's
luck, he is probably already ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes me nervous,'' Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   For the other candidates, it seems like a lot of good votes
going to waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first, I think Doug is a good candidate and it's a shame
that he has to back out,'' said Forest Blanton, 47, who is running
for the council.
</P>
<P>
   But politics is politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were more aggressive, I'd try to ask him to recommend me
to voters,'' Blanton said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castillo, the Miami-Dade County assistant fire chief,
said Couvertier was not going to be disciplined for not taking a
leave because it was ``an honest mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' he said, ``everyone is chuckling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it appears that Couvertier will be able to reclaim
his job if he is elected, then resigns, he takes the election
seriously and does not want to have to say ``No thank you,'' if he
is unsuccessful in not winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only out now is to lose,'' he said.

WILLIAM F. WHYTE, 86; BOOK CHRONICLED BOSTON SLUM IN 1940S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ William F. Whyte, a retired professor at Cornell
University and author of ``Street Corner Society,'' a seminal
sociological study of Italian-American street life in the North End
of Boston, died Sunday in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street Corner Society'' was first published in 1943, when the
North End was a congested slum inhabited almost exclusively by
Italian immigrants and their families. Mr. Whyte took a
``hands-on'' approach to his research, living in the North End
while a fellow at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   His book is credited with changing the way Americans looked at
both urban poverty and Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, which was published in an expanded 50th anniversary
edition by the Chicago University Press in 1993, the North End is
referred to as ``Cornerville,'' a neighborhood of ``Eastern City''
where gangs of youths hung out on almost every street corner.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Whyte discovered that although the North End appeared
chaotic to outsiders, it had a strict social order built around
churches, social and political clubs, and corner gangs. North End
residents had solid family values and preserved a vigorous ethnic
culture. He learned that, while the neighborhood was very poor _
the unemployment rate was about 40 percent _ it was one of the
safest places in the city.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay he helped organize a 1939 protest march that
resulted in cleaner streets and improvements to the public
bathhouse. Because the boilers often broke down, the bathhouse
frequently had only cold water, a serious inconvenience in a
neighborhood where about 85 percent of the houses had no tubs or
showers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Whyte called his method ``participatory action research,''
and claimed he could maintain objectivity while sometimes nudging
his subject in the direction of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Some academics were not so sure. They called for more passive,
objective observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His practice of social science was really aimed at social
reform and social change,'' said Davydd Greenwood, a professor of
anthropology at Cornell. ``He never accepted the notion that social
science should be a purely academic profession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Street Corner Society'' was translated into Chinese, Japanese,
German, French, Italian, and Spanish. It has sold more than 270,000
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Whyte was born in Springfield, Mass. He graduated from
Swarthmore College and earned a doctorate at the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 he became one of the first professors at the new Cornell
University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Kathleen (King); two daughters, Joyce Wiza
of Manchester, N.H., and Lucy Whyte Ferguson of Taos, N.M.; two
sons, Martin K. of Silver Spring, Md., and John of Philadelphia; 12
grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren

GORE SEEKS TO DISCREDIT RIVAL IN HIS HOME STATE 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also TEXAS-PRIDE) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Vice President Al Gore blew into Gov. George W.
Bush's home territory on Thursday to try to undercut the governor's
popularity, suggesting that what he called Bush's skewed priorities
had made Texas a backwater where big oil interests are more
important than children's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this is a wonderful state,'' Gore said. ``But I think it
should be _ and I think most people agree _ it should be a state
where it's just as easy to raise a child as it is to set up an oil
rig.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also confronted head on the common assumption, backed up in
polls, that voters prefer Bush's personality, warning that the
presidency was not a ``popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that Governor Bush is a popular and well-liked
governor here, and I want to give him some credit on that score,''
Gore told a hastily arranged forum of a dozen adults, including
Democratic state legislators, three single mothers and a few
squirming children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has a warm and engaging personality but, you know,
the presidency is more than just a popularity contest,'' Gore went
on. ``It involves whether or not you're willing to fight for what's
right, whether or not you're willing to spend popularity to do
difficult, hard things. And that's where you get to priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore diverted his campaign to Texas on Thursday to try to take
advantage of questions emerging about the state budget, which has
$610 million in cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which called Gore's visit a gimmick stunt,
said the vice president was raising more questions about his own
credibility than he was about the stewardship of Texas, accusing
him of distorting the budget situation.
</P>
<P>
   The state comptroller, a Republican and a supporter of Bush,
announced on Thursday that the state had $1.4 billion in cash on
hand, an amount more than necessary to cover any spending overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held a brief news conference at the governor's mansion on
Thursday afternoon and, when asked about Gore's visit, said, ``I
welcome him here.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his prepared remarks, Bush talked tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed that the vice president of all the United
States would come to one of those states and try to mislead people
about its budget,'' the statement said. ``Our Texas budget is
balanced and in the black. We have a surplus of $1.4 billion in the
bank. For Vice President Gore to claim otherwise for his own
political purposes is a travesty _ he should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett a spokesman for Bush, said Gore's chief distortion
was painting a $1.7 billion tax cut pushed by Bush and his allies
as a special break for the oil industry. Bartlett said that the oil
industry's share amounted to just $20 million, and that most of the
tax break had been applied to reducing school property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the central question was one of priorities. His press
secretary, Chris Lehane, said Bush's priorities ``raise questions
about whether he has what it takes to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a theme that Gore had tried out earlier this spring but
dropped when advisers said it was too early to be so negative. It
still seemed the major risk on Thursday for Gore, which is why he
opened his remarks with a nod to Bush's congeniality, Gore backers
acknowledged. Still, Gore advisers said this would become a central
theme as the campaign developed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides conceded that today's event was aimed chiefly at
voters beyond Texas, particularly swing voters, women and core
Democrats who may find the governor an appealing figure, but who
would be offended at what Gore tried to portray as Bush's disregard
for health care, children and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's most serious charges was that Texas had not only
favored oil companies and other special interests over health care
for children, but that it had deliberately made applying for
children's health insurance a cumbersome process, so the state
would have more money available for the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a state finds ways to discourage families from signing up
for CHIP, the state saves money in its budget,'' Gore said, with a
personal testimonial from one of his guests to that effect. ``If
they create obstacles, and families get the idea they shouldn't
participate, the state can use the money for other things, like a
tax break for the oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, Bush's spokesman, said Gore was blurring the line
between Medicaid and CHIPS, the Children's Health Insurance
Program. He said that applications for the children's health
program were simple and could be mailed in. He said that contrary
to Gore's assertion, Texas is one of 12 states, not the only one,
that requires reapplication every six months for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore's comments on Bush's personality, Bartlett said:
``This contest is going to be, Who do the American people trust
with their money and their priorities? And if we're going to base
this on the fiscal stewardship of Texas compared to the lack of Al
Gore's credibility, we relish the fight.''

AS REPUBLICANS ALTER `MARRIAGE TAX' PLAN, PRICE TAG RISES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., S.D.)  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to make it harder for President Clinton to veto a measure
they see as having tremendous political appeal, Republicans have
unveiled a new version of their tax cut for married couples, but
they promptly found themselves under fire for making the bill cost
$44 billion more overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their new version of the tax bill, which House
and Senate negotiators agreed to Wednesday night, did respond to
the White House's concerns by stripping out a provision in the
Senate bill that would have benefited only upper-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the negotiators also decided to speed up
the timetable for putting the cuts into effect, a step that left
the bill with a 10-year cost of $292 billion. That a $44 billion
increase in the estimates over that time frame, handing the
administration more ammunition to assert that the bill is too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had said on Wednesday that they hoped to defuse the
Democratic criticism by agreeing on a revised bill closer in cost
to the $180 billion, 10-year measure passed by the House than to
the $248 billion, 10-year plan approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, which had said it would veto even the
less-costly House version, promptly reiterated the veto threat, and
congressional Democrats joined in on the attack as well, portraying
the Republicans as more interested in scoring election-year
debating points than in passing compromise legislation that would
mean something to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no better,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the
minority leader. ``In fact, it's worse than the original version,
based on cost alone. I'm disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The House quickly passed the revised bill on a 271-156 vote, and
the Senate was expected to give it final approval within a day or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that by stripping out a provision to benefit
couples earning $106,000 or more this year, they had responded to
criticism from Democrats that the measure was too tilted to the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the bill left plenty of money in the projected
federal budget surplus to deal with other needs like reducing the
national debt. And they challenged Clinton to make good on his
claim that he also favored the main goal of the bill, reducing the
marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that forces many
two-income couples to pay more in taxes than they would if they had
remained single.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason on earth that the president should veto
this bill,'' said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to congressional leaders Thursday, Secretary of
the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers listed several.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together with other tax legislation passed by the Congress
this year,'' Summers said, ``it would threaten our fiscal
discipline and jeopardize our ability to strengthen Social Security
and Medicare, pay down the national debt, enact well targeted tax
cuts, provide a long-overdue voluntary Medicare prescription drug
benefit, and meet other pressing national priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised version of the bill would immediately double the
standard deduction for married couples filing jointly so that it
would be equal to twice the standard deduction for single filers.
The deduction now for couples filing jointly is 1.67 times the
deduction for single people.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would gradually expand the income level covered by
the 15 percent income tax bracket for married couples to twice the
level covered for single filers. The change would be phased in over
five years, starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also increase the earned income tax credit, a
rebate for low-income working families. But Democrats said the
revised bill would offer a smaller increase in the credit than the
version passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With the revisions in the bill, the nonpartisan Joint Committee
on Taxation said, the tax would total $292 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But because of an arcane budget rule, the bill would expire in
five years, meaning that unless a future Congress acted to extend
them, the tax cuts would be canceled just as they were fully phased
in.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make the best of the situation, Republicans said that
meant the bill's actual cost would be $90 billion, the size of the
tax cut over five years, not the $292 billion figure cited.

VANDALS TAKE AIM AT EXPERIMENTAL CROPS AND GENETICS EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN EDS: Repeats to correct slug; GENETIC-TESTING is a separate
story, by Tamar Lewin, which moved earlier tonight.)   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLD SPRING HARBOR, N.Y. _ On a police blotter, it might not
look like much: a small cornfield vandalized, a few acres of ears
trampled and uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not just any cornfield. The patch that was damaged
here last Thursday was part of a research project at the Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, a field with a distinguished scientific
heritage. It was where Barbara McClintock studied Indian corn in
the 1940s to learn about genes _ work that won her a Nobel Prize in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they believe that the field was attacked for that
very reason. The destruction, they said, appears to be the latest
of several recent incidents across the country in which
experimental crops have been destroyed and research centers
vandalized by militant environmentalists who oppose the genetic
modification of plants. Graffiti denouncing genetic engineering
were found near the trampled rows of corn.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 acts of sabotage against genetic research have been
reported in the last year, according to both law enforcement
officials trying to combat the practice and radical environmental
groups that encourage it. Vandals have trampled experimental grass
fields in Oregon, pruned pinot noir vines and uprooted strawberry
fields in California, and hacked down cornfields in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the destruction goes well beyond crop damage. On New
Year's Eve, arson destroyed a suite of offices in Michigan State
University's Agriculture Hall. No one was hurt, but the fire caused
hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of damage. A radical
environmental group, the Earth Liberation Front, later claimed
responsibility, saying it had focused on the program because of the
program's ties to biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said that last week's
vandalism was not only misguided, but misdirected. The corn that
was trampled was not genetically modified, they said, but rather
was the result of natural plant breeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that these individuals chose illegal means
and intimidation to promote their point of view,'' said Bruce
Stillman, the director of the laboratory, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and businesses have been working on genetically
modified crops for years. In recent years, though, opposition to
the practice has grown among a broad range of environmentalists and
others who fear the unknown effects of manipulating nature.
</P>
<P>
   This opposition soon led to organized protests and vandalism,
first in Europe, where fear of so-called Frankenfoods is more
common, and now in the United States, where groups with names like
the Cropatistas, the Strawberry Liberation Front, the Anarchist
Golfing Association and Reclaim the Seeds have claimed
responsibility for acts of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be on the rise, and we are quite concerned about
it,'' said Michael J. Phillips, the executive director for food and
agriculture at the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade
organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It has attracted the attention of law enforcement officials as
well, from campus police departments to the FBI. ``We are very
aware of these incidents of eco-terrorism, and when they do occur,
the FBI considers them to be serious violations of federal law and
investigates the matters thoroughly and vigorously,'' said Steven
Berry, a supervisory special agent for the FBI in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Those who claim responsibility for the attacks dislike the term
vandalism, preferring to call what they do direct action.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the activists are concerned, it is the genetic
engineering itself that is the vandalism,'' said Denny Henke, a
spokesman for Genetix Alert, a group that uses the Internet to
publicize actions against genetic modification. ``The activists
that are doing this aren't doing it for fun. They feel passionately
that this is a very real danger, and they are willing to risk
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   California has seen such a spate of vandalism at its
universities and private businesses that one lawmaker,
Assemblywoman Helen M. Thomson, introduced a bill this year to
stiffen the civil penalties for destroying crops used in research.
Thomson, whose district includes Davis, where the state university
has been the target of frequent attacks, said her bill had been
nicknamed the Hate Crimes Against Vegetable Crops law. She said she
decided to increase the civil penalties because of the lack of
success officials in her area had had building criminal cases
against the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year a number of graduate students had their research
projects upended, pulled up, cut,'' she said. ``It's all because of
the overall issue of biotech. Now, that's a good debate, biotech,
but without the research, the data and real understanding, there
isn't very much to go on other than what your biases are.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the Biotechnology Industry Organization would like
to see a similar federal law intended to protect crops.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have been taken aback by the attacks, saying
they have been working on projects that will benefit the
environment by reducing the need to clear-cut forests or use deadly
pesticides, or by helping developing countries grow crops more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Ives, the director of the Agricultural Biotechnology
Support Project, a federally financed group at Michigan State that
helps developing countries learn to use biotechnology, was shocked
when her offices were gutted. A few weeks later, the Earth
Liberation Front _ which has also claimed responsibility for the
1998 arson at a ski resort in Vail, Colo., that caused $12 million
in damage _ said it had set the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, its unconscionable,'' Ives said. ``We're so fortunate
to live in a country where you have the right to protest. It is
unconscionable that you have to resort to violence and skulking
around in the middle of the night and setting fires. Picket me,
debate me, I'd salute you. But you don't have the right to destroy
property.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the cornfields here at Uplands Farm stunned
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   To some researchers, it was like vandalizing Mendel's pea patch.
This is, after all, where McClintock did her groundbreaking studies
of Indian corn, analyzing the patterns of kernels to learn about
the breaking and joining of genes and chromosomes inside the cells.
</P>
<P>
   But lab officials were reluctant to discuss the vandalism in
detail, fearing that publicity would encourage copycat attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, although a two-year research project paid for
by the National Science Foundation was damaged, lab officials said
the vandalism had set experiments back only a few weeks. And a new
generation of scientists here is continuing the research McClintock
began, using a new species: the mouse-eared cress, a small plant in
the mustard family that takes less time to grow than corn.

U.S. TAKES A BLAST FROM ITS ENVOY AT U.N. ON PEACEKEEPING COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Richard Holbrooke, taking aim at both Congress
and the Clinton administration, said Wednesday that U.S. reluctance
to sufficiently pay for U.N. peacekeeping could cost the United
States much more down the line in emergency relief and the direct
involvement of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who has more often been critical of the United
Nations, turned on Washington publicly for the first time in nearly
a year as U.S. ambassador here, saying that the administration was
asking Congress for too little and Congress was slashing that even
further.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was a ``disconnect'' in budgeting $7.1 billion for
emergency relief and only $500 million for peacekeeping and the
prevention of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is that by lagging behind in funding peacekeeping
operations, we often inadvertently, unintentionally contribute to
conditions in which peacekeeping fails and refugee and relief
assistance is then required,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is most acute in Africa, where there has been an
unwillingness to aid U.N. missions, an issue that re-emerged this
week as the United States stalled action on a Security Council
resolution that would increase the size of the peacekeeping
operation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Tactical obstructions are one of the few weapons left to the
U.S. delegation here, since U.S. influence in determining how U.N.
peacekeeping is designed and carried out is rapidly declining
because of congressional budget cuts and the reluctance of the
Pentagon to put any Americans on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   On Sierra Leone, Holbrooke said Wednesday that he could not ask
Congress for more money for an expanded force until he can show
that the troubled mission has been restructured. Officials and
other diplomats say that enlarging the force is essential to
strengthening it. And, they say, now is the time because the force
finally seems to be making headway against the largest rebel group
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Appropriations committees in the House and Senate have slashed a
$738 million budget request for peacekeeping in 2001 to $500
million and rejected a request for $107 million for current
expenses in Kosovo and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked for too little,'' Holbrooke said of the
administration's initial request. ``Both the secretary of state and
I feel we asked for too little.
</P>
<P>
   He said $500 million ``is not enough to do peacekeeping
worldwide,'' adding that there would soon be new requests for
operations in the Horn of Africa, Burundi and Congo. ``In every one
of these cases,'' he said, ``if we don't do the peacekeeping, the
humanitarian aid will go up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Security Council, no action is likely on increasing the
force in Sierra Leone until well into next month. Under an
agreement with congressional leaders, the Clinton administration
must give 15 days' notice of any Security Council vote on
peacekeeping that could raise costs for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   No notification has been made for Sierra Leone, putting on hold
a British-sponsored resolution to increase the size of the force
from 13,000 to 16,500 troops as recommended by Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, a contingent of peacekeepers, backed by combat
helicopters, freed a group of unarmed military observers and more
than 200 troops who had been surrounded by rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front at Kailahun, a town in the southeast of
Sierra Leone, according to U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The successful rescue _ with the loss of one peacekeeper's life
and seven injuries but much larger casualties on the rebel side _
lifted the morale of a mission that had been humiliated when rebels
took 500 peacekeepers hostage last May. Those hostages were all
subsequently released through the intervention of the Liberian
president, Charles Taylor, who has close ties to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, the Security Council banned trading in Sierra Leone
diamonds, which are controlled by the rebels and mainly reach
international markets through Liberia, enriching that government as
well as the rebels. The ban is to continue until the Sierra Leone
government establishes a certification system for controlling
exports.

THE NEWS ACCORDING TO OLBERMANN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They hired him 18 months ago to a multimillion-dollar contract
specifically to boost the credibility and exposure of their nightly
sports report. So why now will the execs at Fox Sports Net be
content with having poster boy Keith Olbermann on as a once-a-week
fixture?
</P>
<P>
   Because, Fox Sports chief David Hill says, this is ``an attempt
to redefine sports journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   And because, Hill adds, ``In TV, you gotta be like a shark _
move or else you'll die.''
</P>
<P>
   And because, those who need to speculate will say, Olbermann has
worn out his welcome already and this is a way to separate him from
the rest of the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's total crap,'' Hill responded Thursday during a
conference call during the announcement of what will be called
``The Keith Olbermann Evening News,'' a multifaceted, one-hour
sports news and interview show starting Sunday, Aug. 6, in the 10
p.m. time slot.
</P>
<P>
   The name, by the way, is meant to be silly and serious. Take
your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Hill admits he wasn't totally happy with the way Fox
Sports News had been evolving, even with Olbermann's presence,
which is why ``NFL on Fox'' Sunday-morning show producer Scott
Ackerson was brought on board about four months ago to revamp it
into what's now called ``The National Sports Report.''
</P>
<P>
   With that part of the plan in place, Fox can afford to branch
Olbermann off into his own show, of which he'll also be executive
producer. It will also fill a void of Sunday-night sports TV
programming that has yet to be defined clearly in this information
age of knowing game results hours before the news shows come on.
</P>
<P>
   The approach will be to replace the usual ``National Sports
Report'' hour with Olbermann's sports-news segment, followed by
analysis, opinions, interviews and essays. One-stop shopping, kinda
like the old ``Nightly News'' shows the networks did in the '60s
and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound as arrogant and egotistical as I've ever been,
but this is the one show you should watch if you only watch one
sports show,'' Olbermann said. ``The idea is I don't think there's
one show anymore with everything so diffused. If you want
interviews, you watch Jim Rome or Gary Miller (on ESPN's `Up
Close'). If it's analysis, you wait for (HBO's) `Real Sports' or
(ESPN's) `Outside the Lines' or (Fox's) `Goin' Deep.' There's no
full-service operation anymore. At least one night a week, we have
the opportunity to do it. We can experiment and see if this is what
the people want.''
</P>
<P>
   It's another risk Fox is willing to take. The worst that could
happen is it doesn't appeal to the cerebral sports fan and
Olbermann returns to the schlock factory.
</P>
<P>
   And for Olbermann, it's a unique situation in which he'll be his
own boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given my career history, I can now submit my own resignation
to myself,'' he said. ``Finally, I can give myself hell.''
</P>
<P>
   MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE STUDIO: If the only form of baseball that
Mark Gubicza could be around in his post-big-league career was in
helping coach his 5-year-old son's tee-ball team at Northridge
(Calif.) Little League, that'd be fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   But then a TV opportunity was presented to Gubicza on a tee.
Could it be even better?
</P>
<P>
   In this case, sure, especially since it was a gig near the San
Fernando Valley home that he and wife Lisa have lived in since they
were married in 1986 and where they've had two daughters, now 8 and
2.
</P>
<P>
   Two years removed from a disappointing end to his 14-year
career, Gubicza says he has the best of both family and baseball
going in as a studio analyst this year with Fox's ``National Sports
Report'' news show and its ``Baseball Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation couldn't be better,'' said Gubicza, who turns
38 in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, my job should be as a real husband and father.
Playing for so long away from home was so much a burden on my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV certainly wasn't anything I thought much about after
retirement. If anything, I thought I'd be coaching. But it feels
great to be back in the game, expressing opinions. It's like I'm
back in the clubhouse again _ and I get to go home afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   After a shoulder injury pretty much washed out his final year _
a 0-1 record in two horrific starts with the Angels in '97 after 13
seasons with Kansas City that included two All-Star appearances _
Gubicza was asked by the Royals if he'd like to be a roving
minor-league pitching instructor. He passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox gave him a tryout and he was about to sign,
but he found out he'd have to spend time at Triple-A Pawtucket. He
passed again.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN even called to see if he'd like to be on its ``Baseball
Tonight'' show, but that meant going back to Bristol, Conn. No
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   But when Fox Sports talent recruiter Hank Siegel asked him out
of the blue if he'd like to do an audition for the news show,
Gubicza gave it a try.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. Getting by on more than just good looks,
Gubicza has been able to convey his thoughts with relative ease. He
says he has no trouble making the transition from playing field to
TV studio, even with the fine line ex-athletes and former managers
(such as fellow Fox analysts Ron Darling, Steve Sax and Kevin
Kennedy) have to draw when discussing current players with whom
they have long-time relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've treated it as if I was a player in that regard,'' Gubicza
said. ``I didn't like it when people said things about my
character. If I had a bad outing, fine. As long as it's not a
character issue. I'm not going to roast someone for the pure
entertainment of it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- Coverage of the Tour de France winds down to this weekend's
final stages, and should Lance Armstrong keep that yellow shirt on,
ESPN says it will do what a 24-hour all-sports network should do _
cut in live Sunday morning, even if it's only the last 10 minutes
of the race. That's projected to between 7:50 and 8:08 a.m. Pacific
Time. A live report on the start of the final stage will be
featured in ESPN's 6 a.m. ``SportsCenter.'' ESPN2's regularly
scheduled coverage Sunday will be at 4 p.m., and ESPN has a show
starting at midnight. ABC has delayed coverage Saturday to 5 p.m. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- Mike Lamb joins Jim Watson and John Jackson on Fox Sports Net
2's coverage of the CaliFlorida high school all-star football game
from the Rose Bowl (Saturday, 7 p.m. PDT) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- No surprise with all the flowing synergy featured in the new
movie ``Disney's The Kid,'' but stay around for the credits and
you'll discover that it was ESPN ``SportsCenter'' anchor Rich Eisen
who played the part of ``Stuart Scott'' and Stuart Scott who did
``Rich Eisen.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- Used to be a team could win a title and then sell a few caps,
T-shirts and bumper stickers to make the fans feel a part of it.
Today, it's videos, CDs and quick-to-print books that the diehards
are expected to buy into or else feel incomplete. And only the
``officially licensed'' material will do. The official Lakers
1999-2000 championship video was released this week, an hour-long
production put out by NBA Entertainment and USA Home Entertainment
that sells for $19.99. That in itself is a nice investment with
some very decent never-before-seen stuff. But add to that the
official CD of what's described as ``arena music and the most

IBF LAWYERS CRITICIZE PROSECUTION
</HEADLINE>
  By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Lawyers for the leaders of the IBF, who are on
trial for racketeering and seeking bribes in exchange for boxer
rankings, said Thursday that their clients are victims of a
``selective prosecution'' of the sport's only black-controlled
sanctioning organization.
</P>
<P>
   They charged that in bringing the case, the office of the
U.S.attorney for New Jersey had made itself an ``unwitting ally of
multimillionaire white promoters'' who were among the key
prosecution witnesses. They said these promoters stand to gain
greater influence over the millions of dollars involved in boxing
with the discrediting of the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearly daylong summation, Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for
Robert Lee, the IBF president and founder, said that witnesses like
Bob Arum, the head of Top Rank promotions, Cedric Kushner and
Ronald Weathers, who all testified that they paid illegal bribes,
were walking free ``with a wink and a nod'' from prosecutors while
his client was forced to undergo a 3 1/2 month trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to act as the conscience of this community and say
that this man should not be convicted for conduct that others
engaged in and are walking around free for,'' Krovatin said.
``Whether you view it as racial or nonracial, it is still selective
and it's not fair, and you have to say so.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his son, Robert Lee Jr., are charged with 34 counts of
bribery, conspiracy, racketeering and money laundering in
connection with allegedly soliciting and accepting $338,000 in
bribes from managers, promoters and fighters over a 14-year period.
The two face 20 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge John Bissell is scheduled to send the
jury to deliberate in the case by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Krovatin and John DeMassi, the lawyer for the younger Lee
in their summations, parsed the legal distinctions between what the
prosecution called bribes and what they called ``legal gratuities''
of the kind given to letter carriers, doormen and waiters.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers questioned whether the IBF had any obligation to
base its rankings on merit alone and painstakingly followed the
trail of alleged bribes laid out by prosecutors to raise questions
about whether the federal government had jurisdiction even if they
did take place.
</P>
<P>
   The government case, said Krovatin, was ``out there on the far
frontier of legal theory'' and ``vagued-up'' in a way to snare his
client. Furthermore, he charged that in using the Racketeering
Influenced Corrupt Organizations act originally intended for
prosecuting organized crime figures, the prosecution was engaged in
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   But his most withering comments were reserved for the government
witnesses whose ``converging agendas'' in getting rid of the IBF,
with its close ties to the promoter Don King, were served by the
government investigation which they aided.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly, he directed his charges at the government's main
witness, Colin Douglas Beavers, the IBF's former rankings chairman,
who testified that he was the bagman and distributor of the alleged
bribes which the prosecution has conceded Lee never solicited or
collected himself. When confronted by FBI agents with the threat of
arrest, Beavers became a government informant and recorded and
videotaped conversations with Lee and others that figured
prominently in the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   Krovatin depicted Beavers, who is white, as being bitter at his
demotion within the IBF and eager to set up his own sanctioning
group.
</P>
<P>
   He said Beavers first raised a racial spector in the case when
he told Dan Duva, the late promoter and owner of Main Event and an
antagonist of the IBF, that Lee's actions as head of the group were
less about money than they were about a racial solidarity with
King.
</P>
<P>
   Krovatin recalled a conversation that Duva taped and turned over
to prosecutors, triggering the investigation: ``Beavers says to
Duva, `Don King is a black man who has made it in this business and
Bob Lee has attached himself to his coattails.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Krovatin's version of the case, these alleged payments were
all tailored by Beavers and others to snare Lee: the $65,000 Dino
Duva testified that he made to get a fighter a better ranking; the
$100,000 payment that Arum said he made through an intermediary in
1995 to get IBF sanctioning of a fight between George Foreman and
Axel Schulz, and the $100,000 that Kushner said he paid to Beavers
on Lee's behalf for a Foreman-Schulz rematch. Pointing to Arum's
testimony and inconsistencies in other evidence presented, he said
the go-betweens were the real beneficiaries of the payments.

PEOPLE WITH GENETIC RISKS OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY INFORMING
RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 10th and 11th grafs for clarifications) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As genetic testing becomes increasingly common, people who
choose to learn their genetic risks, and the health professionals
who treat them, are facing difficult decisions about how _ and
whether _ to share the results with family members who share their
genes.
</P>
<P>
   And the new genetic information is creating new kinds of rifts,
when one family member finds out what another family member does
not want to know, or when family members react differently to the
same knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman who'd had ovarian cancer was tested for the breast
cancer gene mutations mostly for the sake of her two adult
daughters,'' said Katherine Schneider, senior genetics counselor at
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ``But when she told
them she had it, they were so devastated that they didn't talk with
her for two years. They didn't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell that story a lot. There's nothing easy about any of
this. But before testing, it's important to talk not only about
what the information will mean for you, but what it might mean to
your sisters, your children, your cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests are now commonplace, what with prenatal tests
diagnosing hundreds of different syndromes, midlife tests for
mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer, and _ with the human
genome newly mapped _ more and more familial disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific advances have created intense debate about public
policy on genetic discrimination. But the private effects on family
dynamics are just as complex, as patients and health professionals
adjust to thinking about family not just as flesh and blood, but
flesh and blood and genes.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, patients are happy to share health information with
family members for whom it may be important, often asking the
doctor or genetic counselor for a written explanation to pass
along.
</P>
<P>
   But when patients want to keep the information to themselves,
health professionals may encounter situations that mix social
problem and soap opera, and be ethically and legally pulled into
uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A young man in Washington state called his genetics counselor to
confess a guilty conscience: Several months earlier, he told her,
he had made a sperm donation. And while he knew his test results
had shown that he had an inheritable syndrome that causes heart
trouble and, often, early death, he did not mention it to the sperm
bank. Troubled, the counselor called the sperm bank and found that
there had, indeed, been successful pregnancies with the man's
sperm. She offered to counsel those families but does not know
whether the sperm bank even passed on the information.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York family with three adult daughters, the two married
daughters know that their mother, who had breast cancer as a young
woman, has been tested and found to carry a gene mutation
associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The
mother has forbidden them to tell their unmarried sister, who has
always felt herself to be the least attractive, for fear that it
might make her less marriageable. They have obeyed, but want the
family doctor to make sure she has frequent mammograms and
screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Two sisters who know their mother had genetic testing before she
died of ovarian cancer want to find out her test results. But the
Pennsylvania medical center that did the testing will not release
the results to the young women without the consent of their
stepfather, who has a dismal relationship with them. The sisters
could, of course, have had their own genetic tests, but they had
hoped by learning more about their family's history they could
avoid the expensive process. The center's ethics committee is now
revising its consent forms to require all patients tested to
specify which family members should have access to the results
after their death.
</P>
<P>
   One California genetics counselor tells of her confusion when a
couple who had a child with cystic fibrosis came to discuss their
risks for future pregnancies, and in providing a family history,
the wife mentioned that her estranged half-sister had a baby who
died from a serious congenital defect. It was nothing genetic, she
assured the counselor. But the counselor knew otherwise: The sister
had been an earlier client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just rang a bell in my head,'' the counselor said. ``I
remembered the name, and I remembered telling her it was genetic,
and she should tell her relatives. I didn't know what to do. But I
didn't want to breach confidentiality for either one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she called the previous client on the pretext of a
routine records check. ``I played dumb, saying I just happened to
have her file on my desk,'' the counselor said, ``and I'd noticed
we'd talked about telling her family the results, and I was just
following up for the records, wondering if that conversation had
taken place, and she said, why, no, it hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I reminded her why it was important. And a few days later,
I had a call from the current client, who said the funniest thing
had happened, she'd had a call from her half-sister, and there was
a genetic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Often, the decision to pass on information is a delicate one,
depending not only on such factors as the relatives' closeness, age
and emotional health, but also the nature of the disease and the
severity of the risk. Where there is no treatment, or the risk is
small, the case for sharing painful knowledge becomes less
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Josephine Wagner Costalas, a genetic counselor at Fox
Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, has an unspoken worry whenever
she counsels a patient who has tested positive for the breast
cancer gene mutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst nightmare is the scenario where I might have a
patient who tests positive and doesn't tell her relatives,''
Costalas said, ``and a few years later her sister will discover she
has metastatic cancer, with a bad prognosis, and she'll find out
that there was this information showing she was at risk. And maybe
she'll sue me, saying I should have picked up the phone and told
her, `Your sister's positive, you should get tested.' This is all
so new, and there are no clear guidelines, so I worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Costalas does not pressure her patients to share their
results. ``If people aren't sure about sharing the information, I
ask them to think about what it would be like if the situation were
reversed,'' she said. ``Would they want to know? But I do believe
patients need to decide for themselves what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And when several family members come in together, there are
other issues. ``What if they have different results?'' Costalas
said. ``Who do you tell first? What if they have different
reactions?''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Shumsky, whom Costalas counseled recently, never had any
doubt about sharing her results. There has been a lot of cancer in
Shumsky's family: Her father had early-onset colon cancer, his
sister had early breast cancer, three of his other siblings had
colon cancer, and her grandfather had melanoma. Shumsky herself was
diagnosed with melanoma last year, on her 40th birthday, and the
breast cancer gene mutations she was being tested for are
associated with a higher risk of melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She listened intently as Costalas told her that the test was
negative, that there was no sign that the melanoma was genetic, but
that it might be worth pursuing further genetic testing for colon
cancer. Then Costalas asked about Shumsky's plans to share her
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister knows I'm here, and I'm going to tell her the
results as soon as I get home,'' Shumsky said. ``And I'm going to
tell her about the colon cancer. After walking around with a mole
for years, and then finding out it was melanoma, I want everyone in
my family to watch out for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got my diagnosis, I called her doctor myself, and told
him she needed melanoma screening. I know it's butting into her
life, but if she never talks to me again, and I save her life, it's
worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the American Society of Human Genetics, an
organization of doctors, counselors and others dealing with
genetics, adopted a position recognizing the conflict between the
health professions' duty to maintain confidentiality and the duty
to warn about serious health risks. Health professionals should
tell patients about potential genetic risks to their relatives, the
statement said, and in some cases, they may be allowed to breach
confidentiality to warn relatives at risk if the harm is ``serious,
imminent and likely'' and prevention or treatment is available.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little consensus on where to draw those lines.
Generally, genetic counselors are more concerned about
confidentiality and not pressuring patients, while physicians
specializing in genetics are more concerned about the duty to warn,
according to research by Dorothy C. Wertz, senior scientist at the
Shriver Center in Waltham, Mass. As a practical matter, though,
most health professionals cannot warn relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it's up to the patient, because in real life, we
don't have relatives' names and phone numbers,'' said Helen Hixon,
a genetic counselor in cardiology at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles. ``We do tell people pretty strongly that they should
warn their relatives, that they may have a legal duty to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers specializing in bioethics say that while patients may
have some moral obligation, they have no legal duty to warn
relatives. There have been at least two legal rulings, one in a
1995 Florida case and the other in a 1996 New Jersey case, giving
conflicting signals on whether doctors can be held liable for
failing to warn a patient's relatives about their risks of a
hereditary form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tensions involving family disclosure of genetic
risks are not new, the issue has become more complicated as genetic
tests proliferate, and it becomes possible to identify a person's
predisposition to common diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that most of these issues came up around rare
disorders, where there was a recessive gene that became a problem
only when it met up with another carrier,'' said Vivian Weinblatt,
president elect of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.
``With those, the risks are pretty clear, and you know who's
affected. Now we're talking about areas where it's all gray, where
it's a gene that predisposes you to some disease you might get
anyway in late middle age.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOws)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The breast cancer gene mutations are the latest case in point
and the fastest growing area of testing. While most cases of breast
and ovarian cancer are not hereditary, women with specific
mutations in the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes have a lifetime risk of
breast or ovarian cancer well over 50 percent, odds so high that
many women who test positive choose to have their breasts and
ovaries removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother died of breast cancer when I was 15, and my older
sister got it when she was 41,'' said a 43-year old New York woman
who recently had the preventive surgery, telling only three people
of her situation. ``I knew as soon as I tested positive that I
would do anything I could to get my odds down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's been awkward with my sister, who's against
prophylactic surgery. I think she's crazy, she thinks I'm crazy and
we don't talk about it anymore. Instead of it being a shared family
thing, it's made us less close.''
</P>
<P>
   In some families, particularly Ashkenazi Jewish families, which
are more likely to carry the mutations, the testing has become a
pressure point.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of our early research families, with a serious history
of cancer, there was a push from the family matriarch that anyone
found to have the mutation should get a mastectomy,' said Jill
Stopfer at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center. ``The push
was so strong that some of the younger women decided they wouldn't
get tested, not because they couldn't handle the results, but
because they were worried about the family pressure to have
surgery.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Like most candidates for public office, Douglas
Couvertier needed a clear, strong message, something that would cut
through the other candidates' talk about what they would do for the
voters, if elected.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a catchy slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't vote for me, please,'' seemed about right.
</P>
<P>
   Couvertier, whose name will be on the ballot Tuesday when voters
go to the polls to elect a city council for the newly formed town
of Southwest Ranches in Broward County, is running hard, and
running to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to civic leaders asking them not to vote for me,''
or provide other support in any way, said Couvertier. ``I've sent
out letters saying, `Please don't vote for me.' I've talked to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood a real good chance of being elected,'' he said,
forlorn. ``In fact, my fear is I still stand a real good chance of
being elected.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, he said, he will resign from the council
without serving.
</P>
<P>
   It did not start that way, of course. He ran because he wanted
to help shape the future of the town, one of the last mostly rural
places in South Florida that is neither park land, nor under water
in the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the 54-year-old Couvertier, a battalion chief
for the Miami-Dade Fire Department, was told by his boss that the
Miami-Dade County charter prohibits employees from holding elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the charter, candidates must go on leave when they begin
campaigning, and must quit their job if they win. Couvertier could,
his superiors told him, lose a big part of his pension if he
resigned from the fire department now.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know the charter had such a provision, and it came to
his bosses' attention too late. He wanted to bow out, but was told
by election officials that it was too late to have his name removed
from the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   So he is campaigning fast and furious, as dedicated as anybody
who is trying to win, to derail his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He has stopped short of name-calling and character
assassination, but there is no telling how low he may have to stoop
if things keep going the way they are going.
</P>
<P>
   He hears he is the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   With eight candidates seeking four at-large seats, he has a
50-50 chance at least, but early indications are that Couvertier, a
27-year veteran of the fire department and a popular figure in his
community of 7,000 to 9,000 people, has been pulling ahead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, in what seemed like a good thing at the time, he
won the endorsement of The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   His home bustles with anti-campaign activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God you called,'' said a friend, Sara Horowitz, when
told it was The New York Times on the line. ``We're trying so
desperately not to get him elected.''
</P>
<P>
   With no budget for television advertising _ if he just had some
television money, he could blow himself right out of contention _
he must try other tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But it is tricky.
</P>
<P>
   He could post signs that read ``Vote for anybody but me,'' but
that could backfire. In the attention span of many voters, it might
be just enough information to trip their memories on election day
and cause them to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in this area,'' he said. ``I've lived here
for over 20 years and I love it here. I thought it was important
for my town for me to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But now is not the time.
</P>
<P>
   Couvertier is three years from retirement. If he is elected and
then resigns, he will probably be able to save his pension. But he
would prefer not to go through that bureaucratic ordeal, and not
have friends and neighbors elect him to a job that he immediately
rejects.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to quit the race came too late to just take him off
the ballot, said Jane Carroll, the Broward County elections
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to correct them at this point,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four absentee ballots are already in. With Couvertier's
luck, he is probably already ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes me nervous,'' Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   For the other candidates, it seems like a lot of good votes
going to waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first, I think Doug is a good candidate and it's a shame
that he has to back out,'' said Forest Blanton, 47, who is running
for the council.
</P>
<P>
   But politics is politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were more aggressive, I'd try to ask him to recommend me
to voters,'' Blanton said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castillo, the Miami-Dade County assistant fire chief,
said Couvertier was not going to be disciplined for not taking a
leave because it was ``an honest mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' he said, ``everyone is chuckling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it appears that Couvertier will be able to reclaim
his job if he is elected, then resigns, he takes the election
seriously and does not want to have to say ``No thank you,'' if he
is unsuccessful in not winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only out now is to lose,'' he said.

MALLON USES DETOUR ON WAY TO LEAD
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL FIELDS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. _ Meg Mallon knows that the route to success in the
U.S. Women's Open traditionally demands few detours, but she made
an unusual one Thursday while taking the first-round lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon chose a maverick strategy on the 14th hole in an
otherwise textbook round at the Merit Club. The result was a
4-under 68, which gave her a one-stroke lead over Australians
Karrie Webb and Shani Waugh. Juli Inkster, the defending champion,
was another stroke back at 70. Annika Sorenstam, the LPGA's money
leader, was five strokes back at 73.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Women's Open in 1991, Mallon purposely drove
her tee shot at the difficult 406-yard par 4 into the wrong
fairway. The drive, played well right into the adjacent 13th
fairway to avoid water and sand on the troublesome dogleg hole, set
up a 5-iron shot to the green from 170 yards and a two-putt par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that's a better way to play the hole,'' said Mallon,
who was encouraged by her caddie, John Killeen. ``The tee shot on
14 is very severe.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that during her practice rounds, ``I had hit it in the
water and in the bunker and I thought going over to the 13th
fairway was a better option.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dottie Pepper looks back on her opening 76, she might
agree. Pepper was cruising along at even par before driving two
balls into the water at No. 14 and making a quadruple-bogey 8.
</P>
<P>
   The wind picked up in the afternoon, providing tougher
conditions for afternoon starters. Mallon, Waugh and Inkster each
played in the morning. ``It was almost perfectly calm when we teed
off,'' said the 30-year-old Waugh. ``This course is tough enough
when it's calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon's decision at the 14th hole startled fellow players and
U.S. Golf Association officials, who hadn't anticipated such a
maneuver. ``I guess creativity is the hallmark of U.S. Women's Open
champions,'' said Kendra Graham, the USGA director of women's
competitions. ``I think it's ingenious. It just shows there are
many ways to skin a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of an infamous piece of USGA history, Graham attempted
to play down Mallon's line of play on No. 14. During the first
round of the men's 1979 U.S. Open at Inverness Club in Toledo,
Ohio, Lon Hinkle and five others took a shortcut from the eighth
tee down the 17th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of the second round, the USGA hastily planted a
24-foot spruce to block the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remember the Hinkle tree,'' Graham said. ``I would not want
to do that at the U.S. Women's Open.''
</P>
<P>
   A five-person championship committee had planned to discuss the
issue Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, meanwhile, would love to repeat her first-round form.
She hit 16 greens in regulation and did not make a bogey. Just a
few days ago, she was struggling with her swing,
uncharacteristically hitting shots far off line.
</P>
<P>
   But sessions with her instructor, Mike McGetrick, restored her
rhythm and tempo. ``I had no transition at the top of my
backswing,'' Mallon said. ``Mike and I just went back to basics. We
had to work on drills just to get me back.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her Women's Open victory in 1991, the 37-year-old
Mallon was second in 1995 and tied for fifth place last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some very good finishes in the U.S. Open,'' she said.
``But I know how fickle it is _ a certain break here or a lucky
bounce there. It's my favorite event, and I'd love to win it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, who played in the stronger afternoon winds, is looking for
her first Women's Open title. She had to take her right shoe and
sock off to play a recovery shot out of a water hazard on the
seventh hole, but saved par. Webb birdied two of the final three
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all it was just a really solid round of golf,'' Webb
said.

SIX STATES BEGIN TO SUE PHONE   GIANTS  &HT;     BY TODD WALLACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO - California and five other states filed separate
lawsuits against Worldcom Thursday, accusing the long distance
giant of slamming, cramming and deceptive advertising.
<P>
   Several states also sued AT&AMP;T and Sprint for misleading
advertising Thursday. But California regulators said they zeroed in
on Worldcom, the nation's second-largest long distance telephone
company, because it received more complaints than any other major
long distance carrier. Top complaints included slamming, or
switching customers' service without permission, and cramming
unauthorized charges on customers' bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are providing a necessary service, but they are doing it
utilizing unfair business practices,'' charged California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC received more than 3,500 complaints against Worldcom
last year, more than AT&AMP;T, even though AT&AMP;T has three to four times
as many customers. And PUC complaints against Worldcom climbed 136
percent from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As first reported in Thursday's Chronicle, Lockyer teamed up
with the California Public Utilities Commission to deliver a
two-fisted punch against Worldcom, which mainly sells long distance
service under the MCI name. The complaint, filed in San Francisco
Superior Court, seeks $20 million in penalties and court-ordered
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom declined to comment on the suits. But consumer groups,
who have long &LR;  frequently complained that long distance companies
have received scant attention from state regulators, cheered the
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is great news,'' said Tom Long, an attorney with the
Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ``No one in this office
can recall the PUC going to state court to enforce consumer
protection laws. This is a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine, Minnesota, Missouri and New Jersey also sued Worldcom.
Idaho and Maine sued AT&AMP;T. Illinois sued Sprint. And Connecticut
sued all three. Attorneys general said they coordinated the action
to pool their resources and boost the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is to let the industry know that we mean
business,'' said Leslie Sandberg, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom has already been fined for slamming by New York state
regulators, and recently paid the U.S. government $3.5 million in
lieu of a fine for slamming. But Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal said federal regulators haven't done enough to
address false advertising and other issues. ``The federal agencies
have simply not stepped up to the plate'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint could not be reached for comment. But AT&AMP;T said the suits
were unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been our longstanding policy to provide customers with
clear and direct information,'' said AT&AMP;T spokesman Mark Siegel.
``To do anything else in a competitive marketplace simply wouldn't
make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the California complaint cites several examples of
misleading ads from Worldcom, such as the company's ``Five Cents
Everyday''cq &LR;  promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says the advertisements are deceptive because the
rates don't apply to weekdays between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., or
in-state calls. In addition, customers always wind up paying more
than a nickel per minute when extra charges are considered.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to standard taxes and calling rates, Worldcom
charges a monthly fee of up to $4.95 per month, levies a $5 minimum
for calls and tacks on a ``carrier access charge'' of $1.46 per
month. In addition, Worldcom charges up to 7.2 percent more for a
``Federal Universal Service Fee,'' even though the federal
government doesn't require Worldcom to charge the fee.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, singled out the
Worldcom ads, which often feature basketball star Michael Jordan
and cartoon icon Bugs Bunny, as particularly egregious. He said
many of the key details only appear in tiny print, if at all, while
a ``flurry of activity is on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers deserve the truth as big and clear as a Michael
Jordan slam dunk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies aren't actually legally required to disclose
all the terms and conditions to consumers, so long as they include
them in government filings. But regulators say they aren't allowed
to mislead customers either.
</P>
<P>
   California regulators also slammed Worldcom for bragging that
its national directory service lets customers ``get any phone
listing in America,'' when the database is incomplete. And
regulators said it didn't adequately disclose all the rates and
restrictions for its 10-10-321 dial-around long-distance number.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, when customers call to complain or ask
questions, they often encounter rude customer service
representatives, who sometimes hang up on them or put them on hold
for more than an hour, the complaint says.

SMELLS LIKE TEAM SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KELLY YAMANOUCHI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO - A few weeks ago, Bob Valeiko and 17 colleagues in
his sales group at America Online were sipping wine and commenting
on the chef's delicious sweet-corn soup with spicy rock shrimp.
<P>
   Also on the menu were pan-seared halibut fillets with asparagus,
lemon risotto, Caesar salad and chocolate souffle. It was more than
Valeiko could bear.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't necessarily Valeiko's love for risotto that sparked
his enthusiasm. The truth is that the AOL senior executive and his
colleagues found the dinner particularly satisfying because they
had prepared it themselves, under the watchful eye of a chef, as
part of an unusual team-building exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Halibut fillets? Chocolate souffle? Team building?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the organizers believe the event serves team-building
purposes quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasoning: The old team-building standbys such as rock
climbing and group brainstorming put employees through a lot of
physical exertion, mental stretching and competition without making
them happier or more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the thinking is that an exercise like preparing dinner
together could very well be the type of relaxed atmosphere that can
truly help employees develop better rapport and build trust.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a new idea. Mary Risley has been doing it for two
decades at her San Francisco cooking school, Tante Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, cooking classes have been tailored to serve corporate
team-building purposes in other culinary meccas such as New York
and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking classes are gaining currency these days, especially in
the Bay Area, where Silicon Valley companies are looking for ways
to give professionals on the fast track a break as well as a chance
to get to know their co-workers beyond their e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of cooking and eating a sumptuous meal with colleagues
fits in well with the frenetic but casual workplace attitude so
prevalent in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are living such fast-paced lives where they're driving
in SUVs down to the Silicon Valley, coming back late at night and
microwaving their food,'' Risley said. ``Somehow, cooking classes
are grounding them. It's closer to a former life, it's not high
tech.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of AOL, the company firmly believes that
team-building events can help those groups that are separated
geographically and communicate mainly through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Employees in Valeiko's sales unit say the cooking class was a
much-needed break from their long, hectic workdays.
</P>
<P>
   After cocktails and an explanation from chef Charlie Vollmar,
they put on their aprons, rolled up their sleeves and split up into
teams.
</P>
<P>
   One group clustered around the counter preparing a Caesar salad,
while another started mincing shallots for the appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   While Valeiko helped with the main dish, some of his co-workers
started on the chocolate souffle.
</P>
<P>
   Vollmar worked next to each team, giving instructions and brief
lessons on how to cook the ``professional way,'' starting with a
lesson on how to properly dice an onion.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours later, the group sat at dinner tables they
had set themselves complete with fanned napkins as they waited
eagerly to serve their dishes and taste what their co-workers made.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Flanagan, a sales representative for AOL, said she has done
plenty of other team building with activities such as rope-obstacle
courses. For her, the cooking class was not only a chance to learn
something new and practical, but also more relaxing, especially
because it came at the end of the workweek.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are making team building a regular quarterly or
monthly event. They also aren't shy about investing tidy sums in
the exercise because they have seen the return in improved employee
workplace performance.
</P>
<P>
   In case of Valeiko's group, AOL shelled out nearly $2,000 for
the cooking class and even flew Valeiko and another employee in
from New York for the occasion. By comparison, other team-building
programs such as ropes courses and rock climbing can cost more,
nearly $200 per person for a half-day event.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also use cooking classes to serve other purposes, such
as rewarding the efforts of a department or getting employees and
their clients together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing companies finding very untraditional ways of
entertaining their troops or entertaining their clients,'' said
Vollmar, who runs Epicurean Exchange, a 1-year-old business he
started to teach cooking classes for companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking classes can be ``a low-risk way to interact with
people,'' noted Bain &AMP; Co. employee Karen Greve, who learned to
cook with her co-workers during a team-building session.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Susan Forster, who teaches a seminar series on team building
through the Advanced Management Institute in San Francisco, said
she hadn't heard of this use of the culinary arts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she noted that a cooking class could have the fundamental
criteria for a successful team-building exercise: planning,
coordinating and evaluating the results _ skills that can be
brought to the next project at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of cooking is that it makes team members
accountable: ``The meal you create _ that's what you get, and
that's what you gotta eat,'' Forster said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 organizations in the Bay Area offer cooking classes
for corporate team-building purposes. They charge anywhere between
$45 per person for a two-hour class to $400 for an all-day session.
For that price, the employees get to eat what they have prepared in
a formal dinner, complete with wine.
</P>
<P>
   The price may be well worth it in today's red-hot job market,
where companies seek ways to keep qualified professionals from
bolting to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the cooking classes come in. Instead of using team
building to push employees harder, they are trying to show
employees that they are appreciated by using cooking classes as a
reward for finishing a project, or for a much-deserved break.
</P>
<P>
   But in some corporate cooking classes, results are still
everything.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with choosing a recipe designed to foster teamwork.
For instance, preparing a complex dish with a number of steps _
like chocolate souffle with a creme anglaise _ requires each person
in the group to work toward a common goal, with the completion of
each step and successful timing essential to successful execution.
</P>
<P>
   There are many variations of the cooking team-building game. One
of the California Culinary Academy's team-building programs
dispenses with recipes and favors the use of a ``mystery basket,''
in which the group is supposed to cook a meal after being given raw
ingredients _ such as vegetables, proteins, herbs and spices.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the team members set the rules of the game. The
group might decide that it can only ask a certain number of
questions of the chef before deciding what ingredients will bring
out the best flavor, then attempt to relate the exercise to their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Team Cuisine, a San Francisco organization that runs cooking
classes for companies, starts with the group deciding what their
goals for the session will be. For example, the goal might be to
get the group to work more cohesively, ending the session with a
discussion about what the team members learned while preparing the
meal.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Connolly, who runs Team Cuisine, says he uses ``cooking as a
metaphor for learning'' and also incorporates motivational speaking
into the program.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate cooking sessions provide an opportunity for
employees to learn more about their work styles in a different
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some that direct, some that take charge, some that
chop, some that observe,'' said AOL's Valeiko.
</P>
<P>
   Often a manager might find that work habits from the office pop
up in the kitchen, giving insight to employees' teamwork styles.
</P>
<P>
   A culinary lesson also has a practical element for
corporate-ladder climbers who don't have the time or the energy to
cook at the end of the day. In the AOL telesales department,
everyone is under 30, none is married and few know their way around
the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one cooking class won't turn anyone into a gourmet
chef. For many, it doesn't even necessarily yield any immediate
results in terms of building better teams. Instead, it's just an
expensive way to socialize with co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have jobs that we sit in our cubes and we're on the
phone much of the day,'' AOL's Flanagan said. ``We don't have a lot
of time to relax and get to know each other personally.''
</P>
<P>
   And Flanagan strongly believes that in the long term, the
camaraderie built during a day out of the office can help in the
workplace. ``It enables you to rely on other people and ask people
questions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another AOL sales representative, Brian Tu, summed up the best
part of the cooking class for himself: ``Having my manager serve me
dinner. That's always fun.''

CHIPMAKERS ARE THE HEROES OF THE SECOND-QUARTER ALL-STAR TEAM  &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're midway through the second-quarter earnings reporting
season, and once again, the all-star roster is loaded with
companies from the technology team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, what's driving the economy is energy and technology,
the same as the first quarter,'' says Chuck Hill, research director
with First Call, one of two major earnings trackers.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 have
reported second-quarter results and so far, tech earnings are
beating expectations by 9 percent, and are up 44 percent
year-over-year, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all is said and done, we expect tech earnings to be up 36
percent,'' says Hill. That's even better than tech's 33 percent
year-over-year gain in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chip and chip-equipment companies are leading the techs. In
fact, four of the companies reporting the 10 largest gains are in
this category.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor earnings are up 163 percent; First Call is
expecting 133 percent when final results are in.
</P>
<P>
   Chip-equipment earnings are up 250 percent, but only two
high-flying companies have reported. First Call expects a final
gain of 148 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big energy companies won't report earnings until
next week, but they are likely to be gushers. The five that have
reported so far have shown a 272 percent increase; First Call is
anticipating a 129 percent gain in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Hill says the biggest surprise has been electric utilities.
``What had been one of the more predictable sectors is now one of
the more unpredictable ones, because of deregulation. With the
demand situation changing as well, we're getting a lot of erratic
patterns. You get into a period when there are shortages and prices
go sky high. These companies are learning to cope, and once it
settles out it won't be as erratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Software is another mixed bag, says Joseph Kalinowski, equity
strategist at IBES International, the other big earnings tracker.
</P>
<P>
   After Computer Associates and BMC announced they wouldn't meet
earnings expectations, he thought all software companies might
struggle. Instead, ``they're either coming in real strong or
missing the consensus,'' Kalinowski says.

 &LR;  ``On average, software companies are beating estimates by 11.3
percent. The average company in the S&AMP;P is beating by only 3.5
percent,'' Kalinowski says.
</P>
<P>
   What's not doing so well? Consumer durables, consumer services,
finance and transportation are all showing less than 10 percent
year-over-year gains in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, second-quarter earnings will be strong, but not as
robust as the sizzling first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year-over-year growth was 23.6 percent in first quarter. So
far this quarter, we're only at 16 percent,'' Hill says. But he
thinks next week's energy surge will drive the final average to 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, investors responded to first-quarter earnings by
dumping stocks. They were so terrified by Alan Greenspan's interest
rate increases that they barely noticed near-record earnings gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quarter, we're in a tug of war between an
interest-rate-driven market and an earnings-driven market,'' Hill
says.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever we get a bit of news that indicates the economy may be
overheating _ like last week's inflation number _ the market
panics. On days when the economy seems benign, investors focus once
again on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   One highlight: Small companies are doing as well as large ones,
which is unusual this late in an economic cycle.
</P>
<P>
   With 22 percent of the little guys reporting, the average
earnings gain is 18 percent. ``They're going to be about the same
as the S&AMP;P 500 after underperforming for two years,'' Hill says.
``Next quarter, small-cap earnings ought to exceed big cap.''
</P>

 &LR; EARNINGS SUE-PRISES: Are all surprises created equal?
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Joseph Kalinowski, who publishes a little-known
but interesting statistic known as the SUE score.
</P>
<P>
   Short for ``standardized unanticipated earnings,'' it measures
not just the size but the significance of an earnings surprise.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of PENDER21 (107960 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  For example, suppose two companies are both expected to earn 10
cents per share. However, analysts expect company Company A to earn
5 cents to 15 cents, and Company B to earn 9 cents to 11 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies report 20 cents. Both have a 100 percent
surprise. But company A beat the most optimistic analysts by only a
nickel, whereas company B blew away almost all of the analysts by a
much wider margin. Company B's surprise was more significant,
according to Kalinowski.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the SUE score measures the number of standard
deviations the actual reported earnings differ from the surprise
mean estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A 10 percent surprise relative to a 1 percent range in estimates
yields a SUE score of 10. A 10 percent surprise relative to a 10
percent range in estimates yields a SUE score of 1. Kalinowski says
a SUE score greater than 1 or less than negative 1 is a
statistically significant earnings surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with big SUE-prises for the second quarter are listed
in the accompanying chart. I'll update the list when earnings
season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's hard to find SUE scores unless you're a
client of IBES. The New York company plans to begin publishing some
SUE scores on its Web site ( &LR; www.ibes.com &LR; ) but hasn't done so yet.

COULTER EXCITED BY CHASE  &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO - David Coulter &UR;  &LR; says he's thinking about his new
job, not dwelling on the past.
<P>
   The former chief executive officer of Bank of America, in one of
his first interviews since he was named vice chairman and consumer
banking chief of New York's Chase Manhattan Corp., said he is
charged up about his new assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter had little to say about the 1998 sale of BofA to North
Carolina's NationsBank and his subsequent ouster by Hugh McColl,
the combined banks' boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working hard to look forward as opposed to looking
backward,'' Coulter stressed. ``I guess if I had to make a summary
statement, it's just that I tried to do the right thing, I tried to
do things that made sense for the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   During and after his 21/2 &LR; - &LR; year &LR;   &LR; stint as BofA's CEO,
Coulter's local reputation rode a roller coaster. At first, he was
the man who pumped up BofA's morale and its stock with a
disciplined yet personable management style.
</P>
<P>
   After the takeover, as jobs disappeared and BofA's stock
tumbled, many saw him as a bumbler who had sold out his bank,
walking away with a golden parachute that gives him $5 million a
year for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the banking world, however, the reviews were not so harsh.
Coulter was widely admired for his intellect, analytical abilities
and people skills, if not for his bargaining acumen. ``He's
obviously a very talented guy,'' said Tony Price, an executive
recruiter with the search firm Russell Reynolds Associates.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving BofA, Coulter weighed several options before last
year joining the Beacon Group, an investment banking and money
management boutique. Two months ago, Chase, the nation's No. 3
bank, bought Beacon. Coulter found himself huddled with William
Harrison, the bank's CEO, discussing job possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Coulter said at first he wasn't enthusiastic
about staying with Chase in a subordinate role. But, Coulter said,
Harrison charmed him and promised him broad authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked probably three or four times,'' Coulter said. ``I
believe that Bill is really trying hard to create a team at the top
that works together. In terms of how we structured what I was going
to be doing, ... he was very flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter said he also was won over by the chance to run the
retail operation of one of the nation's top financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is changing the rules for financial institutions,
Coulter noted. Banks are struggling to come up with the right
balance of online and brick-and-mortar services.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of COULTER2 (100409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR;  &LR;  ``The retail business today ... is certainly in a period of
change,'' he said. ``The people who get this right, who figure this
out strategically ... if you can be on the leading edge of that
change, you'll feel some real accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison sweetened his offer by handing Coulter responsibilities
for Chase's international operations and putting the bank's online
business under his supervision. ``I had my chance to have my cake
and eat it a couple of times,'' Coulter quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Before he got the top job at BofA, Coulter had little experience
as a consumer banking manager. He spent most of his career in staff
jobs or running corporate or international operations. But the old
BofA had one of the nation's most extensive retail networks, and
Coulter took a crash course in the business when he became the
bank's leader.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving BofA, Coulter moved to Los Angeles. He retains
extensive ties in the Bay Area and sits on the board of such
institutions as PG&AMP;E Corp. and the San Francisco Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Though he and his wife, Susan, will move to New York, Coulter
expects to return frequently to the Bay Area, especially to promote
the business of Chase's San Francisco investment bank, Chase H&AMP;Q,
the former Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. Coulter was an H&AMP;Q director before
Chase bought it last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to try hard to stay involved with California,'' he
said. ``At some point in time, I'll probably end up (living) in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter doesn't seem to spend much time thinking about the
ironic twists in his professional life. (Harrison, his new boss,
like McColl, is a native of the Carolinas.)
</P>
<P>
   Coulter said his new job is simply something that came along:
``This may not have been what I was expecting to do a year ago, but
this looks like an interesting opportunity for me.''

HOLLYWOOD ATTACKS DIGITAL MOVIE PIRACY 
 &HT;     BY CARRIE KIRBY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Joining the recording industry in its escalating
war against Internet copyright infringement, the Motion Picture
Association of America filed a copyright infringement suit Thursday
against Scour, a Web exchange where people trade downloads of
full-length movies.
<P>
   ``This lawsuit is about stealing,'' said Jack Valenti, head of
the association, which represents major movie studios including
Sony and Universal. ``There's a feeling spread among young people
that it's OK to take something that belongs to others, just because
technology makes it possible. (But) you don't raise your children
to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, which joined the
motion picture group and the National Music Publishers Association
in the suit, has a similar case pending against San Mateo's
Napster, a file-sharing program that allows millions of users to
trade music files.
</P>
<P>
   Both suits want the sites to halt distribution of bootleg music
and video materials. Films traded on Scour Exchange include some
not yet released on video, such as ``The Patriot'' and ``X-Men.''
The exchange can also be used to trade songs and still images.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks $150,000 in damages for each copyright
infringement or reimbursement for profits lost. About 1.5 million
files have been downloaded from the Scour Exchange since the
program was started in April, the company estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Scour, a Los Angeles Web company that bills itself as a search
engine for multimedia content, insisted it has complied with
federal copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Scour has a notice posted on its Web site that says it
is not responsible for materials its users share. If copyright
holders do complain, Scour will remove links to the materials in
question, the notice says.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Scour President Dan Rodrigues said he
was surprised by the lawsuit, especially because the Web site has
partnerships with Miramax and Hollywood Records, both listed as
plaintiffs in the suit, and recently met with Sony, Warner and BMG.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Scour is nearly identical to the case against
Napster now in federal court, said Brian Mudge, an
intellectual-property-rights lawyer with New York's Kenyon and
Kenyon. He predicted that the industry groups will win both cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scour is likely to find themselves in as much hot water as
Napster found themselves,'' Mudge said. ``The courts will find that
copyright law exists in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Valenti
characterized the Internet exchanges as rogue companies and that
helped rob individual artists, technicians and other entertainment
industry workers of their royalty payments.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Scour is backed by mogul Michael Ovitz, who briefly
served as the president of Walt Disney and now runs a talent agency
called the Artists Management Group, which represents some of the
very artists Scour is accused of robbing. AMG's clients include
actor Robin Williams and director Martin Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sheirer, a media and entertainment analyst with Forrester
Research, said Ovitz's involvement lends legitimacy to the
file-sharing concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even an industry insider thinks this is a great service. It's
not just a rebel site like Napster that views these kinds of
services as something consumers really want,'' Sheirer said.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti and other industry officials acknowledged that in order
to control property rights online in the long term, major
entertainment companies will have to find ways to use the Internet
for their own purposes, perhaps taking advantage of technologies
similar to those used by Napster and Scour.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time that we're in the courtroom, we're also in
the laboratory and in cyberspace,'' Valenti said. ``Our ultimate
goal is to open movies online.''
</P>
<P>
   Scour and Napster are not the only Internet sites where people
trade copyright materials. New sites pop up continually. Some, such
as music-trading network Gnutella, exist informally as
decentralized networks of individual users that would be difficult
to sue. As a result, analysts say halting all online trading of
movies and music may be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Forrester's Sheirer say the lawsuits are worthwhile
because the industry can use them to influence the public and
congressional perception of unauthorized file trading. The Senate
Judiciary Committee has heard from both sides of the debate in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Eight movie studios, including Disney and Time Warner, and 16
record companies were listed as plaintiffs in the suit.

PLYWOOD MAKER WILLAMETTE INDUSTRIES SETTLES POLLUTION CASE FOR
$93.2 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice
Department announced Thursday that a plywood manufacturer with 13
factories in four states had agreed to a $93.2 million settlement
for air pollution violations, the largest settlement based on
pollution from factories.
</P>
<P>
   The accord means that the environmental agency has settled
pollution cases in the last few years with companies that make up
more than half the wood products industry. In a sector-by-sector
campaign to enforce the terms of the Clean Air Act, the agency has
also reached agreements with diesel engine manufacturers, but it is
still battling with refineries and with coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement with Willamette Industries Inc., a plywood and
building materials manufacturer based in Portland, Ore., with
plants in Arkansas, Louisiana and South Carolina as well, follows
settlements with Louisiana-Pacific, Georgia-Pacific and
Weyerhaeuser; the government is still pursuing Boise-Cascade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a civil penalty of $11.2 million, Willamette will
spend $8 million on environmental projects, and $74 million on new
pollution-control equipment, government officials said. Carol
Browner, the EPA administrator, said that the company had saved
money for years by not installing equipment to reduce emissions but
that with the settlement, ``the economic benefit has been captured
in the penalty, and then some.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Duane McDougall, the company's chief executive
officer, said the company had reached the agreement ``to resolve
certain historic air permit questions.'' Willamette will install
emission control equipment that is ``well beyond what is
required,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA says factories that emit pollutants into the air must
have permits to make changes in the plants. Browner said, ``These
guys didn't even say they needed a permit.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougall said that Willamette had consulted with state
authorities as it made changes to its factories over the years and
had been told that no permits were required, but that the
environmental agency had ``revisited these decisions based on a
revised interpretation of long-established standards and
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's defense is similar to the one still being raised
by electric utility companies that the agency last year accused of
not seeking permits for changes they had made to their plants.
</P>
<P>
   Willamette makes plywood and composite panels. The adhesives
used to bond sheets of plywood together, or form composites, give
off pollutants, volatile organic compounds, that react with
nitrogen compounds in sunlight to form smog.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the company will install equipment to
reduce emissions of the compounds, as well as cut emissions of
small particles and carbon monoxide. The company will spend money
to improve municipal sewer systems, acquire park land and build
ethanol fueling stations to encourage companies that own fleets of
vehicles to use clean fuel.

   After rejecting plea deals in recent days, the two chief
organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to win the 2002 Winter Olympics
were indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury on charges of
conspiracy to commit bribery, fraud and racketeering related to the
vote-buying scandal that erupted in late 1998 and threatened the
future of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-count indictment alleges that Thomas Welch, 55, the
former president of the Salt Lake City bid committee, and David
Johnson, 41, the former vice president, paid $1 million to
improperly influence the votes of more than a dozen delegates of
the International Olympic Committee, which awards the host sites
for the Winter and Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The two former officials also secretly paid an official of the
U.S. Olympic Committee to assist in Salt Lake City's bid, drew up a
series of bogus contracts, falsified books, records and other
documents to conceal their activities, and diverted $130,000 in bid
committee money for personal use, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson became the fourth and fifth persons to be
prosecuted in the Salt Lake City scandal, and according to the
indictment were the ones most directly involved in the plan to win
votes through lavish spending and gift-giving to IOC delegates. A
series of revelations about the scandal in late 1998 and early in
1999 severely damaged the Olympics and the credibility of the IOC,
and threatened to topple the committee's president, Juan Antonio
Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Ten delegates either resigned or were forced out in the wake of
the scandal. Late last year, acknowledging that the bid process had
become corrupted, the IOC instituted a policy that prohibits its
members from visiting cities seeking to host Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Welch and Johnson rejected a plea deal they described
as too sweeping in what they would have to admit to. Subsequent
efforts by their lawyers and prosecutors to reach a deal were
unavailing. In Thursday's indictment they were charged with one
count of conspiracy, five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire
fraud and four counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
Each charge carries a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the charges have been reported previously in great
detail. The one new charge that has surfaced in recent days
concerned money that Welch and Johnson allegedly used for personal
purposes. Jet Set Sports, a New York-based ticket and travel agent,
acknowledged in a statement on Wednesday that it was cooperating
with federal authorities regarding $130,000 in a series of cash
payments that it made to the Salt Lake City bid officials in 1994
and 1995, before the 2002 Games were awarded. At the time, the
company was seeking to become an official Olympic sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Max Wheeler, Johnson's attorney, had told reporters in Salt Lake
City that the company made the donations because it stood to make a
significant profit as an official Olympic travel broker, which it
later became. Wheeler said the money was spent on bid activities,
not personal enrichment. The indictment describes a series of cash
payments totaling $130,000 made by a potential Olympic sponsor to
Welch and Johnson at airports and hotels between August of 1994 and
May of 1995. The 2002 Games were awarded on June 16, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued through his Washington-based attorney,
Welch denied that he and Johnson had committed any wrongdoing.
Wheeler has said repeatedly that the two Olympic officials were
being made scapegoats for participating in what had become a common
practice among bid cities of providing exorbitant favors for
members of the IOC in order to secure their votes. Both men have
denied bribing any delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to assure everyone,'' Welch said in the statement,
``that David Johnson and I committed no crime. I took no pay from
the bid effort. I did not ask for or receive anything personally
from the (bid) committee or from anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   An independent ethics panel investigating Salt Lake City's bid
concluded that officials had given more than $1.2 million in cash
payments, scholarships, jobs, medical treatment, shopping sprees,
excessive travel and expensive baubles to IOC delegates and their
families. The panel pointed most of the blame at Welch and Johnson,
who, in turn, have said that there was widespread knowledge and
approval of their activities in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it has been revealed that similar bidding practices
also occurred in Atlanta's securing of the 1996 Summer Olympics,
Nagano, Japan's hosting the 1998 Winter Games and Sydney,
Australia's bid to win the 2000 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 of the IOC's 114 delegates have been linked to various
bidding improprieties, both major and minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we defrauded the bid committee or anybody else
is preposterous,'' Welch said in his statement. ``So is the charge
that we bribed anybody. But that does not change the fact that we
will be photographed and booked like common criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, who is Johnson's attorney, called the charges ``ill
advised'' and said they may ``jeopardize the effective presentation
of the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both men seemed to rule out accepting any further plea offer
that might come from federal prosecutors. Current Salt Lake City
Olympic officials have expressed concern that the specter of a
trial will further cloud their efforts to prepare and continue to
raise sponsorship money for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said: ``We and our families must go through the agony of a
criminal trial on the eve of the Games because we did what we, and
many other people, thought was absolutely necessary and in keeping
with the ideals of the community. We will defend ourselves and we
will be acquitted, but no one can possibly understand the
heartbreak and disappointment I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   David Simmons, a Salt Lake City businessman, had pleaded guilty
to tax offenses related to an alleged sham telecommunications job
provided to Jung Hoon Kim, the son of a powerful IOC delegate from
South Korea named Kim Un-Yong. The son, known as John Kim, has been
indicted but has left the country and is considered a fugitive by
the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Alredo La Mont, formerly in charge of international relations
for the USOC, had also pleaded guilty to tax charges related to
payments he secretly received from the Salt Lake bid committee for
his effort as a consultant to help secure the 2002 Winter Games.

AMERICA ONLINE REGISTERS STRONG PROFIT FOR QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
  By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Signaling that the problems of many Internet start-ups are not
hurting their larger cousins, America Online on Thursday reported
fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $338 million, up 115 percent from
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the world's biggest Internet company and one of
the few profitable ones, earned 13 cents a share, 2 cents more than
analysts had expected. But analysts, generally conservative in
their predictions, said the results were solid but contained few
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't come in with any fireworks here, but they met
expectations,'' said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   For the company's fiscal year, ended June 30, it earned $1.2
billion on sales of $6.9 billion, marking the first time an
Internet company has earned more than $1 billion in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only four years ago after becoming the first Internet company
with $1 billion in annual revenue, we now post $1 billion in
profit,'' Steve Case, the chairman, boasted on a conference call
with investors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the well-publicized problems of many Internet companies,
most of which had been big advertisers on AOL's services, the
company's advertising and electronic commerce revenue increased by
95 percent to $609 million.
</P>
<P>
   Case played down any slowing in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of our advertising revenue comes from
companies like Coca-Cola, which have been around for a long time
and will be around forever,'' he said. ``The minority comes from
dot-com's, and of that, most come from well-funded companies.'' He
also noted that even the most troubled start-ups might well manage
to be taken over, as CDNow, an AOL client, was Thursday by
Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that now they will be able to pay their
bills,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Case added that he expected growth in advertising to remain
steady for the rest of the year and to pick up next year when the
company's acquisition of Time Warner Inc. was completed. He noted
that there was little overlap between the top advertisers at AOL
and Time Warner, creating the opportunity to sell more to existing
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Case dismissed statements by the Walt Disney Co. that it would
ask federal regulators to force the combined AOL and Time Warner to
spin off its cable systems or otherwise make sure that its content
was not given more favorable treatment on its distribution
networks. He said he agreed with statements by Gerald Levin, his
counterpart at Time Warner, calling Disney's move ``silly and
absurd.'' And he said he did not expect any problems completing the
acquisition by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed. ``There has long been an issue about the cable
assets,'' Noglows said. ``But I don't see that as a deal breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, America Online is continuing its unparalleled
growth. In the most recent quarter, subscription revenue increased
by 26 percent to $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though spring is historically the slowest season for new
customers, the flagship service added 992,000 new subscriptions in
the quarter for 23.2 million members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's CompuServe 2000 service, which is offered with rebates and
discounts to appeal to price-conscious customers, added 146,000
members in the quarter. After a loss of about 50,000 subscribers to
the company's older and more expensive CompuServe Classic service,
CompuServe's total membership worldwide membership rose to 2.8
million. Over the last year, CompuServe 2000 added 1.3 million new
subscriptions, but the classic service lost 500,000 subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The international versions of the AOL and CompuServe services
added a total of 200,000 subscribers in the quarter to reach 3.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said its expenses were up 25 percent to $1.5 billion for the
quarter. But it said that it benefited from sharp drops in the cost
of providing the telecommunications network, largely resulting from
regulatory changes.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting America Online's strong financial position, even in
contrast to the other large Internet companies, its cash position
increased by $1.9 billion over the last year to $3.9 billion at the
end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that its backlog of commitments to advertise in
the future increased by $300 million in the quarter, to $3 billion,
twice the level of a year ago. &QL;

MCCAIN RE-EMERGES, AS POSSIBLE BUSH RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct spelling of Kasich in 10th graf; makes `officials'
singular in 3rd graf.)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Months after John McCain adamantly closed the
door to accepting his party's vice presidential nomination, a
Republican close to the Arizona senator said Thursday that he would
take the No. 2 spot on the ticket if Gov. George W. Bush offered
it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's turnaround, which was described as reluctant, came as a
growing number of Republicans lobbied for him as the best possible
addition to the ticket. Some House Republicans, looking for help in
holding the House majority, were circulating a petition to Bush
saying he and the Arizona senator would make the best ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The senator signaled his willingness to be Bush's running mate
earlier this week in a telephone conversation with Pennsylvania
Gov. Tom Ridge, according to the Republican official close to
McCain. The official said that Ridge telephoned McCain on Tuesday
to say that he felt he himself was no longer in the running for the
No. 2 slot and to urge McCain to put his name into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's new willingness to take the job, several
advisers to Bush were skeptical that the governor would consider
him. Karen P. Hughes, the governor's spokeswoman, said simply,
``Governor Bush has said all along that he takes Senator McCain at
his word that he does not wish to be considered for the vice
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Reeves, Ridge's spokesman, said the governor spoke with
McCain by telephone this week. But he would not divulge the
contents of the conversation. He said their discussion was ``not an
unusual event _ they've known each other for 20 years.'' Reeves
described their talk as ``a private conservation between them''
that he could not discuss.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long been considered an unlikely choice for Bush
because of the premium that the Texas governor places on loyalty
and the sometimes strained relations between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The attention that focused on McCain today may have been nothing
more than the wishful thinking of his loyalists. It also reflected
the frenzy of speculation among political insiders about what Bush
will do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain was among a number of politicians whose phone
numbers were collected Thursday by aides to Richard B. Cheney, the
former defense secretary who is heading Bush's search team, so that
the Bush campaign can let them know in the coming days of the Texas
governor's final decision.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not the only one being promoted. Bill Powers, the
chairman of the New York Republican Party, announced at one point
in the day that ``good sources'' had indicated to him that Gov.
George Pataki of New York was on the short list. But Pataki's aides
said immediately that they did not have such information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ridge, other possible candidates include: Govs.
Frank Keating of Oklahoma and James Gilmore III of Virginia; Sens.
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of
Tennessee; and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio. Former Sen. John Danforth
of Missouri, who pulled himself out of the running more than a
month ago, is drawing renewed speculation as well.
</P>
<P>
   Keating on Thursday said he submitted information on his
finances and health to Cheney several weeks ago and has not heard
from him since. ``That's why I'm not holding my breath,'' he said.
But later, a Republican strategist close to Keating said that the
Oklahoma governor's office had also been asked to provide Cheney
with weekend phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans believe Cheney himself is a contender. Bush
himself was asked about Cheney several times Thursday and did not
answer.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden indications that McCain would agree to be vice
president if asked were part of a strange dance that has been going
on for months, and even Thursday the McCain camp was sending mixed
signals. A Republican who knows McCain well insisted that he still
hoped he would not actually be asked to become the No. 2. ``It's
not something he would prefer to happen,'' said a close associate.

   BRADLEY TO CAMPAIGN IN HOMETOWN
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey will campaign in his
hometown of Crystal City, Mo., on Saturday with Gov. Mel Carnahan,
a Democrat who is trying to unseat Sen. John Ashcroft, a one-term
Republican, in one of the year's hardest-fought congressional
races. The event will be part of a four-day, 22-stop train tour
across Missouri by Carnahan that is intended to recreate the 1948
whistle-stop tours around America by another Missourian, President
Harry S. Truman. Bradley will be campaigning for just the second
time since he dropped out of the Democratic presidential primaries
in March; last week, he endorsed Vice President Al Gore in
Wisconsin. Although Bradley lost the Missouri primary to Gore, he
remains wildly popular in Crystal City, where he kicked off his
campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   BUSH LEAD SLIPS IN OHIO
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush has lost some ground to Vice President Al
Gore in Ohio, considered a swing state in the fall election, a new
poll shows. The poll, released Thursday by the University of
Cincinnati's Institute for Policy Research, has Bush leading Gore
by four points in a two-candidate field, 49 percent to 45 percent,
and by six points, 47 percent to 41 percent, in a four-candidate
field that includes Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph
Nader of the Green Party. In April, a poll by the institute gave
Bush a nine-point lead over Gore in a two-candidate race and an
eight-point lead when Buchanan and Nader were included. In both
polls the third-party candidates had 4 percent or less. The new
poll, which surveyed 537 likely voters from July 5-13 and has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points,
also found that roughly a third of Bush and Gore supporters might
switch their vote to another candidate before Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON WOULD FIND TOUGH FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   He has never given any real indication that he might try it, but
President Clinton would face a hard fight if he ran for the Senate
in his native Arkansas after leaving the White House, a new poll
shows. The Mason-Dixon poll, commissioned by The Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, shows Clinton trailing Sen. Tim Hutchinson, a
Republican whose first term ends in 2002, 49 percent to 41 percent,
with 10 percent undecided. Clinton has laughed off but never denied
speculation that he might seek a Senate seat, as his wife, Hillary,
is doing in New York.The poll, conducted July 13-15 and covering
622 registered voters, has a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus four percentage points.

   Franklin Graham, the eldest son of the Rev. Billy Graham and

BUSH TV COMMERCIALS AIR IN 4 KEY STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Fla., Wash., Pa.)   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concentrating on four states that political strategists say
could tip the electoral balance this fall, the Gov. George W.
Bush's campaign on Thursday began running its first major
television commercials of the general election, a kind of sunny
prologue to the Republican convention that begins in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The three commercials, produced by the campaign's own
advertising agency, Maverick Media, went on the air in Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Florida and Washington state in what Ari Fleischer, a
campaign spokesman, described as a ``multimillion-dollar ad buy.''
Bush officials would not say how long the commercials would run, or
whether more states might be added.
</P>
<P>
   But the choice of television markets was an instant subject for
dissection by Gore campaign officials, who pointed to the inclusion
of Florida as a sign that some crucial states that might normally
be safely in the Republican column were viewed by the Bush campaign
as in need of some media triage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that documents the fact that Florida is really in
play,'' said Chris Lehane, the campaign press secretary of Vice
President Al Gore. ``Right now, it's a virtual dead heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Florida's 25 electoral votes went for the Clinton-Gore
ticket in 1996, over the past three decades the state voted more
typically for Republican presidential candidates. Republicans hold
the majority in the state's congressional delegation, and Florida
is the first former Confederate state to have a legislature under
Republican control.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Welch, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said
newspapers in the state had put the television advertising
investment by the Bush campaign and the Republican National
Committee at about $1 million. ``You don't spend a million dollars
in a safe state,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore would not say whether the campaign would respond
rapidly with commercials of its own. Up to now, spots featuring the
presumptive nominees have been run exclusively by the Democratic
and Republican national committees; the Democrats alone are
expected to have spent about $25 million by the time they open
their convention in Los Angeles next month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fleischer said that the 30-second spots were designed to
reinforce Bush's presidential qualities. ``The theme running
through the ads is leadership. Now is the time in American history
we can exercise bold leadership willing to unite America.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the commercials concede a point that Gore has made a
cornerstone of his campaign this summer, that the country is
enjoying an unparalleled era of prosperity. The Bush campaign
argues in the advertisements that the national economic upswing
should be the foundation for a shift to Republican leadership
committed to solving complicated problems like how to shore up
Social Security and raise standards in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, titled ``Hard Things,'' Bush looks into the camera
and says, ``This is a moment in history when we have a chance to
focus on tough problems. It's not always popular to say, `Our
children can't read, or Social Security needs improving, or we have
a budget surplus and a deficit of values.' But those are the right
things to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Another characterizes the election as a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity ``to do something good with it all.'' Echoing the
declared themes of the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia, it asks, ``Shouldn't the president unite, not divide,
and renew America's purpose?''
</P>
<P>
   The warmest and fuzziest of the spots features close-ups of a
newborn's foot and a montage of ordinary people in what the
commercial makers call ``found'' moments. Over footage shot earlier
this month in the New York area, a narrator declares, ``a lot of
new Americans arrived today. They were neither Republican nor
Democrat. But someone held them close and hoped. Be healthy. Learn
a lot. It takes leadership to give everyone a shot at the American
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   While political spots are sometimes tested with focus groups
before being put on the air, these were not, said a Bush adviser
who spoke on condition of anonymity. But in market surveys of
voters, the adviser said, ``consistently, for some reason, Bush
scores overwhelmingly higher than Gore on the question of strong
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, who made the commercials for Sen. John McCain
during the primaries, said the Bush campaign's selection of states
for the media buy was ``probably smart,'' in that ``if they can
block him in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, Gore can't
win.''

FIRST LADY ASSAILS LAZIO ON HOME LOAN VOTE
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Suggesting that her opponent cared more about wealthy
campaign donors than about constituents, Hillary Rodham Clinton
attacked Rep. Rick Lazio on Thursday for trying to kill legislation
in 1998 to expand a federal program that helps first-time home
buyers obtain mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton questioned why Lazio had objected to the legislation,
since it was intended to benefit people in more expensive areas,
including Lazio's district on Long Island, by raising the limit on
the size of mortgages guaranteed by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The program, run by the Federal Housing Administration, assists
first-time home buyers or those with shaky credit, who might
otherwise have difficulty in securing a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had vigorously fought the legislation, saying at the time
that it was an unacceptable intrusion by government into private
industry. The program provides competition for private mortgage
insurance companies, which charge fees to guarantee mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, one of the most influential Republicans on housing
issues, and a few other senior Republicans were able to scale back
the measure before it passed. Less than a month later, Lazio
collected a total of $23,500 in contributions from six of the
largest private mortgage insurance companies in the nation. The
Lazio campaign said recently that the donations were not related to
the fight over the loan limit.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Clinton maintained that Lazio had betrayed his
constituents by opposing a higher loan limit and said that she
would have championed the proposal. ``His opposition meant that if
he had prevailed, fewer people in Long Island and in the rest of
New York would have been able to afford a home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the donations to Lazio, which were reported in The
New York Times on Thursday, she said, ``We are going to have to let
New Yorkers reach their own conclusions about what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Flood, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign, disparaged
Clinton's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has done more for affordable housing in New York than
Rick Lazio as chairman of the subcommittee on housing,'' Flood
said. ``He authored and led the fight for a number of landmark
public housing and affordable housing bills. He has an outstanding
record. The real question is, where has Hillary Clinton been and
what has she done for homeownership in New York?''
</P>
<P>
   The jousting over Lazio's record came as both campaigns
continued to feud over the contents of fund-raising solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   A new letter signed by the chairman of the Republican State
Committee, William Powers, says Clinton is an ``ambitious,
ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman,'' and later
refers to her as an ``angry woman whose political views are so far
to the left, she has left common sense behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been at the front and center of every Clinton-Gore
scandal and this has been the most seedy, shameless and corrupt
administration in American history,'' says the letter, which was
first disclosed Thursday by The Associated Press. Powers also
refers to Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, noting that Clinton did not
send Chelsea to school in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second strongly worded letter from the state party
attacking Clinton to surface this month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has long stirred passionate feelings across the
country, has been a powerful lure in fund-raising letters, with
Republicans across the nation invoking her name in an effort to
generate money from people who dislike her. Before he withdrew from
the Senate race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, Lazio's
predecessor as Senate candidate, set a fund-raising record in part
by tapping into this sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Albany, Powers said the language in the
letter was not anti-woman and was an accurate portrayal of
Clinton's character. He said he was not concerned that the letter
would backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a response to direct mail like we're getting
from her,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, attacked the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Rick Lazio smiles for the cameras in public, his
Republican allies quietly send out insult-filled letters behind
closed doors,'' Wolfson said in a statement. ``It's time for the
hypocrisy to stop. These negative letters signal that Rick Lazio
and the GOP have no intention of running a campaign on the
issues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Giuliani withdrew from the Senate race in May, saying he
needed to concentrate on treatment of his prostate cancer, he
pledged to help Lazio. The Giuliani campaign now says it has
returned about $3 million to donors, with instructions to make it
easy for them to send the money to Lazio. It is not clear how many
have heeded the request.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce J. Teitelbaum, a senior political adviser to Giuliani,
said the campaign had $3.8 million left and added that Giuliani
advisers would be meeting with senior state Republicans in the
coming weeks to determine how Giuliani could use his political
operation to help Lazio and other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the campaign had already begun to use its list
of donors to assist local candidates. For example, the campaign has
culled the names of donors who live in Lazio's congressional
district and has given them to the Republican who is running to
succeed him, Joan Johnson, to aid her fund-raising.

ANOTHER GAME, ANOTHER INJURY: THIS TIME, METS LOSE ALFONZO
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The bases were loaded with two outs in the eighth
inning, and his team was trailing by three runs. Even so, Edgardo
Alfonzo knew he could not hit.
</P>
<P>
   When he came off the field after the bottom of the seventh,
Alfonzo, the New York Mets' All-Star second baseman, told manager
Bobby Valentine that he could not continue. Alfonzo has been
bothered all season by soreness in his right hip, and he had
crossed the threshold of tolerable pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you can play with pain, and you know when you
have to shut it down because you don't feel really good,'' Alfonzo
said. ``When you don't feel like you're 80 percent, it's a good
thing to come out of the game and give another guy the opportunity
to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the other guy was Mark Johnson, who struck out
against the Montreal Expos' Dustin Hermanson, ending the inning and
the Mets' best chance of the day. The Mets lost to the Expos, 4-1,
and they have split the first eight games on this road trip heading
into the opener of a three-game series in Atlanta on Friday against
a Braves team that is now five games ahead of them in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   After playing the last five games on unforgiving artificial
surfaces, Alfonzo aggravated the hip flexor on a single in the
fourth inning. He will receive treatment on the hip Friday, but
general manager Steve Phillips said he did not plan for Alfonzo to
visit a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo conceded that ``it's going to be a little tough'' to
play against the Braves on Friday, and Valentine said the soreness
would have to calm down considerably before he'd put Alfonzo in the
lineup. It stands to reason that the Mets, who have a rested
bullpen and are carrying 12 pitchers, will recall a position player
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They may do something more. Phillips watched the game from a
private box at Olympic Stadium, talking on the telephone most of
the time; yes, he said, he was speaking with other teams about
trades. The Mets may have a match with the Los Angeles Dodgers for
Darren Dreifort, a starting pitcher, or with the Cincinnati Reds
for shortstop Barry Larkin. Phillips is also trying to bolster the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could play their leading division rival with first
baseman Todd Zeile as their only regular infielder who is not out
with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Rey Ordonez is out for the season with a broken arm,
and his replacement, Melvin Mora, is 3 for 26 since the All-Star
Game break. Third baseman Robin Ventura, who is on the disabled
list with a bruised rotator cuff, is halfway into the two-week
period the Mets believe he will be sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be sitting around waiting for a knight in shining
armor in a trade to rescue your team,'' said catcher Mike Piazza.
``If we go out and get a guy that can help us out, great, but we've
got to win with the core of guys that we have here now.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the lesser-heralded Mets have contributed lately, the
Mets without Alfonzo and Ventura are far less intimidating. There
are fewer hitters to pitch around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the biggest contributors to us offensively,''
starter Mike Hampton, Thursday's losing pitcher, said of Alfonzo.
``Losing Robin is big enough, and having him out of your lineup
basically kills us. Besides Todd and Mike, those are the guys that,
if I was the opposing pitcher, those two guys ain't going to beat
me. I'd make the other guys beat me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to lose two of your best players. We need to do
something to get back to where we were and to get healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza pointed out that the Expos are not healthy, either, but
they overcame their injuries and won Thursday. Vladimir Guerrero,
the incomparable right fielder, was out with a strained right hip
flexor, and center fielder Rondell White was out with a strained
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Chris Widger's bat did most of the damage off Hampton.
Widger homered to lead off the sixth, breaking a 1-1 tie, then
stroked a two-run double off the left-field wall in the seventh. In
his career, Widger is 8 for 12 off Hampton, whose record fell to
9-7.
</P>
<P>
   To Valentine, Hampton has not been quite as sharp since beating
the Yankees while pitching on three days' rest on July 9. Hampton
will get an extra day of rest when the Mets are off on Monday.
``I'm sure that day will do him a world of good,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton did not dispute that, but he brushed off the suggestion
that the short rest _ or the muscle cramp in his forearm that
forced him from the Yankees game after seven shutout innings _ has
affected him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, maybe they're searching for answers because
we're losing games when I pitch,'' Hampton said. ``I'm fine. I
thought I had some of my best stuff of the year.''

EVERETT GIVEN A 10-GAME SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Everett, one half of the heart of the Boston Red Sox
offense, was suspended for 10 games and fined $5,000 Thursday for
his encounter _ physical and verbal _ with an umpire in a game with
the New York Mets last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Everett postponed the suspension, which was to have begun
Thursday, by appealing the disciplinary action by Frank Robinson,
major league baseball's vice president for on-field operations.
Everett then went out and hit a two-run home run in the first
inning of the first game of a day-night doubleheader in Baltimore.
He finished 1 for 5 and struck out four times in Boston's 11-7
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the suspension, Robinson said he acted because of
the outfielder's excessive arguing, foul language and contact with
Ron Kulpa, the home plate umpire, who had told Everett he was
standing too close to home plate when he batted against the Mets in
a 6-4 Boston triumph.
</P>
<P>
   During his tirade, Everett bumped Kulpa with his chest, then
angrily slammed his helmet to the ground and struck the umpire in
the face with his face, sending Kulpa staggering backward.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox personnel had difficulty controlling and calming the
enraged Everett, who, when he finally reached the dugout, knocked
over a water container and tossed a bat onto the field, just
missing a teammate, Bret Saberhagen, in the process.
</P>
<P>
   With a .320 batting average and a team-leading 26 home runs and
74 runs batted in before Thursday night's second game, Everett will
leave a hole in the Red Sox lineup when he serves his suspension,
whether it's 10 games or a reduced number. He and Nomar Garciaparra
form the nucleus of the team's offense, and the Red Sox can ill
afford to lose him in their quest for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Because Everett looked so out of control in his confrontation
with Kulpa, some people believed he would be hit with a longer
suspension. Robinson might have been inclined to make it longer,
but he wound up somewhat in the middle of the range of previous
suspensions for similar actions.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing on Everett's appeal, Players Association lawyers
will argue that both the length of the suspension and the fine are
excessive. Management lawyers will most likely use as Exhibit A the
case of Bill Madlock, who in a 1980 game shoved his glove into the
face of Umpire Jerry Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Madlock was fined $5,000 and suspended for 15 days. After his
appeals were denied, the Pittsburgh Pirates third baseman served
the suspension from June 6 through June 19, missing 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Coleman of St. Louis, on the other hand, was fined $500
and suspended for seven games in 1990 after he cut Ed Montague's
nose with the bill of his batting helmet.
</P>
<P>
   The longest suspension for physical contact with an umpire is
believed to belong to Pete Rose, who as manager of the Cincinnati
Reds in 1988 was given 30 days for pushing Dave Pallone. A.
Bartlett Giamatti, then N.L. president, imposed the severe penalty
because, he said, Rose's action incited Riverfront Stadium fans,
who threw objects onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Everett became incensed when Kulpa drew a line with his foot,
indicating the border of the batter's box at the side near home
plate. Everett stands closer to the plate than most batters, and
Kulpa felt he was closer than the six inches the rules stipulate
should separate the plate from the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Dennis Cook of the Mets was ejected from the
interleague game after he hit Everett with a pitch. Cook argued
that Everett was standing out of the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore Thursday, Everett said the news media coverage of
his incident with the umpire ``tried to make me out to be a
monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I didn't do the things people said I did,'' he
added. ``I could say some things that could ruffle some feathers,
but I'd rather keep that to myself until I state my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's contact with Kulpa's head has been described by some
as a headbutt, but Larry Reynolds, Everett's agent, said he looked
at a tape of the confrontation frame by frame and saw no such
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl's lips and nose touched the umpire,'' Reynolds said in a
telephone interview, ``but his forehead clearly never touched the
forehead of the umpire. There clearly was no headbutt.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone, Robinson declined to elaborate on his
decision, explaining that he will have to testify at the appeal
hearing before Paul Beeston, chief operating officer of Major
League Baseball. No date has been set for the hearing, but it most
likely won't be held until next month.

EXCERPTS FROM FED CHIEF'S REPORT TO SENATE PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (with GREENSPAN-ECON)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, presented
his semiannual report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking
Committee on Thursday. Following are excerpts: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, the growth of aggregate demand has exceeded
the expansion of production potential. Technological innovations
have boosted the growth rate of potential, but as I noted in my
testimony last February, the effects of this process also have
spurred aggregate demand. It has been clear to us that, with labor
markets already quite tight, a continuing disparity between the
growth of demand and potential supply would produce disruptive
imbalances.
</P>
<P>
   A key element in this disparity has been the very rapid growth
of consumption resulting from the effects on spending of the
remarkable rise in household wealth. However, the growth in
household spending has slowed noticeably this spring from the
unusually rapid pace observed late in 1999 and early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that this slowing is a pause following the surge in
demand through the warmer-than-normal winter months and hence a
reacceleration can be expected later this year. Certainly, we have
seen slowdowns in spending during this near-decade-long expansion
that have proven temporary, with aggregate demand growth
subsequently rebounding to an unsustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts point to a number of factors that may be
exerting more persistent restraint on spending. One they cite is
the flattening in equity prices, on net, this year. They attribute
much of the slowing of consumer spending to this diminution of the
wealth effect through the spring and early summer. This view looks
to equity markets as a key influence on the trend in consumer
spending over the rest of this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor said by some to account for the spending slowdown
is the rising debt burden of households. Interest and amortization
as a percent of disposable income have risen materially during the
past six years, as consumer and especially mortgage debt has
climbed and, more recently, as interest rates have moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the past year's rise in the price of oil has
amounted to an annual $75 billion levy by foreign producers on
domestic consumers of imported oil, the equivalent of a tax of
roughly 1 percent of disposable income. This burden is another
likely source of the slowed growth in real consumption outlays in
recent months, though one that may prove to be largely transitory.
</P>
<P>
   Mentioned less prominently have been the effects of the faster
increase in the stock of consumer durable assets _ both household
durable goods and houses _ in the last several years, a rate of
increase that history tells us is usually followed by a pause. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Because the softness in outlay growth is so recent, all of the
aforementioned hypotheses, of course, must be provisional. It is
certainly premature to make a definitive assessment of either the
recent trends in household spending or what they mean. But it is
clear that, for the time being at least, the increase in spending
on consumer goods and houses has come down several notches, albeit
from very high levels.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the more important question for the longer-term
economic outlook is the extent of any productivity slowdown that
might accompany a more subdued pace of production and consumer
spending, should it persist. . . .
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, if current personal consumption outlays slow
significantly further than the pattern now in train suggests,
profit and sales expectations might be scaled back, possibly
inducing some hesitancy in moving forward even with capital
projects that appear quite profitable over the longer run. In
addition, the direct negative effects of the sharp recent runup in
energy prices on profits as well as on sales expectations may
temporarily damp capital spending. . . .
</P>
<P>
   As I have already noted, to date costs have been held in check
by productivity gains. But at the same time, inflation has picked
up _ even the core measures that do not include energy prices
directly. Higher rates of core inflation may mostly reflect the
indirect effects of energy prices, but the Federal Reserve will
need to be alert to the risks that high levels of resource
utilization may put upward pressure on inflation. &QL;

STATE ENCOURAGES MORE SWIMMING IN A CLEANER HUDSON
</HEADLINE>
  By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ After years of cleaning up the garbage and
pollution that gave the Hudson River a bad name, New York State
officials are now trying to bring back public beaches and swimming
areas along its shores.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Environmental Conservation and the State
Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation have begun a
two-year study to develop state-operated public swimming beaches
along the Hudson from Manhattan to Columbia County, just south of
Albany. The $88,000 study is part of Gov. George Pataki's 1996
initiative, the Hudson River Estuary Action Plan, to protect the
river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water quality in the Hudson River has improved
dramatically, particularly in the last decade,'' said Jennifer
Post, a DEC spokeswoman. ``Obviously, it's a big river and there
are some areas where tides or other conditions may make it
inappropriate to swim, but we believe there are many locations
where swimming is safe and should be encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Although swimmers have dipped into the Hudson River for as long
as anyone can remember, extensive pollution from raw sewage and
chemical runoffs in earlier decades have made it a less than
attractive option for most people. ``Swimming in the Hudson is a
longstanding activity, but people used to have to clear a path
before they could get in the water,'' said Cara Lee, environmental
director for Scenic Hudson, a nonprofit group that monitors the
river.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials and environmentalists say water quality has
steadily improved as a result of pollution controls adopted by
government agencies since the 1972 Clean Water Act, which required
that sewage be treated before being released into the river. State
research shows that most of the river is now safe for swimming,
Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers now have access to the Hudson from a handful of public
parks operated by local governments, including Croton Point Park in
Westchester County and Kingston Point Park in Ulster County. Other
swimmers enter the river from private property or boats.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the state sent out 2,500 questionnaires to businesses,
environmental organizations, government agencies and randomly
selected residents to solicit suggestions for more public swimming
sites. More than half of the forms have been returned, naming 50
locations from Manhattan to Troy.
</P>
<P>
   State officials met Thursday night at Bear Mountain State Park
in Rockland County to discuss the swimming study with local
residents. Another meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday in Greene
County, and officials will continue to take written comments until
Aug. 4. No decision has been made on how many swimming sites would
be developed, or how they would be paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Several environmentalists said Thursday that they welcomed the
state's efforts. ``If people are swimming at a place, the
government has to make sure the water there is clean enough,'' said
Cathy Drew, director of the River Project, a marine biology
monitoring station in Manhattan. ``The very best thing we can do
for the river is to jump in.''

U.S. NUCLEAR AGENCY DELAYS REOPENING OF PLANT IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD with RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission Thursday said
that Con Edison was not ready to reopen the Indian Point 2 nuclear
reactor with its existing steam generators. The decision makes it
less likely that the plant will resume operations this summer and
more likely that consumers will see higher utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC, in a letter sent to plant managers Thursday, asked for
extensive further analysis of the steam generators, one of which
caused an accident that shut down the plant Feb. 15. The commission
staff said that the accuracy of the instrument for measuring flaws
in the tube walls had been determined by using a tube at another
reactor and that the tubes at Indian Point might differ.
</P>
<P>
   A Con Ed spokesman, Joseph P. Petta, said, ``Right now the
immediate focus is getting these answers to the NRC.'' But he said
the company might try to reduce the uncertainty by sealing off the
tubes most likely to leak, or that it might go ahead with replacing
the steam generators immediately, a step that would preclude
operation for months. ``We haven't ruled anything out,'' Petta
said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said Con Ed could have saved its customers money by
replacing the generators months or even years ago. Loss of the
plant for the rest of the summer would also increase the risk of
the region's running short of power during the season when heat
waves can challenge the system's ability to produce enough
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seemingly, this is the opportunity for Con Ed to go ahead and
do the right thing and replace the steam generators, and not put
the public at any greater risk than they have to be,'' said James
P. Riccio, a nuclear expert at the Critical Mass Energy Project, a
nonprofit group founded by Ralph Nader that had petitioned the
regulatory commission to keep the plant shut. ``If they had
replaced the steam generators in February, they would be making
money hand over fist right now. Instead, they're paying it out hand
over fist.''
</P>
<P>
   After the February accident, the company inspected the steam
generators and asked for permission to run the plant for up to 10
months. But it also said it planned to shut down and replace the
steam generators in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It now faces the prospect of buying replacement power through
the high-demand, high-cost weeks of late July through early
September, while it repairs the steam generators to the
satisfaction of the regulators or installs replacement generators
already at the plant site, in Buchanan, N.Y., on the east bank of
the Hudson River near Peekskill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Costs are higher this summer because oil and natural gas, the
substitutes, are up in price. And because New York state has
deregulated its utilities, power costs now vary much more sharply
according to the time of year. Con Ed has sold off nearly all of
its own generators, and is seeking to sell Indian Point.
</P>
<P>
   The steam generators are giant heat exchangers. Indian Point 2
heats water in the nuclear core and then pumps it into the steam
generators, into thousands of thin-walled metal tubes. Outside the
tubes, clean, nonradioactive water is pumped in and boiled into
steam, which is used to spin a turbine, which turns a generator
that makes electricity. In February, one of the tubes leaked water
from the core, which is contaminated with radioactive material,
into the clean, non-radioactive steam. Con Ed said the release of
radiation was too small to be measured, but the plant has been shut
for analysis and repairs ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Steam generators are designed with extra tubes so bad ones can
be plugged. But that, too, could take days or weeks; the company
may simply decide to go ahead and replace the generators.

BURLINGTON NORTHERN AND CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS CALL OFF
MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest rail merger in North American history was formally
scrapped Thursday amid complaints about regulatory interference.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. and the
Canadian National Railway voted to end an agreement to combine the
two companies into one transcontinental system running from
Halifax, Nova Scotia, to the Mexican border and up to the Alaskan
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the two railroads said that the decision by the
Surface Transportation Board to hold up all mergers for 15 months
while new guidelines are issued had made going ahead with the plan
too risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay and uncertainty caused by the STB's moratorium and
proposed rule-making made it impossible for us to continue with our
combination efforts,'' Paul Tellier, president of Canadian
National, said in a statement issued by both railroads.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium is to last until June. Merger applications
typically take more than a year to be considered by the federal
regulatory board, which would mean that the two railroads would be
prohibited from merging for more than two years, a period they say
is too long.
</P>
<P>
   Tellier and his counterpart at Burlington Northern, Robert
Krebs, said they would work to better coordinate the operations of
the two carriers as fully as possible without a formal merger. They
said no break-up fees would be assessed because both companies had
decided to end the merger plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shippers said they remained convinced they had not
seen the end of the consolidation that has left just a handful of
major freight railroads to serve the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the termination of the Burlington Northern-Canadian
National proposal, shippers said they believe the major railroads
remain intent on mergering until there are just two major rail
systems left in North America. There are five major railroads
operating in the United States and two in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The railroads have really showed their hands as far as what
they view the endgame being,'' said Diane Duff, executive director
of the Alliance for Rail Competition, which represents the coal and
chemical industries as well as other bulk shippers. ``Mergers seem
to be the only way they know how to `get efficiencies.'''
</P>
<P>
   Duff said American regulators now have a chance to ``make a sea
change in the way they've approached the rail industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Shippers have complained that the Surface Transportation Board
has favored the railroads and not always promoted real competition
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   The last few big rail mergers caused major service disruptions
that cost manufacturers and shippers millions of dollars in lost
business. Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific joined together in
1996, and last year the Norfolk Southern and the CSX each acquired
a portion of the Conrail system. Both deals resulted in bigger
railroads, but less competition, according to shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers reacted angrily when Canadian National and Burlington
Northern announced their planned combination in December, and by
March the regulators called a halt to all mergers until new rules
could be drawn up. The two railroads thought that the board had
overstepped its authority, but their legal challenge was overturned
last week by a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Surface Transportation Board said they have
already begun to receive comment from shippers and railroads on
what the new merger guidelines should look like.
</P>
<P>
   The issues to be covered include such basic ones as relieving
bottlenecks and providing access to terminal areas. A controversial
matter is expected to be the captive shippers, businesses on routes
served by only one rail line.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Speight, head of the distribution team at the American
Chemistry Council, an industry group, said the chemical producers
are particularly vulnerable to the lack of rail competition because
63 percent of the nation's chemical plants and warehouses are
already captive to a single railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something to make sure that future mergers
don't result in the same costly service problems that we
experienced in past mergers,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to shape the new merger regulations, the chemical
industry will be lobbying Congress intensively to foster
competition in the rail industry when the moratorium ends, Speight
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board is scheduled to issue proposed
new merger regulations in the first week of October. After a period
of public comment, final regulations are to come out in June when
the moratorium has ended.

WASTE FROM OLD MINES LEAVES PILES OF PROBLEMS

<P>
   PICHER, Okla. _ The problem is chat. Not the Internet variety or
the kind swapped over coffee at Rascal's Truck Stop on the highway
leading into this hardscrabble town of 1,800, but huge hills of
processed rock left after the lead and zinc mines closed in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The mounds of chat _ ground rock laced with lead and iron _ have
marked the skyline of Picher since miners began pulling minerals
from dozens of mine shafts here in 1891. When the mines played out
or were forced to close by cheaper foreign imports _ the last one
shut down in 1958 _ 175 million tons of chat was left behind,
creating a toxic moonscape encircling the town that federal
officials have been trying to clean up since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nearly a hundred chat piles near here, some of them
100 acres wide at the base and stretching 200 feet high,'' said
Philip Allen, the project manager for the Environmental Protection
Agency's Tar Creek Superfund Site remediation efforts here. ``It's
an enormous problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do the job right could cost hundreds of millions of dollars
and would probably take the rest of my career to finish,'' said
Allen, 42.
</P>
<P>
   Government efforts to do something about the chat piles began in
earnest after a 1993 study found that 34 percent of the children
tested in Picher had blood lead levels exceeding 10 micrograms per
deciliter _ considered by the Centers For Disease Control and
Prevention as the point at which there is a risk of brain or
nervous system damage.
</P>
<P>
   Some children in the area tested as high as 32 micrograms per
deciliter, said Dr. Bob Lynch, at the University of Oklahoma's
Health Sciences Center. ``If a kid is over 10, investigations get
launched. Anything over 40 requires medical intervention,'' Lynch
said.
</P>
<P>
   But now, threatened by financial shortages and an investigation
into accusations of price-gouging by one of the contractors
involved, the EPA is at least temporarily abandoning most of its
efforts here after spending $55 million over five years, $21
million of it to clean and replace the yards of 1,537 houses in
Picher.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Oklahoma Legislature refused to appropriate $2.75
million in matching funds required to continue the program,
although about 700 sites still remained to be cleaned up, Allen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of demobilizing right now, and I expect
to be out of here by next week,'' he said. A skeleton crew of three
people, compared with a staff of 300 employees at its peak, will
remain until officials decide whether to continue the cleanup
effort next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, agents of the FBI raided the project's offices after
some former employees contended that the engineering contractor,
Morrison Knudsen, had overcharged the government.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said those accusations probably had an influence on the
Oklahoma legislators' decision not to finance the next phase of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   A Morrison Knudsen spokesman Thursday denied any wrongdoing on
the project, but declined to discuss the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Griffin, Oklahoma's secretary of the environment, said
Picher is within a 40-square-mile area designated as the nation's
highest-priority Superfund cleanup site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the chat, we have 2,000 abandoned mine shafts
and more than 300 miles of flooded underground tunnels in the area,
creating an extremely dangerous water quality and public safety
hazard,'' Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gov. Frank Keating appointed Griffin to head a task
force to deal with issues raised by the abandoned mines, including
the health effects of mine tailings, water quality, mine shaft
plugging and potential uses for chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a great road-building material when mixed with
asphalt,'' Griffin said. He estimates there is enough chat near
Picher to build a four-lane highway two times around the globe, and
that all of that chat would be worth about $500 million if it could
be sold.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately, Griffin said, 80 percent of the chat is on
Indian land, and the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, which controls
ownership, has placed a moratorium on sale of the chat pending
further study of the health effects of using it in roads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the herculean efforts of the government to clean up
their yards, most of the people living in the ramshackle cottages
and mobile homes of Picher remain skeptical of the chat's health
hazards and seem merely amused by the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty good job, but it's a big waste of money,''
said Theron Duggan, 33, who was an excavation crew manager for the
EPA, even cleaning up his own yard in the shadow of a towering chat
pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played on those chat piles all my life, and I can't see
that it's affected me any,'' Duggan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being grateful for the government's efforts, many
local residents complain about the quality of the federal agency's
work.
</P>
<P>
   Vance Reeves, 30, says the agency's workers killed four walnut
trees in his yard and dumped dirt on his porch.
</P>
<P>
   Steven McBride said the workers accidentally paved over part of
his yard while cleaning a parking lot next door. ``They done more
harm than betterment,'' McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Smith, 75, said that since the agency ``remediated'' her
property, water has collected in her yard after it rains, making it
hard to garden and drawing so many mosquitoes that she could not go
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got too many workers that like to lean on their hoe
handles instead of doing things right,'' she said.

 NO WEST NILE VIRUS IN SOUTH CAROLINIAN'S DEATH IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 71-year-old man who died in Staten Island on
Wednesday was not infected with the West Nile virus, city officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, a visitor from South Carolina whose name has not been
released, was admitted to St. Vincent's Medical Center in Staten
Island on July 5 complaining of headache, fever and confusion _
symptoms sometimes associated with encephalitis, which can be
caused by West Nile. He died early Wednesday at the medical center.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue and blood samples from the man, who was found to have
encephalitis, were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, as well as city laboratories, to be tested
for West Nile, largely because crows infected with the virus were
found on Staten Island this month. Although health officials said
they did not yet know why the man died, they said he could have
been sickened by any of several other viruses that cause
encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors around the city have been advised to send blood samples
of patients who have West Nile-like symptoms to the city for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, West Nile virus sickened 62 people in the New York
region, killing 7. There have been no confirmed cases in humans
this year, but the discovery of the virus in mosquitoes and dead
birds again this year has prompted some municipalities to begin
spraying pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   The city sprayed two areas of Staten Island on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, north of New York City, officials planned
to spray four communities on Thursday night, beginning at 11:30:
North Castle, New Castle, Mount Pleasant and Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   The following 10 Westchester communities will be sprayed
starting midnight on Friday: New Rochelle, Eastchester, Tuckahoe,
Bronxville, part of Mamaroneck, Scarsdale, Mount Kisco, Pound
Ridge, Lewisboro and Bedford.

EDITORIAL: OVERTIME AT CAMP DAVID 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 21:
</P>
<P>
   No one knows at this point whether the Camp David meetings will
eventually bring a Mideast peace agreement. This is the first time
Israeli and Palestinian leaders have tackled the most difficult
issues, like sovereignty over Jerusalem. But the fact that Israel's
prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, decided to stay on after President Clinton's departure for
Okinawa on Thursday morning is encouraging. Neither man wants to
walk away from the chance of ending a half-century of destructive
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although a news blackout veils many details, the sharpest
divisions appear to be over Jerusalem. Barak, like all Israeli
leaders since 1967, has insisted that the city remain united and
under Israeli sovereignty. He is reportedly open to letting
Jerusalem's 200,000 Palestinians run their own civil affairs and
letting a Jerusalem suburb serve as a Palestinian capital. But
Arafat resists accepting permanent Israeli sovereignty over East
Jerusalem, something no Arab leader has been willing to concede. He
has left himself little room for flexibility by failing to prepare
Palestinians for any sort of compromise on the city. East
Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, is
home to some of the holiest sites of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Deals are under discussion on all other issues, including
borders, the future of Jewish settlements and the return of
Palestinian refugees. But the Jerusalem impasse has blocked a
comprehensive accord, and neither leader wants to go home with a
partial agreement, leaving Jerusalem to resolve later. That would
oblige them to sell difficult compromises on other issues without a
final peace.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these obstacles, President Clinton has worked hard to
keep the talks going, persuading Barak and Arafat to stay after
both had written him letters saying they saw little hope of further
progress. Meetings are now scheduled to continue at least until
Clinton's return Sunday night. While he is away, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will lead U.S. efforts to help the two sides
bridge their remaining differences.
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy way to reconcile the Israeli and Palestinian
positions on Jerusalem. But if Barak and Arafat believed that
Jerusalem was an insoluble problem, they would not have come to
Camp David. With enough creativity and courage, some way can still
be found to give each side enough to permit a comprehensive deal.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians feel passionately about Jerusalem, a
city that carries powerful religious and national symbolism. But
most people on both sides also yearn for peace. Barak and Arafat
still have time to work out a formula for Jerusalem and conclude
the historic peace agreement that is now within their reach.

CLINTON ON OKINAWA FOR G-8 MEETING, ASSERTS U.S. REDUCING ITS
`FOOTPRINT' 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITOMAN CITY, Japan, _ President Clinton jumped from one delicate
matter to another Friday, after he arrived on the island of Okinawa
for an economic meeting of world leaders and immediately tried to
pacify residents fed up with the American military presence on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to do what we can to reduce our footprint on
this island,'' Clinton said on Thursday morning at a seaside
memorial devoted to the more than 200,000 Japanese, Americans and
others who died in 1945 during the the Battle of Okinawa. ``We take
seriously our responsibility to be good neighbors, and it is
unacceptable to the United States when we do not meet the
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Before flying here, Clinton left the Middle East peace talks
unfinished and aides signaled on his arrival that he was eager to
return to Camp David. They said he might scale back his three-day
trip here for the annual meeting of the Group of 8.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to reassure the Japanese, who have poured money
and attention into the meeting, that it was an important gathering
that merited his 14-hour trip. Clinton is to join the leaders of
Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Russia for a
series of closed-door meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was the first for an American president to this
sliver of land since the United States returned Okinawa to Japan in
1972. Clinton arrived during a particular rocky time in relations
between Okinawans and the approximately 26,000 American troops
stationed on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawans, who lived under U.S. occupation for 27 years, have
long complained that that they suffer from the military presence.
There are 37 U.S. military facilities in Okinawa, representing all
the services and taking up tens of thousands of acres. Recent
incidents involving wayward soldiers have added to local fury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed out that the United States has begun
consolidating bases on Okinawa, a process that residents complain
has been far too slow. The president also emphasized the role
Okinawa has played in ensuring stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the people of Okinawa did not ask to play this
role, hosting more than 50 percent of American forces in Japan on
less than 1 percent of its land mass,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the meeting, the U.S. military banned its
personnel from drinking alcohol or leaving their bases after
midnight, a curfew that followed a hit-and-run accident involving a
staff sergeant stationed at the Kadena Air Base.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the highest-ranking U.S. military official in
Okinawa issued an apology after a marine was arrested on charges of
entering a house and molesting a 14-year-old girl who was sleeping
there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was reminiscent of an earlier stop by another
American president almost four decades ago. While the island was
still under U.S. control, President Dwight D. Eisenhower stopped
briefly in Okinawa on June 19, 1960, during a tour of Asia and
faced the same anger displayed for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Huge crowds of residents turned out to see Eisenhower, and 1,500
of them began a snake dance to protest the presence of American
troops and the failure to return the island to Japanese control.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower ignored the demonstrations in his remarks, calling
the American presence a ``splendid example of the mutual benefits
that result when people of good will work toward the common goal of
peace and friendship in freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke Friday morning from Cornerstone of Peace Park, a
memorial to the soldiers and civilians of Japanese, American and
Okinawan ancestry who died here.
</P>
<P>
   Carved into a granite wall on a seaside bluff, which Clinton
toured with the governor of Okinawa, Keichi Inamine, were the names
of 234,183 victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Battle of Okinawa was warfare at its most tragic,''
Clinton said. ``This monument built in its memory is humanity at
its most inspired. For here, no grief goes unrecognized. While most
monuments remember only those who have fallen from one side, this
memorial recognizes those from all sides, and those who took no
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke a few words of Japanese, quoting Sho Tai, an
ancient king from Okinawa who said, ``the time for war is ending,
and the time for peace is not far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he is to leave on Sunday afternoon, Clinton will also
address American troops at the Camp Foster Marine Base. Commanders
have selected 25 outstanding military personnel to appear with the
president and make the point that the Americans are here to
prevent, not cause, turmoil in the region.

HOMELESS MAN HELD IN JULY 9 CONCRETE ATTACK ON YOUNG WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After an intensive 10-day search, a homeless man was
charged Thursday with using a chunk of concrete to fracture a young
woman's skull during a daytime attack in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Bently Louis Grant, 35, was charged with second-degree
attempted murder, first-degree assault and criminal possession of a
weapon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant confessed after being picked up on Wednesday night by
three plainclothes officers who spotted him in the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn, said Police Commissioner Howard Safir at a
news conference at the 13th Precinct station house Thursday. Safir
said police had been looking for Grant, because a witness
identified him as the attacker in a photo line-up.
</P>
<P>
   A police official said that Grant did not give any motivation
for his actions in his confession.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Grant concludes a manhunt that began on July 9,
when Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, was struck in the back of the head
with a chunk of concrete. The attack took place minutes after noon
on East 29th Street between Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue South,
shortly after Goldberg left the Marble Collegiate Reformed Church,
where she sings in the choir.
</P>
<P>
   She bled heavily from her skull and was taken to Bellevue
Hospital Center. She also suffered two chipped teeth and
lacerations when she fell face-first to the sidewalk. But Goldberg,
walked out the next day in high spirits, after saying that her
attacker was probably a ``struggling kid'' when he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   The attack quickly captured the public's attention, partly
because it echoed an assault in midtown last fall in which another
woman, Nicole Barrett, was smashed in her skull by a man wielding a
paving stone. Paris Drake, a street vendor, was arrested in that
case and charged with attempted murder. In both cases, the same
image of urban vulnerability resonated with the public and the news
media _ a college-educated woman attacked in broad daylight by a
man who roamed the streets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither woman was robbed, but police said witnesses saw Grant
reaching for Goldberg's handbag before swinging the concrete chunk.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack on Goldberg, police talked to witnesses and
circulated sketches of a man who resembled Grant. Two police
officers who were canvassing homeless people in the Murray Hill
section of Manhattan first came across Grant around noon on July
13, Safir said. They brought him into the 13th Precinct, questioned
him, took a Polaroid photograph and let him go because they did not
have any evidence to indicate he was the attacker.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward, a witness identified Grant from a photo
line-up. Copies of the photograph were given to officers throughout
the city. In the Polaroid, Grant wears a stained white T-shirt and
stares to the left of the camera with a haunted, faraway look.
</P>
<P>
   Three plainclothes officers were patrolling Park Slope in an
unmarked car on Wednesday evening when they saw Grant. He was
standing on the busy commercial strip of Seventh Avenue, at Carroll
Street, said Sgt. James Dodd, one of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said he walked up to Grant and said, ``Hey Bently, how are
you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   The officer said Grant responded, ``How do you know me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know you from last year,'' Dodd said. ``What's your
last name?''
</P>
<P>
   When Grant told the officers his surname, they escorted him into
the car.
</P>
<P>
   A police official at the 13th Precinct said the questioning and
eventual confession ``took a lot of hours.'' A witness identified
Grant from a line-up, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant has no permanent address but frequented the Murray Hill
and Park Slope neighborhoods, said Chief Thomas Fahey, a police
spokesman. He said that a few homeless men had been brought in by
police and questioned during the 10-day search.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they did not know whether Grant had a history of
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Computerized records at the Department of Homeless Services show
that Grant spent the night of Feb. 1 in the Bellevue Men's Shelter
on First Avenue near East 30th Street, but left the next day. He
was one of more than 5,400 men in the city's shelter system that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys have this kind of lodging record,'' said Patrick
Markee, director of policy for the Coalition for the Homeless.
``One night in the winter or a handful of nights when it's cold,
but no regular contact with the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that 50 detectives worked on tracking down Goldberg's
assailant. The police offered a $10,000 reward for information in
the case. Although dozens of people are assaulted, robbed and shot
each week in New York, the police rarely expend the same amount of
manpower on tracking down those assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a high-profile case,'' Safir said about the use of
resources. ``It was a case that the public was concerned about.''

ALLEN PAULSON, 78, OWNER OF THE RACE HORSE CIGAR, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allen Paulson, who set speed records as a pilot and airline
executive but became world famous as the owner of the renowned race
horse Cigar, died Wednesday night at Scripps Hospital in La Jolla,
Calif. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson had achieved a major career as a test pilot and airline
pilot and head of the Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. before he became
one of the country's leading owners and breeders of race horses. He
piloted Gulfstream IV aircraft, which were made by the company he
owned, and set 24 world speed records. He later named many of his
race horses for aeronautical checkpoints he had used along the way.
</P>
<P>
   He started his second career, with horses, in the 1970s when he
owned claiming horses, usually the cheapest runners available. But
he did not become seriously involved until 1982. After that, horses
became his passion. He bred 85 stakes winners and raced more than
100 stakes winners and seven champions, but none made such a
lasting record or had such a lasting appeal as Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The great bay, named for an aviation checkpoint in the Gulf of
Mexico, did not prove especially spectacular early in his career,
and in fact did not even run in the Kentucky Derby or the other
Triple Crown races. But after he was turned over to the trainer
Bill Mott, he rocketed into the record books in 1995 and 1996,
earning more prize money than any other race horse in history.
</P>
<P>
   The critical move came when Mott decided to switch Cigar from
grass racing to dirt racing, after Cigar had won only two of his
first 13 races. He was 4 years old in 1995 when Mott tried him on
dirt, and the horse promptly made history.
</P>
<P>
   He won 16 races in a row, tying the record set from 1948 to 1950
by Calumet Farm's champion Citation, and thrilling audiences from
Belmont Park in New York to Arlington Park in Chicago to Del Mar in
California. Huge crowds followed him as he approached the record
wearing Paulson's red, white and blue colors with the distinguished
jockey Jerry Bailey on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran him in as many places as we could,'' Paulson said.``And
the public followed every move he made. We like to think that he
made racing exciting to a new generation of fans. He was America's
best.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning streak ended in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar on
Aug. 10, 1996, when Cigar was 6 years old. But it took a two-horse
team trained by Richard Mandella to run him down. Siphon set fast
fractions for the first mile, keeping Cigar at his heels. Then,
after Cigar collared him in the homestretch, the fast-closing Dare
and Go kicked in with his deciding rally and defeated the tiring
Cigar by three lengths.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired from racing with earnings of $9.9 million,
Cigar was sold by Paulson to Coolmore Stud for $25 million. But in
one of the strange oddities of racing life, Cigar turned out to be
unproductive as a stallion, despite his stellar record as a race
horse.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson and his wife Madeline became familiar, stylish figures
in the winner's circle of tracks around the country as they raced
Cigar and the other champions from their strong stable. The cast
was headed by Cigar, who was voted Horse of the Year in 1995 and
1996, and included Estrapada, the female turf champion of 1986;
Theatrical, the male turf champion of 1987; Arazi, the juvenile
champion colt of North America and Europe in 1991; Eliza, the
champion 2-year-old filly of 1992; Ajina, the 3-year-old filly
champion of 1997, and Escena, the best older filly or mare of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Paulson stable produced 32 Breeders' Cup runners and eight
winners, both records, and he also won 15 Eclipse Awards for racing
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson once was asked about Cigar's ownership: Didn't the horse
actually belong to his wife, as earlier listings showed? ``I traded
Eliza to her to get him,'' he replied with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   The Paulsons stabled their champions at their Brookside Farm
near Versailles, Ky., with divisions of the farm in Florida and
California. But they sold their Kentucky property earlier this year
as Paulson's illness grew more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Paulson is survived by three sons, Richard,
James and Michael, and a brother.

HUFFINS' TOP CHALLENGER IN THE DECATHLON TRIALS IS HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ind., Cal.)  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ When he learned that Dan O'Brien had
withdrawn from the Olympic trials decathlon with a foot injury,
Chris Huffins thought someone was joking. O'Brien is the current
Olympic champion and the former world record-holder, the one
decathlete Huffins had never defeated. O'Brien has served as sort
of a mirror in which Huffins has measured his own reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe it,'' said Huffins, a native of Brooklyn who
will be an assistant track coach at Georgia Tech this fall. ``It's
like reading a book and you have the ending predicted and it's
really stupid and you think, `It's not supposed to end like
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was the year when Huffins, a two-time national champion,
figured he would finally defeat O'Brien, at the Olympic trials no
less. Huffins won a bronze medal at the 1999 world championships
and is expected to challenge for a medal in September at the 2000
Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. But O'Brien is gone from the
trials and Huffins' main competitor now is himself, not any
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The decathlon began Thursday night with Huffins' two strongest
events, the 100 meters and the long jump. Huffins holds the world
record for the decathlon 100, 10.22 seconds, set at the 1996
Olympic trials. His personal best in the long jump, 26 feet 5}
inches, is less than 2 inches shorter than the third-place finisher
leaped Monday night in the open long-jump final.
</P>
<P>
   Huffins held first place after three events Thursday night,
winning the 100 in 10.45 and the long jump at 25-10, and throwing
the shot put 47-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do my absolute best, I believe I will win,'' the
30-year-old Huffins said of the Olympic decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   However, his personal best of 8,694 points lags well behind the
world record of 8,994 points set by Tomas Dvorak of the Czech
Republic, who is the overwhelming Olympic favorite. Huffins'
weakness is related to his strength _ running. While he has a
sprinter's searing speed at 100 meters, and his personal best at
the nondecathlon event of 200 meters is 20.78 seconds, Huffins has
run 400 meters no faster than 48.05 and the 1,500 meters in 4
minutes 51.20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   This time in the metric mile is 17 seconds slower than O'Brien's
personal best and appears to have become a sort of psychological
hurdle for Huffins. He did not finish the decathlon at the 1997
world track championships in Athens or at an important meet in
Gotzis, Austria, earlier this year, skipping the 1,500 both times.
If Huffins is to challenge for a gold medal in Sydney, O'Brien
said, he must learn to convert his sprinter's speed to the longer
running events and to specific technical events such as the pole
vault, where his best is an ordinary 16-}, a foot shorter than
O'Brien's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just knowing that he can compete at that level and going
after the 400,'' O'Brien said of Huffins. ``He can run 21 flat in
the 200 and 48 in the quarter. That has never made sense to me. And
his pole-vault run is not what his long-jump run is. It should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Huffins said he has paid more attention to running
during training. He believes he is better prepared to deal with the
final exhausting meters of the 400, where, according to the world
record-holder Michael Johnson, ``your body is totally fatigued and
wants to flop all over the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffins said: ``All the components are there. In the quarter
mile, it's learning how to deal with the demons in the last
portion.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn,
Huffins never expected to become a decathlete. When he was 11, he
moved to Indianapolis to join his mother, Sandra Gay, who had
studied drama and education at Fordham University, and who wanted
her son to concentrate on his schoolwork, not athletics. Limited to
one sport, Huffins chose basketball over track and field.
</P>
<P>
   His mother later relented during her son's career at Cathedral
High in Indianapolis, and Huffins leaped 23-6{ in the long jump,
reached the state semifinals at 100 meters and earned a scholarship
to California-Berkeley, where he received a degree in the political
economies of industrial society.
</P>
<P>
   He first became intrigued by the decathlon in 1991, during a
redshirt season at Cal. Depending on what story is to be believed,
Huffins either bragged to coach Ed Miller, ``I can do that,'' or
took Miller's suggestion that training for a decathlon would aid
his sprinting, long jumping and triple jumping. ``That was a great
big farce, but I was young and dumb and it worked,'' Huffins said.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 7,531 points in his first decathlon, thought he was
awful but persisted after Miller encouraged him. His second
decathlon qualified him for the 1992 Olympic trials and his third
decathlon came at those infamous trials in New Orleans, where
O'Brien failed to clear a height in the pole vault. Unaware that
O'Brien was an Olympic favorite, Huffins said he made a friendly
bet with O'Brien that he could beat him in the long jump. He was
standing on a parallel runway when O'Brien missed on his third
attempt to clear a height in the pole vault, failing to qualify for
the Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea of that whole zoo of things going on around
me,'' Huffins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember telling myself, `I'm not going to do that''' _
fail to clear a height.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a successful pole vault, Huffins finished 15th at the
1992 trials, four places behind O'Brien. At the 1996 trials,
Huffins finished third. A month later, he took 10th at the Atlanta
Games, while O'Brien took the gold medal. Huffins later won two
national titles, but O'Brien did not compete because of injury. The
2000 Olympic trials would finally signal the changing of the
decathlon guard, Huffins believed. Then O'Brien withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was building to a crescendo and now it doesn't
happen,'' Huffins said. But, he added, the outcome will not be
altered, even if the competition has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the victor is going to be any different than it
would have been in the first place,'' Huffins said.

EDITORIAL: JUSTICE DENIED IN SENEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 21:
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago the Pinochet precedent spread to Africa when
Senegal decided to try the former dictator of Chad, Hissene Habre,
on charges of torture. It was the first time an African country had
brought human rights charges against another nation's head of
state, and it energized democracy activists _ and terrified other
former tyrants _ across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   But Senegalese courts have now dropped the charges after what
looks suspiciously like interference from the country's new
president. Chad's torture victims have appealed. Their plea should
be heard by a court independent of executive branch pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Habre ruled Chad for eight years with the backing of France and
the United States, which supported him as a counter to the Libyan
leader, Moammar Ghadafy. Habre's regime killed thousands of people,
and hundreds of thousands may have been tortured. He was overthrown
in 1990. Since then he has lived in Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   His comfortable exile was disturbed when he was arrested in
February, after a group of torture victims came to Senegal to
testify. Judge Demba Kandji's indictment was based on Senegal's
ratification of the Torture Convention, which obliges states to
prosecute or extradite alleged torturers no matter where the crimes
took place.
</P>
<P>
   In March, however, Abdoulaye Wade was elected president of
Senegal. Wade appointed Habre's attorney, Madicke Niang, as a
special adviser. President Wade also headed a panel that removed
Kandji from the case. The president of the Indicting Chamber, the
body that released Habre, was promoted while his chamber was
deliberating the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber's decision that Senegal had no jurisdiction to
prosecute torture abroad is particularly disappointing because
Senegal enjoys one of Africa's most independent judiciaries. It was
the first nation to ratify the International Criminal Court, and
its lawyers hold prominent positions in judicial and human rights
organizations worldwide. If it tried Habre, Senegal could make a
signal contribution to human rights on a continent that has
suffered more than any other from murderous leaders and the absence
of the rule of law.  &QL;

RACING WILL MISS ALLEN PAULSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Allen Paulson, the great thoroughbred
breeder and owner who died of cancer Wednesday night in La Jolla,
Calif., won major horse races all over the world and flew his
Gulfstream airplanes to round-the-globe records.
</P>
<P>
   To feel racing's loss, though, you needn't go any farther than
Hollywood Park. It was here that Paulson displayed the adventurous
spirit that distinguished him.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1995, Cigar had won eight races in a row, a streak that
had taken him to five tracks in as many Eastern states, and trainer
Bill Mott was understandably reluctant to ship the emerging
superstar to the Hollywood Gold Cup to take on the best of the
West. But Paulson rarely thought small. He wanted the Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar came to Hollywood Park and won the $1 million race by 3
lengths, with million-dollar race winners Tinners Way, Best Pal and
Concern giving chase. Cigar's winning streak would grow to a
record-tying 16, including a victory in the far-away Dubai World
Cup, before ending at Del Mar on his next California excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar became a modern racing legend _ and earned nearly $10
million _ for three reasons: his own physical gifts, Mott's
training skill and Paulson's ambition, not always in that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge for him to go ahead and do that,'' said Martin
Panza, the Hollywood Park racing secretary then and now, referring
to the decision to run Cigar here. ``At the time, everyone (who ran
a track) wanted that horse. It wasn't an easy sale to get him to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Paulson) was pretty game about running him. In today's
racing climate a lot of owners wouldn't have done it. But there was
more `sportsman' in him. It said a lot about Mr. Paulson, being a
sportsman and saying, `I want people around the country to see this
horse.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Hollywood Park began its racing card with a moment of
silence for Paulson, who had once been a member of the track's
board of directors as well as a leading owner.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, who was 78 years old when he died at Scripps Hospital,
probably showed more good horses to more racing fans than any other
owner in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife Madeleine won Eclipse Awards with eight horses,
including Cigar's 1995 and 1996 Horse of the Year titles and
Arazi's 1991 2-year-old championship.
</P>
<P>
   He and Madeleine won Breeders' Cup races with a record eight
horses and started a record 33.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson himself was honored as the outstanding owner of 1995 and
1996 and outstanding breeder of 1993, and led the nation's owners
in purses each year from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His major victories in California _ where he had homes in Los
Angeles, Rancho Santa Fe and Palm Springs _ included two Hollywood
Gold Cups (the first won by Blushing John in 1989), a Santa Anita
Handicap (Stuka, 1994), a Santa Anita Derby (Dinard, 1991), a Strub
Stakes (Diazo, 1994), a Hollywood Oaks (Fowda, 1991), a Vanity
Handicap (Escena, 1998) and a Ramona Handicap (Escena, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Many of those horses were named for aviation checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Until his battle with cancer took him away from the racetrack
and led to the sales of his breeding farms in Kentucky and Florida,
Paulson was a familiar, affable presence. He enjoyed boasting about
his latest winners, especially when they were the offspring of his
past winners, which was often the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes his confidence was off-target, such as when he chided
newspaper handicappers for failing to pick Stuka to win the 1994
Big 'Cap, neglecting the fact Stuka finished second in the race
only to be declared the winner after The Wicked North was
disqualified for interfering with a third horse.
</P>
<P>
   Moments like that aside, Paulson had a keen mind, and it made
him a giant in the aerospace industry. Airplanes had been a boyhood
fascination for Allen Eugene Paulson, born April 22, 1922 as the
youngest of five boys in a Clinton, Iowa, farm family.
</P>
<P>
   In a 30-cents-an-hour job as a Trans World Airlines mechanic, he
readied planes for Howard Hughes. After stints in college and the
Army Air Corps, he became a flight engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Then living in Burbank, he tinkered with aircraft parts in his
spare time, and in 1952 formed a company to design and build
planes. Twenty-five years later he formed Gulfstream Aerospace
Corporation and became the manufacturer of prestigious private
jets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 and 1988, when he was 65, Paulson and a crew flew
Gulfstream IVs on two round-the-world trips that established 35
international records. He was named Pilot of the Year by
Professional Pilot Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to get ahead is to put more effort into things
than the other fellows did,'' Paulson said once. ``I found it hard
to pass on opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing is thankful he rarely did.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson is survived by his wife, sons Richard, Jim and Mike, and
daughter Dominique. Plans were pending for a private funeral and a
memorial service in Rancho Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   THE WEEKEND: Sunday, the second to last day of the Hollywood
Park season, features the Swaps Stakes and two other stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Swaps, which has attracted Triple Crown runners in some
years, has only one Grade I winner this time, 1999 Hollywood
Futurity champion Captain Steve. The ``now'' horse might be Tiznow,
the popular Budroyale's full brother, who won the Affirmed Handicap
at 10-1 last time out.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Squirtle Squirt, ridden by Laffit Pincay, can match
Riboletta and Full Moon Madness with a third stakes victory at the
meet by winning the Hollywood Juvenile Championship. His 2-year-old
opponents include Drumcliff, a D. Wayne Lukas-trained colt who
broke his maiden at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Some human races, too, will be decided between now and Monday.
Bob Baffert, seeking his second Hollywood Park training title, and
Clifford Sise, seeking his first, were tied with 21 victories and
Bobby Frankel had 19 after each went winless Thursday. Jockey
Victor Espinoza has a comfortable 57-48 lead over Corey Nakatani.
</P>
<P>
   It might take more than a training title to get Baffert even for
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the California Horse Racing Board issued a complaint
against the three-time Eclipse Award-winning trainer after a split
urine sample confirmed the presence of morphine in the John and
Betty Mabee-owned Nautical Look when the filly won a May 3 race at
Hollywood Park. The case is to be heard by stewards at Del Mar
during the 43-day meet that opens Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Baffert and owner Mike Pegram were hit with a lawsuit
by breeder George Hofmeister, who charged them with fraud for their
handling of Real Quiet before the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner went to stud this year.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert told the Daily Racing Form the morphine accusation was
the result of ``accidental contamination,'' and the lawsuit ``has
absolutely no merit.'' &QL;

UNITED AIR CRITICIZES MECHANICS FOR DELAYS IN MAINTENANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Airlines, already reeling from the refusal of many of its
10,000 pilots to work overtime, is now facing similar difficulties
from its 15,000 mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ron Utecht, United's senior vice president for
maintenance, circulated a letter to mechanics complaining that
flight cancellations and delays related to maintenance had more
than doubled since July 12, the day the airline's contract with the
International Association of Machinists expired.
</P>
<P>
   Utecht added that the number of United airplanes out of service
had also doubled, while the number of mechanics willing to work
overtime had plunged. He threatened to order mandatory overtime if
the airline's maintenance operations did not improve.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several mechanics were issued form letters
informing them that they were engaged in an ``illegal job action''
and could be dismissed if they did not stop.
</P>
<P>
   A United spokesman declined to say how many of its 2,400 daily
flights were affected by the mechanics' actions, but he said that
the impact had been relatively minor.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Ford, president of the local representing the mechanics,
called Utecht's letter counterproductive. The IAM ``has not
authorized nor encouraged any job action at United Airlines,'' he
said in a statement. ``Threats and counterthreats will not help
United, our members, or the traveling public,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, United has canceled more flights and reported
the worst on-time performance of any major carrier, according to
government statistics. The airline blames unusually bad weather and
the air traffic control system for most of its difficulties. But it
also says that it was caught by surprise when many of its pilots
stopped flying overtime after their contract expired April 12. The
pilots' union also says that it is not engaged in any job action.
</P>
<P>
   United has since cut its summer flying schedule by 4,800
flights, or about 2 percent, to compensate for the crew shortages
and has taken several other initiatives, like adding more time to
its schedules, to try to improve its on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reliability is obviously a core objective for us, and we are
determined to get it back to the levels our customers expect,''
Rono J. Dutta, United's president, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the expiration of the contract with the machinists
approached, United executives said they were confident that the
union would not disrupt the airline's operations. But it appears
that some of the machinists are as upset as the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the two groups received a majority of the stock in
United's parent company, UAL Corp., in exchange for deep wage cuts
and other concessions that helped return the airline to
profitability and made UAL the largest employee-owned company in
the world. Both are expecting to reap big rewards for their
sacrifices in their new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   United said that it was committed to signing industry-leading
contracts but that the negotiations might take longer than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for airlines to conclude new employee
contracts years after the old ones expire. But the pilots and
mechanics say they were led to believe that United would act
differently.

EX-AIDE TO PATAKI QUESTIONED IN INFLUENCE-PEDDLING TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former top aide to Gov. George Pataki came under vigorous
cross-examination Thursday during a trial centering on charges that
a Pataki fund-raiser solicited donations in exchange for political
favors.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by Patrick Donohue, Pataki's former campaign
finance director, was the highlight of the politically charged
trial, which began two weeks ago. Donohue seemed to be tripped up a
handful of times as the government indicated inconsistencies in his
testimony, in which he denied that he had promised to help win the
parole of three violent felons whose families had contributed to
Pataki's 1994 campaign for governor. Pataki has not been implicated
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a hushed voice that at times barely reached the jurors,
Donohue said, for example, that he had no idea that one of Pataki's
volunteer fund-raisers had sought donations from the three families
because they were interested in getting their children freed from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, however, prosecutors read the jury some of
Donohue's earlier testimony, in which he admitted knowing that the
fund-raiser, Yung Soo Yoo, had taken money from the families and
that they wanted the Pataki administration's help in getting their
sons released.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue was testifying at the influence-peddling trial of Yoo, a
prominent New Jersey businessman who was often called upon to raise
money for the Republican Party among the region's Korean-Americans.
Yoo, 63, is accused of promising the three Korean families that he
would use his clout within the governor's office to get their sons
paroled if they donated thousands of dollars to Pataki's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn stems from a 2
1/2-year investigation into allegations that Pataki officials
drummed up campaign contributions with promises of early parole.
While the federal prosecutors overseeing the case have said
numerous times that there is no evidence that Pataki participated
in or had knowledge of the crimes charged, the case has still
proved somewhat embarrassing for his administration, which has
sought to eliminate parole entirely and has made it tougher for
violent felons to win release on parole.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry has resulted in the perjury convictions of two state
parole officials, Ronald Hotaling and Sean McSherry, and the
indictment of a third, Leo S. Levy, on charges of misleading
investigators in the case. It has also led to the intense scrutiny
of a handful of Pataki aides, including Donohue, who has never been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, has said
throughout the investigation that officials never engaged in
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue's appearance in court Thursday as a defense witness was
greeted with a type of gleeful hunger by federal prosecutors, who
have been investigating him since the start of the case. They
wasted no time pouncing on the witness, opening their
cross-examination with a frontal attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand, Mr. Donohue, as you sit here today, that you
are a target of the investigation of the United States attorney's
office into federal bribery _ you understand that, right?'' a
prosecutor, Margaret Giordano, acerbically asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am,'' Donohue answered, wide-eyed but remaining calm.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, Giordano tried to get Donohue to admit that he
was aware that the families' contributions were taken in exchange
for assistance in getting the prisoners released. But with
carefully chosen words and abundant politeness, Donohue said
several times that neither he nor Yoo made any specific promises to
the families, who had donated more than $36,000 to Pataki's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Donohue was caught a few times saying something in
open court only to have his own earlier testimony or, in two
powerful instances, tape recordings flatly contradict him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he testified that he had never sent documents in
support of the release of one of the prisoners, James Jhang, to the
governor's counsel's office, which often handles clemency requests.
But seconds later, the prosecution played a secretly recorded tape
on which Donohue was heard saying that he had, in fact, forwarded
the documents to the counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Donohue testified that he had met Michael Jhang, the
brother of James Jhang, only once to discuss the case. Again, the
government played a tape on which Donohue was heard saying he had
met Michael Jhang at least a half-dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue explained the first discrepancy by saying that the
counsel's office was where some documents related to prisoners were
typically sent, not that he had actually sent them. He explained
the second discrepancy by saying he was lying on the tape about
having met Michael Jhang numerous times.

WILLIAM MOTE, 93, MILLIONAIRE AND DEVELOPER OF MARINE CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ William Russell Mote, a millionaire businessman
whose love of the sea led him to build the Mote Marine Laboratory
here into a major research center, died July 18 at his home on
Longboat Key. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tampa in 1906, Mote, who spent boyhood days wading in
Tampa Bay for crabs and clams, traced his maritime passion to
childhood fishing trips.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, he moved to New York and spent the next three decades
running Republic Carloading &AMP; Distributing Co., a transportation
company, which made him rich. It was sold in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He never earned a college degree, he told friends, because he
was too busy building his business.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in Sarasota in 1965, Mote wanted to create a marine
laboratory on Florida's west coast. He found that a shark
researcher, Eugenie Clark, was struggling to keep the Cape Haze
Marine Laboratory going, and Mote decided to improve the facility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, the laboratory's name was changed to honor its
benefactors, Mote, his wife, Lenore, and his sister Elizabeth Mote
Rose. It was moved to its present location on City Island in
Sarasota in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Mote has given the laboratory at least $8 million over the
years. In 1991, Congress chose the laboratory as the home of the
National Center for Shark Research. The laboratory's snook breeding
program has also earned worldwide recognition, with nearly 40,000
hatchlings released into Sarasota Bay in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the International Oceanographic Foundation gave Mote
its Gold Medal Award for promoting the study of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Mote and his wife, who died in 1991, donated $1 million in 1994
to establish the William R. and Lenore Mote Eminent Scholar Chair
in Fisheries Ecology at Florida State University.
</P>
<P>
   Mote was president of the laboratory's board until his death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he founded the Mote Vascular Foundation, which supports
efforts to diagnose, prevent and treat vascular disorders. Mote
lost both his legs to vascular problems in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory spokeswoman said Mote has no immediate survivors.

EVERETT CASE, 99, EDUCATOR AND OFFICIAL IN GOVERNMENT AND
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everett Needham Case, a former president of Colgate University
who was also the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
in the late 1960s, died on July 18 in Waterville, N.Y. He was 99.
</P>
<P>
   He died in his sleep at a nursing home, said his son, James H.
Case III.
</P>
<P>
   Case's long career spanned academia, commerce and foreign
affairs. At various times, he also served as the president of the
American Council on Education; president of the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, the nonprofit philanthropic institution in New York;
and chairman of National Educational Television, a precursor of
PBS.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Plainfield, N.J. He graduated from Princeton
University in 1922 and received a degree in modern European history
from Cambridge University in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   His business career began in 1927 when he became the personal
assistant to Owen D. Young, then chairman of General Electric and
the founder of Radio Corporation . of America. From 1929 to 1933,
Case was assistant secretary of GE.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, he married Josephine Young, the daughter of Young, and
the couple subsequently spent two months in China. For Case, the
visit started a lifelong interest in China and, in 1949, he was a
appointed a consultant on Far Eastern policy to Secretary of State
Dean Acheson.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, Case also was acting secretary of National
Broadcasting Co.'s advisory council and became involved in a study
by the Carnegie Foundation to assess the role of radio in
education.
</P>
<P>
   He served two years as assistant dean of the Harvard Graduate
School of Business Administration before becoming president of
Colgate in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was then embroiled in World War II, and Case
emphasized that the school would do its part to aid the war effort.
During the war, the college became a training center for officer
candidates for the Navy and Naval Air Force. But he also urged that
greater effort should be put on the school's social studies
curriculum, adding that it would be unfortunate to swing too far
into technical studies.
</P>
<P>
   After the war ended, Case played a major role in developing the
so-called core curriculum approach to higher education that
emphasized an initial broad-based field of study rather than
directing new students into a specific area. Though it quickly
gained popularity at other colleges and universities, the approach
has fallen in and out of favor through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 20-year tenure at Colgate, Case was a staunch
proponent of the value of a liberal arts education. He also
attracted attention in 1960 when he warned against the creation of
``shadow faculties'' of professors who received high salaries to do
government-sponsored research but did little teaching.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Case became a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York and was appointed its chairman in 1965. His father, J.
Herbert Case, held that same position from 1931 to 1936. In 1936,
the post of chairman ceased to be a full-time position.
</P>
<P>
   Case's wife died in 1990. Along with his son James of White
Plains, he is survived by three children; Josephine E. Case of Van
Hornesville, N.Y., Samuel P. Case of Fairfax, Calif., and John P.
Case of Cambridge, Mass.; eight grandchildren; and three
great-grandchildren.

8 STATES SUE LONG-DISTANCE CARRIERS OVER ADS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., Ill., Calif., Idaho, Maine, Minn., Mo.)  By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Connecticut and New Jersey were among eight
states that filed lawsuits Thursday against AT&AMP;T, Sprint and
WorldCom, the nation's three largest long-distance telephone
carriers, accusing them of misleading consumers in television
commercials that offer low per-minute rates.
</P>
<P>
   The suits, filed Thursday in the states' courts, claim that the
advertisements, which feature Michael Jordan, the comedian Paul
Reiser and several Looney Tunes characters, distract viewers from
the fine print that briefly appears, showing the actual costs of
signing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially they have resorted to glitzy gimmicks and
graphics, cartoon characters and world-class celebrities, all to
confuse, deceive and distract consumers from information that is
essential to their understanding the real deal on phone company
services,'' said Connecticut's attorney general, Richard
Blumenthal, in a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan pitches 5 cents a minute,'' lumenthal said,
referring to a well-known WorldCom commercial in which Jordan
banters with Tweety Bird. ``But hey, Michael, that's only in the
evenings, or on weekends,'' he said, ``and it's only for people at
their residences,'' and valid for only out-of-state calls.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut was the only state to file suit Thursday against all
three companies, though the other states may file additional suits
in coming months. Thursday, New Jersey filed suit in Superior Court
in Essex County only against WorldCom, formerly known as MCI,
claiming that its ``Five Cents Everyday'' commercials fail to
clearly disclose the $4.95 monthly fee and calling restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and Illinois are suing Sprint, saying its
commercials that promote rates ranging from 2 to 10 cents a minute
do not adequately disclose monthly fees, allowable calling times
and surcharges, depending on where calls are made.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials for AT&AMP;T, which is being sued by three states,
feature Reiser pithily pitching a rate of 7 cents per minute, while
the words ``All Day, Every Day'' appear on screen. ``What was
confusing is now not,'' Reiser says at the end of the ad. Mandatory
monthly charges and restrictions on the low rates flash in print
too small, and too briefly broadcast, to be read by any but the
most careful viewers, the suits charge.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Siegal, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T, said, ``It's long been our
policy to be open and honest about fees and charges in our
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, he said, AT&AMP;T sent letters to the 28 million customers
who use its basic-rate service to explain how the company charges
for long distance. ``You really can't do anything else in a highly
competitive marketplace,'' he said. ``It really wouldn't make much
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Steinberg, a spokeswoman for Sprint, said the company's
ads were clear and accurate.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom did not comment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The eight states _ which include California, Idaho, Illinois,
Maine, Minnesota and Missouri _ sued after months of talks between
state officials and company executives, which began as early as
last November, failed to produce an agreement, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the suits against the carriers could yield
``potentially millions of dollars,'' depending on the number of
customers affected in each state.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's suit seeks $7,500 for each customer MCI may have
deceived through its commercials as well as other practices that
the state says falsely portray calling-card costs, in violation of
the state's Consumer Fraud Act.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have until late August to respond to the lawsuits.

HOUSE OKS MARRIAGE PENALTY TAX CUT 
 

</HEADLINE>
 PENALTY-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Thursday passed compromise legislation
to provide $90 billion in tax relief over the next five years to
remove the so-called ``marriage penalty'' for dual-income couples
filing joint tax returns
</P>
<P>
   But the 271-156 vote fell short of the 290 votes required to
override an expected presidential veto. Fifty-one Democrats broke
ranks in voting for the Republican-backed measure.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-controlled Senate is expected today to pass the bill,
which would remove federal tax provisions that cause about 25
million dual-income married couples to pay more in federal income
taxes than they would if they filed as singles.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for shallower tax cuts than the tax-repeal
proposals that the House and Senate passed earlier this month.
Republican House and Senate leaders said they agreed to reduce the
cuts late Wednesday in an effort to gain President Clinton's
support for a unified House-Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., doubted the
Republicans' sincerity and accused them of playing politics in
advance of their party convention that starts July 31 in
Philadelphia. Republicans know Clinton will veto the bill, said
Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in Japan for an international economic summit, has said
he would veto the GOP measure because it doesn't contain the $250
billion in Medicare prescription drug coverage he seeks for seniors
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already has before him Republican-backed legislation to
repeal the federal estate tax. Clinton has said he will veto that
measure because the tax largely applies to the wealthiest 2 percent
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In dueling news conferences before the House vote Thursday,
Democratic congressional leaders said the GOP is putting politics
ahead of sound policy while Republicans countered that Democrats
are favoring government programs over reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Republicans) have continued to provide tax relief to
those wealthiest among us at the expense of health insurance, at
the expense of prescription drugs, at the expense of child care, at
the expense of college tuition tax credits,'' said Daschle. ``I
fear they want the issue, they don't want the accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the GOP-backed legislation would give an unfair
benefit to nearly 20 million married couples who are either
unaffected by the penalty or enjoy a tax break through marriage
because one spouse earns significantly more than the other.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Democrats unsuccessfully offered a more
sensible marriage-tax repeal which would have made it easier for
all married couples to file singly if a joint filing would result
in a higher tax.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why so many congressional Democrats have voted for the GOP
bills, Daschle conceded that political realities make it difficult
for lawmakers to oppose tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it: These are popular tax cuts,'' Daschle said.
``Tax cuts have constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., assailed what he
called the Republicans' ``press-release strategy'' of passing
unsound but popular tax cuts that they will be able to trumpet at
their coming national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders dismissed this accusation, saying that
fairness requires that the federal government not impose taxes that
discriminate against married couples or are assessed on the estates
of people after they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to help people keep more money in their own pocket
rather than sending it to Washington,'' said House Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the government
``should be strengthening families'' not penalizing them for being
married.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed marriage-penalty repeal would gradually remove a
disparity in the graduated income-tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, individuals earning up to $26,250 annually are in the
15 percent income-tax bracket. However, a married couple cannot
earn $52,500, twice the $26,250, and remain in the 15 percent
bracket. The 15 percent bracket extends only to joint income of
$43,850.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, two individuals making $25,000 annually would be
taxed singly at 15 percent. But, if they married, some of their
joint income of $50,000 would be taxed at 28 percent, hence they
would be ``penalized,'' in the vernacular of tax accountants.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would remove that over the next five years by
raising the combined income that married couples can earn under the
15 percent bracket to twice that of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would allow a married couple filing jointly to
claim a standard deduction that equals twice the singles standard
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   For tax year 2000 that would mean increasing the standard
deduction for married couples from $7,350 to $8,800, a boost of
nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-backed marriage-penalty and estate-tax repeals come amid
Congressional Budget Office projections of a budget surplus of
$2.17 trillion over the next 10 years, including a $102 billion
surplus next year. Citing the surplus, Republicans have pressed for
tax relief, while Democrats have sought more money for health care
and education. &QL;
