<HEADLINE> 88,000 EU Citizens Register for Belgium's Local Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Belgium has received more than
88,000 applications for voting in its local elections from a
total of nearly 499,000 nationals of other European Union member
states who live in the country, the Belgian Interior Ministry said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In June, Interior Minister Antoine Duquesne expected some 45,
000 of them to register for the local vote scheduled for October 8.
</P>
<P>
The people from other EU member countries living in Belgium
were requested to register before the July 31 deadline so that,
for the first time, they can get the right to take part in the
local elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the registered foreign voters would be viewed as
violating the Belgian law if they finally fail to vote.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than half of the registered foreign
voters are Italians. The other large groups are French and Dutch
nationals.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Overseas Listing Pushes China's SOEs Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The recent listings of China
UNICOM and China Petro in Hong Kong and New York have caused a
stir both within and outside the industries. But while most people
are adoring the big money that has been raised, a few analysts are
thinking of something even bigger: the reform of China's State-
owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Xiaonian, a senior researcher at the China
International Capital Co. (CICC), the significance of overseas
listings is not raising funds as presumed by most people but
pushing the reform of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
He further claimed SOE reform other than attracting foreign
capital was the major motivation of the government when it
approved the first overseas listings in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"This remains true today," Xu said, adding that that overseas
listings have become an important way and force to push SOE reform,
the biggest economic sphinx before the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
China International Capital Co. is China's first investment
banker and the only one with foreign equities. Prominent global
financial services firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has a 35
percent stake in it.
</P>
<P>
The company has been playing a major role in the overseas
listings by China UNICOM, China Petro and other Chinese firms. (

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Overseas Listing Pushes China's SOEs Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noted Chinese economist Wu Jinglian seems to share Xu's opinion.
Speaking at a recent conference in Beijing, Wu said the overseas
listing of China Petro is not only for raising funds, but to
transform it into a company that has a modern enterprise system in
line with international practice and could cope with the
challenges of the market.
</P>
<P>
He further said China Petro's successful IPO (initial public
offering) is the result of decisive corporate restructuring and a
strong commitment to its investors, which would be a good model
for other large SOEs to follow in their reforms.
</P>
<P>
CICC's Xu Xiaonian noted that if it was for the pure aim of
raising funds there would be no need for Chinese firms to list
their stocks overseas, because Chinese citizens have 6 trillion
yuan in savings deposits to buy these stocks, not to say that the
costs of overseas listings are much higher than domestic listings.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out businesses in China are greatly different from
their overseas counterparts. While the latter has maximized
profits as their sole goal of operations, Chinese businesses
shoulder more responsibilities to their societies, which often
demands the sacrifice of efficiency.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOEs certainly could list their stocks in domestic stock
markets. In fact, a majority of China's listed firms are
shareholding companies transformed from SOEs.
</P>
<P>
But Xu said because China's stock market is far from mature in
regulating listed firms and protecting investors' interests, many
transformed SOEs regard the market as a mere financing tool and
failed to carry out true market- and investor-oriented reforms.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, overseas stock markets are much better in
this regard. Hence, SOEs are forced to carry out reforms in line
with the demands of the markets and investors before their
listings.
</P>
<P>
Take China Petro as an example, first it had to sort out its
assets and debts, change its accounting system in accordance with
international practices and restructure its corporate
organizations and assets.
</P>
<P>
After its listing, the firm has to be run in line with the
demands of the market and investors. It has to regularly issue
information on company management and operations and put it under
the supervision of investors.
</P>
<P>
The firm also introduced overseas strategic investors,
independent board members and stock options for management, all of
which are designed to improve management and protect the interests
of its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, since 1993, there have been more than 100
Chinese enterprises listed on overseas market. A notable thing is
that more and more transformed large SOEs are involved, some of
them being vital to the restructuring of a whole industry.
</P>
<P>
In general, Xu said these SOEs are also going farther in their
restructuring and reforms, which are well received by overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
The effect of overseas listings on China's SOEs reform will be
felt by more people in the coming days, Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Most Shares of Former British Royal Vessel to be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Oriana
Entertainment Corporation will transfer its shares of "Oriana," a
former British royal pleasure vessel, by auction on September 28.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai International Commodity Auction Corporation and the
Hangzhou Western Lake International Travel Corporation, which
holds 85 percent of the shares for the vessel, jointly made the
announcement today.
</P>
<P>
The British-made "Oriana" made its maiden voyage in 1960 and
was one of the world's four most famous vessels. It completed its
final voyage in March 1986.
</P>
<P>
The 16-storey vessel is 245.06 meters long and 51.l21 meters
high and has 903 guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
The retired vessel was first purchased by a city in Japan and
rebuilt into the world's only large-sized pleasure sightseeing
vessel.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese enterprise then bought the vessel nine years later
and placed the vessel in Qinhuangdao City of northern China's
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
In November 1998, the Hangzhou Western Lake company and a
Hangzhou department store group jointly established the Shanghai
Oriana Entertainment Corporation and purchased the vessel for over
47 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The corporation spent another 37 million yuan to renovate the
vessel and placed it in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The vessel now has five restaurants, six bars and four
entertainment halls. It has attracted over 500,000 Chinese and
foreign visitors since February 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The net assets of the Oriana company is estimated at 112
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Pilots of Crashed Iranian Helicopter Might Be Alive: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The pilot and copilot of a
helicopter which crashed into the Persian Gulf Tuesday night might
still be alive, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the crash, the two pilots, both Iranians, went missing,
but "we have evidence to prove" that they are alive, said Norollah
Rezaei Niaraki, managing-director of the Iranian Helicopter
Services Organization.
</P>
<P>
He held out the possibility that the two might have been saved
by vessels travelling in nearby waters, adding that the searching
operation is still under way.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter with six people on board crashed around 23:00
local time (1830 GMT) due to unspecific reasons.
</P>
<P>
Besides the two missing, a third person was injured after the
helicopter crashed near the Saga platform in Iran's South Pars gas
field. Three other people, whose nationalities are not clear, were
rescued unharmed.
</P>
<P>
The injured man, identified as Varghese Paul, a 26-year-old
Indian national, said he last saw the pilot and co-pilot trapped in
the wreckage of the helicopter, which came apart in three pieces.
</P>
<P>
"This helicopter was transferring three workers from the
platform to Kish when a sudden jolt occurred", Paul was quoted as
saying from his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
He said he was rescued by workers after about one hour in the
water and transferred to Kish Island in the Persian Gulf province
of Hormozgan.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was chartered by South Pars Company and was
carrying the personnel of a Japanese contractor to Kish free trade
zone, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Gaza Port Construction Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister of Finance
Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashibi said construction works at Gaza Port
started on Wednesday, a step towards the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Gaza Port was "a symbol of sovereignty and independence of
the Palestinian statehood," said the minister, voicing his
happiness at the launching of the project which came later than the
date set in the Sharm el Sheikh memo signed between Israel and the
Palestinians in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal, the port construction works should start
within 60 days after the memo's implementation, but they were put
on hold for months due to impediments and hurdles set by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) stands prepared to
cement and develop infrastructure in the Palestinian self-rule
areas, he added. Once an independent Palestinian statehood is
declared, industrial zones will be set up, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The port, to be completed in 18 months, will cost 70 million U.
S. dollars, half of which will be jointly financed by France, the
Netherlands and the European Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
Once a Palestinian state is declared by the target date of
September 13, the port will start operation as a trade harbor
between Palestine and other Arab countries, he added. The port will
make 15,000 jobs available.

<HEADLINE> Arab Librarians Stress Palestinian Right to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab librarians underlined in a
declaration on Wednesday that Jerusalem is an Arab and Islamic city
that should be the capital of a future independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
The librarians issued the Jerusalem Declaration to mark the
conclusion of the 11th conference of the Arab Federation for
Libraries and Informatics held during the past five days at the
Arab League headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Arab federation reiterated its rejection of the decision
taken by the International Federation of Library Associations and
Institutions (IFLA) to hold its annual meeting in Jerusalem, the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs support the Palestinian position that East Jerusalem
is part of the Palestinian lands occupied by Israel and should be
returned under U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Arab League
demanded IFLA not hold the meeting in Jerusalem. Despite the
opposition, IFLA went ahead with the six-day meeting on Sunday. The
Arab conference was an alternative event to protest the IFLA
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Arab librarians appealed to international scientists,
academics and legal experts to support the Palestinians' rights to
establish their own state with Jerusalem as the capital, the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
They also called on international and regional organizations to
support the Palestinian demands to restore documents and scripts
usurped by Israel and to help the Palestinians to set up integrated
systems of libraries and research centers.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and
declared later the whole city its "eternal and undivided capital."
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future
state.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Should See Peace, Cooperation: Jordanian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Wednesday called on the parties concerned in the Arab-Israeli
peace process to seize all opportunities to turn the conflict-
ridden Middle East into a region of peace and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal in a meeting with visiting U.S. Senator and
head of the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. Senate Floyd
Spence.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also stressed Jordan will continue to support the peace
process to achieve justice for the Palestinians as well as security
and stability for all other peoples in the region, including the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, the king said the strong ties between
Jordan and the U.S. stem from mutual respect and close cooperation,
particularly in the economic and defensive fields.
</P>
<P>
He commended U.S. support to uplift Jordan's economic and
defensive capabilities, as Washington provided some 300 million U.
S. dollars in various economic and military aid packages to the
kingdom annually in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan as a strategic ally in the Arab world
and a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab neighbors
since the two countries signed a peace deal in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Spence reaffirmed appreciation for King Abdullah
advocating the principals of rights, justice and peace in the
region, Jordan's official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
He said Abdullah's visits to the U.S. in the past few months
produced positive and substantial results in the development of
bilateral ties, and helped Washington understand his vision on
Jordan's future and issues confronting the region.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pledges to Work for End of Cyprus Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia will work toward the end
of the division of Cyprus in accordance with U.N. Security Council
resolutions, Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Vladimir Pavlinov said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pavlinov made the remarks when he received a protest petition
from the elected representatives of the Turkish occupied area of
Morphou, northwest of the island, led by mayor Antigoni
Papadopoulou to mark the 26th anniversary since the town was
captured by Turkey in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The petition urged big powers to exert more pressure on Turkey
to change attitude and work toward a just solution to the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Pavlinov said Russia will press on with its position at the
forthcoming millenium summit next month in New York.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Pavlinov has also said Russian
diplomats will play an active role in New York and did not rule out
the possibility of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir
Putin and Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Morphou fell to Turkish troops on August 16, 1974. The Greek
Cypriots of Morphou are now living in the government-controlled
south area as refugees.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have been
held in an effort to find a Cyprus solution. The fourth round is
scheduled to start on September 12 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Russian envoys for Cyprus have followed the first three rounds
of talks and have meetings with Cypriot officials and other foreign
envoys.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the petition, Pavlinov said Putin is well informed
about Cyprus and referred to the position he adopted at last
month's Group 8 (seven most industrialized nations plus Russia)
summit in Japan to ensure the final statement included a phrase
explicitly expressing support for the just cause of the Cyprus
people.
</P>
<P>
He said the statement, though brief, mentioned twice the need to
end the division of the island according to Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"That will be our positions at the millennium summit in New York
next month where we hope that most presidents will have on the
agenda procedure to talk about the Cyprus issue," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Offer for Russian Sub Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Wednesday renewed the U.S. offer for the rescue of 116 sailors of
a Russian submarine sunken at the bottom of the Barents Sea, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Council spokesman David Stockwell
said Clinton made a 25-minute telephone conversation with Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed a number of areas. President Clinton expressed
concern over the situation involving the Russian submarine and
renewed his offer to help," Stockwell said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the call to return the one Putin made last week in
which the Russian president wanted to give Clinton an update on
the talks he had with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat about
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed their upcoming meeting in New York
when they attend the U.N. Millennium Summit on September 6-8.
</P>
<P>
Stockwell said Clinton and Putin also talked about the welfare
of Edmund Pope, an American who has been imprisoned in Russia
since April 3 in Moscow on espionage charges.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Seizes Over 1.5 Tons of Smuggled Ivory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian authorities have
seized
more than 1.5 tons of ivory smuggled from Sudan, one of the largest
ever seizures in Africa, the Middle East News Agency reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian, identified as Mahmoud Hassan Khalil and Sudanese
Ali Hassan Abdul Rahman were arrested on Saturday when they tried
to sneak into Egypt, the Egyptian official news agency quoted
officials of the Ministry of Agriculture as saying.
</P>
<P>
They confessed to illegally entering Egypt for the purpose of
selling ivory, and led security officials to the home of Morsy
Mahmoud Al-Tayeb in the southern Egyptian town of Kom Ombo, where
29 sacks containing 1,525 kilograms of uncut ivory were found.
</P>
<P>
The three arrestees appeared Sunday before a military court,
which will announce a ruling on August 26, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ivory has been transferred to the Aswan customs office to be
kept as evidence for the case. The price for one kilogram of ivory
ranges between 1,000 and 4,000 Egyptian pounds (290 U.S. dollars to
1,160 dollars), depending on the quality.
</P>
<P>
Before this case, the largest amount of smuggled ivory captured
in Egypt was 130 kilograms.

<HEADLINE> Draft Report on Human Rights in Iraq Ready for U.N. General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A draft report on the situation
of human rights in Iraq has been ready for presentation to the U.N.
General Assembly in early October, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Retired Cyprus Ambassador Andreas Mavrommatis, the U.N. Special
Rapporteur for the situation of human rights in Iraq, made the
report following his visits to Kuwait and Britain and contacts with
U.S. administration officials in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA television, Mavrommatis said it was
imperative that he should visit Iraq for an on-the-spot
investigation, adding that during his recent visits he dealt with
the issue of missing persons in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his goal is to secure Iraq's cooperation in
human rights issues so that the situation in the country will
improve.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely necessary for me to visit Iraq for an on-the-
spot investigation and my objective is to embark on a dialogue with
the government of Iraq to see how it will start complying with its
international obligations," Mavrommatis said.
</P>
<P>
He described his cooperation so far with Iraqi officials as "
encouraging", but also said that Baghdad follows a general policy
of non-cooperation with the U.N., which affects his own task.
</P>
<P>
Mavrommatis appealed to Iraq to cooperate and implement the
provisions of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1284 which was
approved last December.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, would be to the benefit of the Iraqi people,
noting that since the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food
program in 1996, there has been some improvement in the human
rights situation in the country, but some problems continue to
afflict the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary report will be given to Iraq for comment before
it is submitted to the U.N. General Assembly, said the former
diplomat.  Mavrommatis said the purpose of his visit to Kuwait
was to look into the issue of the fate of some 605 missing persons.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwaiti officials had asked for his help "to persuade
the Iraqi government to give full replies to the questions relating
to missing persons."
</P>
<P>
"I also met with the Iraqi Ambassador in Geneva and communicated
to him the information I have, asking for a response within a
specified time limit," Mavrommatis said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the U.N. Assembly, he intends to visit
Jordan, Iran and any other country, if needed, for more contacts.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Meets PLO Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah al-Khatib on Wednesday received visiting Secretary General of
the
Palestine Liberation Organization Mahmoud Abbas to coordinate
stands in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a closed-door meeting, al-Khatib and Abbas reviewed the
latest
developments of the peace process, particularly on the Palestinian
track, and they stressed the need for a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the region, Jordan's official news agency
Petra reported without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Abbas' visit to Amman fell within a mechanism of consistent
coordination and consultation between Jordan and the Palestinians
on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here hours before Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
who is scheduled to visit the kingdom Wednesday evening on a
similar mission to rally support.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors after it signed a treaty with Israel in 1994 as the
second Arab country after Egypt to reach such a peace deal with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
However, the kingdom has been persistent in its support for
restoring the rights of the Palestinians, including the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as
its capital.

<HEADLINE> Barak Convenes Cabinet on Budget Ahead of Visit to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Wednesday convened his cabinet to discuss the government's
2001 budget bill ahead of an important visit to neighboring Jordan
for renewing the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of Wednesday's cabinet session, Barak said the
2001 budget, which was proposed by Finance Minister Avraham Shochat
last Thursday, is very important for Israel's future development.
</P>
<P>
The economic recovery in the past year, along with Israel
Defense Forces' withdrawal from Lebanon last May, is the most
important achievement by the current administration, said Barak,
who was sworn in office in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 2001 budget, the prime minister added, put priorities on
education, infrastructure construction, and technical research and
development. Barak promised his government will keep trying to cut
down government deficits and jobless rates.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will convene several times in the next few weeks and
will approve the budget and deficit and inflation target figures,
according to a statement issued by Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Barak will fly to the Jordanian capital of
Amman Wednesday evening to meet with Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein, in order to drum up support for renewing the Israeli-
Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two sides have come to a halt after the
Camp David summit between Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach a deal last month due
to significant gaps over the fate of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry officials said Barak will update King
Abdullah on the recent developments in the peace process during the
two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which has hosted 1.2 million Palestinian refugees in the
past decades, has also a special interest in the Jerusalem issue as
Arab East Jerusalem was once under its control before the Israeli
occupation in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Barak believes his view-exchanging with the Jordanian
monarch is very important at the current stage.
</P>
<P>
To soften Jordan's stands on the refugee issue, Barak, as
Israeli media reports speculated, will agree to call upon the
international community to compensate Jordan for hosting refugees.

<HEADLINE> Iran Builds Biggest Commercial Port on Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran will soon finish the first
phase of Khazar (Amirabad) port, which is located on the Caspian
Sea coast and is set to be the country's biggest northern port, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the port will be commissioned next month when
4 million tons of cargo can be handled, said Abdollah Mohammad
Hashem, a senior official in the Ministry of Roads and Transport.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the port enjoys distinct features
such as links to the trans-Iranian railway and floating docks
accessible by both roads and railways. Once finished completely,
the port will facilitate a simultaneous berthing of 11 vessels.
</P>
<P>
Once the port becomes fully operational, the distance for
transit of goods from the Commonwealth of Independent States,
particularly Russia and Kazakhstan, to the Persian Gulf via the
trans-Iranian railway, will be cut by 455 kilometers, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Khazar port is being built to relieve the pressure on
present ports on the Caspian Sea and respond to increasing amount
of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Some 41 billion rials (about five million U.S. dollars) have
been earmarked for constructing port facilities while another 47
billion rials (about 5.73 million dollars) will be invested in the
next two years for dredging operations, construction of
administrative buildings and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The construction operation of this well-equipped commercial port
began in 1996 and its dock is 830 meters in length.
</P>
<P>
Four million tons of cargo can be handled once the first phase
of the project is commissioned, and the figure will double after
the third phase comes on stream in about two years time.
</P>
<P>
A floating dock accessible by road will enable transfer of
trucks carrying freight from Russia and Kazakhstan to this port. It
will play an important role in expanding road transportation and
lowering the expense of freight transfer, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Khazar port will also include a floating dock accessible by
railway, three handling positions for ships carrying fuel, and a
large warehouse.
</P>
<P>
The dock will further facilitate transfer of oil derivatives
from Caspian Sea littoral states to the world markets.

CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said on Wednesday it is
regretful and dissatisfied at Kuwaiti authorities' failure to abide
by a court ruling over custody of two Egyptian girls.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti court has ruled that the custody of Dalia, 13, and
Sara, 8, should be given to their father, Hisham Abul Naga, who is
working in the Gulf sheikdom, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuwaiti authorities have allowed Abul Naga's
Italian wife to leave the country together with the girls without
his permission, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that allowing
departure of the two girls with their mother has caused "severe
psychological and moral harm to their father, the legal custodian."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that "it is determined to carry on with its
support" for Abul Naga's quest for the custody of his children.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Condemn Continuing Turkish Occupation of Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's continuing occupation of
Cyprus, including the island's northwestern Morphou area, is an
affront to civilized humanity, said Morphou refugees Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a petition presented to the representatives of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council here, they also
expressed disappointment and bitterness at the absence of any move
to oust the Turkish occupation troops from Cyprus and allow the
return of the legal owners to their homes.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that any agreed solution should safeguard the return
of all towns and villages, not only Morphou but all occupied
areas," Morphou mayor Antigoni Papadopoulou said upon delivering
the petition.
</P>
<P>
The people of Morphou, she added, expect the solution in Cyprus
should secure human rights and reunite Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the Mediterranean island
after an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The town of Morphou fell to Turkish control two days after
Turkey launched its second offensive against Cyprus on August 14,
1974, which also resulted in the capture of the Karpass peninsula,
Famagusta on the east and the fertile valley of Messaoria, in the
center of the island.
</P>
<P>
"It is a disgrace to civilized humanity to accept that at the
dawn of the 21st century, thousands of Greek Cypriot refugees are
still deprived of the right to return to their homes and
properties," the petition said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots, who were moved by the Turkish troops to the
north, are also denied by the Turkish army their rights to return
to their homes in the southern government-controlled part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
The petition called on Europe and the governments of the U.S.,
Russia, China, France and Britain to exert more pressure on Turkey
to change attitude and work toward a just solution to the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus is too small to be divided forever. We ask for action
not promise," the petition said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Morphou municipality Wednesday evening will
organize a protest rally in Nicosia.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official
announced here on Wednesday that Iran will soon build its own
national satellite with the cooperation of foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign companies have taken part in a tender
bidding for the project and Iran will select a winner to build the
satellite, said Mehdi Tabeshian, deputy minister of post, telegraph
and telephone for national affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the satellite, named "Zohreh", will be put into an orbit
36,000 kilometers from the earth.
</P>
<P>
The satellite has the capacity of beaming 12 channels, seven of
which are designed for providing audio-video coverage and five
others for telecommunication purposes.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, did not say which countries have attended
the bidding and who will possibly win the project, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Tabeshian said Iran has two more satellite projects. One
called "Mesbah" and with an initial capital of 10 million U.S.
dollars will be operational in the next three years. The satellite
is to be placed in an orbit 800 kilometers from the earth.
</P>
<P>
Another, he pointed out, is a multi-purpose satellite to be
built in cooperation with China, Thailand, South Korea, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Indonesia and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be used for transmission of audio (voice)
mail, transfer of data and other scientific uses.

TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Iranians went missing after a
helicopter they were aboard crashed Tuesday night over the Persian
Gulf, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was on its way from an oil platform in the Gulf

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM's Visit to Syria to Upgrade Bilateral Ties: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit to Syria by
Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb will further strengthen
bilateral ties in all fields, particularly on issues of water and
economic cooperation, said a senior Jordanian official here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb is expected to visit Syria on Thursday to co-chair a
meeting of the higher joint committee between the two countries
with his Syrian counterpart Mohammed Mustafa Miro, said Jordanian
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Prime Ministry Affairs Saleh
Irsheidat at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Irsheidat said Jordan has always exerted efforts to further
deepen its ties with Arab countries in all fields, and King
Abdullah's visits to Arab countries, including Syria, after his
accession to the throne in February, 1999, reflect Jordan's
keenness to boost inter-Arab ties and to forge a comprehensive Arab
unity.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan and Syria are improving steadily as Abdullah
has established close ties with Syria's new President Bashar al-
Assad.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also tided over years of tensions over
Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel as Syria has stood against
any unilateral Arab effort to make peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture, Syria will provide some 3.5 million cubic
meters of drinking water to Jordan this summer though it itself has
been hit by a prevailing drought in the region.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Presents Armored Personnel Carriers to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has donated five
armored personnel carriers to the Mozambican Interior Ministry,
with an aim to consolidate the cooperation between the two
countries' police authorities, said a report reaching here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the South African Safety and Security
Minister Steve Tshwete personally handed over the equipment to his
Mozambican counterpart Almerino Manhenje in Maputo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tshwete said the donation was another demonstration of how the
two countries could work together to fight transnational crimes.
</P>
<P>
A Mozambican police spokesman said that "the donation to
Mozambican police (confirms) the good relationship that exists
between the two police services".
</P>
<P>
This cooperative relationship has led to a number of successful
joint operations, including the arrest of alleged drug smugglers,
closure of a Maputo factory known to be Africa's largest Mandrax
plant and the recovery and destruction of thousands of AK-47
assault rifles, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
"The four-wheel-drive Casspirs will assist the Mozambican
police in carrying out their duties in areas where vehicles of
this nature are needed," added the police spokesman.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Refuse to Transfer Cash Reserve to Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African Banking
Council is opposed to draft legislation that will compel
commercial banks to shift a portion of their cash reserves into
the South African Reserve Bank' s (SARB) vaults.
</P>
<P>
If enacted, the South African Reserve Bank Amendment Bill will
allow the central bank to determine itself how much of these
contingency reserves it should hold, the South African Press
Association reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, banks are required to hold a minimum 2.5 percent of
their total assets as a contingency reserve, but are not required
to transfer this amount to the SARB.
</P>
<P>
The bill -- which will be submitted to the cabinet on August
23 -- was presented to Parliament's finance portfolio committee on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SARB advocate Johann de Jaager said the proposal would allow
the central bank to relieve cash shortages experienced by some
commercial banks, without influencing monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The larger cash reserve held by the SARB would save the
central bank from having to inject additional money into the
system should certain banks run into difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The amendment will provide the government with the
flexibility to control the cash flow in the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposals, the SARB could decide that all of the
reserve balance be held in its accounts.
</P>
<P>
Banking Council chief executive Bob Tucker said this week in a
letter to the committee that the adverse consequences of the
legislation had not been adequately addressed.
</P>
<P>
"The banking industry therefore intends to oppose the passage
of the legislation through Parliament," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tucker warned that the additional costs associated with the
amendment could be passed onto the consumer, and could result in
the closing of unprofitable rural and marginal bank branches.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the four major commercial banks held a total of 11.2
billion rand (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) in reserves, 8.1 billion
rand (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) of which was held as cash in the
commercial banks' vaults.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the new bill, the banks could be forced to hold
this cash reserve with the central bank, where it would earn no
interest.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 figures, this would have resulted in an
additional loss of interest of about 1.1 billion rand (159 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tucker said the banks should be adequately compensated for
this loss.
</P>
<P>
De Jaager told the committee that the International Monetary
Fund-- in a report earlier this year -- had recommended that the
entire reserve be held by the SARB.
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to conduct public hearings on the
draft bill on August 30.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Urges Eligible Voters to Cast Ballots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa on Wednesday urged all eligible voters to turn out
in the upcoming general elections to exercise their democratic
rights.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of newly constructed tarmac
road in the northern town of Arusha, the president stressed that
people must utilize this right and preserve the registration card
until the polling day.
</P>
<P>
"You should listen attentively to the election rallies before
you cast your votes on October 29," Mkapa added.
</P>
<P>
He told a large crowd gathered at the ceremony that
registration but not going to cast votes is tantamount to
forfeiting one's rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will ensure that the elections are
conducted in a peaceful atmosphere and will not allow
troublemakers to disrupt elections or use threats or intimidation
in the process.
</P>
<P>
He warned that no one should sell democratic voting right
because of material temptation.
</P>
<P>
"Don't do that," said the president. "Use your right to elect
people who will bring development."
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, leader of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party, is
running for a second five-year term in the upcoming polls.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Electoral Commission, over 10 million
Tanzanians are expected to be registered for the second multi-
party presidential, parliamentary and councilor elections.

<HEADLINE> Study Says Reptile Decline Worrisome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Reptiles are declining on a
global scale and appear to be in danger of extinction worldwide,
warned a new study by U.S. scientists.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the August issue of the Journal BioScience,
herpetologist Whit Gibbons and his colleagues said the
disappearance of reptiles from the natural world is genuine and
should be a matter of concern.
</P>
<P>
"Current evidence suggests that these declines constitute a
worldwide crisis," said Gibbons, a professor of ecology at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
For example, the estimated worldwide population of leatherback
turtles nesting on beaches was 115,000 in 1980, but dropped to 30,
000 in 1995 due to over-exploitation in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
And the Galapagos tortoise is now near extinction because of
introduced rats that eat the tortoise egg.
</P>
<P>
Habitat loss and degradation, introduced invasive species,
environmental pollution, disease, unsustainable use, and global
climate change are six significant threats to reptile population,
Gibbons told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
According to the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species, there are about 7,150 species of reptiles in
the world now. However, 70 species of reptiles are threatened with
extinction in 2000, and 383 species are not currently threatened
but are likely to become so unless trade is restricted.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said that reptiles are an integral part of natural
ecosystems and heralds of environmental quality, and protecting
reptiles is of great importance to biodiversity.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Scientists to Continue Research on Animal-to-Human Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A decision by a British company
to stop research into cloning animals for transplant purposes won'
t prevent Swiss scientists from pressing ahead with their research,
Swiss Radio International reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss response came after the Roslin Institute in Scotland,
which created the world's first cloned sheep, Dolly, announced it
would no longer pursue research in this field.
</P>
<P>
The Roslin Institute said the decision was taken for purely
economic reasons, after its American backers, Geron Bio-Med, cut
its funding for research into producing genetically altered pig
organs for transplants in humans. However, Director of the
institute Graham Bulfield denied Geron's decision was based on
concerns over the possible health risk of animal-to-human
transplants.
</P>
<P>
The main fear is that transplanted organs from pigs could
transmit potentially deadly animal viruses to humans.
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, Francois Mosimann, president of the study group
on xenotransplants, Swisstransplant, described the volte-face by
the Anglo-American group as "a minor setback" and said he was
optimistic about the future of such research.
</P>
<P>
His words were echoed by the president of the Lausanne Federal
Polytechnic, Patrick Aebischer, who said transplants into humans
of isolated cells from calves and hamsters had caused no problems.
</P>
<P>
A British subsidiary of the Swiss Novartis group, Imutran,
confirmed that it would be proceeding with its xenotransplantation
program.
</P>
<P>
The market for pig organs is potentially worth billions of U.S.
dollars, given the shortage of human donors. Tens of thousands of
people worldwide are waiting for hearts, livers, kidneys and other
organs.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has yet to formulate laws to deal with the issues
related to animal organ transplants, according to the Swiss Radio
International report. To encourage a public debate, the Swiss
Science Council has set up an Internet site with a discussion
forum.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Closes Cheap Bakeries for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The largest warring party
in Afghanistan, the Taliban, had ordered the closure of U.N.-
funded bakeries for women in Kabul, a U.N. spokesman said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said the order
was part of an edict issued by the Taliban in early July which
banned Afghan women from working with the international non-
governmental and the U.N. agencies, except in the health sector.
</P>
<P>
It was a serious impediment for the U.N. humanitarian
operations in the country, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, there are 350 Afghan women
working in the bakery project which was feeding some 50,000 widows.
The beneficiaries belonged to the poorest population of the war-
ravaged capital where the Taliban authorities have banned women
from outdoor work and barred them from education.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has held rounds of talks with the Taliban,
trying to reverse its edit. But no result has been yielded so far.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
Russia had signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Humanitarian
Action in the Northern Caucasus, the U.N. spokesman's office said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The office said the memorandum aimed to establish a firm basis
for the U.N. to continue to provide humanitarian aid to civilians
in need in the Republic of Chechnya, the Republic of Dagestan, and
the Republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N., the memorandum affirmed that the United
Nations and Russia would continue to cooperate on and coordinate
the provision of humanitarian assistance in the Northern Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also confirmed that Russia would work to ensure
the security of U.N. and associated personnel engaged in
humanitarian action in the Northern Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
It acknowledged that humanitarian action carried out by the
United Nations, its agencies, and their partners was based on
recognized international legal instruments, and the humanitarian
programs of the United Nations, its agencies, and their partners
were guided by the principles of humanity, impartiality and
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1, 1999, U.N. agencies including the High
Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children's Fund, the
United Nations Population Fund, the World Food Program, the World
Health Organization and the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs have carries out aid programs
in the Northern Caucasus valued at 30 million U.S. dollars. The
United Nations plans to provide additional assistance to the tune
of 20 million dollars by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Hits Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Britain fell to a
record low while average earnings continued to fall, official
figures released Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Office for National Statistics saw that the
number of people unemployed and claiming benefit was down last
month by 22,700 to 1,069,800.
</P>
<P>
This brings the rate of unemployment to 3.7 percent, the lowest
rate since November 1975, based on the number of people claiming
benefit.
</P>
<P>
However, average earnings grew by 4.1 percent in June, its
lowest rate for three years. This compares with 4.6 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that together, the two sets of data can
be taken as reducing the chances of further rises in interest
rates in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday met behind the closed doors to discuss the current
situation in Burundi at a time when the 15-nation body called upon
all parties to the conflict in Burundi to end hostilities "without
delay."
</P>
<P>
The council stressed the importance of resuming development
aid to the war-torn central African country.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door council session coincided with the meeting
between President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi and former South
African President Nelson Mandela in South Africa. Buyoya arrived
in Johannesburg Tuesday in the second visit to South Africa in two
weeks to consult Mandela in a bid to end the seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is mediating peace negotiations in the central African
country to end the ethnic-based war pitting the ruling Tutsi-
dominated army against the majority Hutu people.
</P>
<P>
On August 2, the Security Council issued a press statement
saying that council members strongly supported Mandela's
facilitation efforts, and urging the parties to engage seriously
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Council members also supported the holding of a donors
conference which would facilitate the relaunching of the Burundian
economy, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
seven-year civil war between the army and the Hutu rebels. Neither
the Burundian government nor the rebels have accepted a peace plan
put forward earlier this month by mediator Mandela to end the war.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Up 0.2 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices edged up
a slight 0.2 percent in July as prices for gasoline and natural
gas eased after soaring in June, the Labor Department reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The department's Consumer Price Index jumped up 0.6 percent in
June, thanks to an expected leap in energy prices, which hit their
highest point in 14 months with a 5.6 percent bounce.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, energy prices inched up only 0.1 percent in July,
the new report showed.
</P>
<P>
In July, food prices rose by 0.5 percent, as prices increased
for cereals, bakery products, fruits and vegetables after
declining in June. Prices also were higher for meat, poultry, fish
and eggs.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the consumer
inflation's "core" rate also rose just 0.2 percent, for a fourth
consecutive month, suggesting that most other prices remain under
control.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of this year, the consumer prices
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 percent,
compared with an increase of 2.7 percent for the whole year of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of consumer inflation so far this year was
largely due to energy costs, which increased at a 22.6 percent
annual rate in the first seven months of 2000 after advancing 13.4
percent in all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The July performance brought the core rate for the first seven
months of the year to an average 2.6 percent, up from 1.9 percent
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the past 14 months in an effort to slow the economy and keep
inflation in check. Many economists believe the Fed will leave
rates unchanged at next week's meeting, preferring to wait and see
whether the rate increases it has already approved will be
adequate.

WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing starts fell 3.3
percent in July from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1,512 million units, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline was in contrast with earlier forecasts that housing
starts would rise 1.94 percent over the figures for June, which
analysts predicted would remain unrevised.
</P>
<P>
The department Wednesday revised its figures for June, however,
to show a 1.8 percent decrease, smaller than the 2.6 percent
decrease initially reported.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, housing starts in July were 11.3
percent lower than the July 1999 rate of 1,704 million units.
</P>
<P>
Housing units authorized by building permits in July dropped 2
percent to an annual rate of 1,497 million units from the revised
June rate of 1,528 million units. That was 10.5 percent lower than
the 1,673 million units in July 1999.

<HEADLINE> Research: Refrigerators Reveal Elderly People's Health Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Doctors have recommended that
nurses and care workers check elderly people's refrigerators
carefully to see whether they are vulnerable to illness.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss medical doctors at the University Hospitals of Geneva
make the recommendations out of their research of 132 elderly
patients with an average age of 81, according to a Swiss Radio
International report Wednesday. These patients were receiving
routine house calls after leaving hospital.
</P>
<P>
The study published in the latest edition of the British
medical journal "The Lancet" found that those older people with
empty fridges were more likely to fall ill than those with well-
stocked refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Each person's fridge was assessed for its contents. The fridges
were classed into several categories: those with rotten food or
products past their best before date and those which were bare or
had less than three different items in them.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen elderly people or 10 percent of those under
observation had empty fridges, according to the study. Women were
more likely than men to neglect their shopping round.
</P>
<P>
Those with empty fridges were found to be three times more at
risk of being admitted to hospital than those who had stocked up.
</P>
<P>
Factors such as gender, body mass index or whether the person
was on their own did not influence the risk factor, the Geneva
Geriatrics team explained.
</P>
<P>
"This finding might suggest that an empty refrigerator is a
sign of a clinically frail stage," the authors of the report
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The doctors believe a lack of strength or of friends and family
stopped people from being able to do their food shopping.

GENEVA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Up to 106 Swiss athletes are to
compete in the 2000 Olympic Games to be held in Sydney in
September, the Swiss Olympic Association announced today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 105 athletes have been confirmed by the Swiss
Olympic Association, including 66 men and 39 women, although that
number could rise to 106.
</P>
<P>
The association has left the possibility open of including one

provided she finishes a half-marathon on September 3 within a time
of one hour, twelve minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, the list is the shortest since the 1988 Seoul Olympic
Games when 99 were selected to compete. At the Atlanta Olympics in
1996, Switzerland was represented by 119 athletes.
</P>
<P>
Missing from this year's line-up is the reigning Olympic road
cycling champion, Pascal Richard. As expected, the committee
confirmed the Swiss Cycling Federation's decision to omit the 36-
year-old rider from the five-man team heading for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Richard took victory in Atlanta in a three-man sprint, and
attracted plenty of attention when he later incorporated the
Olympic rings into the design of his jersey, after learning there
was no official jersey to designate the Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
Another notable absentee, also expected, is the world number
one tennis player, Martina Hingis. Hitting for Switzerland will be
the country's number two, Patty Schnyder, along with Emanuelle
Gagliardi and Miroslava Vavrinec.
</P>
<P>
Marc Rosset and Roger Federer are the two men's players. Rosset
won the gold at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
In percentage terms a record number of Swiss women will be
competing, making up 35 percent of the athletes represented.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Taking International Aid for Settling Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Wednesday denied a
report which quoted President Emile Lahoud as saying that an
international organization agreed to provide 20 billion U.S.
dollars for Lebanon to settle Palestinian refugees living on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
An Nahar newspaper Tuesday quoted Lahoud as saying "
international parties" would offered the money if Beirut abandoned
the long-standing policy of denying settlement of 360,000
registered Palestinian refugees whose homes had been occupied or
destroyed by Israel since 1948. But the newspaper did not name the
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"This (20 billion dollars) figure nears Lebanon's public debt,
which is an important factor of the pressures that are being
exerted on us," An Nahar quoted Lahoud as saying in an article
entitled "an informal discussion with President Lahoud".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the presidential palace said: "It was not an
interview. The president was misquoted. The report has no basis."
</P>
<P>
However, An Nahar, Lebanon's leading newspaper, stuck by its
report. Abdel Hadi Mahfouz, editor of the article, said Lahoud told
him that Lebanon was offered 20 billion dollars on the condition,
but he rejected it. However, the conversation was off-the-record,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Local bankers have expressed hope that Lebanon would accept the
compensation for settling the refugees and pay down the debt, which
is more than 140 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's 21 billion public debt has mostly accumulated since
1992 to pay for post-civil war reconstruction, a massive
bureaucracy, an army and security apparatus. The fiscal problem has
become more acute with debt service alone exceeding government
revenues in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3.5 million registered Palestinian refugees
scattered in the Middle East. Those in Lebanon are banned from most
jobs and deprived of civil rights.

<HEADLINE> Israel Tricks U.N. into Denying Border Grave Violation: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army has tricked the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) into denying the Jewish
state has annexed the Lebanese portion of a disputed holy grave on
the U.N.-drawn Blue Line in south Lebanon, Middle East Reporter
Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops Tuesday hurriedly folded their Star of David
flag, removed a barbed wire fence around the tomb and fled before a
UNIFIL verifying patrol arrived at the scene. However, they
returned shortly after the U.N. peacekeepers left, As Safir
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, meanwhile, has demanded the UNIFIL check on two new
Israeli violations of the Blue Line, threatening to lodge a formal
complaint with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and demand U.N.
action to stop the Israelis, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that Hezbollah guerrillas have prevented
UNIFIL troops from getting into the scene at the Sheikh Abbad grave
on Monday, UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel reportedly said "Hezbollah
officials have assured us that they are not blocking UNIFIL's
movements."
</P>
<P>
An Nahar newspaper reported Lebanese reporters and cameramen
near the grave had seen and filmed Israeli troops hurriedly taking
down the Star of David flag, removing the barbed wire fence they
had set up around the tomb on Sunday and speeding off in armored
personnel carriers with all their equipment into Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
Such a move was made minutes before the arrival of UNIFIL
officers escorted by a mechanized patrol of Finnish and Ghanaian
peacekeeping troops at 1 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One Ukrainian UNIFIL officer, identified as Yuri Sertok, told
reporters after inspecting the grave that "there is no Israeli
violation here."
</P>
<P>
When cameramen offered to give the officer their films to prove
that Israeli troops had fled with their gear just before the
patrol's arrival, Sertok said "since I do not see a violation by
naked eye, I will not be convinced that a violation existed."
</P>
<P>
When the UNIFIL unit left the scene, Israeli troops quickly
returned to the area, raising their flags again and fencing off the
grave with barbed wire anew, An Nahar paper said.
</P>
<P>
The disputed grave is located in the central sector of the
border on the Abbad Hill. The Israelis claim that Rabbi Ashi, a
renowned Jewish theologian who lived 500 years ago, is buried in
that grave. Muslims contend the tomb belongs to an Islamic cleric
called Sheikh Abdullah Abbad, whose name was given to the site for
the last five centuries.
</P>
<P>
When U.N. cartographers drew the Blue Line to verify the Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24, two thirds of the grave
fell inside Lebanese territory and one third remained in Israel.
Lebanon and Israel had given the U.N. their agreement to the split.
</P>
<P>
However, local residents Monday saw Israeli troops with
bulldozers crossing into the Abbad Hill, removing the Lebanese flag
from the grave and raising their own after fencing off the entire
site with barbed wire.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Continues Contacts with Parties to Advance Mideast Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is intensifying contacts with
the Palestinians, Israel and the United States in an effort to help
break the stalemate of the Middle East peace process, Egyptian
Ambassador to Israel Mohammad Bassiouni said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The intensive contacts are aimed at working out a Palestinian-
Israeli peace deal framework to be discussed at a possible new
summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, said Bassiouni, who was in Cairo to report to
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa the latest situation.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after meeting with Moussa that the concerned
parties have been trying to help narrow the gaps between the
Palestinians and Israelis so the two sides are able to prepare a
blueprint framework accord, which can help make any summit
successful.
</P>
<P>
A summit between Arafat and Barak at Camp David in the United
States failed to reach a final peace deal last month due to deep
disputes over the control of Jerusalem, which both sides have
claimed as their capital.
</P>
<P>
The goal of Egypt's continuing contacts with the Palestinians,
the Israelis, the U.S. and other parties is to reach a formula
agreed on by the Palestinians and Israelis regarding what was
achieved at Camp David, Bassiouni said.
</P>
<P>
He added the formula will take the form of a single working
paper, which will include what has been achieved and the ideas to
solve the problem of Jerusalem and narrow the standing gaps.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the possibility of finding a solution to
Jerusalem, the Egyptian diplomat said the solution is "simple,
because there are terms of reference for the negotiations" in
signed agreements and United Nations Security Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Suggest Suspension of Concorde's Flying Certificate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The French Bureau of Accident
Investigation (BEA) suggested on Wednesday a suspension of the
flying certificate for the Concorde supersonic aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The BEA, which is in charge of investigating the crash of the
Air France Concorde on July 25, said in a communique that its
investigators and those of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch
of Britain have recommended to the governments of the two
countries a suspension of the certificate for Concorde.
</P>
<P>
It said that a resumption of the flight will not be possible
until enough security measures are established for preventing the
explosion of tires on the undercarriage of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The BEA also said that the investigation has not ended yet and
it is premature to reach an early conclusion of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The explosion of a tire on the undercarriage is believed to be
the primary cause of the crash of the Concorde on July 25, in
which 113 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The British Civil Aviation Authority also announced on
Wednesday the suspension of the flying certificate for Concorde
until adequate security measures are taken.

"Stanley Prison exemplifies the principle that the object of
punishment must be to reform the individual and to make him a
responsible, useful citizen."

He said the rehabilitative process in Stanley Prison helped to
integrate the offenders into the main stream of society on release.
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely impressed by what I saw. I hope and wish that
this prison will continue to serve the social object of punishment,
" he said.

CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak

NEW DELHI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- India and Iran have set up a
joint committee to examine all aspects of gas supplies to India,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the committee will be held in Tehran from
August 18 to 20, an Indian foreign office spokesman was quoted as
saying to the local press.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the committee was taken during the visit

</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Indian side will be led by K V Rajan,
secretary in the External Affairs Ministry. The Iranian delegation

the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Iranian proposal to supply gas to India via
Pakistan, the spokesman said the committee was a "bilateral one"

richly endowed in energy resources and in India there was a
growing requirement for energy as part of the country's economic
growth, the PTI reported.

New Delhi has expressed strong reservations over the Iranian
proposal and questioned its viability on security and other
considerations, the PTI noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indian parliament
Wednesday passed a bill seeking to ban production and use of
chemical weapons, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported here.
</P>
<P>
The Chemical Weapons Convention Bill 2000 proposes to ban
development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer and
use of chemical weapons and use of riot control agents as a method
of warfare, and also seeks to provide penal provisions for non-
compliance, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, a national authority will also be set up
to serve as a focal point for effective liaison with the
Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and state
parties, it added.
</P>
<P>
After a discussion on the bill in the Lok Sabha, or the lower
house of the parliament, Indian Chemical and Fertilizers Minister
Suresh Prabhu told the legislators that the current government of
India was committed to maintaining the policies followed by
previous regimes with regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention
signed by India on January 14, 1993 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Prabhu also denied allegations of some opposition members in
the parliament that the passing of the bill was linked with Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's coming visit to the United
States in September and was an attempt by New Delhi to "appease"
Washington, the PTI added.

</P>
<P>
The British government is "doing their best," Andrea Dahmen
told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
She added that London will compensate the farmers for their
losses caused by destruction of the CSF-infected pigs, and the EU
will cover half of the compensation.
</P>
<P>
The CSF is a highly infectious viral disease of swine but poses
no risk to humans. The European Commission announced a temporary
ban on imports of live pigs and porcine semen from England
following the CSF outbreak in Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex in the
East Anglia region.
</P>
<P>
Similar restrictions were adopted in past outbreaks in several
other EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Among measures taken to curb the spread of the swine fever, the
commission said, the British authorities have established a three-
kilometer protection zone and a 10-kilometer surveillance zone
around the infected sources and monitored the live animals and
vehicles moving off the infected sources in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, only five new cases have so far been confirmed in
the East Anglia region, it added.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Standing Veterinary Committee will meet next Tuesday
to discuss the situation in Britain and decide whether to extend
or lift the EU ban on England's pig exports, which will expire on
August 31.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Seek More Reunions of Separated Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime Minister Lee
Han-dong Wednesday instructed the Unification Ministry to seek
more reunions of separated families caused by the division of the
Korean peninsula at the end of World War II and the 1950-53 Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
"The reunion of displaced family members is an issue on which
people pin their greatest expectations," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed more dispersed families should be reunited and the
procedures for reunions be simplified.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, 100 people from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) enjoyed family reunions with their South
Korean relatives in the Sheraton Walker Hill Hotel in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
United family members exchanged their stories of the past five
decades, posed for family photos together, and used camcorders to
record the entire process of their family reunions.
</P>
<P>
An 89-year-old South Korean mother, due to poor health, was
transported in an ambulance to the hotel for a tearful reunion
with his 66-year-old son, Ahn In-taeka.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chong-pil, a DPRK man who met his 99-year-old mother ailing
with Alzheimer's disease for 50 years, offered a rite for his
deceased father with things for the ritual service prepared by his
South Korean younger brother. Several other separated families
also held rites for deceased parents.
</P>
<P>
Choe Sang-won, a 66-year-old South Korean who was reunited with
his elder brother, said he brought about a family photo, a watch,
a ring and underwear as gifts for relatives from the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Kim Hong-rae, 67, brought with him ginseng tonic, vodka,
tobacco, liquor and photos from the DPRK as gifts for his younger
brothers and sister in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung shed tears when watching
the reunion parties on TV and he felt "a sense of reward for being
president," said presidential spokesman Park Joon-young Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is sorry he could not ease the pains of
the separated families sooner, said Park.
</P>
<P>
"We should use this opportunity to put all our energy together
to leap forward and prosper in the new age," said the spokesman
quoting the president.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Foreign Reserves Up to 90 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign reserves
rose to 90.42 billion U.S. dollars as of August 15, the Bank of
Korea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the rise to the fact that domestic
commercial banks returned their foreign currency loans they
borrowed from the central bank during the financial crisis in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, returns on the foreign currency-denominated assets
have edged down.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, South Korea's foreign holdings stood at four
billion dollars when the nation borrowed 58 billion dollars from
the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Government Demands Revision of Japan-U.S. Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Okinawa prefectural government
adopted a proposal Wednesday demanding revision of the Japan-U.S.
Status-of-Forces Agreement, which defines the legal status of U.S.
military forces in Japan, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The 11-point proposal, endorsed at a special meeting, includes
enforcing measures to counter environmental pollution within the U.
S. bases in the southernmost Japanese prefecture and revising the
criminal court procedures for U.S. military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawa prefectural government will submit the proposal to
the Japanese government and U.S. Embassy in Tokyo in late August,
Kyodo quoted prefectural government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposal urges U.S. forces to take responsibility in
restoring sites to their original state when environmental
pollution occurs within the bases and also to allow municipal
governments to conduct on-the-spot inspections at such time.
</P>
<P>
The current pact, signed in 1960, does not require U.S. forces
to restore polluted land to its original state when it is returned
to local landowners and bans municipal governments from inspecting
polluted sites within a base.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also demands that U.S. forces hand over personnel
who commit crimes in Japan to Japanese authorities even before
indictment, if requested by those authorities.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government says the current pact, which
stipulates that only those who have committed serious crimes will
be handed over to the Japanese authorities before being indicted,
is not sufficient as some suspects have fled from the base to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Calls for the revision of the pact by Okinawa people increased
after the September 1995 rape of a 12-year-old local schoolgirl by
three U.S. servicemen. The U.S. forces refused at that time to
hand over the servicemen in accordance with the pact to the
Okinawa prefectural police which had obtained arrest warrants.
</P>
<P>
The pact was later revised to allow those who have committed
serious crimes to be handed over to the Japanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, the definition of the term "serious crimes" remains
vague. In 1998, the U.S. forces' refusal to hand over a suspect in
a traffic accident which killed a Okinawa female high school
student once again ignited anger among local people.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, where U.S. bases are located, accounts for 0.6 percent
of Japan's total land area, but is home to some 75 percent of land
occupied by U.S. military facilities in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Economic Development Vital to Protection of Tibetan Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A Tibetan Buddhism senior
religious leader today criticized those people who have tried to
prevent economic development in Tibet by using the excuses of "
preserving national characteristics" and "protecting religious
culture."
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan cultural heritage can only be better preserved and
the freedom of religious belief be better protected through
developing the economy and improving people's life in the region,"
said Jamyang Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, vice-president of
the China Buddhist Association. "If not so, Tibetan culture and
traditional religion will become `items on display' and soon go
into decline."
</P>
<P>
Jamyang, a living Buddha from the Labrang Temple of Tibetan
Buddhism in northwest China's Gansu Province, made the remarks at
a symposium on world peace attended by people from different
Chinese religious circles in Beijing today. He will go on to
attend the United Nations' millennium conference on world peace as
a member of the Chinese religious leaders' delegation in New York
at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
He said since the 1950s, especially after the implementation of
reform and opening-up policy in the 1980s, the economy has been
developing rapidly in Tibet and the religious beliefs of Tibetan
people have been fully protected.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Chinese government has started the development
program for western regions, and will invest a lot of money to
improve the basis for sustainable economic development, Jamyang
said. This will further improve the living conditions of Tibetan
people and create a better environment for inheriting, protecting
and developing Tibetan religious and cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that empty talks on inheriting, protecting and
developing national cultural heritage and religious culture
without the basis of economic development can never last long. He
said it can not be tolerated for some people in foreign countries
to spread the rumor of "Tibetan cultural traditions being
seriously damaged."
</P>
<P>
Jamyang said that the protection and development of the
national culture in Tibet can only be achieved through catching up
with the progress of modern civilization and promoting local
economic development and improving people's life.

CHENGDU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people lined up in
front of an exhibition building in north suburban Chengdu, capital
of southwest China's Sichuan Province, today to see three Chinese
national treasures which were returned to China after being kept
overseas for more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The antiques are the bronze heads of ox, tiger and monkey,
three of the 12 animal sculptures in a water clock designed for
the Yuanmingyuan Palace in Beijing, which was described as one of
the most splendid gardens in the world.
</P>
<P>
They were looted by British and French troops when they invaded
Beijing in 1860, and were recovered at an auction fair in Hong
Kong in May when the Poly Group Corporation of China bought them
for more than 33.17 million Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three pieces of treasures attracted more than 100,000
visitors in Hong Kong and the same number of people in Beijing and
Shanghai when they were on display there.

More than 10,000 visitors went to the Chengdu exhibition in the

KHARTOUM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations resumed its
relief aid flights to southern Sudan on Wednesday, after assurances
of safety were made by Sudanese government, diplomatic sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Two planes took off early Wednesday for both government and
rebel-controlled areas in southern Sudan to drop food to the hungry
people there, thus ending an eight-day suspension of such flights.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. relief flights, carried out by Operation Lifeline Sudan
(OLS), were suspended on August 8 upon accusations of government
bombings of civilian targets. Khartoum denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sudanese government accused relief agencies
working in the south of aiding the rebel group Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), fighting for autonomy since 1983.
</P>
<P>
A special envoy of U.N. secretary general will arrive in
Khartoum on Saturday to discuss the matter with Sudanese officials.
The SPLA wants a separation of the largely Christian and animist
south from the predominantly Muslim north.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2 million people have lost their lives in the civil war
and consecutive famines in the war-torn areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Cambodia
signed here Wednesday five agreements aimed at strengthening
diplomatic and economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada and visiting Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen witnessed the signing of the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hun Sen was accorded full military honors upon his
arrival at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Later, the two leaders held an expanded bilateral meeting
during which they discussed bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said one
of the pacts signed is the agreement on the promotion and
protection of investments by both countries.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Mar Roxas II of the Department of Trade and Industry
said the agreement is expected to increase commercial exchange
between Manila and Phnom Penh, which reached only 3 billion U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
This figure, Roxas said, is relatively small considering that
Cambodia has at least 10 million people while the Philippines has
a population of over 75 million.
</P>
<P>
The other four agreements signed include those on tourism

<P>
HANOI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and international donors
signed agreements, programs and projects using official
development assistance (ODA) sources to the value of 1.264 billion
U.S. dollars in the first seven months of this year, Vietnam News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, the value of projects signed with the Japanese

<P>
In the period under review, Vietnam disbursed more than one
billion U.S. dollars, a year-on-year increase of 15 percent. Of
this sum, 85 percent was loans and the remainder, non-refundable
aid.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to disburse 1.68 billion U.S. dollars this year,
about 330 million U.S. dollars more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Since Vietnam resumed credit relations with international
donors in 1993, donors have pledged to provide a total ODA sum of

<HEADLINE> WFP Close Down Women Bakery Project After Taliban Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
closed down its women bakery project in Afghan capital of Kabul
after the ruling Taliban barred women from working in U.N.
affiliated organizations and NGOs, a WFP spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have closed down 25 bakeries being operated by women while
the remaining general bakeries will remain working," Khaled
Mansoor, the WFP spokesman was quoted by the News Network
International, a local news agency, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taliban last month barred women from working in the U.N.
affiliated organizations and NGOs in Afghanistan. The order led to
the arrest of a U.S. aid worker along with seven local women in
Kabul. The American woman was later expelled from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We were told that we can not continue to support these
bakeries being run by women," Mansoor said. "We have no option but
close them down."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the closure will affect 43,000 women and
children since 7,200 families were getting flour from these 25
bakeries.

<HEADLINE> Somalia's Transitional Parliament to Elect Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Djibouti, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The transitional parliament of
Somalia, inaugurated here Sunday, is due to elect its speaker in
the coming two or three days.
</P>
<P>
"We are to start the process for the election of speaker
tomorrow," Mohamed Abshir Muse, interim speaker of the 245-strong
transitional parliament, told Xinhua here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti President Ismael Omar Guelleh and United Nations envoy
David Stephen attended the opening of the transitional national
assembly, the first since president Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will also elect state president who will be
authorized to appoint future prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The designated premier will select members of the cabinet, and
then submit the list to the parliament for approval, Muse said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 people representing four major clans and many
minority groups in Somalia have been holding the Somali Peace
Conference since May 2 in Arta, some 45 kilometers from the
capital of Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the Djibouti government, was aimed
at establishing a central government to end a decade of anarchy.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the meeting, including some of so-called
warlords, came from Africa, Europe, America and other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
"We have invited all the warlords in Somalia to attend the
meeting, including Hussein Mohamed Aidid, But Aidid rejected our
invitation." Muse said.
</P>
<P>
According to Muse, former Somali president Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
and Hassan Nour, chief of the Rahanwyn Resistance Army (RRA),
attended the meeting and were elected members of the transitional
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the participants are satisfied with the process of the
conference so far," Muse said, noting that 99 percent of the
participants are here to vote for the restoration of national
reconciliation and peace.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Sunken Submarine in Critical Situation EDS-Adds details on no sign of life; oxygen availability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Frantic efforts continued
Wednesday to evacuate the 116 crew from Russia's sunken nuclear
submarine at the bottom of the Barents Sea as President Vladimir
Putin describing the situation as "critical."
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk" went down over the weekend during a
naval exercise of the Northern Fleet. There is no sign of life
aboard the submarine, Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
However, Klebanov told reporters that "it is too early to
conclude that something terrible has happened," the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Both Putin and Klebanov are in the Black Sea resort of Sochi
on vacation.
</P>
<P>
The crew could be lying low to conserve oxygen and body energy.
They had earlier maintained acoustic contact with the rescuers by
tapping Morse codes.
</P>
<P>
In other Interfax reports, an officer in the Northern Fleet
headquarters said the crew has not sent any audio signals since
Tuesday and the signals had been weak and far apart on the
preceding day.
</P>
<P>
The signals may be hard to discern because of the stormy
conditions in the area, but "bad events" may be a more likely
explanation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin praised the rescue efforts, saying that "whatever can be
done is being done" to save the submariners.
</P>
<P>
"When it became clear that the sub was in trouble, every
necessary step was taken... Not a minute was wasted," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the grim description given by Putin, Yury
Yevdokimov, the governor of the northern Murmansk region, said the
critical moment for the "Kursk" would be August 23-25.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Kuroyedov, the Russian Navy commander, said British
Royal Navy experts and their wherewithal would be used to rescue
the "Kursk" crew. Moscow had earlier refrained from asking for
outside help.
</P>
<P>
Britain has airlifted about 40 tons of submarine and equipment
to Trondheim by a Russian Ruslan An-124-100 cargo plane Wednesday
afternoon, Interfax reported, quoting the press service of the
Volga-Dnepr air company that performed the mission.
</P>
<P>
12 British divers have also arrived in Trondheim.
</P>
<P>
Kuroyedov, the Russian Navy commander, expressed the hope that
"Kursk" crewmembers are still alive and "struggling to stay alive.
"
</P>
<P>
"There should be enough oxygen on board until August 25" and
attempts to save the crew will continue until that time, the
commander said.
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions worsened Wednesday afternoon at the site of
the accident and one of the rescue apparatuses was nearly lost,
Interfax reported, quoting Navy spokesman Igor Kygalo.
</P>
<P>
Kygalo said Russia was "by no means" rejecting foreign help.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that it is impossible to start using other
countries' rescue means without calculating the effectiveness of
their use, without calculating the compatibility of their
technical parameters with those of our rescue units and battle
ships," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
There is still no final word on the cause of the accident, but
a former Russian Navy commander said the submarine could have
collided with a surface vessel on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Kursk" could have collided with a dry-cargo ship or an
icebreaker, ex-commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral Eduard
Baltin said.
</P>
<P>
Baltin had once served as the commander of the Northern
Fleet's 41st division of Project 667 missile carrying submarines
and is well acquainted with this area, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military started the third attempt Wednesday
morning to evacuate the 116 crew from the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The previous two attempts overnight failed due to poor
visibility and strong underwater currents, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy is pondering plans to lift the submarine
to shallow waters in order to improve visibility.
</P>
<P>
A press officer of the Northern Fleet said attempts would be
made in the next few hours to raise the sub from the bottom by
pneumatic pontoons and move it from 100 meters under water to
about 30-50 meters, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia has 22 ships on the surface involved in the rescue bid.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days, Interfax reported earlier.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Oil Smuggling Firm Penalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo, a major port in east
China's Zhejiang Province, has penalized a Singaporean oil company
for smuggling, after five years of lawsuits against the firm.
</P>
<P>
The company was found guilty of smuggling oil worth 90 million
yuan (about 10.8 million U.S. dollars) in 1995. It is the largest
oil smuggling case in the coastal province and China.
</P>
<P>
The Ningbo Intermediate People's Court recently confiscated a
vessel and ordered a public auction of a building, both owned by
the company. The vessel "Prim," was confiscated as a fine, while
the Huaning Building, located in downtown of Ningbo, was sold for
more than 70 million yuan at the auction.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, several persons in connection with the case have been
fined or given prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling case was discovered in September 1995 on an
island in Zhejiang. After that, company staff members abandoned
two buildings still under construction in Ningbo and fled.
</P>
<P>
The court said the company smuggled thousands of tons of oil
and naphtha, in the name of "processing materials supplied by
clients," a means of doing foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Streses Better Protection of Cultural Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG (GANSU), August 16 (Xinhua) -- Fan Jinshi, a noted
Chinese expert on Dunhuang studies, said today that the country
should make greater efforts to protect its cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Fan, also president of the Dunhuang Academy, suggested that
laws should be implemented to help protect cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years more and more modern buildings and
commercial areas have been built around scenic spots, which has
had a negative effect on cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Fan's academy is in charge of the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes,
considered the greatest repository of Buddhist art in the world.
They were listed as a World Heritage Site by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The grottoes contain more than 50,000 relics including Buddhist
Sutras, documents, exquisite frescoes, dating back to the 4th
century.
</P>
<P>
"The cultural relics of Dunhuang, especially that of the Mogao
Grottoes, are not only the treasures of the Chinese nation, but
are treasures that belong to the whole world," Fan said.
</P>
<P>
"Only by strictly protecting our cultural relics, can we leave
them intact for future generations," the scholar stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG (GANSU), August 16 (Xinhua) -- China is applying
modern digital technologies to preserve its ancient arts in the
Dunhuang Grottoes in northwest province of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
By utilizing advanced digital cameras and computers, Chinese
experts have developed a system particularly devoted to preserving
these priceless cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The images processed by the system are not only identical to
the originals in size, but also are superior to the original ones
in color and resolution, said Doctor Wang Xudong, an expert from
the Dunhuang Research Academy.
</P>
<P>
The system, which took two years to develop with a funding of
two million yuan from the Chinese government, will greatly
facilitate the preservation and researches of Dunhuang arts, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the frescoes and sculptures in four of the Mogao
caves are stored on computers for posterity.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 488 caves of the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes and 42
caves in the Yulin Grottoes will be"digitalized" later.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang, popularly known as the Thousand
Buddha Caves, were carved out of the rocks stretching for about 1,
600 meters along the eastern side of the Mingsha Hill, 25 km
southeast of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
The first cave in the Mogao Grottoes was cut in 366 A.D.
Despite erosion and human destruction, the 492 caves are well
preserved, with frescoes covering an area of 45,000 square meters,
more than 2,000 colored sculptured figures and five wooden eaves
overhanging the caves.
</P>
<P>
As the greatest repository of Buddhist art in the world,
Dunhuang Grottoes was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1987 by
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religious Leaders Call for Cracking Down on Cults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of major religions in
China today denounced Falun Gong for stealing Buddhist and papist
phrases to spread its fallacies and defame these religions, and
urged the authorities to crack down on this cult and others.
</P>
<P>
Seven religious leaders of five lawful beliefs in the country,
namely Buddhism, Taoism, Islamism, Catholicism and Christianity,
gathered today to attend a symposium of the Chinese religious
circles on the issue of world peace.
</P>
<P>
These leaders are members of the Chinese delegation to the
forthcoming United Nations' millennium conference on world peace
attended by religious and spiritual leaders.
</P>
<P>
Master Shenghui, a vice-chairman of the Buddhist Association of
China, said the Falun Gong cult is by nature against science,
mankind, the government, society, world peace and the fortunes of
human beings.
</P>
<P>
He said since Falun Gong has caused many deaths in China, Li
Hongzhi, the cult leader, has committed severe crimes. Chinese
Buddhists are in opposition to Falun Gong and its practices, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The whole world should firmly oppose cults like what has been
done by the Chinese government against Falun Gong. The cult leader
is being sought by Chinese police, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the cult members are trying to attend the coming
UN conference. "All religions in the world are against cults, and
the conference will be tarred if these cult members are allowed to
attend," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu Tieshan, chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, complained that while the world is celebrating the
millennium, many cults have arrived. Some of them just make money
by cheating the masses under the cloak of religions.
</P>
<P>
All religious people must be on their guard against these cults,
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at today's symposium were Jamyang Losang Jigme
Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, a vice-chairman of the Buddhist Association
of China, Han Wenzao, chairman of the China Christian Council, Min
Zhiting, chairman of the China Daoist Association, Chen Guangyuan,
chairman of the Islamic Association of China, and Cao Shengjie, a

KUALA LUMPUR, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Singapore Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew expressed here Wednesday his optimism over
Asia's long-term growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
"My view of Asia's long-term growth prospects is based on the
way their societies are organized, their histories and cultures,
and their openness to technology," he said at a lecture organized
here by the Institute of Strategic and International Studies of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that before East Asia's financial crisis, it was
conventional wisdom that East Asia would become an industrialized
and advanced belt of nations by the middle of the 21st century and
after the crisis, the new wisdom is that the region's
administrative and economic structures are too weak to justify
such optimism.
</P>
<P>
"However, none of the basic factors that made for East Asia's
spectacular growth rates in the last four decades have changed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the economies of Northeast and Southeast Asia are
complementary and are integrating as trade and investments have
increased, especially in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
After the recent summit between the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea and South Korea heralding the prospect of
stability and high growth opportunities for both countries,
Northeast Asia is "in a much better position, with greater
prospects of investments and growth in the 21st century," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"China in WTO will become a driving force in the growth of the
region. This will benefit Northeast more than Southeast Asia
because their trade and investment levels are three to five times
larger. China's economy has been growing by an average of 9.6
percent per annum since it opened up in 1978," he said.
</P>
<P>
Northeast Asia is also ahead in the new economy, he said,
adding that the Chinese in China are capable of exploiting the
digital revolution and in the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, Malaysia and Singapore are best prepared for the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that if China is not deflected from its present
concentration on education and economic development, it could by
2050 well be the second largest trading nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that East Asians now know that given the time
and the opportunity to engage in trade, investments and technology
transfers, they too can industrialize and catch up with the west.
</P>
<P>
However, the Singapore senior minister acknowledged that there
are many pitfalls along the way that can upset this expectation of
stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
Lee arrived here Monday for a four-day working visit to
Malaysia,aimed at enhancing Singapore-Malaysia bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> China To Launch First Ocean Color Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to start its
first ocean color satellite next year to promote its oceanic
survey, according to senior Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the State Oceanic Administration,
"China will launch its own ocean color satellite in 2001."
</P>
<P>
As one of the most advanced technology in oceanic research,
ocean color satellite is used to survey primary productivity of
ocean and offshore sands by observing optical features of the
ocean's waters, said Su Jilan, a scholar at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences and vice chairman of the Chinese Society of
Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
Over the past twenty years, China's remote oceanic sensing
technologies have been improved as new and high technologies, such
as remote sensing, biological and information technologies, have
been widely used in the oceanic research, experts said.
</P>
<P>
China has established a three dimensional observation system,
which can carry out scientific surveys from outer space down to 6,
000 meters below sea level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has tens of thousands of
technological employees working with more than 300 oceanic
research and educational institutes nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Dongtan Mudflat Applies for World's Important Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- An application has been
submitted recently to make a patch of mudflat at the estuary of
the Yangtze River one of the world's most important wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 326 square kilometers, the Dongtan Mudflat,
on Shanghai's Chongming Island, the country's third largest island,
is a natural reserve for birds.
</P>
<P>
Dongtan Mudflat is the largest wetland at the estuary of the
Yangtze River and still maintains its natural condition, untouched
by man.
</P>
<P>
Natural conditions have made the Dongtan Mudflat a paradise for
birds. It is at the middle point of the migration route of migrant
birds in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, mild climate in the
region has enabled trees and grasses to grow luxuriantly, which in
turn provides bountiful food for migrant birds.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Dongtan Mudflat is home to a total of nearly 3
million birds of 108 species, many of which are key animals under
the country's protection.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are pleased to find that due to the tidal force and
the accumulation of silt brought on by the Yangtze River, the
Dongtan Mudflat has expanded in the area continuously.
</P>
<P>
Correspondingly, interesting changes have taken place to the
birds, animals and vegetation on the island, making the mudflat a
valuable venue for biological study.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has seven natural reserves listed as the world's
important wetlands, including the Zhalong reserve in Heilongjiang
province and Xianghai reserve in Jilin province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China's export had reached 136
billion U.S. dollars from January to July, an increase of 35.8
percent over the same period last year, according to statistics
released by China's General Administration of Customs today.

</P>
<P>
China's trade surplus was 14.4 billion U.S. dollars from
January to July.
</P>
<P>
The increase in China's exports in July slowed down mainly due
to a sharp increase of China's export from July last year, a local
analyst said, predicting that the growth of China's exports in the
coming months will continue to slide.
</P>

U.S. dollars worth of goods from China, up 29 percent. Hong Kong
follows second, buying 24.64 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods
from the mainland, up 31.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the third largest importer of Chinese goods. It bought
22.06 billion U.S. dollars of Chinese goods, up 33.3 percent, and
the European Union bought 21.33 billion U.S. dollars of Chinese

Russia 73.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the increase of exports to all of China's top 10
partners was because of a lower benchmark in the same period last
year. In the months to come, the increase may slow down a little
bit as the benchmark rose since July last year.

<HEADLINE> China Among Best in Restoring Ancient Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese skills in restoring
ancient books are ranked among the best in the world, experts said
today.
</P>
<P>
"If China is not the best in restoring ancient books, it should
be among the best in the world," said Du Weisheng.
</P>
<P>
Du made the remarks at an exhibition of ancient literature from
the Dunhuang grottos at the China National Library in Beijing to
mark the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the Sutras Cave in
the grottos.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 Buddhist scriptures and historical documents are on
display at the library, which has over 16,000 Dunhuang documents,
the largest collection in the world.
</P>
<P>
Some of the scriptures and documents were restored to their
original form by Du, who has helped the United Kingdom, France and
Germany restore ancient books.
</P>
<P>
Through years of experiment, Chinese experts have developed a
unique technique in restoring these treasured documents and books.
</P>
<P>
The paper used is noteworthy. Chinese craftsman choose paper
according to the texture of the originals while their foreign
counterparts use a kind of paper produced in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Produced by hand, the paper we use in China is generally
superior to the paper produced in Japan and has a peculiar texture
the Japanese paper does not," Du said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese also use a kind of paste where their foreign
counterparts generally use glue when mending an ancient book,
which, according to Du, will hardening the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paste's consistency varies according to the thickness and
rigidity of the paper when a Chinese expert restore an ancient
book. "It is a skill learnt from years of experience rather than
from books," Du said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts to Adopt Chief Justice System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court
announced here today that Chinese courts at all levels will adopt
the chief justice system to give a bigger and, mostly, decisive
say to chief justices.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today, the supreme court issued the "
Methods on Selection of Chief Justice by People's Court (Trial)".
</P>
<P>
The document requires chief justices to be politically correct,
have a higher education, and being professionally experienced and
able.
</P>
<P>
Courts at all levels should inspect these chief justices every
year and those who are found to violate laws or disciplinary
regulations will be removed from their posts. Chief justices who
have been caught mishandling cases will be not only dismissed but
also punished according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the briefing, Jiang Xingchang, a vice president of
the supreme court, said the setting-up of the chief justice system,
a major part of the ongoing restructuring of the country's court
system, is expected to be completed by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Reforms are aimed at improving efficiency and allowing chief
justices to fulfill their duties, Jiang said, noting that under
the existing system, a chief justice has to consult court leaders
before making final decisions on a case, regardless of whether it
is a simple or complicated case.
</P>
<P>
Reforms will promote building democracy and legal system in
China, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Once the system is set up nationwide, all the chief justices
will be able to practice their independent powers and undertake
their duties in accordance with the law, Jiang emphasized.

use of digital certificates, the government can address the issues
of authentication, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation
in electronic transactions and is assured of a secure and trusted
environment of e-commerce, Yau said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to encourage more extensive IT adoption, the HKSAR
government will take the lead by implementing the electronic
service delivery scheme in October this year, to provide an open
and common information infrastructure for the public to obtain
government services on-line, she said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will also serve to induce e-commerce development in
the private sector by allowing commercial services provision
through the government IT infrastructure, Yau added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the government also provides computer, Internet
and electronic mail services at community halls, post offices and
libraries for use by the public free of charge.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, the Information Technology and
Broadcasting Bureau will join the Information Technology Services
Department and Home Affairs Department to organize IT courses in
the community to promote public interest in IT, Yau said.
</P>
<P>
Yau also described the ongoing InfoTech Forum 2000 as a good
chance for the promotion of the public's IT awareness.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Wisers InfoTech Forum 2000 was inaugurated here
Wednesday to draw about 100 leading information experts from major
media of China's mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao to discuss
IT development and opportunities and challenges brought about by
the information age.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Government Intensifies Anti-Smoking Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government plans to
intensify its anti-smoking campaign with the aim of reducing
tobacco supply and demand and the incidence of smoking-related
diseases and deaths, Vietnam News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A resolution on national policies to prevent smoking-related
illness for the 2001-2010 period, issued by Vietnamese Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai recently, stipulates policies to reduce
tobacco product use and supply, expand international cooperation
and ensure enforcement of national policies and programs in the
fight against cigarette harm.
</P>
<P>
The targets of the national policies are to lower the number of
male smokers to 20 percent from 50 percent, female smokers to
under 2 percent and smokers in the 15-24 age bracket from 26
percent to 7 percent to ensure the right of non-smokers to a smoke-
free environment and lessen the damage caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey in 1997, 50 percent of men and 3.4
percent of women in the country smoke.
</P>
<P>
Besides the negative health impacts, smoking causes great
economic losses to families and the society.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry's remittances to Vietnam's state budget
represent only one-third of the sum spent on smoking (about 6,000
billion Vietnamese dong or 428.57 million U.S. dollars), according
to the government.

<HEADLINE> Australia Downgrades Warning to Australians in Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia Wednesday downgraded
a warning on safety to Australians in Fiji, saying the security
situation in the Pacific nation has improved since the arrest of
coup leader George Speight.
</P>
<P>
But the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade cautioned that
the situation in Fiji remained uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"Australians in Fiji should maintain a very high level of
personal security awareness and monitor developments that might
affect their safety," the department's travel advice said.
</P>
<P>
It advised Australians to avoid travel to the island of Vanua
Levu and to take advice from local authorities before visiting
rural areas of Viti Levu, where incidents of lawlessness continue.
</P>
<P>
It said the capital, Suva, remains calm following the
appearance in court of Speight and some of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, "There remains the possibility of civil
disorder as a result of further proceedings against George Speight
and his group."
</P>
<P>
"Australians are advised to stay clear of any public gatherings
associated with these proceedings," the advice added.
</P>
<P>
The advice was last updated on August 7.

<HEADLINE> Russian Sub Could Have Collided With Surface Vessel, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A former Navy commander said
Wednesday that the Russian nuclear submarine crippled at the
bottom of the Barents Sea may have collided with a surface vessel
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Multipurpose "Kursk" could have collided with a dry-cargo ship
or an icebreaker, ex-commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral
Eduard Baltin said.
</P>
<P>
Baltin had once served as the commander of the Northern Fleet's
41st division of Project 667 missile carrying submarines and is
well acquainted with this area, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Baltin said that the Kursk submarine must have been rising to a
periscopic level at between 11:30 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. Moscow time
(0700 and 0745 GMT) on Saturday.  Judging by the damage caused
to the bow, the submarine had a classical deck differential of not
more than 3 degrees. In such shallow waters, the submarine's hydro-
acoustic system does not work effectively, Baltin said.
</P>
<P>
"The Kursk is an ocean submarine, whose systems function
perfectly at great depths. But at a depth of 100 meters, the
submarine's hydro-acoustic system may have failed to spot an
approaching surface ship," Baltin added.
</P>
<P>
The former commander said that during his service in the
Northern Fleet, he did not allow submarines to submerge in shallow
waters.
</P>
<P>
He said all crew members that were in the first and second
compartments must have died following the collision and that the
surviving crew must be going through a critical period in absolute
darkness.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military started the third attempt Wednesday
morning to evacuate the 116 crew from the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The previous two attempts overnight failed due to poor
visibility and strong underwater currents, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy is pondering plans to lift the submarine to
shallow waters in order to improve visibility.
</P>
<P>
A press officer of the Northern Fleet said attempts would be
made in the next few hours to raise the sub from the bottom by
pneumatic pontoons and move it from 100 meters under water to
about 30-50 meters, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
With the crew thought to have just 48 hours of oxygen left,
Russian navy officials were due to meet their NATO counterparts in
Brussels on Wednesday to consider accepting western help.
</P>
<P>
Russia has 22 ships on the surface involved in the rescue bid
and has so far not accepted offers of help from Britain or the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Kursk went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea while
attending a routine exercise of the Russian Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days, Interfax reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Kuroyedov, the Russian Navy commander, told reporters
Wednesday that hope for saving the crew of "Kursk" would remain
until Friday, August 18.
</P>
<P>
Initial examination revealed that the submarine's deckhouse is
damaged and the shield of the fairing of the two missile silos on
the right-side deck was ripped off, Kuroyedov said.
</P>
<P>
"The submarine lies aground with a raised periscope. The causes
of the accident will become clear following a detailed examination
of the entire submarine body," the commander said.

<HEADLINE> French Press Questions Future of Concorde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The French press Wednesday
expressed their pessimism about the future of the Concorde
supersonic aircraft after the British Airways suspended the flight
of such planes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberation published a story with the title "
Concorde Bye Bye" saying that the suspension of Concorde by both
British Airways and Air France is "euthanasia" for the plane.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said in its title of the Concorde story
that "Will Concorde ever fly again ?" and the daily Le Parisien
said that the suspension of Concorde by British Airways "can
signal the end of the supersonic."
</P>
<P>
The daily L'Humanite said in its title: "Concorde nailed down
at the end of the runway."
</P>
<P>
British Airways Wednesday suspended the flying certificate of
Concorde, three weeks after the crash of the Air France Concorde
near Paris on July 25.

<HEADLINE> French Minister says Concorde Still Has Seven or Eight Years Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- French Transport Minister Jean-
Claude Gayssot said Wednesday that the Concorde supersonic
aircraft still has "seven or eight years ahead of it."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Liberation, Gayssot said that he
is not pessimist about a resumption of the flight of Concorde but
the plane's security should be first of all guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"Concorde still has its capacities, but we should readjust it
to the right state," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disputed the comment by the French press that the
suspension of the flight of Concorde by the British Airways means
the end of the plane.
</P>
<P>
"Basically I do not agree that it is the end of Concorde," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The British Airways suspended the flight of Concorde on Tuesday
and its flying certificate on Wednesday, three weeks after the
crash of the Air France Concorde which killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
Air France has suspended the flight of Concorde since the crash
on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The French Bureau of Accident Investigation will submit a
report to the minister on August 25 or 26 to propose extra
security measures for the plane.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French and British officials and experts will meet
on Thursday in London to decide the withdrawal of the flying
certificate for Concorde.

<HEADLINE> HK Union Bank Gains Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) said today that the Hong Kong Union Bank,
which ICBC acquired in April, has turned losses into profits,
gaining 84 million HK dollars in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for ICBC said that after the acquisition, ICBC
adopted measures to support the development of Union Bank. The
latter's businesses and major financial indices have been largely
improved.
</P>
<P>
The Union Bank was founded in 1964 in Hong Kong and was listed
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1973. By the end of 1999, it
had total assets of 21.4 billion HK dollars, with 22 local
branches and one overseas branch.
</P>
<P>
ICBC signed a contract with China Merchants (Holdings) Ltd.,
the Union Bank's controlling shareholder, on April 19 in Hong Kong
on the acquisition of a controlling stake in the Union Bank. The
deal was clinched on July 14. ICBC paid 1.804 billion HK dollars
to buy some 240 million shares of the Union Bank at a price of 7.
52 HK dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said ICBC will continue to support the Union Bank
's capital financing and handling of non-performing assets.

<HEADLINE> China's Fund Market Down on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China's securities investment
fund market changed its recent corrective attempts and fell across
the board as investors were reluctant to delay profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
However, the downside potential was rather limited as it is
almost certain that buying interest will be attracted to the 22
discounted funds to take advantage of their low prices, according
to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities
advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Also there is a fundamental support for the fund market as some
insurance companies are allowed to raise their investment
proportions in securities funds.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Antai Insurance Co., with its background related to
some foreign parties, recently got the green light from the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to increase their
securities fund investment ratio from 5 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other applicants are still waiting for CSRC's permission.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants to Host New Three-Way Summit: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Administration intends to
host another three-way summit in order to clinch a final peace
agreement between Palestinians and Israel, a senior Palestinian
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, minister of planning and international cooperation
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), said Washington has
informed the PNA of its intention to hold the summit, according to
the El Ayam newspaper here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the U.S. officials have not decided the time or
the venue of the summit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli and Palestinian Chief Negotiators to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami will meet with Palestinian Legislative Council
Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) Wednesday night at an undisclosed
location, Israeli Foreign Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials refused to reveal the exact agenda of the meeting,
only said that Ben-Ami, a dovish politician who succeeded former
Foreign Minister David Levy last Thursday, will also meet
Palestinian Gaza Preventive Security Service Chief Mohammed Dahlan
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami and Qurei have been acting as chief negotiators on the
final-status issues since the so-called back-channel talks in
Stockholm in May, which laid the foundation for last month's ill-
fated Camp David summit attended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting will be the first meeting between the two
chief negotiators since the Camp David talks that foundered over
the status of Jerusalem. Both Israel and the Palestinians want the
holy city as their capital.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Jerusalem predicted that the meeting may prepare for
a second three-way summit ahead of the September 13 deadline set by
Israel and the Palestinians for a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ben-Ami told his Labor party colleagues that a
second trilateral summit meeting is possible next month.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, who just returned form visits to a series of countries
to explain Israeli position in the peace talks, said to ensure the
success of another summit, the two sides should reach a "
preagreement," clarifying their positions at first.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday evening, Barak told Gondoleeza Rice, senior aide of U.S.
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, that he hopes the
Palestinians will show more flexibility and openness in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Time is very short and we are at a very sensitive stage and
based on this I hope that logic will win," Barak emphasized.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and left-wing Meretz leader
Yossi Sarid failed to reach an agreement on terms for Meretz's
return to the government. They agreed to meet again in a couple of
days.
</P>
<P>
During this period, Barak reportedly plans to gauge the chances
of getting the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party back into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meretz ministers resigned their cabinet posts in June in an
effort to help Barak keep Shas in the coalition, but Shas ministers
eventually quit as well, citing differences with the prime
minister's peace policies.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government wants to cut the water quota for
agricultural use by 50 percent in 2001, following an already steep
cut of 40 percent this year, according to an agreement reached by
related authorities.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Agriculture Ministry estimated that the
loss of income and direct losses from dried-up orchards, hothouses
and fields would total 2 billion Shekels (about 500 million U.S.
dollars). Some 10,000 agricultural workers will lose their jobs
under a 50 percent cut.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 3 billion shekels (about 750
million dollars) to develop new water resources. However, even if
the investment proves fruitful, it will take five years before
results are seen.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Tel Aviv police in Israel are investigating whether the
deaths of four women on Tuesday in a brothel fire was part of a
recent series of fires in sex shops and brothels.
</P>
<P>
The torching of a south Tel Aviv apartment that functioned as a
brothel killed the four women who lived and worked there early
Tuesday morning. The victims have not yet been identified.
</P>
<P>
Acting Interior Minister Haim Ramon has appointed a three-member
committee to investigate the cause of the fire, the firefighters'
response to it, and coordination between firefighters and other
emergency services at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami believes that
a second trilateral summit meeting between Israel, the Palestinian
National Authority and the United States will be possible next
month, but should only be held after careful preparation that will
ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami Tuesday night briefed Barak and senior negotiator
attorney Gilad Sher on the results of his trip to a series of
countries to explain the Israeli position on the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Asks People to Rebuild Democratic Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Wednesday urged the Indonesian people to rebuild their
democratic values and nationalist spirit inherited from the
republic's founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a plenary session of the House of Representatives
ahead of the 55th anniversary of the country's independence day
which falls on August 17, Wahid noted that democracy and
nationalism are a process and they are not born and formed
naturally.
</P>
<P>
the founding fathers of this republic agreed to lay the
foundation for the Indonesian nationalistic bonds based on common
destiny and ideals, he said, noting that they strongly opposed
attempts to colonize Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Wahid warned against justifying violence in the name of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Should we in the name of democracy -- consciously or
unconsciously -- agree to give a nod to let violent acts occur in
the society, to use hatred and vengeance as an instrument to
sideline political opponents, or, to exploit the previous
government's mistakes and loopholes as a pretext to justify
separatist movements, it could be assured that the true meaning of
democracy as a rational process to deal with the prevailing
conflicts would be difficult to materialize," stressed the
president.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the efforts to redefine, reorient and
reproduce national and democratic values are indeed urgently
needed.
</P>
<P>
He also said he interpreted the proclamation of independence
itself as the pinnacle of the Indonesian people's agreement to
embody its common life through the formation of a nation-state,
which is free, sovereign and democratic.
</P>
<P>
"This republic belongs to all Indonesian people," he declared.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Urges Policy Continuity After General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai on Wednesday urged that the current government's economic
and social reform measures should be continued after the upcoming
general election, which is expected to be held in October this
year.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the country's annual economic forum
here,which is participated by key politicians, business circles
and foreign diplomats, he said that to deal with the problems the
country now faces, policy continuity is of great importance.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the current problems, namely bad loans
in the financial sector, hike of oil prices, weakening of the
currency, slide in agriculture products, unemployment and the
people's welfare are not as severe as those seen in the financial
disaster three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"They are normal problems for every country, and we are
confident of managing them if the related policy measures are kept
on going," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Positive signs have already been seen in tackling with the
mentioned issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Within this year, the non-performing loans (NPL) in Thailand's
finance sector have decreased from 40 percent of the total bank
lending to 32 percent, and are hoped to decline to single digit at
the end of the year, according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is also dropping while a social safety
network is taking the shape, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The weakening baht may cause the problem of inflation, he said,
but it also boosts the country's export and help speed up the
overall economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Those signs are believed to help bring back foreign investments,
which are thought to be vital for the country's recovery and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of the reoccurrence of the
economic crisis, but said the economy is not yet back to the sound
situation prior to the crisis although it is recovering.
</P>
<P>
The current government is expected to dissolve the parliament
in one and a half months' time. A general election will then be
held to select the next government.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Sees No Possibility of New Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said here Wednesday that there is almost no
likelihood of a new economic crisis because the macroeconomic
situation in the country now does not meet the definition of a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
There is no total loss of foreign reserves, no loss of
confidence in the financial institutions and no panic capital
outflows now in Thailand, all of which can be used to define a
crisis, he said at an annual economic review forum organized by
The Bangkok Post and a few other institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, he agreed that the economy is not recovering as fast
as expected due to some unfavorable factors, such as the
adjustment of the U.S. economy and the rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He compared Thai economic recovery to an airplane with four
engines -- public spending, exports, private investment and
consumption, which he said are beginning to work one after the
other.
</P>
<P>
But to sustain the recovery, he said, Thailand needs to further
work on the huge non-performing loans, which amount to 40 billion
U.S. dollars, and bank recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
He said recovery can happen with impaired financial
institutions, but full recovery can't happen without fully
repaired financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Thailand should also try its best to absorb foreign investment
and work out measures that help restore confidence in the
financial institutions, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
While Thailand needs to create a favorable domestic environment
by itself, some external factors, such as the adjustment of the U.
S. economy and the economic recovery of Japan, will also play a
role in the pace of Thailand's recovery, he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Maintains Cooperation on Food Security Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will continue to be obliged by an agreement
on food security reserve, aimed at ensuring adequate food supply
in the region, according to a statement of the Thai Ministry of
Commerce available here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by the five founders of the ASEAN --
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand --
in Bali in 1976, said the establishment of the ASEAN Food Security
Reserve was needed and meant to require the five ASEAN founders to
maintain within their national borders agreed quantities of basic
food stocks, particularly rice, as a matter of national policy,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was part of the Declaration of ASEAN
Concord, also included the establishment of the ASEAN Emergency
Rice, aimed at reserving the major foodstuff for meeting emergency
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Each of the five ASEAN members is required to earmark rice
within or above its national reserve, totally accounting for at
least 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The five ASEAN founders also agreed that a country facing any
food problem would directly notify the others of the emergency,
and the other countries would take immediate actions to make
necessary arrangements to ensure immediate and speedy release of
the require rice.
</P>
<P>
Prices, terms, and conditions of payments in respect of the
rice released under the emergency arrangement would be subject to
direct negotiations, and the requesting ASEAN member would have to
inform the ASEAN Food Security Reserve Board of its request to the
other ASEAN member partners.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, ASEAN members which have to release
earmarked rice to meet either their own emergency requirements, or
emergency requirements of other members would have to take steps
to re-fill the rice so that the earmarked quantity of the
countries would be restored to the agreed levels.
</P>
<P>
Governments of the ASEAN member countries also agreed to
coordinate in their national food stock policies, which take
policies of other members into account, aiming to maintain a
minimum safe level for the ASEAN Food Security Reserve, the
statement noted.

<HEADLINE> Manila Optimistic Over Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
optimistic that the Abu Sayyaf will finally release anytime soon
the remaining hostages it has been holding in Jolo since April,
negotiators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said he was to go
to Jolo to discuss with Abu Sayyaf leader Ghalib Andang alias
Commander Robot the final details for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make some finishing touches. Former Libyan Ambassador
Rajab Abdulaziz Azzarouq and I will clear up some things with
Robot," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said he remains optimistic that the Abu Sayyaf would
release all of the hostages. He said President Joseph Estrada told
him to ensure the hostages' safe release.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Aventajado said a jet from Libya, which
arrived in Manila Monday night, would be stationed only at the
Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) here.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Libyan plane has raised hopes for the speedy
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"The plane will be there at the NAIA in the meantime," he said,
when asked whether the plane would be flown to Jolo.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Abu Sayyaf has released six Malaysians, two Germans
and three local Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group is still holding hostage 14 of the 21 people
abducted in April from Malaysia's Sipadan island and then moved to
the southern Philippine island province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The 14 Sipadan hostages consist of three Malaysians, two
Germans,two French, two Finns, two South Africans, two Filipinos
and a Lebanese. The rebels are also holding three French
journalists and 13 local Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government Urged to Remove Gas Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The petroleum industry in Kenya
has urged the government to remove all taxes on liquid petroleum
gas and gas-cooking appliances for the sake of environment
protection.
</P>
<P>
In a proposal to the Ministry of Finance, the industry said
this will make the products affordable to more Kenyans and shift
demand from wood fuel to gas, a cleaner and more efficient energy,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The industry argued that demand for charcoal and related wood
fuel is a major contributor to environmental degradation and
deforestation in the country, saying that wood fuel meets more
than 70 percent of Kenya's energy needs which put intense pressure
on the country's forests.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the industry called for a deliberate policy to
shift demand from wood fuel to liquefied petroleum gas, therefore
asking for the elimination of taxes on gas and gas-cooking
appliances including cylinders, regulators, cookers and grills.
</P>
<P>
The industry added that such a move will reduce the prices of
gas-cooking appliances, helping Kenyans afford to such products.
</P>
<P>
At present, per capita gas consumption in Kenya is only 1.9
kilograms compared to Senegal, whose per capita consumption is 5.5
kilograms, the industry said.

<HEADLINE> Acute Food Shortage in Kenya: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is among 16 African
countries facing severe food shortages, according to the 2000
annual report by the U.N. World Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO).
</P>
<P>
 The FAO also painted a gloomy picture for the coming October
harvest, saying that the long rains cropping season (March-May),
which normally accounts for 80 percent of total annual food
production, "has already failed due to a severe drought".
</P>
<P>
Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia are also among
the countries hit by the prolonged drought, said the report, which
is to be launched on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 3.3 million Kenyans need urgent food assistance,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Except for Western and Nyanza Provinces, the other five
provinces in Kenya have received no rain or little in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
The severe drought, the worst in 42 years for the east African
country, has caused widespread crop failure and livestock losses.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's GDP Growth Dips by 1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic growth slowed
further in May, hurt by a prolonged drought that has undermined
farm and industrial production, the Central Bank of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly economic review released here Tuesday, the bank
said Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew a real 1.0 percent in the
12 months to May this year, compared to 1.1 percent in the
previous month and 1.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is currently experiencing its worst drought in four
decades and a power rationing program has cut supplies to industry
to just 32 hours a week and also hit agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"The slowdown in economic performance is expected to continue
as a result of the on-going drought, electricity and water
rationing and other structural factors which have impacted
adversely on the economy," the bank said in the economic review.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said the on-going structural reforms and the
resumption of financial support by international development
partners are expected to impact positively on the growth of the
economy and the government hopes to increase GDP growth to 5.5
percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund last month agreed to advance a
198-million-U.S. dollar three-year loan to Kenya, while the World
Bank also approved a 150-million-dollar credit to the country
early this month.
</P>
<P>
Improvement in the country's economy is expected to be slow
because of the power crisis and droughts, the bank added.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Efforts Continue for Crew of Sunken Russian Sub EDS-Adds plans to raise sub; commander remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military started a
third attempt Wednesday to evacuate the 116 crew from the Kursk
nuclear submarine that is stranded at the bottom of the Barents
Sea since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The previous two attempts overnight failed due to poor
visibility and strong underwater currents, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy is pondering plans to lift the submarine to
shallow waters in order to improve visibility.
</P>
<P>
A press officer of the Northern Fleet said attempts would be
made in the next few hours to raise the sub from the bottom by
pneumatic pontoons and move it from 100 meters under water to
about 30-50 meters, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The first submersible capsule was unable to dock with the sub
in the night operation and had to be brought to surface to restore
its life-support system.
</P>
<P>
"It has exhausted its resources," Tass quoted an officer with
the Northern Fleet headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The visibility for the capsule decreased to zero when it was
enveloped by sand and silt suspensions, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
With the crew thought to have just 48 hours of oxygen left,
Russian navy officials were due to meet their NATO counterparts in
Brussels on Wednesday to consider accepting western help.
</P>
<P>
Russia has 22 ships on the surface involved in the rescue bid
and has so far not accepted offers of help from Britain or the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk" went down to the bottom of the Barents
Sea on Sunday while attending a routine exercise of the Russian
Northern Fleet. It is not clear whether there are any casualties
among the servicemen aboard the vessel.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is still unknown and all versions are
being checked, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Tuesday. He
listed collision with a different object or an explosion in the
first compartment of the submarine as among the most probable
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were two U.S. submarines nearby at
the time of the accident and they reported the sound of an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days, the Interfax news agency reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Kuroyedov, the Russian Navy commander, told the nation
Wednesday that hope for saving the crew of "Kursk" would remain
until Friday, August 18.
</P>
<P>
Initial examination revealed that the submarine's deckhouse is
damaged and the shield of the fairing of the two missile silos on
the right-side deck was ripped off, Kuroyedov said.
</P>
<P>
"The submarine lies aground with a raised periscope. The causes
of the accident will become clear following a detailed examination
of the entire submarine body," the commander said.

<HEADLINE> China to Publish Pictures of 1911 Revolution Taken by U.S. Photographer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to publish rare
pictures taken by a U.S. photographer who recorded historical
events during the 1911 Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Francis Eugene Stafford, a U.S. photographer, came to Shanghai
in 1909 with his wife and took a number of pictures about the
revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, which overthrew China's last
dynasty, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Shanghai Museum of History said that the
pictures are highly valuable in studying modern Chinese history
and culture in the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Stafford died in 1938 and his pictures were not known to the
outside world until three years ago, when his daughter decided to
hand over the pictures to her son, Ronald Anderson, a professor of
sociology at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Stafford was born into a family of clergyman in Colorado State.
He became a photographer of a publishing house in California and
then came to China, continuing his career at the Commercial Press
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Using a camera, which was rarely seen in China at that time,
Stafford took a lot of well-known pictures, some of which had
already been published. One of the published pictures shows Dr.
Sun Yat-sen, who was elected Provisional President of the Republic
of China, leaving the Shanghai railway station in December of 1911
for Nanjing to assume office.
</P>
<P>
These sepia pictures were preserved for nearly a century at
Stafford's home. As a grandson of Stafford, Prof. Anderson, said
he would share the history with the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Prof. Anderson was in Shanghai to discuss publishing
the pictures.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Museum of History, the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences and the Commercial Press have decided to publish a book
next year which will mark the 90th anniversary of the 1911
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only the wish of my grandfather, but also my wish,
to share the photos with the Chinese people," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
Stafford, who loved Chinese culture, also brought advanced
printing technology to the Shanghai Commercial Press.
</P>
<P>
The couple left Shanghai in 1915. Stafford returned again to
Shanghai twice, but each time he did not stay long because of
health problems. In 1938, Stafford died from tuberculosis at 44.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Opposes Dialog With U.S., Calling for Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei has expressed strong opposition to dialog with the
United States, calling for resistance against U.S. influence,the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Experiences show that there is no common point between Iran and
the U.S., so dialog and relations with the country would solve no
problem, the leader said Tuesday in a meeting with Foreign Ministry
officials, including Iranian ambassadors stationed abroad.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of Washington in proposing dialog is to
prepare the ground for imposing its stances and materialize its
wishes, Khamenei pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Iranian nation to build up on their resistance
against U.S. and Western cultural and political influences to "add
to the nation's power and dignity."
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Washington severed diplomatic ties 20 years ago when
Islamic radicals stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52
Americans hostage in the heyday of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has since kept political attacks and
economic sanctions on the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Relations thawed after Iran's moderate President Mohammad
Khatami took office in 1997 and the U.S. government even has
offered to hold direct dialog with Iran on their differences.
</P>
<P>
But Iran's conservative hardliners still harbor strong hostility
toward Washington, accusing it of trying to stir up unrest in Iran
and undermine the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Iran also bitterly criticizes the U.S.-sponsored Middle East
peace process, especially the alleged U.S. bias toward Israel,
which Iran does not recognize as a legitimate state.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government tries to establish a uni-polar world system,
but it lacks the political, moral and ideological competence to
lead the world, Khamenei noted in his remarks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed "religious faith" as a tool to protect Iran's
national security. Democracy in Iran must be built up on the
people's religious beliefs and Iran's democracy must not be
influenced by the U.S. and Western countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, the highest authority of the country, also underlined
the importance of diplomacy in strengthening the power of Iran's
system.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Foreign Ministry officials and the ambassadors
not to forget their commitment to the system in their talks with
various states.

<P>
MANILA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the Philippine

</P>
<P>
Also, the broader all-share index fell 1.54 points to 656.21.

Analysts said most investors stayed at the sidelines, fearing
the peso might breach the crucial level of 45 against one U.S.
dollar in late trading.
</P>

"The main concern is toward the direction of the peso. There
are also some concerns about the country's macroeconomic figures
like the lower imports in June," Jonas Ravelas, a market analyst
said here.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 44.946 early Wednesday, softer compared with
Tuesday's close of 44.915.

<HEADLINE> Japan Sets Conditions for Canceling Zambia's Debt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the report, this came to light when Etsuya Washio,
president of Rengo, a Japanese trade union federation, and vice-
chairman of International Federation of Trade Unions, held a
joint press briefing with Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU)
president Fackson Shamenda in Kitwe in Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
The two labor leaders held the press conference with a view to
acknowledging the warm relationship between the Zambian and
Japanese governments, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Shamenda asked Washio to pressurise the Japanese government to
cancel Zambia's debts, stressing that it was practically difficult
to talk about development in the country because of the staggering
debt.
</P>
<P>
Washio said his government had also decided to contribute 400
million dollars to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
for the reduction of debts as well as for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the debts were accumulated during the Cold War
more than 20 years ago, sacrificing the present generation.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity every
where," Washio said, adding that the world is now more
interrelated economically as well as politically than ever before.

<HEADLINE> Russia Starts Third Attempt to Rescue Crew of Crippled Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military started a
third attempt Wednesday to evacuate the 116 crew from the Kursk
nuclear submarine that is stranded at the bottom of the Barents
Sea since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The previous two attempts overnight failed due to poor
visibility and strong underwater currents, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The first submersible capsule was unable to dock with the sub
in the night operation and had to be brought to surface to restore
its life-support system.
</P>
<P>
"It has exhausted its resources," Tass quoted an officer with
the Northern Fleet headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The visibility for the capsule decreased to zero when it was
enveloped by sand and silt suspensions, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
With the crew thought to have just 48 hours of oxygen left,
Russian navy officials were due to meet their NATO counterparts in
Brussels on Wednesday to consider accepting western help.
</P>
<P>
Russia has 22 ships on the surface involved in the rescue bid
and has so far not accepted offers of help from Britain or the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk" went down to the bottom of the Barents
Sea on Sunday while attending a routing exercise of the Russian
Northern Fleet. It is not clear whether there are any casualties
among the servicemen aboard the vessel.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is still unknown and all versions are
being checked, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Tuesday. He
listed collision with a different object or an explosion in the
first compartment of the submarine as among the most probable
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were two U.S. submarines nearby at
the time of the accident and they reported the sound of an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days, the Interfax news agency reported earlier.

<HEADLINE> Warm Water, Slow Wind Blamed for Triggering Bohai Red Tides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Higher water temperatures, the
sun and the wind are blamed for triggering frequent outbreaks of
large-scale red tides last month in the polluted Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Li Xingming, an expert with the China Maritime Supervision
Corps under the State Oceanic Administration of China, said
excessive nitrogen and phosphorus pumped into the sea are the main
reasons for four red tides last month.
</P>
<P>
But without high water temperatures, enough sunshine and wind,
or the right weather conditions, there would be no red tides, said
Li.
</P>
<P>
About 20 to 30 red tides are expected to occur this year in the
coastal sea waters, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
Red tides are mainly caused by pollution from land and large-
scale farming in coastal waters, which produce too much nitrogen
and phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
China has experienced increasing red tides off the coast since
the 1990s due to increasing pollution caused by industrial waste
water, according to a recent report issued by the State Oceanic
Administration.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45 large-scale red tides occurred between 1997 and
1999, causing direct economic losses of 240 million U.S. dollars,
Guangming Daily reported.

Wahid said here Wednesday that the national economic recovery
program is aimed at increasing the quality of the people's life.

The rebuilding of the national economy is also aimed at
achieving the ideal of independence, said the president in his
state address before the House of Representatives (DPR) to
commemorate the 55th anniversary of the national independence day
which is due on August 17
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the crisis that is entering its third year
has obliged us to undertake various recovery policies which often
cause weighty impacts on the social and economic lives and which
are politically sensitive," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the same occasion, DPR Speaker Akbar Tandjung
said the DPR leadership attentively observes the government's
efforts in overcoming the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that all the ongoing crisis recovery programs, which
are now being implemented, could be continued or even increased,
especially if they are connected to the presence of a decision on
entrusting the duties to the vice president to lead -- on a daily
basis -- the governmental technical activities, and the
possibility of restructuring and reshuffling the cabinet,"
Tandjung said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also added that the quantity and quality of the various
instruments to carry out the goal of economic justice will be
continuously improved.
</P>
<P>
In connection with the global situation, Wahid said the
rebuilding of the country's economy which is aimed at achieving
the ideal of independence will be carried out within the ever-
changing global environment.
</P>
<P>
He added that economic globalization requires the
implementation of and the respect for human rights and the
protection and preservation of the environment.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the economic management has also to be based
on the just, firm and positive rules aiming to safeguard the
interests of the workers, the consumers and the environment. These
interests are weighted to and in line with the interests of the
government. At the same time, they have to be measured in a
balanced manner with the interests of the investors and business
society at large," the president said.

engulfed in a miserable condition.
</P>
<P>
Wahid made the statement before the House of Representatives (
DPR) plenary session, during which he delivered a state address to
commemorate the 55th of the national independence day which falls
on August 17.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed ironical that during this auspicious event, there
are many citizens of our nation still engulfed in a miserable
condition because they are not as yet free from fear over the fate
and safety of their family members as well as of their own," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"The urban poor people are not yet completely free from being
sidelined and chased away from their own dwelling places," Wahid
said, adding that "freedom from a protracted suffering has not yet
been enjoyed by some of our fellow citizens who are still engulfed
by the structural poverty."
</P>
<P>
"The government is, therefore, highly committed to lessening
its dominant role," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that all governmental apparatuses need to improve
their capability to assume their facilitating role. "We should all
be aware that it is indeed of paramount importance to build a
society which has its own capability, initiative and inner
strength," Wahid stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is saddening to learn the fact that after more than 50
years of independence, we are still unsuccessful in managing the
relations among and between various groups, ethnicities, races and
religious followers," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"It is deplorable that blood still sheds, vengeance and hatred
loom large in the hearts of some of our supposedly independence
guardians," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
The task ahead is, therefore, to rebuild the inter-group
relations in a more creative and humane manner, noted the
president.
</P>
<P>
"We need to formulate a national agenda to be used as a forum
for reconciliations, dialogues, and communications in an attempt
to restore the relations among and between the components of the
society in various regions. We also need to encourage the
emergence of a cultural response against the breakdown of
political communication in our society in several areas," Wahid
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Venezuelan President Ends Tour of OPEC Nations By Wang Quanfu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
on Tuesday wound up a whirlwind tour of 10 nations of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) within nine
days.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the tour was to invite leaders of the OPEC
countries to attend the second OPEC summit, scheduled for
September 27 and 28 this year in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said Chavez has received confirmation from
six leaders to attend the summit, which is aimed at strengthening
the bloc's unity, its consultation mechanism, and enhancing
Venezuela's leadership in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Chavez was quoted by the press as saying that the heads of
state of Iran, Indonesia, Nigeria, Algeria, Kuwait and Qatar have
confirmed their participation in the summit, and those who would
not be able to attend have promised to send high-level delegations.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the journey had exceeded the initial
expectations, guaranteeing a success of the summit, the president
said in Algiers, Algeria, the last leg of his tour.
</P>
<P>
Chavez discussed with OPEC leaders a possible alliance between
OPEC state firms and the creation of an OPEC bank.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic step of Chavez's 10-nation trip was his visit
to Iraq, the first by a foreign head of state since the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
He was warmly welcomed in Baghdad and was impressed as he was
driven through the capital reportedly by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein himself.
</P>
<P>
He made an impassioned plea to the United Nations for lifting
the decade-long economic sanctions against Iraq, saying: "We have
called many times for the sanctions to be lifted ... because what
is happening in Iraq is unjust and we are happy that we are not
the only ones who feel this way."
</P>
<P>
The visit roused criticism from the United States, which said
the visit could compromise international efforts to contain Saddam
Hussein and force him to comply with U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
Shrugging U.S. criticisms, Chavez said: "I'll go to hell if I
want."
</P>
<P>
But Chavez was not alone. He was backed by Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid, who announced that he would visit Baghdad in
the coming weeks for a meeting with Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Despite the friction over the president's visit to Iraq,
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said on Tuesday
that the country's relationship with the United States remains
stable, describing the friction as normal "differences" between
allies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chemical Giant Auctions Bonds Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Dow Chemical, the second
largest chemical producer in the United States, auctioned five-
year bonds worth 300 million U.S. dollars over the Internet on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dow is the first industrial corporation to use an online "Dutch
auction" that allows investors to bid in real time for both the
amount and price of bonds. The company said the bond offering was
successfully placed during a two-hour auction.
</P>
<P>
Dow executives said the use of an Internet-based bond auction
allows the company to raise funds on a more efficient, less costly
basis, and provides the company with access to a broader investor
range as well.
</P>
<P>
In the auction, Dow said, 55 investors were awarded amounts of
up to 40 million dollars, compared to the typical 15 to 20
investors allocated securities in bond offerings of this size.
</P>
<P>
Several companies, including automakers DaimlerChrysler and
Ford Motor, and investment bank Bear Stearns, have reportedly
tried this new way to sell bonds online this year.

<HEADLINE> Association Set to Standardize, Expand Online Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. e-market solutions
provider Commerce One and another 23 companies from 15 countries
have formed an association tasked to standardize and expand
international business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce activity.
</P>
<P>
Commerce One said Tuesday that the newly-born Global Trading
Web Association aims to promote international trade of goods and
services through the use of the Internet. The open, voluntary
venture will also work to remove barriers to trade and provide
alternatives beyond traditional methods of doing business.
</P>
<P>
The association will be a place for international partners to
meet and negotiate transactions, build business relationships,
identify best practices and promote interoperability. Partners can
also issue guidelines, create global directories and develop
services that allow transactions to flow more efficiently for the
good of both member companies and their customers.
</P>
<P>
The new group is an outgrowth of the Global Trading Web, a B2B
online trading community created last year by Commerce One to
provide the advantage of economics of scale for buyers, suppliers
and service providers through independent industry portals. At
present, the association membership consists entirely of core
users of the Global Trading Web. Commerce One, however, said any
company that uses the Global Trading Web even for the smallest
transactions can join in.
</P>
<P>
Among the initial members are global accounting firm Price
Waterhouse Coopers and online marketplaces from Mexico, India,
Australia, Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that one of the complexities involving
international B2B e-commerce is settlement procedures between
different banks in different countries. So it's crucial for the
association to include a larger roster of international financial
organizations.

In 1999, Sri Lanka completed the third rural electrification
project which supplied 140,000 rural houses with electricity under
a 3500 million rupee loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
while in 1995, the second rural electrification project, also
funded by the ADB, was completed to supply power for 100,000 rural
houses.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that these projects have increased the
proportion of electrified houses from 43 percent in 1994 to 56.6
percent at the end of 1999, and it expects new projects to help
increase the figure to 80 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Despite expanding electricity services to both rural and
industrial areas, Sri Lanka is faced with a dire power problem.
The country is heavily dependent on hydro power for its
electricity supply but with weather patterns changing and rain
falling short in catchment areas electricity supply has had to be
restricted.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the situation was so bad that power cuts of up to 12
hours a day had to be imposed. Most industrial and commercial
establishments were compelled to purchase their own generators to
keep their establishments functioning.
</P>
<P>
Since then the government has encouraged the generation of
thermal power but still the crisis looms with each delay in
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
This year the Electricity Board has cautioned that, unless more
rain falls in the catchment areas, power cuts may have to be
imposed again.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Sugar Production Drops in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 29,560 tons of
sugar in fiscal year 1999-2000 which ended in March, dropping by
18,838 tons or 38.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year,
said the country's Central Statistical Organization in its latest
report.
</P>
<P>
The drop in sugar production came after the country had
maintained its average annual sugar output of 50,000 tons for the
past four fiscal years, during which it exported over 35,000 tons
of sugar annually.
</P>
<P>
There are eight state-owned sugar mills in Myanmar, namely
Pyinmana No.1 and 2, Yedashe, Zeyawaddy, Belin, Shwenyaung, Namte
and Kyauktaw.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three new sugar mills in Bago and Mandalay divisions,
built by the state-run Myanma Sugarcane Enterprise under contracts
with Chinese companies, have successively gone into production
since last December.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar cultivates over 100,
000 hectares of sugarcane with an annual output of over 5 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Sugarcane is one of Myanmar's four important pillar crops and
extensive and intensive cultivation of the crop is being made
around the areas of sugar mills for sufficient supply of cane to
the mills.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Military Confirms 18,000 Tamil Tiger Deaths Since 1982 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Security forces have
confirmed that over 18,000 Tamil Tiger rebels have been killed
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
The military also said that government troops continue to
retake and bring under government control more areas that have
been under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE), which has been fighting a war against government forces for
a separate state for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics with the Ministry of Defense, quoted
Wednesday by the national news agency "Lankapuwath," 18,262 LTTE
guerrillas have been killed during this period and over 20,000
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that a total of 2,410 Tamil Tiger rebels was
killed in 1999 and 508 killed so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The long-running bloody civil war launched by the LTTE has
claimed more than 60,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to achieve a political solution to the war have so far
failed despite three efforts at peace talks under the ruling of
President J.R. Jayewardene in 1984, President Ranasinghe Premadasa
in 1990 and the incumbent President Chandrika Kumaratunga in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Norway has initiated a peace negotiation between the government
and Tamil Tigers but so far little progress has been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Gary Hall Misses World Record in 50m Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Gary Hall secured his second
Olympic ticket with an American record but missed the world mark
in the men's 50m freestyle at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials in
Indianapolis Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Hall, 25, who finished second in the 100m freestyle on Sunday,
clocked 21.76 seconds for a national mark, only 0.12 seconds off
the fresh world record of 21.64 set up by Olympic chief rival
Alexander Popov on June 16, 2000 in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Ervin, 19, who won his first trip to Sydney by
finishing fifth for the 100m freestyle relay, claimed his first
outing for an individual event in the Olympic Games by securing
the second place in the 50m freestyle in 21.80.
</P>
<P>
Neil Walker, 24, who was beaten twice in the Olympic Games by
Popov in both the 50m and 100m freestyles, was eliminated from the
50m finals as he only
finished in a disappointing third place in 22.12.
</P>
<P>
However, Walker has already secured two outings in the Olympic
Games by
finishing first in the 100m freestyle and second in the 100m
backstroke earlier.
</P>
<P>
Ian Crocker, 17, also claimed his first spot on the U.S.
Olympic swimming team by winning the 100m butterfly in 52.78,
followed by Tommy Hannan in 52.81.
</P>
<P>
Crocker was the latest evidence of a youth movement in the men'
s program as he became the eighth teenager to make the Olympic
team, while only one male teenager of Tom Malchow went to Atlanta
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Amanda Atkins came from behind to win the women's 200m
backstroke in 2:12.97, followed by Lindsay Benko in 2:13.19.
However, their winning timings are far away from the national mark
of 2:08.60 set by Betsy Mitchel, not to mention Hungarian
Krisztina Egerszegi's world mark of 2:06.62.
</P>
<P>
Brooke Bennett also secured her second Olympic spot by
finishing first in the women's 800m freestyle in 8:23.92, after
claiming the second place in the 400m freestyle last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kaitlin Sandeno finished second in 8:28.61, becoming the first
U.S. swimmer to book three berths in the Olympics as she was
triumphed in the 400m medley and became runner-up in the 200m
butterfly.

BOGOTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Jario "the Tiger" Castillo helped

The game earned the Colombians three points, giving them a

Though noticeably slowed by Bogota's altitude, the visiting

Castillo's goal.

WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A damaged Russian nuclear-powered submarine sank in the
Barents Sea off Russian's northwestern coast Sunday, trapping at
least 100 sailors beneath 500 feet of Arctic waters. As rescuers
reached the crippled vessel, the commander of the Russian navy
said there was little hope of raising the submarine or its crew.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton opened the 43rd Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles on Monday with a sharp rebuttal to
Republican criticism that he had squandered his presidency,
claiming the nation's prolonged economic boom was "a matter of
choice...not a matter of chance". He also praised Vice President
Gore as someone who would "keep our prosperity going."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- An 8-year-old girl who spent two nights shackled to the
front seat of a kidnapper's car found a key that opened the lock
and escaped, the police in vallejo, calif., said. A convicted
kidnapper was charged.
</P>
<P>
-- Ten African presidents met in Zambia for an urgent push to
salvage the crumbling Congo peace accord and to pave the way for
the deployment of United nations peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Business inventories rose a larger-than-expected 0.9 percent
in June as firms stocked up to keep pace with strong demand. The
small-business index rebounded in July, adding confusion as to
whether economic growth is slowing.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.N. Security Council backed Secretary-General Annan's
call for 4,200 peace-keepers to police an Ethiopia-Eritrea cease-
fire. The council also took the first steps toward setting up a
special court to try Sierra Leone rebel leaders for civil-war
atrocities.

<HEADLINE> Russia Turns Down French Proposal to Help Rescue Sunken Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia has turned down a French
proposal to help it evacuate the crew of the sunken submarine "
Kursk" in the Barents Sea, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted
French navy officials as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
French Navy Admiral Yves Lagane has contacted the navy attache
of the Russian embassy in Paris and proposed sending a 10-man team,
including four military doctors specialized in under-sea operation,
four divers and two experts of nuclear propulsion.
</P>
<P>
But the Russian side turned down the offer, AFP quoted
officials at the headquarters of the chief of general staff of the
French armed forces as saying.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation of the 116-man crew of "Kursk" begun Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose submarine went down to the bottom of the
Barents Sea on Sunday while attending a routine exercise of the
Russian Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident remains unknown, but Moscow says a
collision with another object or an explosion in the first
compartment of the submarine as among the most probable scenarios.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk", with a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and able
to dive to an depth of up to 500 meters, was commissioned for the
Russian Navy in 1995. It is armed with torpedoes and "Granite"
cruise missiles.

PARIS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that the
hostage crisis in the Philippines has clearly come to an important
moment and the French government is intensifying efforts to secure

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A top official of Liaoning
Province expressed his confidence in the success of the province's
campaign to bail out unprofitable State-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Wen Shizhen, secretary of the provincial committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, predicted that less than 30 percent of
the province's large and medium-sized SOEs would still be losing
money by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"I estimate the figure can be as low as 25 percent," he was
quoted by today's "China Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has the largest number of State-owned enterprises of
all of China's provinces. "They were the most influenced by the
planned economy in the past," Wen said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, when China started a campaign to make its debt-ridden
SOEs profitable within three years, most of Liaoning's large and
medium-sized SOEs were in the red.
</P>
<P>
Most of these enterprises stopped losing money last year, and
showed a net profit of 3.28 billion yuan (400 million US dollars),
according to Zhang Guoguang, governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
Profit in the first half of this year was 4.3 billion yuan (518
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two major goals set for the three-year campaign are
reversing the trend of unprofitability in most of the large and
medium-sized SOEs and introducing a modern corporate mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the overall situation, these goals can be achieved
by the end of this year," Wen said.

<HEADLINE> China to Restrict Digging in Grassland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua)-- China, a country taking pride in
its traditional herbal medicine, is considering how to limit
digging plants for such usage in grassland.
</P>
<P>
Digging for wild plants and herbs usually destroys grass
growing around them, resulting eventually in the environmental
destruction, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
If excessive digging continues, the great Hulunbuir Pasture
which has a grassland of 149 million mu, or 9.98 million hectares,
will become a desert within 10 years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Major herbal plants being dug for include liquor ice, Chinese
ephedra, Chongcao (Chinese Caterpillar fungus) and Facai, a
precious wild vegetable.
</P>
<P>
To limit digging such plants is by no means an easy task, not
only because many poor people make a living by digging herbal
plants, but also because administrators concerned lack fund and
necessary experience to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
However, the government of Inner Mongolia, China's major
grassland province, has decided to curb the excessive digging.
</P>
<P>
Its measures include limiting the number of permissions granted
to the diggers and dealers, and strengthening co-operations
between police and departments concerned.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has a good chance to
win a medal in the women's 48 kilograms class at the Olympic Games
in Sydney next month.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Olympic Games deputy chef de mission Imron Z.S.
said the absence of Chinese lifters, who won the event at the
World Championships last year, might enable Indonesia's two
lifters Sri Indriyani and Lisa Rumbewas to win the medal.
</P>
<P>
Both Sri and Lisa joined their compatriots Winarni and Supeni,
who are competing in the 53kg divisions, for the final evaluation
onAugust 9 and 14.
</P>
<P>
"As the Chinese lifters will be absent in the women's 48kg
division, our lifters will have a great chance to contribute a
medal from a sport other than badminton," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia earned three Olympic berths but the Indonesian
Weighlifting, Powerlifting and Bodybuilding Association (PABBSI)
had problems in deciding which athletes would represent the
country in theevent. Therefore the association decided to stage an
evaluation topick three athletes.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation results were as follows: Sri lifted 85.5 kgs in
snatch, 112 kgs in clean and jerk and a total lift of 197.5 kgs.
Hertotal lift equaled the world record created by Liu Xiuhua of
China at the World Weightlifting Championships in Montreal in June.
</P>
<P>
While Lisa lifted 85 kgs in snatch, 110 kgs in clean and jerk
and atotal of 195 kgs.
</P>
<P>
In the 53 kg division, Winarni lifted 97.5 kgs, which also
equaledthe world record created by Meng Xianjuan of China in the
World Weightlifting Championships last year. The Indonesian lifted
115 kgsin clean and jerk and a total lift of 212.5 kgs.
</P>
<P>
While Supeni only lifted 85 kgs in snatch, 110 kgs in clean
andjerk and a total lift of 195 kg.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian officials held a meeting on Tuesday to decide which
athletes would represent the country in the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
"I will report the results of the meeting to the Olympics
executive training director tomorrow (Wednesday). It's unethical
if I announcethe names today (Tuesday)," Imron said, declining to
mention thelifters.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the National Sports Council will not
onlyobserve the
final evaluation of the athletes but also assess theirphysical and
psychological condition as well as their self confidence,all of
which are needed to overcome pressure in such a major event.

NANJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A hospital in China took the
lead in the world to clone genes that result in brain tumors, thus
paving the way for possible gene therapy against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Called the low-oxygen inducing factor, the gene was recently
cloned from a galotinous tumor sample from a human brain by a
hospital attached to the Xuzhou Medical College in east China's
Jiangsu province after almost four years of experiments.
</P>
<P>
Existing inside the human body, the gene could induce various
diseases and cause nerve system damage and brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
A Shanghai biological technology corporation has recently
detected that the cloned gene shares an identical sequence with
that reported in the international gene database.

<HEADLINE> Students Need More Sex Education: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The results from a recent United
Nation survey show that more than 80 per cent of the questioned
Chinese high school students admitted they have been in love at
least once.
</P>
<P>
Only 18.4 of the respondents, all are high school students, are
against pre-marital sex, while 30.4 per cent are in favor of it
and another 47.8 per cent think it is understandable, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, funded by the United Nations Population Fund,
covered five high schools in Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality and Northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether chastity is important, 63.6 per cent of
those surveyed in Chongqing said it was important for both genders.
But also 15.2 per cent said it is important only for females, and
another 6 per cent said it was unimportant at all.
</P>
<P>
More than 86 per cent said it was necessary to use
contraception to prevent pre-marital pregnancy, according to today
's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found some students confused sexual
incompetency and premature ejaculation with venereal diseases,
although most of them had a rough idea about sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents agreed that pornography is dangerous to young
people, but still many of them admitted to having viewed some form
of pornography.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. NMD Plan Could Start New Arms Race: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. plans for a National
Missile Defense (NMD) system is bound to disrupt global strategic
balance and lead to a new arms race, Chinese military experts have
said.
</P>
<P>
The defense system, part of the U.S. global military strategy,
"principally targets containing Russia and China", the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
The National Missile Defense plans for 2005 represents a "high
risk", said Luo Yuan, director of the Second Office of the
Department of Strategy Studies under the Academy of Military
Science.
</P>
<P>
The missile shield also would "severely damage" the value of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, under which the
United States and Soviet Union agreed that neither would build a
comprehensive defense against the other's long-range nuclear
arsenal, Luo said, adding that NMD would require re-negotiation of
the ABM treaty signed with the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
If NMD goes forward, non-proliferation efforts in the Asia-
Pacific region will be shattered, said Song Xuefeng, a research
fellow of the academy.
</P>
<P>
"Seeking one-sided or unilateral interests and absolute
superiority with military means will surely disrupt regional
stability and undermining all parties' interests," Song was quoted
as saying by today's China Daily.

<HEADLINE> Missile System Threatens Relations: Military Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. proposals to include Taiwan
in a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system will upgrade
technological ties between the United States and Taiwan and affect
Sino-U.S. relations, said Chinese military experts.
</P>
<P>
"It means the U.S. could pitch a part of China against China,"
Song Xuefeng, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Science
of the People's Liberation Army, was quoted as saying by today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
TMD, a variant of the National Missile Defense system which
specifically protects the U.S., is aimed at shielding the U.S.
troops and its allies in Asia. It has caused great concern and
opposition from the international community.
</P>
<P>
China has accused the United States of exaggerating the threat
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as an excuse to
project its military strength in Asia and as a reason to bring
Taiwan under TMD.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's entry to TMD will represent "a paramilitary alliance"
or "a de facto military alliance" with the U.S., said Luo Yuan,
director of the Second Office of the Department of Strategy
Studies at the academy. It would affect Sino-U.S. relations, Luo
added.

<HEADLINE> Hemudu Culture Forced on Move by Flood (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 16 (Xinhua) -- It was a flood, not seawater,
that removed the Hemudu culture, one of the most important
Neolithic cultures in China some 7,000 years ago, out of its
ancestral home, a local archaeologist suggested recently.
</P>
<P>
It has been a long-perplexing mystery why the Hemudu culture, a
symbol of China's ancient civilization, suddenly abandoned its
home after dwelling there for 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Uncovered in 1973, the Hemudu relics were situated in the
Hemudu Town in Yuyao in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have already decided, however, that the
relocation was caused by either the frequency of seawater or a
flood.
</P>
<P>
Based on the analysis of the geographic environment in the
region, Shao Jiuhua, former curator of the Hemudu Museum, recently
proposed that a malicious flood wield a fatal strike at the Hemudu
Culture.
</P>
<P>
The Hemudu was attacked by at least two vicious and long-
lasting floods, he argued, one 6,000 years ago and the other 5,000
years ago, as detected through the accumulation of strata.

<HEADLINE> Hemudu Culture Forced on Move by Flood (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second flood not only submerged the houses of the Hemudu
residents, but unexpectedly changed the course of a local river
called Yaojiang River.
</P>
<P>
The change in the river course posed a natural barrier to the
residents who usually went hunting for food in the hills on the
other side of the river.
</P>
<P>
Even more detrimental, seawater mixed back in along the new
river caused the soil to have saline in it, which made it sterile
and forced the residents to move.
</P>
<P>
Shao also pointed to the remnants of some big logs in the
Hemudu relics as traces of a flood. Only logs that serve as keels
in houses were held down while trigs and twitch grass used for
thatching the roofs were washed away, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the fact that the silt gets thicker eastward under
the Hemudu relics might be another factor pointing toward a flood,
he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Shao denied the theory of seawater invasion
as "not in line with the archaeological finding in the region."
</P>
<P>
None of the remnants like shells bequeathed by sea invasion had
ever been discovered in the vicinity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Shao emphasized that "sea invasion is gradual in
its effect and therefore could not annihilate a culture all of the
sudden like a flood, seaquake or an earthquake does."

first half of the year, despite limit imposed on fish output.
</P>
<P>
Sea-farming output increased by 31.5 percent over the same
period last year, a major impetus behind the province's rise in
total sea fishery production which hit 250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Like most coastal regions which put a limit on sea-fishery
output to preserve fishery resources, Jiangsu province mapped out
a plan at the beginning of the year, stipulating that the number
of fishing boats be cut in half and the fish output be reduced
from 680,000 tons in 1999 to 600,000 tons by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
In response to that, coastal regions in Jiangsu started to tap
the potential of sea-farming, either building new sea-farming
bases or converting fresh water bases into sea-farming ones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, advanced technology has been introduced in 40
percent of the sea-fishing area.

<HEADLINE> 20 Million People in E. Africa Face Severe Food Shortage: FAO Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- About 20 million people in
Eastern Africa are facing severe food shortage and is in urgent
need of food aid, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
warns in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 people in Tanzania alone need food assistance
as some areas of the country face acute food shortage, the August
issue of FAO's "Food Supply Situation and Crop Prospects in Sub-
Saharan Africa" says.
</P>
<P>
In the Eastern African region, the number of people facing "
critical" food deficits has increased by a staggering 3 million
compared with April this year, according to the FAO report.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, FAO estimates that nearly 3.3 million people need
urgent food aid. Some starvation-related deaths have been reported
among children in the hardest hit areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that livestock farmers are of particular
concern because they are facing the failure of the fourth
consecutive rainy season in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and Kenya are among 14 sub-Saharan African countries
facing "exceptional food emergencies".
</P>
<P>
Other countries in the same situation include Angola, Burundi,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sierra
Leone, Somalia and Sudan, which are suffering from the impact of
civil wars or conflicts.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Tutu Returns Home From US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu Thursday returned home from the
United States, where he had lived and worked for the past two
years as a visiting professor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media conference at Cape Town International
Airport upon arrival, Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said he
was seeking a much reduced involvement in public affairs.
</P>
<P>
"So those of you who are thinking: the Arch is back, now we are
going to have interviews with him -- this is your last interview,"
he joked.
</P>
<P>
"I really do want to have a much, much reduced public
involvement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the work of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (TRC) of which he is the chairman, Tutu said the
country had an obligation to those the TRC had identified as
victims of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
"When I spoke to President (Thabo) Mbeki in September last year,
and more recently when I met in Atlanta with him, there was no
question in his own mind that government would honor its
obligations to the victims," he said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
He also called for vigorous debate on the problems facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We must celebrate our differences. We ought to debate
vigorously... because dissent is not necessarily disloyalty," he
said.

"We are proud of women in the continent, especially in Nigeria,
where women have demonstrated their intellectual prowess in
various fields and any government attempts to ignore them in its

KAMPALA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said that African countries have no choice but to
industrialize, calling for the improvement of macro economy and
building of infrastructure so that investors can be attracted to
come and do business in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks when meeting with six visiting
British Members of Parliament led by Tony Worthington at the State
House in the capital Kampala Thursday afternoon, according to a
press release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
The president said the essence of debt relief is to enable
governments of the developing countries to build infrastructure
such as roads and schools.
</P>
<P>
Another way of helping African countries to develop is to
enable them to have access to European markets where they can
export their agricultural produce, said Museveni.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Reaffirms Decision to Quit COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has reaffirmed
its willingness to quit the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) next month despite calls by its private sector to
retain membership, newspapers here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Industries and Commerce Minister Idd Simba reiterated in a
report on measures to withdraw from COMESA that the country's
intention is based on its multiple membership in various
international organizations, some of which have similar goals.
</P>
<P>
"The country has opted to remain a member in the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and the East African
Community (EAC) blocs whose aims are similar to COMESA's," Simba
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that by pulling out Tanzania will only lose
Egypt, Eritrea, Djibouti, Ethiopia and the Sudan, which however,
have insignificant trade links with the country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture
President Elvis Musiba has argued the withdrawal is bound to
affect Tanzania's industrial and agricultural sectors which for
decades had strong ties with those in COMESA member states with a
combined 300 million people.
</P>
<P>
In April, Tanzania rejected a pleading by neighboring Kenya and
Uganda, claiming that it could not remain in all the three
regional blocs because it would have to adopt three individual
stands when negotiating with other regional organization and the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, a founder members of COMESA, announced the pullout
decision in July last year, blaming that a COMESA plan to reduce
customs tariffs for member countries by 90 percent would damage
its budget revenues and undermine local industries.
</P>
<P>
COMESA leaders are worried that other members, who also have
dual membership with SADC, may follow suit due to the problem of
duplication.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Tighten Control Over Diamond Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government is
determined to tighten its control over the country's diamond
production and trade with the approval of a protocol on fighting
the illicit trafficking of diamonds and the proposal of
reinforcing the auditing work in the diamond-producing and
commercializing sectors, an official document said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the Standing Committee of the
Angolan Council of Ministers said on Wednesday that the protocol
between Angola and Belgium is aimed at obtaining technical
assistance and adequate consultancy in the area of
commercialization and a major involvement of the international
community in the fight against the illicit diamond-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the council of ministers said that the
auditing work in the diamond-producing and commercializing sectors
will also be promoted, saying that the work will be executed by
firms of internationally recognized authority, mining societies
and associations in cooperation with the Angolan Diamonds Company
(Endiama).
</P>
<P>
The independent audits to the companies of the diamond
production in the country will verify the companies in compliance
with the fiscal and contract terms and the fulfilment of the
foreign exchange regulations on the part of the companies of the
mining sector and the justification of the debts attributed to the
Endiama.
</P>
<P>
The committee also paid much attention to the rehabilitation of
the diamond production in the country. One of the memorandums
recommends the new operating forms of the Endiama, with an aim to
make it an important instrument for fomenting and regulating of
the diamond activity.
</P>
<P>
The memo defines the ways in which the small and medium-scale
producers should operate so that the state can have a growing
control of the sector and benefit from its output.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Rebels Threaten to Resume Fight if Peace Deal not Implemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A Burundian Hutu rebel
group, Front for National Liberation (FROLINA), has threatened to
resume fighting if the peace agreement scheduled to be signed on
August 28 will not be smoothly implemented, the independent
Guardian newspaper reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chairman of the FROLINA National Joseph
Karumba as saying on Wednesday that FROLINA might be forced to go
back home and take up firearms, if the peace talks with moral and
material supports from both the Great Lakes region and
international community would end up as an abortive deal.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group leader said the implementation of a peace deal
should be accompanied by close monitor to avoid further bloodshed
in the tiny central African country in which over 250,000 people
have been slaughtered since a coup in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Some Burundian parties among the 19 involved in the peace
process being carried out in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha
were there "merely to waste time" and were not seriously committed
to the peace process nor manifested political will or seriousness
during the talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the signed peace accord will not be smoothly implemented
simply because of rigidity of few parties, FROLINA might opt for
going back to the bush," Karumba warned.
</P>
<P>
He stressed it was the hope of his party to see that the
international community and the Great Lakes region would not allow
any sort of obstruction to the signing of a peace accord later
this month.
</P>
<P>
However, the 19 parties featuring in the Arusha talks have not
solved several key issues, including who is going to lead the
transitional government and the timing of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The international facilitator in Burundi conflict, former South
African President Nelson Mandela is making efforts at different
levels for the parties to break the deadlock on the issues before
the signing of the final power-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
He has invited 23 heads of states to witness the signing of a
peace deal on August 28 in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The White House announced on Wednesday that President Bill
Clinton will visit Arusha at the end of this month to show U.S.
support for the Burundi peace process, which has started more than
two years ago to try to end the ethnic civil fighting between the
minority Tutsis, who control the government, and the majority
Hutus.

KAMPALA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Allied Democratic Forces (

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Slams Legislators Over Selfishness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has criticized a move by lawmakers to award themselves hefty
allowance "in total disregard of the hard economic conditions" in
the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Last month Kenya's 222 Members of Parliament secretly increased
their travelling allowance from 118,000 shillings (1,600 U.S.
dollars) a month to 336,000 shillings (4,480 dollars), which has
provoked a public outcry.
</P>
<P>
The legislators should have "first considered the economic
depression facing the country" before making such a move, Thursday
's Kenya Times quoted Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rise took effect on July 1 and only became public early
this month. In the current Kenya's parliamentary structure, the
president has no influence over matters on salaries and welfare of
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Kenyan legislators passed a bill to arm
themselves with guns and equip themselves with drivers while the
parliament paid the cost. The measure eventually aborted due to
strong opposition from the public.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The fuel supply situation has
remained critical in Zimbabwe with most service stations reported
to have dried up while only a few that still have limited supplies
experienced long queues of motorists, The Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Oil Industry Tom Walter said: "The overall
fuel supply is extremely critical countrywide," adding that there
will be "frequent stock-outs at service stations."
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe Webster
Muriritirwa confirmed that fuel stocks have reached critical
levels, calling on all motorists to conserve fuel in every way
possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taskforce on fuel also said the overall supply
situation in Zimbabwe is now extremely critical.
</P>
<P>
There will be frequent stock-outs at service stations and that
car owners should be patient and courteous when they meet with
long queues for fuel, it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The country has been experiencing an acute shortage of foreign
currency since December last year to import fuel. At least 14
million U.S. dollars is needed every month to acquire enough
supplies to meet the country's fuel needs.

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest against Police Brutality in Los Angeles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The march began at a nearby park then moved through the Gritty
Neighborhood near downtown. "No justice, no peace, no racist
police!" protesters shouted. "Racist, sexist, anti-gay, LAPD go
away!"
</P>
<P>
Protesters wearing white gags sat in front of the steps to the
station's entrance. As police arrested them for blocking a public
building, demonstrators went limp. Officers then carried them into
the station.
</P>
<P>
"It has been peaceful so far and the people are sitting down
and demanding to be arrested, and the police are facilitating
their request," said Cmdr. David Kalish, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Among those activists was state Sen. Tom Hayden, a member of
the Chicago 7, the group accused of conspiring to disrupt the 1968
Democratic convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Democratic convention week here, police have
maintained a pervasive presence in downtown Los Angeles, and it
was no different Wednesday as protesters geared up for a third day
of demonstrations around the convention.
</P>
<P>
Arrests during the first two days of protests totaled 152,
although violence was limited to a clash after a free protest
concert Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's confrontations included an animal-rights
demonstration in which anti-fur activists banged on the windows of
downtown businesses, leading to about 45 arrests. Police contended
the protesters planned to attack a McDonald's restaurant and other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 activists were arrested a few hours later when more
than 100 bicyclists tied up rush-hour traffic across downtown as
they demanded more bike lanes and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's protests were more peaceful than Monday's, when
police swinging batons from horseback and firing rubber bullets
broke up a crowd of several hundred people who had thrown rocks,
bottles and chunks of concrete at them after a free concert in the
protest zone.
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to file a
lawsuit Wednesday, accusing the Los Angeles Police Department of
deliberating targeting reporters during Monday night's
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Police denied they were targeting journalists.

<HEADLINE> Internet Surveyed to Surpass TV as Key Information Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 16 (Xinhua) -- After only five years as a
widespread communications tool, the Internet is viewed as an
important source of information of the vast majority of Americans
who use the online technology, according to a report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Responses to a select group of questions gave the Internet a
rating higher than for either television or radio, said brief
excerpts of the report from the Center for Communication Policy of
the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The full
Internet report is scheduled to be released in October.
</P>
<P>
In fact, more than two-thirds of respondents (67 percent) who
use the Internet consider the technology to be an "important" or "
extremely important" source of information, while 53 percent of
those surveyed rank television and 47 percent rank radio at the
same level.
</P>
<P>
Among non-users, however, only 26 percent ranked the Internet
as an important source of information. Topping the list to them
were books, followed by newspapers, television, radio, magazines
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Opinions varied widely among users and non-users about the
reliability and accuracy of information on the Internet, the
report said. While almost 55 percent of the Internet users said "
most" or "all" information in cyberspace is reliable and accurate,
only a third of non-users shared that opinion.
</P>
<P>
UCLA launched a long-term study last year examining the social,
political and economic effects of computer technology and the
Internet. The study was designed to survey computer users as well
as non-users in the United States, Singapore and Italy and then
expand to other countries.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Blue chip stocks on Wall Street
fell Wednesday as growing worries about corporate earnings over
the rest of the year triggered a selloff in retailers and banks.
But the technology shares rose.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 58.61 at 11,008.39,
extending its loss of 109.14 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 9.54 at 3,861.20 but the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 4.58 at 1,479.85.
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened higher in the wake of additional signs that the U.
S. economy is slowing and inflation remains under control. The
Commerce department reported that housing construction fell 3.3
percent in July to the lowest level in at least two years, and
meanwhile the Labor Department said consumer prices rose a mild 0.
2 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The reports gave investors more confidence that the Federal
Reserve Board will leave interest rates unchanged at a monetary
policy meeting on Tuesday, next week. The board has raised rates
for the six times in the past 14 months in a pre-emptive move to
cool off the U.S. economy and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
But investors sold stocks of retailers and banks in the late
session as worries arose from the slowing economy. They feared

<HEADLINE> Colombian Problem Affects All the Region: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Argentine Foreign Minister Adalberto
Giavarini agreed Wednesday here that the Colombian problem
concerning the war against drug trafficking affects all the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived Tuesday night for a two-day visit to
Argentina, told the press that Colombian President Andres Pastrana
must be given moral and technical support.
</P>
<P>
She said that she had talked with the Argentine foreign
minister about the mutual support to the democracies in America,
of the efforts to rescue Colombia from the clutch of drug
trafficking, the situation in Haiti and the importance of dialog "
to take to Peru some kind of democratic reform."
</P>
<P>
Albright and Giavarini praised the bilateral relations between
the two countries and the common commitment to defending the
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The visitor also met Wednesday with a group of representatives
of non-government organizations to talk on the investigation into
the loss of persons in Argentina during the military dictatorship,
and the use of World Bank funds to build plants to create jobs.

<HEADLINE> Gore Arrives In Los Angeles To Claim Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a short speech at the Burbank Airport, Gore declared "we're
the new guard and we're going to bring positive change to the
United States of America."
</P>
<P>
The vice-president, who will deliver the most important speech
of his life when he accepts the Democratic presidential nomination
Thursday, was greeted by his running mate Joe Lieberman,
California Gov. Gray Davis, Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan and
several hundred cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
"The victory starts in California," he told a welcoming rally
at Burbank Airport, running mate Joseph Lieberman at his side. "`I
need your help to fight for you."
</P>
<P>
Gore arrived moments before the Democratic National Convention
was called into session for its third day, to ratify his
nomination and Lieberman's, and to hear the vice-presidential
nominee's acceptance address and the presidential nominee's
address on Wednesday night and Thursday night respectively.
</P>
<P>
Previewing his speech, Gore told his supporters, "there are
some big choices we have to make and I'm looking forward to
addressing the nation at the convention podium tomorrow night with
some specific, hard choices that I believe we have to make in
order to ensure that we have a bright future."
</P>
<P>
"You deserve to know exactly what the candidates are proposing
to do so you can make an informed judgment. I'm going to tell you,
" Gore added.
</P>
<P>
A poll by the Voter.com Internet service found Gore had slipped
two points further behind Republican nominee, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, during the first two days of the four-day convention.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Gore's slippage, if confirmed by other surveys,
might have reflected a voter backlash against the rhetoric at the
convention, including a sharp attack on Bush by civil rights
leader Jesse Jackson and an appearance by Massachusetts Sen.
Edward Kennedy, a liberal icon who is less popular with
independent voters.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also noted that President Clinton was slated to boost
his deputy in his speech on Monday evening but devoted most of his
speech to his own accomplishments over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
Gore said his address accepting the Democratic nomination on
Thursday night will spell out the "specific, hard choices" the
nation faces as voters decide between him and Republican nominee
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
Gore listed some of his proposals: better pay for teachers, an
increase in the minimum wage, legislation to guarantee patients'
rights in HMOs, prescription drug benefits in Medicare, a hate
crimes law, mandatory gun locks, affirmative action, cleaner air
and water.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said the issues Gore will highlight in his own
speech have been clear for days, and he used a campaign appearance
with President Clinton on Tuesday to test-drive some rhetoric,
arguing for tax cuts aimed at workers, health care for the young
and elderly and education for all.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Improved Efficiency, Transparency of Procurement Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
taken a series of measures to open procurement opportunities to
more vendors in developing nations and countries with economies in
transition, a U.N. report on procurement reform said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These steps are among the initiatives launched by the U.N.
Secretariat to increase transparency and evaluation objectivity in
the organization's bidding process while increasing the cost-
effectiveness of its procurement activities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted the role that the procurement division's
website has played in raising awareness about U.N. opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"The secretariat has received feedback that the availability of
comprehensive information on the procurement division's website
has made United Nations procurement activities one of the most
transparent among international organizations," the report said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. procurement briefing material in CD-ROM and video formats
are produced and distributed to member states, field missions, U.N.
information centers and other U.N. offices away from headquarters,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to reach business communities that do not have
access to the Internet, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that "simple-to-read and replicate printed
literature in all the official languages on how to do business
with the United Nations has been produced and freely distributed."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations remains committed to ensuring that these
positive developments in procurement reform are sustained and
advanced, the report added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Kinshasa to Honor Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Wednesday urged the Congolese government to honor the 1999 Lusaka
agreement and move to bring about an end to the conflict in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Kinshasa government will reconsider its
refusal to honor the agreement it has signed and will join with
other parties in working toward the peaceful resolution of the
Congolese conflict," spokesman Philip Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
Reeker expressed regret that a summit meeting of 10 African
presidents which ended in Lusaka, Zambia, on Tuesday failed to
reach agreement on next steps to deal with the conflict in the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington continues to believe that the peace
agreement signed in Lusaka in 1999 "represents the most viable
means of achieving a just and stable peace for the peoples of the
Congo and the Great Lakes region."
</P>
<P>
Except for the Congolese government, he said, all parties to
the conflict have affirmed their collective desire to create
conditions for the full implementation of the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
At the Lusaka summit called by the Southern African Development
Community, Congolese President Laurent Kabila reportedly refused
to give ground on two key issues: the deployment of U.N. troops
and his rejection of former Botswana leader Ketumile Masire as the
organizer of all-party talks on the political future of the former
Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Unionists to Have More Power in United Ireland: Adams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The pro-British Unionists in
Northern Ireland could wield more influence in a united Ireland
than they do in the United Kingdom, said Sinn Fein President Gerry
Adams on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Irish Republican Army's political wing of
Sinn Fein claimed in a speech in the Northern Irish city of
Londonderry that the creation of a new, united Ireland made sense
for both communities and that republicans viewed the 1998 Good
Friday Agreement as a vehicle for achieving it.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the assertion of sovereignty by the British
government is contrary to the democratic wish of a majority of the
Irish people," he argued.
</P>
<P>
"Irish sovereignty is a fact in its own right and quite
separate from the entitlements of unionists and those who
categorize themselves as British," he added.
</P>
<P>
Adams denied that the republicans wanted to strip anyone who
considers themselves British of their cultural identity or deny
them the right to express it.
</P>
<P>
"The Good Friday Agreement is the foundation upon which new
relationships between unionists and nationalists and republicans
can be forged," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the struggle for full independence and
sovereignty throughout the island of Ireland had not ended.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein president was delivering a lecture in memory of
three IRA members killed by a bomb in June 1970.

WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. intelligence said on
Wednesday that it had detected no sign of life on board of the
Russian Submarine Kursk since it sank at the bottom of the Barents
Sea last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence officials said they had seen no evidence of, or
heard no evidence of survivors on the Submarine, on board of which
there are 116 sailors.
</P>
<P>
They said they did not know whether anyone survived the initial
incident or not.
</P>
<P>
The officials believed that the Kursk Submarine went down
because of an explosion on board and not because of a collision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intelligence would not say how they collected
information about the Kursk, but said that no radio communications
or banging on the hull had been detected. The officials however
cautioned that did not fully rule out survivors on board.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears GM-Fiat Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it has approved a cooperation agreement between the
U.S. automaker General Motors and its Italian counterpart Fiat
because their proposed joint activities would meet European Union'
s competition rules and benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
The two carmakers' agreement focuses on the areas of
powertrains, joint-purchase of car components among other
activities, which the EU executive Commission said would improve
the companies' ability to compete with other car manufacturers in
terms of quality, safety standards and prices.
</P>
<P>
"After an analysis and consultation of interested third parties,
" the EU executive believes that although Fiat and General Motors
will coordinate, on an exclusive basis, certain activities, the
alliance should benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
The two automakers told the EU in June that they had agreed to
set up joint ventures in Europe and Latin America. The EU filed
the agreement for regulatory clearance since then.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said components and parts account for a
considerable share of the cost of a new car and the increase in
the two companies' bargaining power could result in substantial
savings which would be passed on to the consumer in terms of
better safety standards and lower prices. It means the cooperation
conditions for an exemption from the EU competition rules are met.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation agreement provides for the creation of a
powertrain joint venture to be located in Turin, Italy, and a
purchasing joint venture to be based in Russelsheim in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Britain Joins Russian Submarine Rescue Operation </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday sent a
submarine and a team of 27 rescuers to help save the 118 Russian
sailors trapped in a submarine on the bed of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
A British aircraft carrying the mini-submarine and a team of 27
rescuers arrived at Trondheim in Norway on Wednesday afternoon, en
route to Murmansk, British Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The sending of the British rescue team came after Russian
authorities, in an about-turn, had finally asked Britain for help
in rescuing the seamen trapped on the disabled nuclear submarine,
Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The British team is to be joined by a Norway team with a diving
ship and a crew of 12 to 15 divers.
</P>
<P>
Russian rescuers, frustrated by bad weather off the Arctic
coast, are still trying to dock a capsule with the submarine,
which has been lying on the bed of the Barents Sea since an
unexplained accident last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russians said there had been no sign of life aboard the
submarine on Wednesday, but that this did not mean that there were
no survivors.
</P>
<P>
The crew was thought to have enough oxygen until Friday,
although the Russian navy has now revised that estimate to nine
days - until 25 August.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier called the situation "
critical".

<HEADLINE> Pilots of Crashed Helicopter Saved by U.S. Vessel: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Iranian pilots missing after
their helicopter crashed into the Persian Gulf Tuesday night have
been reportedly netted alive by an American vessel on the spot, an
informed source at Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry has demanded the Swiss embassy in
Tehran, which also represents U.S. interests in Iran, to launch a
probe into the issue and announce the results, the source told the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the international law, the witnesses and the
rescuers have to cooperate on the health condition and return of
the people suffered in an accident," the unnamed source added.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. have been hostile to each other since their
relations broke up in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day an official had predicted the survival of the
missing pilot and copilot.
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence to prove that the missing pilot and copilot of
Tuesday night's air crash are alive," Norollah Rezaei Niaraki,
managing-director of the Iranian Helicopter Services Organization
said.
</P>
<P>
A third occupant, identified as a 26-year-old Indian national,
was injured after the helicopter crashed near Saga platform in
Iran's South Pars gas field. Three other people, whose
nationalities are not clear, were rescued unharmed. No cause for
the accident has yet been given.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was chartered by Iran's South Pars Company and
was carrying the personnel of a Japanese contractor to Kish free
trade zone in Iran's Persian Gulf province of Hormozgan.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Calls for Eliminating Sectarianism in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah, or Party of God backed
by Syria and Iran, has announced its election platform which
stresses the elimination of sectarianism from the Lebanese
political system, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah Deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem, speaking at a news
conference on Tuesday, said the platform calls for the formation of
a national committee to recommend steps for the elimination of
political sectarianism, which was proposed in the 1989 Taif Accord,
the Arab-
brokered agreement that put an end to Lebanon's 15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Kassem also told reporters the names of Hezbollah's candidates
for the elections in Beirut, north Lebanon, the Bekaa and south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The party's platform said the next government will be urged to
carry out a comprehensive development plan for the "liberated
areas" in the southern and western Bekaa, while the party itself
will continue its efforts to ensure the release of Lebanese
prisoners held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The party will "resist normalization" of ties with Israel and
refuse to coexist with the Zionist invaders, said the platform,
adding Hezbollah will also oppose the settlement of Palestinian
refugees on Lebanese soil and "insist on their return to their
homes in the whole of Palestine."
</P>
<P>
The party reaffirmed its "continued hostility" to the United
States, "which favors and supports the Zionist entity". It
considers the Lebanese-Syrian alliance as "a source of strength to
both countries."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's platform calls for administration reforms to combat
corruption, a fair solution to the problem of the displaced, and
a new election law.
</P>
<P>
The parliament election will be held at the end of August. Some
128 legislators will be picked up from candidates. Hezbollah has
nine seats in the current parliament which has the power to approve
the nomination of prime minister and the formation of government.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes U.S. Order to Step up Inspection of Boeing 767 Elevator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Transport Minister Ibrahim
el-Demiri on Wednesday welcomed an order by the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) to step up inspection of Boeing 767
elevator control systems, calling it a positive sign for the probe
into last year's EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
The investigations, demanded by the Egyptian side last February,
are developing "in a good direction," el-Demiri told reporters upon
return to Cairo from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The minister was commenting on an upcoming "emergency
airworthiness directive" by the FAA, which will increase inspection
requirements for the system that controls the Boeing 767's
elevators.
</P>
<P>
The investigation has started to address various technical
aspects and this is "in our interests," he said, warning against
making premature judgements on the causes of the crash which killed
217 people.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian investigators have for months been asking their U.S.
counterparts to further investigate the possibility that a failure
of the elevator control system caused EgyptAir Flight 990 to crash
into the Atlantic shortly after take-off from New York airport on
October 31.
</P>
<P>
The two elevators located on the tail of a plane control the
upward or downward movement of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
FAA spokesman Les Dorr said on Wednesday the inspection
directive for Boeing 767s will be published soon. But he added the
decision was not linked to the EgyptAir crash or any other
incident.
</P>
<P>
But the Egyptian transport minister said the inspection order
has effectively rendered void accusations that an Egyptian pilot
deliberately crashed the plane into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. investigators suspect the relief co-pilot of EgyptAir
Flight 990, Gameel al-Battouti, downed the plane in an act of
suicide, according to leaks from the probe. Cairo has strongly
opposed the theory.
</P>
<P>
El-Demiri has been in the United States where he attended the
publication last week of 1,665 pages of factual reports related to
the crash.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Forecasts Higher Economic Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada's central bank forecast a
higher rate of 4.75 percent Wednesday than its May prediction of 4.
5 percent for the country's economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen declared a positive "
outlook for Canadian economic growth and inflation" in a statement,
reaffirming "economic activity in Canada remains strong" while
signs begin to show an economic slowdown in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The bank based its prediction on the report that growth
continued being strong at 3.5 to 4.25 percent with the core
inflation dropping to 1.4 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that demand may not yet have outstripped Canada'
s production capacity," according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thiessen cautioned about economic uncertainties
including the possibility of rising inflation pressures in the
United States in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The bank expects the U.S. Federal Reserve may have to further
raise interest rates in case the economy continues to be hot to
build up inflation pressure.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are some signs of slowing. But I think it's too
soon to say that we've really gotten the momentum of the U.S.
economy to a sustainable pace," Thiessen said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Asks for Interim Extension of U.N. Mission in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has recommended a one-month extension of the United
Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), known
as MONUC, to allow time to assess the impact of recent development
in the central African country, a U.N. spokesman said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mission's current mandate is set to expire on August 31
following the February 24 resolution of the Security Council,
under which Annan is expected to present his next report to the 15-
nation body on the status of MONUC by August 24.
</P>
<P>
However, in a letter to the Security Council released here
Wednesday, Annan requested that the Council consider an interim
extension of the Mission through September 30 to allow sufficient
time to assess the impact of the latest event and to formulate
appropriate recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the "adverse climate" in the DRC had so far
prevented the deployment of MONUC in accordance with the Council
resolutions, the U.N. chief called attention to the persistent
large-scale fighting in many parts of the country, formerly known
as Zaire, and the severe restrictions imposed by the DRC
authorities and other parties on MONUC's freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the "sustained campaign of vilification"
against MONUC and individual members of its staff, which had
created significant risks to their security.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace process, Annan said, was undergoing "an
extremely challenging phase," requiring substantial reevaluation
not only on the part of its signatories, but also of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The role that MONUC is to play under the current
circumstances remained unclear," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan emphasized that the implications of several
major developments -- including the August 14 summit meeting in
Lusaka, capital of Zambia, and Rwanda's statement about the
disengagement of its forces in Kasai, a DRC town -- should be
fully and taken into consideration before he submitted
recommendations to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held talks on Tuesday and will make a
decision on August 24 to extend the mandate of the U.N. mission.
The Security Council agreed in February to send 500 cease-fire
observers and 5,500 troops to protect them but has put the plans
on hold because Kinshasa has refused to let them to area under the
government control.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hipolito Mejia assumed Wednesday as the Dominican president for
the 2000-2004 period at a ceremony held at the National Assembly,
attended by delegations from 30 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"I will do whatever is necessary to achieve the food security
of the population," said the new president.
</P>
<P>
The new president said that the economy will be reactivated,
jobs will be created, health and education coverage will be
expanded, exports will be stimulated and there will be more
tourist development.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to work to control drug smuggling in the
Dominican Republic, which is a major transshipment point for
cocaine bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mejia, 59, an agronomist, won the May 16 presidential elections
as the candidate of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD).
</P>
<P>
Mejia succeeds Leonel Fernandez, the first modern leader of
this former Spanish colony of 8 million people. The pro-investment
policies and privatization of state monopolies helped boost the
economy by 40 percent in recent years but failed to lift most
Dominicans out of poverty.

<HEADLINE> France Suspends Concorde's Flying Certificate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,August 16(Xinhua)-- France suspended the flying
certificate of the Concorde supersonic aircraft on Wednesday,
following an identical decision by the British Civil Aviation
Authority on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The General Direction of the Civil Aviation of France made the
announcement hours after the Bureau of Accident Investigation (BEA)
recommended that the government suspend the flying certificate
until adequate security measures are taken on the plane.
</P>
<P>
Air France and British Airways were the only two air companies
in the world which used Concorde on their Europe-North America air
lines.
</P>
<P>
The flying certificate is issued to each individual plane
considered capable of making safe flight by the civil aviation
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Air France has suspended the flight of its remaining five
Concorde planes after one of such plane crashed on July 25 near
Paris.
</P>
<P>
British Airways suspended the flight of its Concorde planes on
Tuesday, nearly three weeks after the July 25 crash in which 113
people were killed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Reduce Antidrug Aid for Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States will give
Costa Rica only 2 million dollars in assistance to beef up the
joint patrolling program against drug trafficking,  Costa Rican
President Miguel Angel Rodriguez said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that the assistance, to be given in equipment in
the year 2001, is far less than the 15 million dollars agreed on
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Some aid has been obtained, not what we have a right to,
according to the signed treaties," said Rodriguez, explaining that
"Washington has not made available the resources budgeted for us.
They will give us one part, but the rest is still pending because
it is a commitment between countries."
</P>
<P>
The treaty for the joint patrolling between the United States
and Costa Rica was signed in October 1999 and became operational
on January 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaty, U.S. Navy ships and military personnel
can enter the Costa Rican territory, waters and skies to fight
drug trafficking for a period of 10 years.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Calls for End to Hostilities in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday called on all parties to end hostilities in Burundi "
without delay," and to "engage seriously in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The call came in a press statement after the 15-nation Council
held closed-door consultations, which included the updated
briefing by the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The statement, read to the press by Security Council President
Agam Hasmy of Malaysia, said, "Members of the Council reiterated
their call on all parties to end hostilities without delay."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council called on all parties to engage
seriously in the peace process and reiterated their strong support
for the facilitation efforts of (former South African) President (
Nelson) Mandela," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council looked forward to working very closely
with the facilitator in determining the appropriate role of the
United Nations," the statement said. "They would reflect further
on the complex issues surrounding the support that the United
Nations could give to any peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
The statement coincided with the meeting in South Africa
between President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi and Mandela, who is
mediating peace negotiations in the central African country. It
was the second time in two weeks Buyoya, who arrived in
Johannesburg, had come to South Africa to consult Mandela in a bid
to end a seven-year war, which is ethnic-based and pitting the
ruling Tutsi-dominated army against the majority Hutu people.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in seven
years of civil war between the army and the Hutu rebels. Neither
the Burundian government nor rebels have accepted a peace plan put
forward earlier this month by mediator Mandela to end the war.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: France, Britain Suspend Flying Certificate of Concorde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain Wednesday
suspended the flying certificate of the Concorde supersonic
aircraft, a rare move taken against a plane considered too risky
to fly.
</P>
<P>
After the British Airways suspended the flight of its seven
Concorde planes on Tuesday, doubt is rising as for whether the
plane, often called "the queen of the sky" because of its high
expenses and superb style of design, can ever fly again.
</P>
<P>
France has suspended the flight of all its remaining five
Concorde planes after one of its such planes crashed on July 25
near Paris, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in London and the General
Direction of Civil Aviation under the French Ministry of Transport
made the decision after receiving a recommendation from the French
Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA) and the British Air Accidents
Investigation Branch (AAIB).
</P>
<P>
Both the BEA and AAIB said that adequate security measures must
be taken on the plane before it can be allowed to fly again,
especially the part linked with its tires.
</P>
<P>
The cutting and explosion of a tire is considered to be the
primary cause of the crash on July 25, after a metal strip was
found among the debris on the runway of the plane.
</P>
<P>
A fire broke out in the rear part of the Concorde as soon as
the plane took off from the Roissy international airport. Experts
explained that the explosion of the tire could have damaged one or
two reservoirs and caused a massive leakage of oil.
</P>
<P>
But Sir Malcolm Field, president of CAA, said he cannot believe
the explosion of a tire could have brought about such a
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the flying certificate by the civil aviation
authorities is a rare move and means that the plane suspended is
too risky to fly.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the U.S. aviation authorities suspended the DC-10
plane's flying certificate after an air accident, but the
certificate was given back 37 days later.
