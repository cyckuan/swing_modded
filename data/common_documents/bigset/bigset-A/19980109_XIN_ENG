<HEADLINE> Israel's 1997 Financial Deficit Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's 1997 financial
deficit was only half of that for 1996, standing at 8.124 billion
shekels (about 2.32 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year's financial deficit represents 2.4 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP), 2.5 percentage points lower than
that of 1996, according to The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
It is also lower than the budgeted deficit of last year, which
was originally set to 9.744 billion shekels (2.78 billion
dollars), or 2.8 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Israeli Account General Shai Talmon as
saying that the main reason for the decrease was the privatizing
process of the state-owned companies, which has been accelerated
by the Likud government since it came to power one year and a half
ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that 8.5 billion shekels (2.43 billion dollars) was
earned from privatization in 1997, particularly the sale of
government interests in Bank Hapoalim, the largest bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"During the year of 1997, the government did not fund its
deficits by taking loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has been carrying out a large-scale economic
reform to reduce the financial deficit.

<HEADLINE> EU Becomes Bulgaria's Biggest Trade Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
become the biggest trade partner of Bulgaria, with the bilateral
trade in 1996 accounting for 35 percent of the country's total
trade volume, reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This compares with the 30 percent of Bulgaria's trade with the
former Soviet republics and nine percent with other central and
east European countries in the year, said Eurostat, the EU's
Luxembourg-based statistical office.
</P>
<P>
The EU's trade with Bulgaria expanded vigorously between 1990
and 1995, with imports and exports rising by an annual average of
25.8 percent and 17.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the Eurostat, Bulgaria's trade with its
traditional partners, particularly with the former Soviet
republics, has dropped since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Bulgaria's main EU trade partner, followed by Italy
and Greece, which accounted for 27.7 percent, 20.4 percent and
15.6 percent respectively of the EU's total trade with Bulgaria in
1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Record sharpest Decline in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. producers prices
paid by wholesalers fell in December for the ninth month this
year, bringing the price decline for 1997 to 1.2 percent, the
largest deflation since 1986, the Labor Department said today.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the 2.3 percent drop mainly because of
oil prices in 1986, declines last year were much more broad-based.
They ranged from gasoline to eggs to cars to computers, the
department noted.
</P>
<P>
In December, the department's Producer Price Index (PPI), which
measures prices paid to producers such as factories and
food-processing plants, fell 0.2 percent, the same as in November.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year, energy costs fell 6.4 percent after
shooting up 11.7 percent in 1996. Food prices fell 1 percent after
advancing 3.4 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
The so-called core rate of producer price inflation, finished
goods excluding the volatile food and energy components, moved a
0.1 percent higher for all of 1997 after rising 0.6 percent in
1996. It was the smallest rise on record since the department
began tracking the core rate in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The consumer prices still are increasing at about a 1.8 percent
rate in 1997, largely due to service prices. It was influenced by
tight U.S. labor markets.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices at year-end were 14.9 percent lower than 12
months earlier. Fuel oil fell 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Egg costs were down 15.6 percent; pork, 13.9 percent; chickens,
10.1 percent; fresh fruit, 9.6 percent, and processed fruit and
vegetables, 2.7 percent. Coffee, though, soared 18.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Household appliance prices fell 2.6 percent; cars, 1.7 percent
and light trucks, 3.1 percent. All were influenced by competition
with imports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Foreign Minister Keli
Walubita said today that Zambia needs to develop an aggressive
and dynamic foreign policy if it has to beat competition for
resources, investment, technology and markets in the world,
Zambia News Agency ZANA reported.
</P>
<P>
Opening a workshop on performance review for the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in Siavonga, a town on the Zambia-Zimbabwe
border, Walubita said that countries are becoming closely
interlinked through advanced means of communication, technology,
hence there is need for an aggressive foreign policy to enhance
investment flow into Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"Expenditure has shown that there is a strong link between a
dynamic and aggressive foreign policy and trade and investment
flow into a country, hence effective strategies should be
obvious," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He called on the participants to the workshop to devise
strategies that would take the country to the year 2001 and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
Walubita also stressed the need to strengthen relations with
the Democratic Republic of Congo, with which Zambia shares the
longest common border.
</P>
<P>
There is still potential for the two neighbours to increase
cooperation in mining, power and transport, communication and
other areas for the mutual benefit and development of the people
of the two countries, said Walubita.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is aimed at, among other issues, enabling the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to respond to some negative
sentiments about the country abroad, according to ZANA.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Steps up Anti-Piracy Campaign in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Computer software maker
Microsoft Corporation has stepped up its efforts to combat piracy
on the Zimbabwean market where an estimated 85 percent of all
installed software is being illegally used.
</P>
<P>
A microsoft spokesman said here today the company had sent out
letters of warning to 50 Zimbabwean organizations alerting them
to the dangers of using illegal software.
</P>
<P>
"The risk to business is enormous, over and above the fact
that users of pirated software are breaking international and
local laws," piracy manager Frederick Jonker said.
</P>
<P>
He said pirated software did not have the support of
manufacturers which meant any problems that may occur would not
be resolved by Microsoft certified solution providers.
</P>
<P>
The American firm is undertaking a two-pronged campaign to
eradicate piracy: a strong crackdown on offenders and an
awareness campaign aimed at getting organisations to legitimize
their software.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to dramatically reduce piracy rates in Zimbabwe
which are more than double those in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
Complimentary to the Microsoft campaign, the Business Software
Alliance will be conducting audits on companies that have not
legitimize their software and will also be stipulating a cut-off
date by which they should have legalized their operations.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to step up our campaign intensively in 1998 and we
look to organisations in the public and private sectors to give
us active support in this exercise," Jonker said.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO to Support Three Gorges Underwater Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Education,
Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO) has financed the
publication of an illustrated book covering the planning of an
underwater museum to protect ancient carvings on an 1.6-km ridge
in the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In the forward for the book, UNESCO Director General Federico
Mayor wrote: "UNESCO is delighted to join the Chinese Government
in an effort to preserve the White Crane Ridge."
</P>
<P>
White Crane Ridge, the rock formation which features carving of
18 fish, surfaced annually in the Yangtze River between spring
and summer when the water level is comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
Over the past millennia, local residents have traveled to the
ridge which also features some 30,000 inscriptions carved by poets
and local officials over the past 1,200 years.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists noted that inscriptions date to an earlier period
and are greater in number than the famous low-water carvings along
the Nile in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
However, the ridge will be permanently submerged upon completion
of the Three Gorges Project, China's largest water conservancy
project,
</P>
<P>
In hopes of preserving the carvings and keeping them in good
shape, Chinese experts have carried out geological studies and
underwater archeological research around the ridge, and have in
turn completed a detailed design for a museum.
</P>
<P>
The design calls for an underwater double-shelled structure
covering the inscriptions found on some 220 meters of the ridge.
</P>
<P>
So visitors will still be able to view the inscriptions via a
130 meter underwater passageway and exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
The project will be completed over the next 10 years at a cost
of approximately 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars).

<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
said today Britain must increase its efforts for a peaceful
settlement to the protracted conflict in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
A New Year message published in a newspaper of IRA's political
arm Sinn Fein said, "We reiterate our belief that all-party,
inclusive negotiations are crucial to the resolution of the
conflict between the British government and the Irish people."
</P>
<P>
"We leave 1997 behind, conscious that many nationalists are
impatient with the lack of progress in the negotiations process,"
said the outlawed IRA, which called a ceasefire with the British
government last July to enable Sinn Fein to attend the multi-party
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The fragile peace process founded on talks and ceasefire is in
crisis, with Protestant loyalist extremists declaring their
opposition to the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Some pro-British paramilitary groups have resorted to violence,
killing two Catholic nationalists since Christmas after a loyalist
extremist leader was killed in Maze prison by dissident
republicans opposed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam is going to meet
with both IRA and loyalist prisoners on Friday in a bid to
persuade them to support the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Supports Zimbabwe's Land Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan today said Zimbabwe's land reform
policy was justified.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on the first day of his visit to
Zimbabwe as part of his tour of 53 nations, Farrakhan said land
redistribution was proper provided it was done with equity and
without vengeance or evil intent.
</P>
<P>
"In the interest of the poor masses, in all equity and
fairness there should be land redistribution so that the poor
indigenous people can also grow and prosper," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added land redistribution was necessary because tracts of
land were seized from blacks during colonialism.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe was justified in asking Britain to fund the
land reform programme because most of its cities were built with
the wealth from Commonwealth nations.
</P>
<P>
British minister of state at the foreign and Commonwealth
office Tony Lloyd told journalists at the end of his two-day
visit to Zimbabwe on Wednesday his country had no direct
obligation to fund land reform in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The controversial Islamic leader also commended leaders of the
country's liberation struggle, president Robert Mugabe and
vice-president Joshua Nkomo, for their policy of reconciliation
which he said allowed whites to remain in Zimbabwe.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal Trains Midwives to Reduce Maternity Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has trained 1,500
midwives in the past years in efforts to reduce maternity and
child mortality rates in the country, the official RSS news agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Midwife Training Program aims to train 22,000
midwives by the year 2000, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 44,000 Nepalese women die annually from
pregnancy or labor.
</P>
<P>
About 92 percent of child deliveries in Nepal take place at
home and an average Nepalese woman gives birth to five or six
babies during her life time, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
A report entitled "Impact Assessment of Midwife Training"
issued Thursday said the trained midwives have been successful in
caring for lactating mothers and babies.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that the training program be extended from
the targeted 59 districts to all the 75 districts in the country,
the RSS said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Rights Organization Worries Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's human rights watchdog,
over the continued detention of the people connected with the
country's abortive military coup in 1997, Zambia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Lusaka this morning, the
commission's chairperson Judge Lombe Chibesakunda said 70 days
have passed since the first detentions were made but none of the
detainees have been charged or taken to court.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said over 90 people including former president
and opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda, have been detained for
alleged involvement in the coup under the state of emergency
declared by President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaunda was released from prison one week after he was
arrested last December and shifted to house arrest under a
presidential order.
</P>
<P>
Chibesakunda urged the detaining authorities to charge the
detainees and take them to court or release them.
</P>
<P>
She said the continued detention of restricted persons, though
lawful under the current state of emergency, is not conducive to
the building of a culture of human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Judge Chibesakunda also condemned the
harassment of both local and foreign journalists who have been
covering the case of Kaunda in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Journalists should be allowed to operate freely as they have a
duty to keep the nation informed, said the chairperson.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Law enforcement agencies in
the United States reported 8,759 hate crimes taking place in 1996,
with race-motivated incidents accounting for more than 60 percent,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the reported incidents, 5,396 was linked to racial bias,
1,401 to religious bias, 1,016 to sexual orientation bias, 940 to
ethnic bias and six to multiple biases.
</P>
<P>
"These statistics show what we long believed is true: hate
crimes have long gone under-reported," Attorney General Janet Reno
said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Violent crime has dropped for five years in a row, but we're
just beginning to grasp the problem of hate crimes and how best to
fight back, and we are not going to let up," Reno said.
</P>
<P>
Reno said she has asked all 93 U.S. attorneys to appoint hate
crime coordinators to meet in Washington next month to map out
strategies to fight hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
The FBI first began reporting hate crime statistics in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Bug Suspected Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- German police will be allowed to
bug suspected criminals in combating the country's rising crime,
thanks to a deal reached late Wednesday between the German
government and major opposition Social Democrats (SPD), which is
expected to pass the parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, which requires a change in the German
constitution, judges could approve police installing listening
devices in homes of suspects of serious crime, and of people who
might carry out major crimes, such as terrorism against the
public.
</P>
<P>
However, police would be barred from bugging conversations
between criminal suspects and religious figures or their lawyers.
The use of information bugged from doctors and lawyers would also
be limited.
</P>
<P>
The issue of police bugging has been debated in Germany for
years and such a need was made more acute only in the 1990s by
increasing organized and violent crime in the country.
</P>
<P>
Violent crime in Germany increased by 5.5 percent in 1996,
showed the latest available data. The number of crime cases
involving the use of firearms grew to 13,479 in 1996 from 12,855
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
German police launched 845 investigations into suspected
organized crime in 1996, compared to 787 in 1995. The economic
losses incurred by organized crime were estimated at 2.7 billion
marks (1.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 71 People Killed in Central Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kigali, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Details continue to emerge about
Monday-Tuesday night "Interahamwe" militia's attack on two
communes of Central Gitarama Prefecture since the beginning of
this week.
</P>
<P>
The two communes where unrest has heightened these days are
Nyakabanda and Nyabikenke, located north of Gitarama town, on the
border with north-western Rwanda which is a fertile ground for
armed insurgency.
</P>
<P>
"Monday night militiamen armed with guns, machetes, and small
hoes raided 25 families, slaughtering 52 people, and seriously
wounding 8 others," local authorities in Nyakabanda told Rwanda
News Agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Four of those who were injured in the raid succumbed to the
wounds later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It had been earlier announced that only 26 persons had lost
their lives, but fresh reports put the number of victims at 56 in
this commune alone.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were mainly concentrated on Ngaru and Nuabinoni
"sectors" --adminitrative entities --- where they used small hoes
to kill villagers.
</P>
<P>
The list of the victims in Nyakabanda include notably 10 local
leaders, 17 children, and 6 mothers.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen who reportedly launched their attack from
Satinskyi in Gisenyi were assisted by many Hulu villagers from
that commune.
</P>
<P>
In neighbouring Nyabikenke, the militiamen killed 14 people
the same Monday night and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
The commander of Gitarama-Kibuye Brigade, Col. Balthazar
Ndengeyinka, had told Rwanda News Agency on Wednesday that the
problems of insecurity in Central Gitarama are only localised in
three communes: Nyakabanda, Nyabikenke, and Dulinga.
</P>
<P>
All the three communes are on the extreme northern border of
Gitarama, in the vicinity of north-western Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Review Its Policy towards Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- In response to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami's call for cultural exchanges, the
United States would review its policy toward Iran on exchanges
restrictions, the White House said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that the
United States would review whether it is possible to lift visa
restrictions to allow exchanges of scholars and artists with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"In the aftermath of President Khatami's interview last
night, that will be examined by the president's foreign policy
advisers. It is too soon to speculate on what, if any action
may result," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami told CNN in an interview, broadcast on
Wednesday evening, that "nothing should prevent dialogue and
understanding between two nations, especially between their
scholars and thinkers."
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I recommend the exchange of professors, scholars,
writers, artists, journalists and tourists," he said in a
lengthy interview, which was seen as a message to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
McCurry welcomed Khatami's remarks, describing them as
"positive remarks about the United States."
</P>
<P>
"The president (Bill Clinton) appreciates those positive
remarks. We welcome the fact that he wants a dialogue with the
American people and between two great civilization. That can be
useful," he said.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry stressed the importance of direct contacts
between U.S. and Iranian governments.
</P>
<P>
"it's also important to stress that the best way for issues
to be addressed is for governments to talk directly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As for the scope of any such dialogue, our views on that I
believe are very well known. But ultimately improvement in
relations depend upon not just what Iran says but what Iran
does," he repeated U.S. consistent stand toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
The United States said any improvement in relations between the
two countries, which severed following the 1979 Islamic
revolutions in Iran, could only result from addressing such issues
as Iran's supporting terrorism, developing of weapons of mass
destruction and interference in the Middle East peace process,
which President Khatami denied in his interview with CNN.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Divides Pullback Decision into Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today his government's decision on further
redeployment in the West Bank would be divided into two parts and
conditional on the Palestinian fulfillment of commitments.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks at a meeting with heads of
coalition parties in a bid to rally support among hardliners to
the planned second phase of further redeployment. Rafael Eitan of
Tsomet, Aryeh Deri of Shas Party, Natan Sharansky of Israeli
Baaliya and Avigdor Khahalani of The Third Way were invited to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the pullback decision would be broken up into
two separate decisions.
</P>
<P>
He said the first decision on the scope of further pullback
would be made ahead of his scheduled trip to the United States
late this month.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat are to hold separate meetings in
Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton to discuss advancing
the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The second decision on the implementation of pullback would be
made months later based on the PNA's fulfillment of its
commitments, including fighting terrorism, amending the
Palestinian Covenant and extraditing Palestinian murderers.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's new idea on the long-delayed pullback seemed to be
an attempt to further postpone the redeployment to appease the
hardliners within his rightwing government.
</P>
<P>
Due to this week's resignation of Foreign Minister David Levy,
a leading moderate within the rightwing coalition, Netanyahu's
maneuvering room has been dramatically reduced. A group of
rightist lawmakers have threatened to topple Netanyahu if he goes
ahead with the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Many now doubt how Netanyahu could carry out the second
redeployment since his government has in fact become hostage of
the hardliners. Another dove within the government, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, threatened Wednesday night to resign
if the government could not implement the pullback within three
months.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu late today held a third meeting with visiting
U.S. special peace envoy Dennis Ross. Under the heightened
U.S. pressure, Netanyahu repeatedly assured Washington that he
would honor the promise he made on the redeployment. But he is
reportedly scaling down the proposed percentage of pullback in the
West Bank from over 10 percent to 8 percent in order to gain
support from the hardliners.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has made it clear that it would firmly reject anything
that is less than 10 percent. In fact, the PNA has been demanding
for a 30 percent withdrawal in every stage of the three-phased
pullbacks.

<HEADLINE> Mass Strike by Eastern German Steelworkers Averted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A mass strike by eastern Germany's
steelworkers has been averted in the last minute after employers
conceded to a trade union's demand for wage parity between eastern
and western German steelworkers, German press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise reached between eastern German steel
companies and the country's largest trade union IG Metall
Wednesday evening, employers have agreed to a 2.6 percent wage
hike for eastern Germany's 8,000 steelworkers for the period from
January this year to March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, each eastern German steelworker would also get a
one-time additional pay of 330 German marks (180 U.S. dollars) for
the period from October to December 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the IG Metall is hailing the deal as "a big victory for
the steelworkers", employers largely worried about the wage hike,
saying it had been agreed only under the threat of strike and
would risk the existence of eastern German steel companies with
about 80 percent of them already plagued by heavy losses at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
According to IG Metall's estimates, eastern German steelworkers
currently earn about 83 percent as much as their western German
fellow workers. But in the first half of 1997, each eastern German
steelworkers had produced about 250 tons of steel compared with
only 191 tons for a western German worker.
</P>
<P>
Employers however said that the productivity of the eastern
German steel industry was only about 77 percent of that in the
west.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Members Urged to Commit to Oil Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
today called on members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) to commit to their oil output quotas to shore up
world oil prices which have declined recently.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to UAE's Wam news agency, Minister of Oil and
Mineral Resources Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir said that over
production by OPEC members "would impose additional pressure" on
world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"The flood of excessed production in oil markets will impose
additional pressure on world prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation in oil markets demanded all OPEC
members to commit to their quotas to prevent the market from
being swamped by the flood," he said.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices began to go downhill after the OPEC decided in
November to increase its oil output ceiling from 24.1 million
barrels per day (bpd) to 27.5 million bpd this year.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend was accelerated during the last three months
when world oil prices dropped from 1997's averaged 19.43
U.S. dollars a barrel to this month's 15.9 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The oil price collapse was further deepened by other factors
including the over supply and the slackened world demand due to a
currency crisis spreading in Asia since the end of October, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Asian region accounts for a quarter of world oil demand and
over the past five years has contributed to nearly 50 percent of
the global growth in crude demand.

<HEADLINE> 4 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli soldiers and two
members of South Lebanese Army (SLA), the Israeli militia ally
were wounded this afternoon by a roadside bomb donated by Lebanese
guerillas, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of People said that the country's Islamic resistance
movement had claimed responsibility for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the movement said guerillas donated
the bomb at 2:12 p.m. local time (12:12 GMT) when an Israeli
patrol was travelling on the Heni-Yibel road in the central sector
of the Israeli self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio said its reporter inside the security zone witnessed
the explosion and described the sound of it as "very loud."
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for guerillas' attack, Israeli artillery fired
about 30 mortar rounds on the outskirts of several villages near
the explosion site.
</P>
<P>
The tit-for-tat conflict between Israeli troops and Lebanese
guerillas has lasted for more than 10 years since Israel carved
out a 1,200-square-kilometer area in south Lebanon as the
security zone to protect its northern towns from cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> PNA Criticizes Israel's Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today strongly criticized Israel's plan to build
new housing units in Efrat, a town near Bethlehem in the West
Bank, for Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
PNA Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi told Israel Radio
today that the planned construction of new housing units for
Jewish settlers in Efrat "is a serious blow to the American
efforts to revive the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"This new housing plan showed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
is determined to destroy the peace process before his government
is finished," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government on Wednesday approved construction of
574 housing units in Efrat, in defiance of a U.S. call for "time
out" on settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's Meretz Party and the peace movement "Peace
Now" also criticized this plan today.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid said that the new housing
construction plan is an obstacle to the peace process which could
trigger confrontations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ran Cohen, a Knesset (parliament) member of Meretz, also said
that the government's decision to build more housing units in
Efrat is an economic scandal.
</P>
<P>
He asked why the government agreed to allocate about 2 million
U.S. dollars to build more houses for the well-placed population
in Efrat while thousands of other families are waiting for
solutions of their housing problems.
</P>
<P>
The "Peace Now" pointed out that the new housing plan in Efrat
was the third of the type adopted by the government recently aimed
at expanding Jewish settlements, not for the natural population
growth as claimed by the government.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Urges S. Leone Junta to Abide by Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) today urged the military regime in Sierra
Leone to respect the peace plan to end the country's crisis,
restating that the deadline of April 22 this year for the junta
to quit remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing here this afternoon, Adrienne Yande Diop,
Information Director of the ECOWAS executive secretary, also
called for the strengthening of sanctions against the junta.
</P>
<P>
According to Yande Diop, the ECOWAS committee of five on
Sierra Leone has reiterated that the peace plan signed between it
and the junta in Conakry, Guinea, last October remained the best
framework for the restoration of peace and constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord provided for, among other things, the
immediate cessation of hostilities, the reinstatement of Kabbah's
government within six months, disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration of combatants beginning last december, and
humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, the junta said later that it would not step down
according to the schedule because of the delay in disarmament and
the arrival of international aids.
</P>
<P>
At its latest meeting on December 19 last year, the committee
accused the junta's move of disrupting the peace process in S.
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire
and Liberia noted the junta's violations of the ECOWAS and
U.N.sanctions, especially of arms embargo and travel
restrictions, Diop said.
</P>
<P>
They also deplored the junta's upgrading of an airstrip into a
full-fledged airport for the illegal importation of arms and
other supplies, as well as its unprovoked attacks on the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG has to retaliate," she added.
</P>
<P>
On what steps the committee is to take to deal with the latest
developments in Sierra Leone, the information director said,
"It's only a few weeks. You have to take time to see the
progress."
</P>
<P>
To enhance the operational capacity of ECOMOG, Nigeria has
recently deployed more troops to Sierra Leone, and Ghana has also
sent a vessel to join the ECOMOG fleet.
</P>
<P>
Diop stressed the junta's reluctance would not affect the
determination of west African countries to resolve the crisis
there because "peace and security is a pre-requisite for
the sub-region."

<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) decided
here today in principle to send a fact-finding delegation to
Algeria, where a series of killings have been reported recently.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose country is holding
the rotating the EU presidency, said in a statement that the EU
delegation would include representatives from the current EU

</P>
<P>
"It will also enable the EU to make clear to the Algerian
government the concern felt in Europe about the security situation
in Algeria and our desire to offer humanitarian assistance," he
added.
</P>
<P>
British government officials said that no concrete timetable
has been made about the EU visit, but EU officials had been in
touch with the Algerian government.
</P>

It was reported that some 1,000 Algerian civilians have been
killed in the first few days of the holy Moslem month of Ramamdan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Woman Posting Pig Leaflets Gets Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Jerusalem District Court
today sentenced Tatiana Susskin, who posted leaflets depicting the
Muslim Prophet Muhammad as a pig, to two years in prison plus
another year's suspended term.
</P>
<P>
Susskin, convicted late December of racism, threatening public
order and supporting extremist Jewish group, could face a
sentence of up to 26 years. But the court handed down the
relatively light sentence, citing she is not totally well
mentally.
</P>
<P>
Susskin, 26, from Jerusalem, was arrested in June after
posting the pig leaflets on the storefronts of Arab shops in the
West Bank city of Hebron. The leaflets sparked angry Muslim
protests worldwide and Palestinian violence in the territories.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, her defense lawyers had tried to convince the
court that she was too mentally ill to control her own actions.
</P>
<P>
But the court rejected the defense's argument and put her on
trial. Still, the court apparently took into consideration of her
mental state.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the posting of the leaflets, Susskin was also
found having committed other crimes against Arabs, such as
throwing stones at Palestinian cars and supporting the outlawed
Jewish extremist group the Kach Movement. While posting the pig
leaflets, she was wearing a yellow sweater bearing the Kach's
symbol of clenched fists.
</P>
<P>
By giving the sentence, the court said it was issuing a
message that Israel could not tolerate extremist actions, which
insulted Muslim not only in Israel but all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Susskin repeated that she had no regret for what she had done,
because she did it for her love of Israel.

LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) - Britain faces an increase in the
number of company collapses because of high interest rates and
falling economic growth.

Although business failures last year were at their lowest

KPMG's head of corporate recovery Mike Wheeler said: "The eight

"We are poised for an upturn in company collapses after that,"

LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Scottish Secretary
Donald Dewar said today he decided to stand for election to the
new Scottish Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Dewar, 60, is known as the principal architect of the "yes"
campaign in the recent referendum in Scotland. The parliament will
have wide powers in key areas of Scottish life such as health,
education, agriculture and the environment.
</P>
<P>
By announcing his decision, Dewar said in a statement: "The
relationship with the Government of the United Kingdom will be
crucial. The new parliament must earn the confidence of Scots."
</P>
<P>
As Labor is the dominant political party in Scotland, the
leader of its parliamentary group is virtually certain to become
First Minister.
</P>
<P>
The chances of Dewar getting this job increased earlier this
week when Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, tipped as a likely
candidate, said he planned to remain in his present post.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed Dewar's decision. He said at
a news conference he believed that "by going and standing for the

there, he will enhance both the Scottish Parliament and the whole

<HEADLINE> Survey: Majority of Israelis, Palestinians Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The majority of both Israelis
and Palestinians support the Oslo process, while the Israelis tend
to put more blame for impending the process on themselves than the
Palestinians, said a public opinion survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, issued here Thursday evening, was jointly conducted
by the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center and Tami Steinmetz
Center for Peace Research of Tel Aviv University in the last two
months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,185 Palestinians aged 18 and over and 1,002
Israelis of the same age were interviewed during the survey, with
the Palestinians being interviewed face-to-face, while the
Israelis answered questionaires through telephone.
</P>
<P>
As for the attitude towards the peace process, 59 percent
of the Israeli respondents support it, which is slightly lower
than the 68 percent in the Palestinian respondents, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the survey said, 59 percent of Palestinian and 62.5
percent of Israeli respondents are optimistic about the prospects
of concluding a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
On the question of the obstacle facing the peace process,
almost all Palestinian respondents referred to factors on the
Israeli side, such as Israeli intransigence (27 percent),
settlement activities (17 percent), Israel's Likud government (10
percent) and the Jerusalem issue (7 percent).
</P>
<P>
On the same question, 27 percent of the Israeli respondents
blamed the Israeli government and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for blocking the four-year-old Oslo peace process,
while 9 percent of them said the obstacle is terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On the question of personal security, 64 percent of the
Palestinians said there is an improvement in this regard since
the process began, but 55 percent of the Israelis said there is no
change.
</P>
<P>
As for expectations to peace, 65 percent of the Palestinian and
77 percent of Israeli respondents believe that they should
strengthen their support for peace, and relations in all fields
between the two peoples should be strengthened too.
</P>
<P>
The two groups also hold similar views on the need to have a
clear demarcated border between the two sides, with 63 percent of
the Palestinian and 81 percent of the Israeli respondents favoring
such a separation, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of assessing the other side's intentions, 89
percent of the Palestinian respondents believe that the Israeli
government does not want peace. The Israelis are of two minds
concerning the PNA, 56 percent of them believe the PNA is truly
interested in peace and 40 percent believe to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
Despite the asymmetry in the two peoples' situation and the
difference, the survey found a large majority of Israelis (70
percent) and Palestinians (73 percent) deem themselves "very
optimistic" or "optimistic" concerning the future generally.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia today agreed on
the limited partnership of foreign investors in the defense
industry, power generation and telecom sector, the Ethiopian News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The limited participation of private investors in these
sectors was suggested in a key-note address by Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi at the ruling party conference opened
yesterday in Jimma Town, some 340 kms away of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the third regular conference of the ruling
Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)
expressed the belief that the involvement of the entrepreneurs
would help the enhancement of the on-going rural centered
development strategy, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
After a thorough discussion on the issue, participants have
agreed on the limited involvement of foreign investors in the
telecom sector which demands huge funds for its expansion thus
hindering competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
With regard to tapping energy resources, the conference
accepted participation of foreign entrepreneurs in power
generation alone, leaving the supply and distribution to the
government, since it will be difficult to properly exploit the
potential the nation has in the sector due to capacity
limitations.
</P>
<P>
The participants also have agreed that some
of the defense industries under the auspices of the Ministry of
Defense, which could not operate through the use of local civil
resources alone, should begin producing mainly goods meant for
civil purpose through the involvement of foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> 65 Million Dollars Raised by Diana Tribute Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A Princess Diana tribute album by
the world's top music stars has raised 65 million U.S. dollars for
her favored charities.
</P>
<P>
Richard Branson, responsible for the fund raising, said today
that "the music industry worked together like never before" by
raising so much money in just four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six well-known singers from different countries, ranging
from Michael Jackson to Luciano Pavarotti, contributed to the
compilation record after Princess Diana died in a car crash
incident on August 31 of last year.
</P>
<P>
One million copies have been sold in Britain, and another 3
million around the world, Branson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
British famous singer Elton John's "Candle in the Wind," sung
at Diana's funeral, became the world's biggest-selling single
within a month of its September release.
</P>
<P>
Record producers believe that combined sales from the single
and the compilation album could top 100 million pounds -- twice
what Bob Geldof earned with his 1985 pop benefit concert for
African famine relief.
</P>
<P>
The official Princess Diana Memorial Fund set up its own record
label to ensure that all profits go directly to her favored
charities, which range from AIDS to land-mine victims and the
homeless.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Launches Investigation into Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Interior Minister Murat
Baseskioglu today ordered an extensive investigation into the
massive wave of illegal immigration to Italy, local TV reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Baseskioglu said that those organizers of the refugee
smuggling would be punished under the laws.
</P>
<P>
"An inspection commission composed of administrative and police
officials is now in charge of the investigation. If necessary,
additional officials from the relevant ministries will join them,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of Kurds from southeastern Turkey and northern
Iraq were transported through different ways to Italy since
last week, causing grave concern in Turkey, Italy as well as some
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police had tightened security measures in the largest
city of Istanbul and other harbor cities in an effort to stop more
immigrants from illegally heading for Italy.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of immigration organizers and hundreds of Kurds trying
to flee Turkey had been detained in Istanbul, local press reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Baseskioglu called for international coordination in handling
this large-scale illegal immigration since some people are from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
About 196 illegal Bangladeshi immigrants who were trying to go
to Europe via Turkey were freed Thursday by Turkish police, a
spokesman from the Bangladeshi Embassy in Ankara said.
</P>
<P>
Italy has said that it will grant some of the Kurds political
asylum if they are proved to face political prosecution in their
places, which angered Turkey and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli said earlier
that these Kurds fled their home to seek a better life in rich
European countries, stressing that this had nothing to do with
the alleged human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which has a population of nearly half a million
Kurds, accused Italy of adopting an open-door policy on this
issue, saying that this would possibly lead to a new wave of
Kurdish immigration to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Police heads from Turkey and six European countries gathered in
Rome Thursday to discuss how to deal with the current wave of
illegal immigration.

<HEADLINE> France Voices Support for Turkey's EU Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine today reiterated his country's support of Turkey's bid for
full European Union (EU) membership, the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who arrived here Wednesday on a one-day visit, made
the statement during his meeting with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
He said that France would do its utmost to help Turkey achieve
its goal of becoming a full EU member country.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, admitted that no country could forcibly
impose its will on the EU policy-making process, indicating that
Turkey has to make energetic efforts by itself.
</P>
<P>
"I am not an EU representative or envoy," Vedrine affirmed
repeatedly while answering reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine is the first minister of the EU countries to visit
Ankara since Turkey announced last month its suspension of
political dialog with the European bloc following its exclusion
from the EU enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister also hoped that Turkey would send
a delegation to an EU meeting scheduled for March in London aimed
at discussing the details of the upcoming accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had stated that it would not participate in the London
meeting because of the EU discriminative attitude regarding
Turkey's membership bid.
</P>
<P>
The EU invitation of some eastern European countries and
Cyprus to the enlargement process has angered Ankara, which
claimed that some of these countries had poorer conditions
compared with that of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU has always held that Turkey has to take pains to
improve its poor human rights record before being invited to the
membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also held talks with his Turkish counterpart Ismail
Cem earlier today, exchanging views on the ways of furthering
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign ministers agreed on the forming of a think tank
which aims to maintain routine contacts between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the possibility of President Suleyman
Demirel's state visit to Paris in mid-February.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS 1998 Programs Stick to Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) said today it will continue to undertake
programs aimed at promoting sub-regional integration and
development.
</P>
<P>
The areas that will catch the attention of ECOWAS this year
include trade, customs, tourism, transport, telecommunications,
energy and social and cultural affairs, ECOWAS information
director Adrienne Yande Diop disclosed at a news briefing here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member ECOWAS was established in 1975 as a sub-regional
economic bloc aimed at promoting development through economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
A lot of protocols have been signed to this effect and the
first of them is on the free movement of persons within member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gained achievements, problems remain as many of
the protocols are either waiting for some member states to ratify
or faced with hitches in implementation.
</P>
<P>
Even Travelers of one member countries with proper documents
to other countries are frequently harassed at immigration and
customs offices due to lack of knowledge of both the travelers
and the officers on free movement, according to Diop.
</P>
<P>
The information director also decried the ill-implementation
of the protocol on membership contribution, the financial source
of the ECOWAS executive secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Head of States of some member countries often forgot the
documents they had signed, leading to irregular and non-payment
of financial dues to the community, she claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the member states owe the
sub-regional organization a total of 44.7 million U.S. Dollars.
Some of them have not paid their contribution for more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat therefore decided to embark on an
enlightenment campaign this year designed to inform the people on
their rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
This is especially to promote travel within the sub-region and
check undue harassment by immigration and customs officials.
</P>
<P>
Work will continue to complete the trans-Sahelian highway from
Dakar, Senegal to Ndjamena, Chad, and the trans-coastal road from
Lagos, Nigeria to Nouakchott, Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
Both roads have been more than 85 percent completed.
</P>
<P>
The information director announced that the second ECOWAS
trade fair will be held in Accra, Ghana next month in a fresh
effort to promote trade among member states.
</P>
<P>
The first such event took place three years ago in Dakar.
</P>
<P>
Beside, the secretariat will undertake the organization of the
first ECOWAS tourism fair in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire this year,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made for the complete harmonization of
documents, regulations and custom formalities, as well as in
collective drug war.
</P>
<P>
In the field of social and cultural affairs, Diop said this
year's ECOWAS prize for excellence would be in literature.
Competition was in the field of pharmacopoeia last year.
</P>
<P>
The director did not forget to mention the work in the
information department, saying that ECOWAS has been in lack of
good communication to inform the world of what it has done for
many years.
</P>
<P>
She said one of the most important things is to go to
computerization and Internet so that everyone with a computer and
access to the international information network can easily get to
know the progress of ECOWAS.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Calls for Vigilance over Chechen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Thursday called on troops to be on the alert
against Chechen terrorist attacks, but disagreed to stage
preventive blows on Chechnya's terrorist bases.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a Chechen raid on a Russian tank unit in late
December last year, Chernomyrdin stressed that the "power" bodies,
including army, police and security, "must not permit such actions
to be performed on our territory."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin noted that the situation in the breakaway republic
and on its border with adjacent republics is difficult because
Chechen militants have repeatedly made brazen attacks on Russian
troops.
</P>
<P>
However, he resolutely stood against the pronouncements of
Interior Minister Anatoly Kilikov concerning the "preventive
blows" on the Chechen territory and proposed "a preventive bang"
on the negotiating table instead.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that Russia is "conducting a policy towards
reaching agreements." "We are constantly negotiating with the
authorities of the Chechen republic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin meanwhile emphasized that Cabinet members have no
right to express their own opinions on behalf of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) called
here today for urgent action to tackle the massive Kurdish
immigration which has caused panic in the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
British ministers, whose country is holding the current EU
presidency, held a special meeting with the EU Commission
officials in London to discuss the worsening immigration
situation.
</P>
<P>
A British official said after the meeting that both sides had
agreed on the urgency of the problem and the need for an action
plan to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The action plan, to be discussed by EU foreign ministers in
Brussels later this month, will cover ways of strengthening EU
border controls by tightening visa and asylum procedures, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 1,200 Kurds have arrived in Italy
since last week and other EU countries fear a huge wave of
immigration that could rush into their countries.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Trade Union Calls for Lifting Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Egyptian Trade
Union Federation (ETUF) Al Sayyed Rashed today called on the
United Nations and the Arab League (AL) to work for lifting the
seven-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a cable sent to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and AL
Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid, Rashed also urged the
international community to offer humanitarian aid to the Iraqi
people to ease their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Arab and international peace-loving
organizations to back, with "their potentialities and full
strength," the Iraqi workers' right, pledging ETUF's utmost
efforts in extending aid to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been suffering from lack of food and medicines under
the U.N. sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a show of solidarity with the Iraqi people, a ceremony is
planned here next Thursday to mark the collection of a million
signatures from Egyptians demanding an end to the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will feature a protest march attended by Egyptian
celebrities and representatives from the AL, universities, a
number of professional syndicates and organizations including the
ETUF.
</P>
<P>
The collection of signatures coincided with a visit of a
23-member Egyptian delegation to Baghdad last week to deliver
100,000 Egyptian pounds (about 30,000 U.S. dollars) of medicines
to Iraqi hospitals.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Ruling Party Pledges to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) today celebrated its 86th
anniversary, vowing to continue its struggle for fundamental
social transformation.
</P>
<P>
New ANC president Thabo Mbeki said at the party's anniversary
celebrations here that the ANC had helped build a better life for
all South Africans, and would continue on this path.
</P>
<P>
More people in South Africa now had access to health care,
more children had entered the school system and many homes, in
both rural and urban areas, had been electrified, said Mbeki, who
is also deputy president of the country.
</P>
<P>
The ANC leader, however, pointed out that not as much progress
had been achieved as the party had hoped. He stressed the need to
wage a determined struggle to overcome the terrible legacy of
apartheid which continued to define the nature of society.
</P>
<P>
South Africans need to be realistic and acknowledge that three
decades of apartheid damage could not be undone in three years of
democratic rule, Mbeki noted.
</P>
<P>
The black-dominated ANC took state power in May 1994 which saw
the first non-racial general elections in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
referring to crime issues, Mbeki pledged that his party would
do its best to root out crimes.
</P>
<P>
South Africa could not say it had attained a good quality of
life for all its citizens as long as it continued to allow crime,
the party chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Not only must we work to ensure that the people do not do
crime, we must also strive to ensure that they do not tolerate
it," Mbeki noted.
</P>
<P>
On world issues, Mbeki said that his party would continue to
strive to build a society which would contribute to the creation
of a better world order.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would act in solidarity with the people of
Palestine and peoples of other countries in addressing challenges
facing them, Mbeki said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Children Severely Malnourished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian scientist today painted a
gloomy picture of rising poverty in the country, saying that 87
percent of the child population in the country is severely malnourished.
</P>
<P>
According to Tunde Ajayi, acting Director of Nigerian Institute for
Oceanography and Marine Research (NIOMR), 35 percent of children under
five were under-weight, 43 percent stunted and nine percent wasted,
leaving only 13 percent of the juvenile population wholesome and
healthy.
</P>
<P>
Ahayi made the disclosure at the second review and planning meeting
of the nationally-coordinated research program in marine fisheries
held here today.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the problem to poor dietary protein supply, noting
that the trend had also made children to suffer both physical and
material devastation, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientist, researchers have focused on intergrated
fish, poultry, piggery and vegetable production to meet the country's
protein requirements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fisheries society of Nigeria President Sam Talabi has
criticized the lifting of the embargo on importation of frozen chicken
under the newly released 1998 government budget, saying that it would
adversely affect fish production in the country.
</P>
<P>
The President noted that fish production had been low in the
country that the government had to spend up to 20 billion Naira (about
250 million U.S. Dollars) on fish importation every year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas today described Turkey's questioning of Greek
sovereign rights as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Reppas was referring to comments by Turkish officials on the
development plans for Aegean islands by Greek Ministry for the
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Aegean Minister Elizabeth Papazoi announced Wednesday that
Greece planned to step up development in the Aegean islands this
year in order to help offset adverse economic repercussions
expected from European Union (EU) policies. Development planning
would be undertaken island by island on the basis of EU structural
funds for 2000-2006.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that these were European programs aimed at the
environmental protection and development.
</P>
<P>
As for the violations of Greece's airspace by Turkish
warplanes, he attributed them to an attempt by Turkey to deflect
attention from its domestic problems instead of trying to solve
them.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece would be making a strong protest.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 Turkish F-16 and 12 F-4 jet fighters violated
Greek national airspace today throughout the Athens Flight
Information Region (FIR) without submitting flight plans, and all
of them were successfully intercepted by Greece's fighter planes,
according to Greek Defense Ministry sources today.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Names New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Newly re-elected Kenyan
President Daniel Arap Moi today announced the list of a new
cabinet excluding the vice president.
</P>
<P>
Simeon Nyachae will replace Musalia Mudavadi as new Finance
Minister, according to a statement from the Presidential Press
Services (PPS).
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka moved to the Education
Ministry and was replaced by Bonaya Godana, the former Deputy
Speaker of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Biwott and Jackson Kalweo, former key ministers in
the president's office, have been given their own departments to
run and are replaced by Marsden Madoka and Gideon Ndambuki.
</P>
<P>
"I have spent many hours to decide who, among the elected
representatives of wananchi (the broad masses) will assist me in
managing the affairs of our beloved nation," Moi said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet list showed sweeping changes after 12 members of
Moi's 25-strong cabinet failed to win their parliamentary seats
in the just-ended general elections.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the lack of a vice-president
suggested a power struggle within the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) had still not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
KANU had its parliamentary majority significantly reduced in
last week's elections with many of the party faithful complaining
that its queue system of nominating would-be MPs had
disenfranchised supporters.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 73 and in power since 1978, won a fifth and final
five-year term in last week's elections while KANU won 106
parliamentary seats against the combined opposition's 104.
</P>
<P>
A further 12 lawmakers will be appointed according to elected
party strength in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
There are no women in Moi's cabinet, but he has formed a new
ministry to deal with women's and youth affairs. Its minister is
Maalim Mohamed.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Likely to Increase Sugar Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has the prospect of
exporting more than 300,000 tons of sugar worth about 100 million
U.S. dollars this year, sources from the sugar industry said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have begun with various international buyers to
sell sugar at the London Commodity Exchange, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's sugar industry is likely to produce 3.2 million tons
of sugar this year as the country had a bumper sugarcane crop of
about 52 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sugar industry has a sufficient held-up stock
of sugar at the mills, leaving at least 600,000 to 800,000 tons of
sugar for export after meeting the domestic demand of 2.8 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar has indicated that the
government may consider allowing 200,000 tons of sugar to be
exported in addition to the existing limit of 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) recently gave
approval for exporting 300,000 tons of sugar.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the local media Friday, Dar said the government now
would maintain the restriction of sugar export at 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"But it can be increased to 500,000 tons subject to the actual
figure of its production," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Electronics Sale to Boom in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Sales of home information
products will outpace sales of home entertainment products in the
United States in 1998, the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Association (CEMA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"While home entertainment continues to be an important segment
of the consumer electronics industry, home information has become
the largest and fastest growing product group," CEMA President
Gary Shapiro said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the home information product, including personal
computers, modems, printers, monitors and cordless phones will
generate sales of 34.5 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Combining home entertainment products such as TV sets, digital
versatile disc and audio products, sales of consumer electronics
products will grow 5 percent to a record 75.6 billion dollars in
1998, said the CEMA, organizer of the International Consumer
Electronics Show which opened here earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,800 makers of such consumer electronics as stereos,
TV sets, phones, Internet products, cameras, video cameras and
home theater systems are parading their wares at the show with
more than 100,000 attendees expected.
</P>
<P>
Digital products, including digital television, digital cameras
and digital versatile disc, take an important position at the show.
</P>
<P>
The CEMA estimated that factory sales of consumer electronics
products will reach 92 billion dollars in 2001.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Balloonists Launch Nonstop Round-World Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. balloonists launched
a 52-meter silver balloon into the sky earlier this morning in New
Mexico to bid to make aviation history by circling the globe
without stopping.
</P>
<P>
Dick Rutan, 59, and Dave Melton, 39, floated the ball-shaped
Global Hilton balloon into the clear pre-dawn sky with wind about
9 kph out of the southeast.
</P>
<P>
The liftoff came three days after weather conditions forced a
delay.
</P>
<P>
The Global Hilton is a combination hot-air balloon and helium
balloon, with 18 propane tanks to fuel the flames that warm the
gas. It was planned to rise immediately 9,700 meters into the jet
stream and ride 300 kph air currents around the world in about 14
days.
</P>
<P>
As the balloon's white capsule is pressurized, it can safely
fly at high altitudes in strong wind currents.
</P>
<P>
Rutan is a former Air Force pilot from Mojave, California, who
helped fly the experimental plane Voyager around the world nonstop
11 years ago. Melton has three time of balloon experiences.
</P>
<P>
It was the third such attempt by a balloon team to circle the
globe since December 31.
</P>
<P>
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett ended his fourth
round-the-world bid Monday when he landed on the edge of the Black
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Fossett had hoped to break his own record of traveling 10,361
miles in a balloon in six days and two and a half hours set in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Another balloonist, Kevin Uliassi, left Loves Park, Illinois,
on New Year's Eve but an equipment problem forced him to land a
few hours later in Indiana.

<HEADLINE> New HIV/AIDS Intervention Measures Gain International Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Funding from governments and
organizations from overseas will enable Chinese AIDS control
experts to carry out a number of new programs, including promoting
the use condoms and publishing literature on AIDS to enhance the
awareness of primary school students.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 plans for blocking the further spread of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in China have been submitted to
representatives from more than 40 foreign embassies and
international organizations with the means to provide financial
and technological support.
</P>
<P>
The programs included establishing an Internet HIV/AIDS
information center, promoting the use of condoms amongst high-risk
groups, and publishing textbooks about sex and AIDS for school
children.
</P>
<P>
"The programs will undoubtedly help China curb the HIV/AIDS
epidemic. However, the major problem centers on the lack of
technology and capital," according to Liu Peilong, director of
Department of International Cooperation under the Ministry of
Health (MOH). Liu made the remarks today during the International
Donor's Meeting on HIV/AIDS Control in China.
</P>
<P>
China documented 8,303 cases of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) by the end of October 1997, with 209 cases involving fully
developed AIDS and an additional 119 cases involving death.
</P>
<P>
However, experts estimated that the country had between
150,000-200,000 HIV cases by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is fully prepared to the international
community in a concerted effort to battle HIV/AIDS," according to
State Councillor Peng Peiyun.
</P>
<P>
Developers of the related programs joined foreign diplomats and
representatives from the European Union, The Ford Foundation, the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and various other
organizations today in discussions of the feasibility of proposed
project.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of said programs will enable China to make
progress in developing omnidirectional projects, raise the level
of public awareness concerning AIDS prevention and control issues,
guarantee safety in health care settings and improve care for
people suffering from HIV/AIDS, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
An effective and scientific surveillance system will be created
and community participation in all aspects of HIV programs will be
enhanced, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the meeting was to "strengthen the international
community's awareness of the HIV/AIDS situation in China and
promote greater participation in control efforts", and to "ensure
all possible international support will be forthcoming," according
to Arthur Holcombe, resident coordinator of UN operational
activities in China.

<HEADLINE> Five Nepali Ministers Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Five Nepali cabinet ministers
tendered their resignations Friday as Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa waited for King Birendra's decision on his proposal
to hold mid-term polls, state-run radio said.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra has accepted the resignations submitted to the
prime minister by Defense Minister Fateh Singh Tharu, Minister for
Science and Technology Rajiv Parajuli and three ministers without
portfolio, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
The resignations come as no surprise as the five ministers, all
from Thapa's own National Democratic Party (RPP), have joined
hands with the opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) in initiating a no-confidence motion
against the present coalition government.
</P>
<P>
These ministers plus 87 MPs from the CPN-UML on Thursday
requested the King to convene a special session of the parliament
to discuss their no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
To preempt the move, Thapa on Thursday asked the King to
dissolve parliament and hold mid-term polls.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra has been consulting with his advisors and former
prime ministers about the situation in the country, but no
decision has been made yet, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Thapa came to power on October 7, 1997 as the head of a
three-party coalition formed by the Nepali Congress, the RPP and
the Nepal Sadbhavana Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese armed forces must
fully understand the profound changes in the world strategic
patterns and the trends in worldwide military development in order
to improve the quality of the Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
General Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission
and Chief of General Staff, made the remarks today at a
military conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The army must condense its power and boost morale with
cross-century strategic goals, said Fu.
</P>
<P>
The army should proceed under the guidance of Mao Zedong's
military thinking, Deng Xiaoping's theories on defense
modernization during the new period, and Jiang Zemin's
instructions on related issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The army should focus its efforts on increasing combat
effectiveness, improving the quality of its men and developing
hi-tech equipment, according to the general.
</P>
<P>
The army should build a highly efficient structure and be fully
prepared to face challenges in worldwide military development in
order to gain a strategic advantage in the next century, said Fu.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China had documented 8,303 cases
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by the end of October 1997,
with 209 cases involving fully developed acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 119 patients having died from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health (MOH) released the figures today, and
vowed to control the epidemic level at under 1.5 million cases by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"The spread of HIV/AIDS entered into a period of rapid growth,
namely HIV infections resulting from sexual activity and contact
with contaminated blood, as well as infant HIV infection,
according to Minister of Health Chen Minzhang.
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drug use accounted for 5,495 cases, with additional
547 HIV/AIDS cases resulting from heterosexual
contacts. Homosexual behavior and the using contaminated blood
products were also held responsible for a limited number of cases.
</P>
<P>
The ration of male to female HIV/AIDS patients stood at
5:1. Patients in the 20-39 age group accounted for about 78
percent of the total, according to Ministry of Health statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, AIDS experts estimated that China had 150,000 to
200,000 persons testing HIV positive by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they warned that any failure to promptly adopt
effective measures could possibly increase the number to one
million by the year 2000 and as many as 10 million by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
"The multiple use of needles and the growth of prostitution have
emerged as two major risks raising the possibility of an outbrake
of HIV/AIDS in China," they acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"We will work hard to control epidemic level at under 1.5
million cases during the next 12 years," said Wang Zhao, director
of the MOH Disease Control Department.

She noted that China will strive to improve its national
HIV/AIDS prevention and control network which is under leadership
of the central government in cooperation with governmental
departments and people from all sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
"We must halt HIV transmissions through blood transfusions by

the annual growth rate of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) at
a level below 15 percent," according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The goals are explicitly defined in medium- and long-term Plans

fleet.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by Greek Defense Minister Akis

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nadibaidze hailed the signing of the agreements as
the continuation of the exceptional military and political
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Greek-Georgian relations have been developing

<HEADLINE> Domestic Electronics Manufacturers Facing Fierce Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite boasting a rapidly
increasing market share in 1997, China's household electronics
appliance manufacturers will face growing tough competition with
foreign brands on the domestic market during 1998, according to a
survey conducted by the State Statistical Bureau and China
Statistical Society.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the domestic color television market, the report
noted that market share of such foreign brands such as Panasonic,
Philips, Sony and Samsung have rebounded from a year-long
decline. Panasonic and Philips ranked on the list of top 10
bestsellers on Chinese market during 1997.
</P>
<P>
Domestic color TV manufacturers have little room for further
price reductions, and could very possibly lose market share to the
foreign rivals whose technology and capital advantage are far from
being challenged by Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign brands held a 5.51 percent share of the refrigerator
market in 1997, with Panasonic and Sony once again included on the
list of top 10 bestsellers.
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledged that foreign companies will most likely
gain an even greater share of the refrigerator market in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition to introducing their own VCD players to the Chinese
market, foreign companies have accelerated the promotion of DVD
products and are quickly breaking the dominance of Chinese VCD
manufacturers on the video products market.
</P>
<P>
Various foreign companies will introduce DVD players priced at
some 2,000 yuan (US$241) this year, and will in turn spark a
rising DVD consumption in China, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The only way for Chinese household appliance manufacturers to
survive the fierce market competition is to accelerate technical
renovations and launch new products, rather than simply engage in
a cut-throat price war, the report said.

out a package of comprehensive measures to deal with the issue of
prison overcrowding and the situation would be improved gradually.
</P>
<P>

DHAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi left here for home on Friday following the singing of a
joint agreement on chambers of commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Italian investors are very keen to invest in Bangladesh,"
Prodi told a press conference at the airport at the end of his

<P>
Jiang Zemin said that China would increase the output of
agricultural produce, raise the annual income of farmers and
maintain a steady rural development no matter what difficulties it
might encounter this year.
</P>
<P>
As the year 1998 is the first year to implement the principles
and policies set forth at the 15th CPC National Congress held in
September 1997, there are many arduous tasks ahead in reform,
economic development and social stability, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Last year's agricultural production was a good one following
two years of consecutive good harvests, paving the way for the
country's economic growth and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attributed the good harvests to concerted efforts by
farmers under the leadership of Party committees and governments
at all levels as well as support from other trades. He also
extended cordial greetings to those working in the agricultural
industry on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to guard against laxity after good harvests and
attach more importance to studying the changing situation and new
problems, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding problems in rural areas now include weak sales in
farm produce, a drop in prices and slower growth in farmers'
income, Jiang said, adding that they will hamper social stability
if the country fails to find a timely and effective solution.

<P>
A key to doing a good job in rural areas is to stabilize all
policies, especially the Party's policies on the land-contract
system, grain purchases and alleviation of farmers' burdens, the
Party general secretary said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a breakthrough must be made in optimizing the
rural economic structure, raising farmers' incomes and maintaining
a balanced development between rural capital construction and
ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said a welcome trend is the building of the joint stock
cooperative system in collective enterprises at the township
level. The system will be operated in a down-to-earth manner to
make it more popular among the masses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the system should be based on the principle
of seeking truth from facts and be carried out in the light of
conditions of different areas. "There is no need to rush headlong
into mass action," he said. "Collective assets should not be
allowed to become the personal assets of a tiny number of people,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Party general secretary called on leading officials at all
levels to effectively improve their work styles and to go deeper
into the grassroots level to investigate and study new problems.
</P>
<P>
Leaders at the county level were urged to meet the masses of
farmers and help them solve concrete problems, render all kinds of
services and provide them with new ways to get well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
Many management and technical people with varied educational
backgrounds will be trained to meet the needs of rural development
through adjusting the existing educational structure in rural
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The democratic electoral system practiced in rural villages
will continue to improve, he said. Village affairs management and
accounts should be made public, he said, and democratic
supervision over rural officials should be tightened.

Under the new blueprint, the per-capita net income of farmers
will be raised by 5 percent, and the rural population living below
the poverty line will be reduced by more than 10 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The accomplishment of the above tasks will lay a solid
foundation for reaching the goal of reaping an annual grain output
of 500 million tons, ensuring that farmers living a comfortable
life, and guaranteeing enough food and clothing for people living
in poor areas by the end of the century, according to a document
released at the conference.
</P>
<P>
General guidelines formulated at the conference called for
upholding the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and
implementing the policies worked out at the 15th National Congress
of the CPC in an all-round manner.
</P>
<P>
The conference stressed steady progress in agricultural work,
called for continuing to stabilize and consolidate the status of
agriculture as the base of all sectors and implementing the basic
policies of the CPC in rural areas, as well as stabilizing the
gross output of farm produce and maintaining social order in rural
areas.

<P>
Good or poor agricultural harvests rely heavily on farmers'
initiative, which in turn hinges on the Party's rural
policies. So, governments at all levels must be held accountable
to carrying out Party policies, including the household-based
contract responsibility system and policies to ease the farmers'
financial burdens and purchase any amount of grain from farmers at
protective prices.
</P>
<P>
China is experiencing a shift from a self-sufficient farming
sector to a commodity-oriented one and from a traditional farming
sector to a modern one. Therefore, efforts should be made to
improve the agricultural structure to adapt to a socialist
market economy. The farm product processing industry should be
developed and made into a new rural economic growth area, as well
as a pillar industry of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
In restructuring the rural industrial structure, it is
essential to improve to market analyses and prediction, and
provide timely and accurate market information for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Attention should be focused on cultivating country fairs and
farm produce wholesale markets, and on enlivening distribution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, positive and proper measures should be taken to
promote market-oriented agricultural industrialization, and to
foster and support leading enterprises, which will serve as
examples in rural areas in opening up markets, guiding production,
and participating in sales.

<P>
The agricultural infrastructure remains a weak link and
vulnerable to natural disasters, with inadequate applications of
science and technology to agriculture. A step forward for
agriculture will require the intensification of various production
factors and increase agriculture's comprehensive production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Leaders at all levels must take agro-sciences as the primary
productive force, gradually promote farm mechanization and make a
greater effort to fight poverty. Furthermore, governments and
departments at all levels should continue to carry out
preferential policies for and increase investment in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, efforts should also be made to promote rural reforms,
especially to solve outstanding problems that hinder the
development of productivity. However, these reforms should be
tried out before widespread application.
</P>
<P>
Focuses should be placed on building the Party's organizations at
the village level to promote a democratic system characterized by
an open administration and democratic management.
</P>
<P>
The household contract responsibility system introduced in the
early 1980s has brought farmers' initiative in production into
full play. A sound democratic system could arouse the farmers'
political enthusiasm and this in turn will promote economic and
social prosperity in rural areas, the conference said.

JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto on
Friday met with three ministers, a military official and an
economic advisor, and is aware of rumors of a coup d'etat at the
Presidential Palace, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"The president received his guests from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.
and gave instructions to his ministers," the official Antara News
Agency quoted Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the president was aware rumors that he was very ill
were circulating.
</P>
<P>
"Those reports are groundless," Moerdiono said. He also denied
that the head of state along with his family had left the country.
</P>
<P>
On suggestions by several parties to hold a national dialogue
on ways to overcome the current monetary crisis, Moerdiono said
the crisis could not be overcome merely with a national dialogue.
</P>
<P>
More concrete measures would be needed, he said.
</P>

The monetary crisis, which started early July last year in
Southeast Asia, has brought great losses to Indonesia's economy.
The country's currency, the rupiah, has declined by about 300
percent against the U.S. dollar since last July.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has also caused Indonesia's economic growth rate to
fall from 7.98 percent in 1996 to 5.1 percent in 1997. The
country's inflation rate rose to 11.5 percent last year from 6.47
percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> CSA to Punish Swimmer Yuan Yuan and Coach Zhou Zhewen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Swimming Association
(CSA) will punish swimmer Yuan Yuan and coach Zhou Zhewen who both
were involved taking a banned drug into Australia, said the
Chinese delegation leader Shi Tianshu on Firday night.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation shall deprive these two people of the
right to participate in the current world championships," Shi
said. "Further action will be taken in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the Chinese Swimming Association, and the FINA
will be duly informed of the result."
</P>
<P>
In a routine baggage check at the Sydney Airport, Yuan was
found to have in her bag a suspicious substance which a laboratory
in Sydney confirmed on Friday is growth hormone, a drug usually
used to cure children slow growth but banned in sports.
</P>
<P>
"According to swimming coach Zhou Zhewen, before they came here
someone asked him to take the substance over here. This is their
individual behavior and they will be responsible for all the
consequences thus arising," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation leader reaffirmed CSA's stand at
fighting performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Swimming Association insists on the policy of
strick prohibition, strick examination and strict sanction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The number of drug tests that CSA conducted among its swimmers
in 1997 can reflect the Chinese swimming body's determination to
fight against doping, Shi noted.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we conducted over 600 tests, including 460
out-of-competition checks, on Chinese swimmers and none turned out
positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The world swimming ruling body FINA did 104 flight tests on
Chinese swimmers last year and all of these tests were negative,
the team leader added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, FINA secretary general Gunnar Werner said that FINA
Bureau won't punish Yuan and Zhou pending its doping penal's
hearing on this issue.

PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The French police Friday blocked
an election campaign caravan of the extreme-right National Front
(FN) in the central seventh district of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported the caravan, consisting of
six vehicles covered with posters, were prepared to go around town
in a campaign for the regional elections scheduled for March.
</P>
<P>
The police stopped the caravan from moving ahead because it
would cause traffic jams and the FN had not applied for
permission, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
However, Jean-Yves Le Gallou, the FN candidate for presidency
of the regional council, or local parliament, of the Paris region,
said police officers told him the caravan was stopped because of
its posters.
</P>
<P>
The FN candidates for the deputies of the regional council
meeting at a location nearby immediately denounced the police
action as "an attack on democracy and freedom of expression."

Leonard Appleyard said today that he looks forward to expanded
educational cooperation between Britain and China in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the '98 British Education Exhibition, which
was opened here today, Appleyard said cooperation is expanding
in the educational field of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cooperation, which has extended from
standard academic areas to business and industrial training, has
helped promote commercial and technical development between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
Related efforts will enhance the skills and expertise required
for the future prosperity of the two countries, said Appleyard.
</P>
<P>
The three-day exhibition will present Britain's academic
achievements to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, the largest of its kind held in China in recent
years, is expected to promote understanding between the two sides,
according to the State Education Commission of China.
</P>
<P>
Britain is considered to be a worldwide pioneer of modern
education and has an excellent reputation for cultivating
outstanding students. The country, which has a somewhat rigid but
straightforward educational style, is in the process of reform to
transform the sector.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, China has paid great attenion to the
educational sector and introduced reform measures in the
institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is being sponsored by the China Education
Association for International Exchanges and the British Embassy in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the
opening ceremony of the exhibition along with Appleyard.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Minister Meet Maze Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam arrived Friday at Maze Prison near Belfast for a meeting
with loyalist inmates on inter-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam were meeting the pro-British loyalist extremists in the
prison to back a drive for peace flagging under recent violence in
the divided province, reports arriving here said.
</P>
<P>
She caused a shock on Wednesday while announcing her plan to
meet the prisoners, who are called loyalists because they support
the British rule of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners are held in awesome respect by the leaders of the
underground forces and have a key influence on decisions about
truces and political strategy.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a gamble aimed at getting 120 loyalist
extremists to renew their backing for peace talks and bolster a
three-year loyalist truce.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high in Northern Ireland since Christmas, when
a loyalist paramilitary group leader, Billy Wright, was gunned
down at Maze by members of the Irish National Liberation Army
(INLA), a Catholic republican splinter group.
</P>
<P>
Wright's followers then killed two Catholics and wounded
several more in Northern Ireland for revenge.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam will also hold separate meetings with Irish Republican
Army (IRA) prisoners later in the day.
</P>
<P>
IRA, an outlawed paramilitary organization against the British
rule, called a ceasefire last July to allow its political wing
Sinn Fein to join the multi-party peace talks on the future of
Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Draw Held for HK's Lunar New Year Soccer Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Luck turned in favor of the
Hong Kong soccer team's new Brazilian coach Sebastiao Pereira
Araujo as he obtained on Friday what he had expected -- playing
the Chilean team on the opening day of the coming Carlsberg Cup
Lunar New Year soccer tournament here.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is to play Chile while Iran plays Nigeria on January
28. The losers of the first two matches will vie for the third
place while the winners on the opening day will clash each other
for the championship trophy on January 31.
</P>
<P>
Chile, Iran and Nigeria have all qualified for the World Cup
finals in June this year in France.
</P>
<P>
The organizers felt happy and settled after receiving
confirmation from the three visiting teams for participation.
"With three World Cup finals sides here, this year's tournament
could be expected to be the best ever held in Hong Kong," a
spokesman for the organizers said at the lots-drawing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Araujo admitted before the lots were drawn that he would prefer
playing Chile in the Hong Kong team's first match at the two-day
event. "I think the Chileans are not as physically strong as the
Nigerians. If we could meet them first, we'd have more chance for
the final," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Football Association had received players' lists
from the Iranian and Chilean football associations -- 30 for Iran
and 25 for Chile. But their playing squads would be finalized to
a size of about 22 players each.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong League Eleven side is said to be formed after the
coming Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup, with local players picked up from
the current Hong Kong line-up and several foreign players now
playing in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Flights of Foreign Airlines to S. Korea Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The sharp depreciation of the
South Korean won caused by the current financial crisis and
slumping number of Korean travelers have prompted some foreign
airlines to stop or reduce their flights passing through Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Continental Micronesia stopped its weekly seven flights on
Seoul-Guam-Saipan route last December, and Air New Zealand and
Turkish Airlines followed the suit.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of this year, Air New Zealand stopped
flights on Seoul-Brisbane-Auckland routes while Turkish Airlines,
which launched service to Seoul from Istanbul just two months ago,
stopped its operation on January 2.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ansett Australia International, which began its
South Korean flights in 1996, decided to suspend its services
between Australia and South Korea in February.
</P>
<P>
Craig Wallace, general manager of Ansett Australia
International, said South Korea's economic crisis shows that its
Korean services are no longer commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
Qantas Airways, another Australian airline which has so far
scheduled four flights a week to South Korea, has announced
recently that it would stop its current operations between
Australia and Seoul as from February 1.
</P>
<P>
More airlines from Southeast Asian countries, analysts said,
are expected to reduce their flights to South Korea sooner or
later as Thai Airways reportedly plans to reduce by four flights a
week between Seoul and Bangkok; and Malaysia Airlines intends to
cut the flights to three a week from five.

<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese customs departments
recovered 1.5 billion yuan (180 million US dollars) worth duties
which smugglers and exporters evaded during 1997, according to the
General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the administration launched nationwide drive to check
the smuggling of rolled steel, steel plates, copper and edible oil
products.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of last year alone, local customs offices
looked into 22 cases involving copper smuggling and recovered
duties in the neighborhood of 200 million yuan. In the latter half
of the year, the said offices handled 12 cases involving over
60,000 tons of smuggled edible oil valued at 100 million yuan (12
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Customs offices across the country examined and investigated
more than 14,200 companies during 1997, with the discovery of
1,446 smuggling cases and the recovery 1.5 billion yuan. Companies
and individuals involved in evading the payment of duties paid
fines totalling 51 million yuan (6.1 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the administration implemented a supervision system to
check on the imports and exports of local enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University's Founder
Group Corp., one of China's major manufacturers of computer
hardware and software, plans to make bigger strides in the world
market during 1998, according to Founder President Wang Xuan.
</P>
<P>
The company scored notable success in exploring foreign
markets in 1997, with its product line, including printing
software and monitors selling well overseas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Founder Group sold software valued at three
million US dollars to Japanese printing firms, with its graphics
processors entering markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of two million monitors manufactured last year
were exported to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Friday news conference, Wang said the company's
ambitious 1998 plan is to export its graphic processors to North
America.
</P>
<P>
"Our company is a newcomer, but our products are nonetheless
competitive on the international market in terms of performance
and quality," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The company achieved a 1997 sales volume of close to six
billion yuan (723 million US dollars), up 50 percent on the
previous year, he said, adding that the company earmarks some 4-5
percent of its annual earnings for new product development.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Government Urged to Avoid Further Credit Crunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A private institute Friday called
for renegotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
extend the deadline of South Korean banks' capital adequacy ratio,
so as to avoid further credit crunch.
</P>
<P>
The government, said Korea Institute for Industrial Economics
and Trade, should take measures to boost the financial status of
domestic banks so as to meet capital adequacy ratio of 8 percent,
as required by the Banks for International Settlements (BIS).
</P>
<P>
These measures, the institute said in a report, could include
preference shares, increase of credit guarantee funds and
re-arrangement of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Domestic banks' refusal to make fresh loans while demanding
payment on the existing loans to maintain capital ratio will put a
serious squeeze on credit, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It could lead to sharp interest rate hikes, a paralysis in
export and import and a decline in growth rate, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Even the industrialized nations, such as the United States and
Japan, experienced such a crisis since the system of BIS-required
ratio was adopted at the meeting of central bank presidents of
group of seven (G-7) industrialized nations in 1987," it said.
</P>
<P>
Many countries, however, could be able to overcome such a
crisis by extending the period for calculating the BIS ratio,
pouring more public funds and increasing support for small- and
medium-size companies, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
President-elect Kim Dae-jung has promised to implement the
agreement signed with the IMF last December for a loan of 57
billion U.S. dollars to rescue the country from the current
financial crisis caused by the failure of conglomerates and bad
loans of financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> India Rules Out Devaluation of Rupee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 9 (Xinhua)-- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram Friday ruled out any competitive devaluation of the
country's currency rupee to make good the loss arising from steep
falls in the values of East and Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
"If you want competitive devaluation, I am ruling it out,"
Chidambaram told a special plenary session of the fourth
partnership summit, which opened Thursday in Chennai, southern
India.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that Indian exports had been hit by the Asian
currency tumbledown, he said the route to recovery was by
improving quality, reliability and delivery, and not merely by
devaluing the currency.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Asian currencies were expected to firm up by
the end of 1998, he said Indian exports would recover then.
</P>
<P>
Imports from the Asian tiger economies have become cheaper in
the international market compared to imports from India, prompting
Indian exporters to call for competitive devaluation of rupee.
Indian exports have been hit hard by the currency crisis in
Southeast Asia, particularly in gems and jewelry, textiles and
leather sectors.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides left for Athens today for talks with Greek Foreign
Ministry officials on the latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Kasoulides said he will hold talks with
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and other officials to
review developments in the Cyprus problem, in the wake of the
Luxembourg European Council summit last month.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) leaders confirmed they had decided to
begin membership talks with Cyprus on March 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides described the current period as "critical" because
of the situation in the Aegean Sea and the Turkish provocations
with repeated violations of Greece's air space and Athens Flight
Information Region by Turkish jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said any developments would have consequences on
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island following of
a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have long been at odds
with each other over Cyprus, a strategic island in east
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
After his Athens talks, Kasoulides is expected to fly to
Lisbon for talks with his Portuguese counterpart, concentrating on
issues relating to Cyprus' bid to become a full member of the EU.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine Curing Cancer Ready in 3-5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A vaccine which may lead to a
cure of cancer will be ready in three to five years, the Cyprus
Weekly magazine said today.
</P>
<P>
"It will take three to five years to see whether the vaccine is
effective, because patients injected with it will initially be in
remission," Greek Australian immunologist Vasso Apostolopoulou on
a four-day visit to Cyprus was quoted as saying by the Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Apostolopoulou, a woman researcher of the Austin Research
Institute in Melbourne, Australia, is currently working in the
third of the four testing phases of the vaccine, a potential
major breakthrough in cancer research.
</P>
<P>
At this period, the vaccine will be tested on 1,000 women in
Greece, including Cypriots, in their early stage of breast cancer
to see if it kills the cell of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine made up of synthetic mucin found in cancer and
synthetic sugar is used to kill the mucin in cancer and help the
human immune system produce antibodies T-lymphocytes, which can
destroy the disease.
</P>
<P>
Apostolopoulou has verified through her first two tests of the
vaccine on human bodies that the vaccine has no side effects on
human being and that the human immune system responds to it
positively, which are exactly what she has hoped for, the Weekly
magazine said.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth phase, she will test the vaccine on individuals
with a high risk of developing cancer due to hereditary factors,
and then as a preventive on children, according to the Weekly.
</P>
<P>
She expressed optimism that the vaccine will become an
effective weapon against cancer.

<HEADLINE> Materials on 2,500-Year-Old Great Wall Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Five elderly people in east
China's Shandong Province have collected the most complete
materials to date on the 2,500-year-old Qi Great Wall after an
investigation tour.
</P>
<P>
The great wall, a section in Shandong built by the Qi State
during the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.), was more than 470
years older than that built in the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.). It
is regarded as the "father of the Great Wall" by historians.
</P>
<P>
The 367-day investigation on foot has for the first time
measured the accurate length of the Qi Great Wall, which is 618.9
km. Also found this time was a large number of legends and folk
songs, and many materials on the great wall section including word
records, pictures and atlas.
</P>
<P>
They are very helpful to the research of the military, politics
and culture of the Warring States period, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Rehabilitate Judicial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
decided to rehabilitate its judicial system which was severely
damaged by the 1994 genocide, with financial support from the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Justice Faustin Nteziryayo today met U.S.
Ambassador to Rwanda Robert Gribbin on projects supported by his
government in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"These projects include training the judicial staff, providing
equipment and repairing court houses," state-run Radio Rwanda
announced.
</P>
<P>
Both the Minister and the US Ambassador examined the cases of
genocide suspects at large outside the country, and reiterated
the responsibility of nations to extradite them to the
International Crimes Tribunal in Arusha, in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Three years after the genocide, a lot has been done in
rehabilitating the ravaged judicial system notably in training
new magistrates, investigators, and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
However, officials in the ministry of justice indicate that
many more are needed to overcome the serious challenge of trying
over 120,000 genocide suspects currently detained in Rwanda
prisons.
</P>
<P>
During her last visit to Rwanda in December 1997, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that the U.S. will
pledge a 30-million-dollar-package in the framework of the
justice initiative aimed at developing "impartial, credible, and
effective" justice systems.

cities in east China's Fujian Province have been expanding in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
City governments of Xiamen, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Putian, Ningde

<P>
Culture departments in these cities have provided a number of photo
and painting exhibitions, and many art troupes and folk artists
have given performances of acrobatics, puppet, ethnic songs and
danced, and local operas.
</P>
<P>
A group of 218 experts in the cities visited 18 countries and
regions for cultural exchange programs last year, and 103 artists
came to visit them from eight countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cities in 1997 sent 95 artists to give
performances in Taiwan, and received five groups of 71

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Air Base Ready Later This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Air Force Base near the
western coastal town of Paphos, Cyprus, will be ready for use
later this month, President Glafcos Clerides has announced.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local television program Thursday night,
President Clerides said in conjunction with the installation of
the Russian S-300 surface-to-air missiles, the island's air space
would be fully covered.
</P>
<P>
That would provide "persuasive air coverage against enemy
jets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The air force base was constructed under a joint defense pact,
signed in 1993 between Cypriot and Greek governments. Under the
pact, Greece will provide military assistance if Cyprus is
attacked.
</P>
<P>
To raise its defense capability, the Cypriot government also
decided last year to buy Russian-made anti-aircraft S-300
missiles, which will be delivered this summer.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has decided to deploy those advanced
missiles later this year despite threats from Turkey to launch a
pre-emptive strike if it does.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the main reason for boosting Cypriot air defenses
is to protect vulnerable tanks on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"The S-300 missiles will cause such damage to the enemy's air
force that they will think twice before attacking again," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

</P>
<P>
Beckett reportedly said earlier: "I am delighted to be visiting
Hong Kong just over six months after the handover. The message I
am taking to Hong Kong is that Britain and British business is
committed to a major business presence, building on our existing
very strong links."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is extremely important, not just because of its own
dynamic economy, but as a gateway for business into China," she
said, noting that China including Hong Kong as its part is a very
important market for Britain both now and in the medium and long
term.
</P>
<P>

NEW DELHI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Indian Union Industry Minister
M. Maran said Friday that his country's reform process would
continue as it is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fourth Partnership Summit, which opened Thursday
in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu, southern India, Maran said the

soft-pedal the reform process already initiated. "Our agenda is to
ensure that India becomes the third largest economy in the world."

Stressing the need for encouraging foreign investment, Maran
said such investment is essential because it brings in modern
technology and better management practices and obtains new markets
for the country, besides creating more jobs.

"We want more gain than pain and we want more support and not
criticism of the reform," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- External investment has flowed
steadily into Hong Kong's manufacturing industries, as shown in a
government survey released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Inward direct investment in the manufacturing sector reached 48
billion HK dollars (6.15 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of 1996,
a 6-percent rise over the previous year, according to the latest
annual survey, conducted by the Industry Department.
</P>
<P>
The total number of companies with external investment was 403
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
External investment in manufacturing industries grew by 10
percent on average each year between 1994 and 1996, the survey
found.
</P>
<P>
"The steady increase reflects the attractiveness of Hong Kong
as a manufacturing base," said Francis Ho, director-general of
industry, at a briefing Friday.
</P>
<P>
Japan continued to be the leading source country of external
investment in Hong Kong's manufacturing sector, contributing 38
percent to the total inflow of capital. The United States ranked
second, followed by Britain and the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The external investment mainly went to four industries, namely,
 electronics, electrical products, chemicals and food and
beverages, which together accounted for almost 60 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Ho said: "About 75 percent of the respondents in the survey
consider that Hong Kong's overall manufacturing investment
environment has been improved or remains more or less the same."
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure, banking and financial facilities and labor
productivity were regarded as the most important and favorable
factors in Hong Kong while cost of doing business, namely high
wages and rents, was considered as unfavorable, according to the
survey.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Shows Concern over Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The military government in
Sierra Leone today expressed concern over what it described as
"sustained harassment and inhuman treatment" regarding the
detention of vehicles and citizens by Nigerian troop in ECOMOG at
the Jui Checkpoint, 13 miles east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to state radio, a statement released from the
Department of Information has appealed to the international
community and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) "to urge Nigeria to stop this complete affront to the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1132."
</P>
<P>
The release called on the Nigerians " to stop this act
immediately as it goes against the Conakry Peace Plan" signed in
October last year.
</P>
<P>
It reminded the Nigerians that "Sierra Leone is a nation whose
territorial integrity should be respected."
</P>
<P>
Over 15 trucks, some with Guinean registration plates, are
still detained at the Checkpoint by the Nigerians after they were
impounded nearly a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The trucks, including a state-owned National Petroleum tanker
with 1,800 gallons of diesel, were heading either for the
interior or neighbouring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian Captain reached by telephone at the Checkpoint
explained that the trucks were impounded as there were evidence
that their goods, including cocoa and coffee were being taken to
Guinea for shipment overseas.
</P>
<P>
"When we inspected the trucks, we found papers signed by the
inspector-general of police for the vehicles to go through
checkpoints manned by Sierra Leone soldiers and documents from
Sierra Leone Trade officials giving clearance for the goods to be
shipped overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, these violate the sanction and embargo now in
force in the country," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian held talks today with Sherali Khairullaev, his Tajikistan
counterpart, and said that China is fully prepared to cooperate
Tajikistan in the realm of military training and logistics.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also State Councillor and vice-chairman of China's Central
Military Commission, said that China pursues an independent
foreign policy of peace and will not form alliances with any major
power or group of states.
</P>
<P>
Ideological and social systems should not be the criteria used
in state-to-state relations and China opposes any country
attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of another nation
under the pretext of nationality, religion and human rights, said
Chi.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China and Tajikistan are close and
friendly neighbors which have witnessed sustained and healthy
growth of bilateral relations since the two nations forged
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
He noted that relations between the armed forces of China and
Tajikistan constitute an important aspect of ties and there are
broad prospects for collaboration between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chi emphasized that China is fully prepared to work with
Tajikistan to establish a stable, mutually beneficial and
good-neighbor relationship.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the visiting delegation on the situation in
China and modernization of the Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
Khairullaev said that China is an important neighbor and
stressed that the development of friendly bilateral ties will not
only serve the interests of the two peoples, but will also promote
peace and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Frequent exchange of visits between leaders of the two nations
and their armed forces have greatly promoted bilateral relations,
said Khairullaev, adding that his country will continue to work
with China to enhance bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Chi also presided over a welcoming ceremony in honor of
Khairullaev, who arrived earlier today on an official goodwill
visit to China as guest of the Chinese Defense Minister.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Guiding Principles For Agriculture In 1998 (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agricultural infrastructure remains a weak link and
vulnerable to natural disasters, with insufficient applications of
science and technology to agriculture. A step forward for
agriculture will require the intensification of various production
factors and increase agriculture's comprehensive production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Leaders at all levels must take agro-sciences as the primary
productive force, gradually promote farm mechanization and make a
greater effort to fight poverty. Furthermore, governments and
departments at all levels should continue to carry out
preferential policies for and increase investment in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to promote rural reforms,
especially to solve outstanding problems that hinder the
development of productivity. However, these reforms should be
tried out before widespread application.
</P>
<P>
Focus should be placed on building the Party's organizations at
the village level to promote a democratic system characterized by
an open administration and democratic management.
</P>
<P>
The household contract responsibility system introduced in the
early 1980s has brought farmers' initiative in production into full
play. A sound democratic system could arouse farmers' political
enthusiasm and this in turn could promote economic and social
prosperity in rural areas, the conference said.

<HEADLINE> China Insures One Third of Government, Institution Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- One third of government and
social institution employees in China, with a population of 11.32
million, have joined in various social insurance schemes, the
Ministry of Personnel announced here today.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 1,700 prefectures, cities and counties in
28 provinces across the country have introduced social insurance
for workers in local government and social institutions, the
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Among them, more than 680 prefectures, cities and counties have
provided pension insurance for all employees of local governments
and institutions, more than 300 have begun to offer unemployment
insurance, and many more are now trying to introduce job-related
accident insurance.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Personnel show that by the
first half of 1997 social insurance funds for government and
institution employees across the country totaled 7.8 billion yuan
(950 million U.S. dollars), 6.9 billion more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the funds came from central and local
government budgets, a Ministry official revealed.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), convened in Beijing in September, called for the founding
of a social security system based on the social insurance and
poverty-relief scheme.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the social insurance scheme in governments
and social institutions is a major component of, and support for,
China's personnel system reform," said Song Defu, minister of
personnel.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that 19 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions -- including Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi and
Chongqing -- have worked out their own plans to insure employees
of local governments and social institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to sources available, the number of people in
governments and social institutions across the country exclusively
assigned to work on the insurance scheme has now exceeds 8,000,
and many of them are equipped with computerized facilities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimming Team Issues Statement on Drugs Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Following is the statement issued
by the Chinese swimming team here Friday night:
</P>
<P>
"On January 8, 1998, part of the Chinese swimming team had a
stopover in Sydney on their way to Perth for the Eighth World
Swimming Championships. In a routine baggage check at the Sydney
Airport, one of the swimmers Yuan Yuan was believed to have in her
baggage suspicious substance banned by the Sydney Customs.
</P>
<P>
"Upon arrival of the above-mentioned group of people in Perth,
the Chinese Swimming Delegation made inquires of the people
concerned in regards to what had happened.
</P>
<P>
"According to swimming coach, Mr. Zhou Zhewen, before they came
here someone asked him to take the substance over here. At the
Sydney Customs, the customs officials inquired these two people
and Mr. Zhou made an explanation. As this is their individual
behavior they will be responsible for all the consequences thus
arising.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Swimming Delegation holds that carrying things for
other people on the way to the World Swimming Championships
violates the delegation's disciplines and was definitely wrong.
Once the Australian Customs officially confirms that it is a
banned drug, the Chinese Swimming Delegation shall deprive these
two people of the right to participate in the current world
championships. Further action will then be taken in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the Chinese Swimming
Association, and the FINA will be duly informed of the result.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Swimming Association has always been fighting
against any doping practice and insisting on the 'Three Strict'
Anti-doping Policy, namely, 'strict prohibition, strict
examination and strict sanction.' However, we are strongly against
that this individual behavior being regarded as a collective
action.
</P>
<P>
"Holding high the banner of fighting against doping, the
Chinese Swimming Association is willing to co-operate with the
other sports federations and make unremitting efforts to ensure
the successful fight against doping and safeguard the purity of
the Olympic Movement."

<HEADLINE> HK Attractive as Regional Headquarters Location </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains an
attractive base for overseas companies to build their regional
operations, according to a government survey released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
By June 1, 1997, overseas companies had set up 2,530 regional
operations in Hong Kong, a 10-percent rise from a year before,
said the annual survey conducted by the Industry Department.
</P>
<P>
These regional operations include 924 regional headquarters and
1,606 regional offices and nearly half of them built up their
presence in Hong Kong in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Francis Ho, director-general of industry, said at a news
briefing Friday: "The survey reaffirmed the increasing importance
of Hong Kong as a major regional business center for overseas
companies."
</P>
<P>
Ninety-one percent of the respondents said the attractiveness
of Hong Kong as a location for regional headquarters or regional
office has improved or remains the same, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
Considered as the most important and favorable factors are
banking and financial facilities, government economic policy,
infrastructure, rule of law, tax regime, transparent government
and access to information.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the United States, with 219 companies,
has the largest number of regional headquarters in Hong Kong,
followed by Japan, the Chinese mainland and Britain. In terms of
the number of regional offices, Japan tops the list with 378
companies and the United States comes second with 262.

<HEADLINE> Challenges Mingle with Chances for China's VCD Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers are expected
to buy 11 million video compact disc (VCD) players in 1998, up 29
percent from 1997, according to China's Ministry of Internal
Trade.
</P>
<P>
Such brands as Shinco, Malata, Idall and Samsung are expected
to remain popular.
</P>
<P>
China is considered a world leader in the manufacturing of VCD
players.
</P>
<P>
Chinese manufacturers of VCD players have become major factors
in the domestic market. Their market share of VCD players in
December last year rose to 85 percent from 72.2 percent in January
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jin Zhenglong, an official of the China Association of the
Electronic Stereo System Industry, expressed his confidence in the
market potential of VCDs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He supported his prediction by saying that in China's
relatively developed large and medium-size cities, only one-tenth
of the households are equipped with VCD players. These areas are
the major consumers of the machines.
</P>
<P>
Big price cuts in the past year have also enabled people in
some rural areas and small cities to afford the machines, Jin
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospects are not all optimistic. Domestic
manufacturers are faced with new challenges in the new year.
</P>
<P>
VCD player production and sales are expected to be even less
balanced. The 30 biggest plants out of 400 plans to turn out 30
million players this year. Total production will reach 50 million
units, far exceeding the market demand.
</P>
<P>
The lowest price for a VCD player is 1,000 yuan, leaving little
room for further price cuts.
</P>
<P>
All major manufacturers of VCD players are aware of the
competition and the need to advertise. Nine of the VCD
manufacturers won the bidding for the 12 vacancies in the prime
time slots on China Central Television, a nationwide TV network.
</P>
<P>
The recognition of brand names and improvement of service
quality are increasingly important to manufacturers in the
intensifying competition.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhibiao, general manager of Idall, said: "Those with better
quality and services will be the winners. Service wars and brand
recognition wars are the main stream of the competition."
</P>
<P>
Idall became the "king of the bidding" by offering 210 million
yuan for CCTV ads.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong: Ideal Regional Licensing Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Geographic advantages, a
strong economic foundation and a wealth of management personnel
have made Hong Kong an ideal regional partner in licensing, a
senior member of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC)
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regional licensing seminar, TDC Deputy Executive
Director Frederick Lam noted that the licensing industry worldwide
has an annual business turnover of 102 billion U.S. dollars and a
lot of international licensers and holders of top-notch brands
are targeting at the opportunities in the Asian-Pacific region
and China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is well equipped to be a regional base for
international firms and enterprises to develop their businesses in
Asia, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is recognized as the freest economy in the world,
offering an open and fair trading environment; it is also the most
service-oriented economy in the world, providing all-round
services in financing, trading, telecommunications,
transportation, sourcing, licensing and product design to China's
inland areas and the region, said Lam.
</P>
<P>
The seminar entitled "Hong Kong: Your Regional Licensing
Partner" is part of a series of measures by the TDC to promote
Hong Kong as a global middle man for those wishing to expand their
business network.
</P>
<P>
It was held in conjunction with the Hong Kong Toys and Games
Fair '98 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Licensing professionals from the United States, China's inland
areas and Hong Kong attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Zoologists Find Tibetan Antelope's Breeding Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 9 (Xinhua)--A Sino-U.S. wildlife exploration
team has located the breeding place of the Tibetan antelope,
solving a riddle that has puzzled zoologists worldwide for nearly
200 years.
</P>
<P>
The team discovered last summer that Tibetan antelope, a rare
species roaming only in the northernmost part of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, would give birth to their babies mainly at the
foot of the southern slope of the Kunlun Mountains and along the
banks of Hoh Xil Lake -- both 5,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The team was headed by Liu Wulin, a wildlife conservationist
with the Tibet Autonomous Region's Forestry Bureau, and George
Schallei of the Wildlife Conservation Society of the United States.
</P>
<P>
With long, straight horns and coated with thick hair, Tibetan
antelopes are so fast that they can outrun wolves. They live in
the southern part of Changtang Prairie in winter.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the season when female antelopes are to give birth to
their babies, they travel north with male antelopes in large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
But male antelopes halt in the middle of the prairie while the
females continue their trip. They then return with baby antelopes
and rejoin the large group for the trip back south.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and zoologists from more than 20 countries and
regions around the world had come to Tibet since the 19th century
trying to find out the antelopes' travel route and breeding place,
but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. team's previous attempts also had failed. Big
mountains, rivers and waterfalls on the journey often eradicated
any trace of the traveling antelopes.
</P>

"We have seen the baby antelopes," said Liu Wulin. "Born only
three to five days, they run as fast as rabbits."
</P>
<P>
The team concludes that Tibetan antelopes choose the northern
region as their breeding place because the thick-haired animal
wants a cool place to give birth in summer, plus the northern
prairie has rich freshwater ponds and lush grasses.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the discovery is significant as zoologists now can
better protect the rare animal.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto, Clinton Discuss Currency Crisis on Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
talked with Indonesian President Soeharto on the phone Friday
morning about Indonesia's economic situation, a cabinet minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono told reporters that Clinton
expressed his concern about the situation in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton is apprehensive about the economic and
currency crisis which is affecting Indonesia," he said.
</P>
<P>
In their 25-minute conversation, Clinton expressed the belief
that Indonesia will overcome its crisis because its restructuring
and reform programs are backed by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton supports implementing the programs and will
send U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to Indonesia
to hold discussions with President Soeharto and other top
officials," Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia, with a grateful heart, will accept the U.S.
government's special envoy," Moerdiono said, adding that Summers'
visit aims to obtain first-hand information about Indonesia's
policies for handling the ongoing monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the telephone conversation, Soeharto met with Minister of
Trade and Industry Tunky Ariwibowo and economic advisor Widjojo
Nitisastro, whom the president asked to seriously examine the
IMF-supported restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah, the country's currency, hit a record low
of 11,000 against the U.S. dollar in late trading Thursday. The
rupiah has declined by about 300 percent since early July last
year.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers attributed the sharp drop of the rupiah to the
worsening public confidence in the country's economy and the IMF's
disappointment over the Indonesian government's programs in coping
with the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which agreed to an IMF-led bailout of more than 30
billion U.S. dollars in October last year, has committed to
conducting a series of reforms, including those in the financial,
fiscal and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government closed 16 insolvent private banks in
early November as part of its reform package. In December the
government announced a plan to merge a number of state-run banks
before July 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, IMF officials on Tuesday called Indonesia's economic
crisis worrisome and faulted the Jakarta government's effort to
follow through on pledges to restructure the nation's economy.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Soars on Central Bank Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar went up
by one U.S. cent in less than an hour Friday as the Reserve Bank
of Australia (RBA) intervened in the foreign exchange market for
the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The RBA's move to buy Australian dollars and sell the greenback
pushed the local currency up from an 11-year low of 63.18 U.S.
cents and sent it bursting through the 64-U.S. cent level.
</P>
<P>
By the close of the local session, the currency had retreated
slightly to 63.98 U.S. cents, lower than the levels reached at the
height of the RBA-inspired rally, but still well above the 63.28
U.S. cents at the opening and 63.68 U.S. cents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rally was just in time to prevent the unit falling through
the critical support level of 63 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Many market analysts had predicted that a break below that
level would have hastened the currency's downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency has been steadily heading lower since
March 1997 when it peaked at around 80 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
It ended Friday at 84.27 Japanese yen, from 84.39 Thursday and
at 1.1608 marks, from 1.1621.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Host Int'l Investment Forum in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
concluded plans to organize an international investors forum the
coming June and open investment promotion offices in some Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The countries will include Japan, China, Malaysia and some
others in southeast Asia, according to Industry Minister Onikepo
Akande.
</P>
<P>
The measure aimed at attracting foreign investment will
expectedly boost the country's privatization efforts, the
minister said when presenting the ministry's budget in the
capital Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision in this respect "is in consonance with our
resolve to attract needed foreign capital, machinery and
equipment which, though very necessary, are not locally
available," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations leading to the signing of investment promotion
and protection agreements with interested countries would
continue in 1998," the minister said, quoted by today's This Day
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to her, efforts to implement this year's budget will
be made "to step up our investment promotion initiative
particularly now that the governing council of the Nigerian
Investment Promotion Commission has been inaugurated while its
activities commenced in earnest".
</P>
<P>
The first priority of her ministry has been and will continue
to be on small and medium-sized enterprise promotion and
development to hold the upliftment of the industrial sector of
the country, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Certain key sub-sectors in the ministry, including those of
machine tools, sugar, pulp and paper and cement, will receive a
boost from the 1998 budget, she added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Nigeria's sugar industry can only
meet about 10 percent of the domestic requirement estimated at
one million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this, the minister said the government is to "aim
to achieve at least 70 percent self-sufficiency in sugar
production by the turn of the century".

PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin met with for the first
time Thursday representatives of jobless people, who urged him to
make a gesture by providing financial aid to the unemployed. While
expressing understanding of the demands of the jobless, Jospin
ordered with a threatening tone the protesters to end their
occupation of government agencies and other forms of protest.
</P>
<P>
-- Algeria Thursday agreed to a proposal by the European Union
(EU) to send a delegation to Algiers, on the condition that the
mission of the delegation is focused on discussion over cooperation
in fighting terrorism. The wave of killings in the Ouarsenis
mountains in western Algeria pushed the EU to decide to help put an
end to terrorism in Algeria, which has earlier rejected an EU
proposal to provide aid to victims of the massacres.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French Interior Ministry said in a report on 1997 that
15,791 violent incidents took place in French cities last year,
while the number of large-scale violence, such as the riot which
took place on New Year's eve in Strasbourg, has diminished since
1993. Seven French cities experienced riots in 1997, while police
were subjected to grave physical attacks in 36 cities.
</P>
<P>
-- The French Minister of National Education Claude Allegre has
launched a large operation to investigate what the schoolchildren
and high school students want to learn. His ministry has sent 3
million questionnaires to schools across the country asking teachers
pupils and students to answer these questions before January 29. A
special commission headed by college professors has also been set up
to analyze the result of the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Assembly Plant for German Fighters in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Daimler-Benz
Aerospace has confirmed that it was in talks with South Africa to
set up a local assembly plant for its jet fighters, The Star
daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Germany is believed to have made the South African National
Defense Force's short-list of products and suppliers for an arms
purchase of 10 billion Rand (2.04 billion U.S. Dollars) approved
by South African parliament in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Michael Woerfel, president of Daimler-Benz's southern African
branch, said Thursday that the final assembly of the company's
advanced jet trainers and more than 50 percent of the work and
development, integration and supply of the mission systems for
the aircraft would be undertaken in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that with predicted sales of between 700 and 800 units
by 2025, the deal could earn South Africa several billion Rand
over a 25-30 years period.
</P>
<P>
The advanced jet trainers have already been presented to
potential customers. Two countries with a total procurement
volume of 250 aircraft have short-listed the trainers, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
While the agreement is still being negotiated with South
Africa's arms manufacturer Denel, the German group expects first
deliveries from 2005.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz is also negotiating similar cooperation with
South Korea's Hyundai Space.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Road Death Toll Expected to Be Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The road death toll since
December 1 last year is expected to be lower as compared with the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
They said in a statement Thursday that 844 people had died in
traffic accidents since December 1 last year. In comparison,
1,242 people died on South Afircan roads between December 3, 1996
and January 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is a definte indication that motorists heeded our
warnings and generally cooperated with the traffic authorities in
their attempts to reduce the carnage on our roads," said Leonard
Ramatlakane, a senior official in the Transport Department.
</P>
<P>
"It is also, I am sure, the consequence of the intensified
law enforcement effort during (last) December, when no less than
24,078 drivers were charged with over-speeding, and 254 with
drinking and driving offences," Ramatlakane said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Transport Department, since October 1 last
year#,which saw a government-sponsored Arrive Alive campaign,
11,845 drivers and passengers were charged with failing to wear
seat belts.
</P>
<P>
The fatalities so far included 369 passengers, 273
pedestrians and 202 drivers, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic volumes were expected to increase considerably today,
peaking on Sunday, when holiday-makers returned for the school
year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Decline on Asia, U.S. Stock Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
declined by about 2 percent Friday as falls across international
markets shook local investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
Australian stocks with the greatest exposure to Asia were dealt
the hardest blow because of growing concerns about the prospects
of Southeast Asia's financial markets and the impact on local
companies' earnings.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index fell 47.6 points or 1.8 percent to
2603.1, having earlier dipped to as low as 2585.8.
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average
plunged 99.65 points to 7802.62 on the back of Asian market losses
and concerns that the International Monetary Fund's prescriptions
for Asian countries were being ignored.
</P>
<P>
"The latest events in Asia and Wall Street obviously got market
players nervous here today," Henderson Charlton Jones broker
Philip Toop said. "Those stocks with strong links to the region
suffered the most. People will be watching New York closely
tonight for a lead on Monday."
</P>
<P>
The All Resources Index shed 27.3 points or 2.5 percent to
1084.3 while the Industrials Index slipped 74.3 points to 4500.2.
</P>
<P>
Weaker copper prices saw Rio Tinto drop 54.5 cents, BHP 39
cents, WMC 17 cents and MIM 4 cents.

Forty-four cents was wiped from ANZ Bank, which has the
greatest exposure to Asia among the big four banks. It finished at

<HEADLINE> Manila Adopts Measures to Sustain Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Trade Department
has adopted a "three-step route" measure to cope with the current
currency turmoil and sustain the country's economic growth, the
Philippine News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista proposed the
measures in his year-end report to President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
They include calibrated measures to restore financial
stability, productivity improvement measures in enterprises to
increase competitiveness and innovation especially in technology
and marketing areas.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said these steps would help snap companies out of
their gloom and turn regional threats into opportunities.
</P>
<P>
These confidence-building measures, he said, will also help
ensure that the Ramos administration will bow out with high marks
for helping sustain economic growth in his last semester in
office.
</P>
<P>
Under the Ramos administration, the economy achieved its
"longest, uninterrupted period of growth" for the sixth
consecutive year, from zero growth in 1991 to about 6 percent by
October 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, the economic growth is expected to slow
down to 5 percent this year due to uncertainties brought about by
the regional currency crisis.

<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Greater effort must be made in
six areas to accomplish the goals for agriculture in 1998 set by
the Central Rural Work Conference of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
-- Further stabilize and strengthen agriculture as the
foundation of the national economy, and maintain a sustainable and
steady growth of agriculture;
</P>
<P>
-- Keep the Party's basic rural policies stable, and take
effective measures to protect and bring farmers' initiative into
full play;
</P>
<P>
-- Act promptly to adjust and optimize the industrial structure
in rural areas and the product mix in a bid to improve the quality
and efficiency of the farming sector as a whole;
</P>
<P>
-- Vigorously intensify the essential factors to increase
agricultural production and improve its efficiency, and to raise
agriculture's comprehensive production capacity;
</P>
<P>
-- Take positive and proper measures to step up rural reforms
and inject new vitality into agriculture and the rural economy;
</P>
<P>
-- Improve the agricultural infrastructure and balance economic
and social development;
</P>
<P>
The conference held that after three consecutive years' of good
harvests, sustainable and steady agricultural growth can be
achieved as long as top priority is given to agriculture in all
economic work and the Party's basic rural policies are
followed.
</P>
<P>
Measures must be taken to ensure that attention to agriculture
will not be shifted elsewhere, efforts will not be relaxed and
investment will not be reduced. In addition, work must be done to
improve the eco-system and production conditions, and to promote
rapid progress and the widespread application of agricultural
scientific and technological revolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
Good or poor agricultural harvests rely heavily on farmers'
initiative, which in turn depends on the Party's rural
policies. So, governments at all levels must be held accountable
to carrying out Party policies, including the household-based
contract responsibility system and policies to lighten farmers'
financial burdens and purchase any amount of grain from farmers at
protective prices.
</P>
<P>
China is experiencing a shift from a self-sufficient farming
sector to a commodity-oriented one and from a traditional farming
sector to a modern one. Therefore, efforts should be made to
improve the agricultural structure to adapt to a market
economy. The farm product processing industry should be developed
and made into a new rural economic growth area, as well as a
pillar industry of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
In restructuring the rural industrial structure, it is
necessary to improve to market analysis and prediction, and
provide timely and accurate market information for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Attention should be focused on cultivating country fairs and
farm produce wholesale markets, and on enlivening distribution.
</P>
<P>
Positive and proper measures should be taken to promote
market-oriented agricultural industrialization, and to foster and
support leading enterprises, which will serve as examples in rural
areas in opening up markets, guiding production, and participating
in sales.

<HEADLINE> Opposition May Not Keep Deadline of Sri Lankan Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
party, the United National Party (UNP), said Friday morning that
it would not be intimidated by a government deadline to submit
alternative proposals concerning the government's devolution
package.
</P>
<P>
UNP General Secretary Gamini Atukorale said the work on the
constitution, which contains the devolution package, should not be
done in a hurry. The party has asked six more months for it to
come up with a decision on the new constitution proposed by the
People's Alliance (PA) government.
</P>
<P>
The UNP response followed a government decision to make January
31 the deadline for the party to submit its alternative proposals
on the package, the core of the government's peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Justice, Constitutional Affairs, Ethnic Affairs and National
Integration Minister G. L. Peiris said Thursday that the
government wants to come to an agreement with the UNP and that is
why it gave the party time to submit its proposals.
</P>
<P>
If the government doesn't receive UNP proposals by the end of
January, it will have to consider an alternative course of action
such as a referendum, the minister said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Doctor Jailed for Medicare Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A migrant Australian doctor has
been sentenced to eight years in jail for defrauding Medicare of
almost 1 million Australian dollars (about 650,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
John William Kibukamusoke, 65, pleaded guilty in the Canberra
Supreme Court on December 17 to 414 charges, committed between
1992 and 1996, and has been in custody since, the Australian
Associated Press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kibukamusoke, a former Ugandan high commissioner to Australia,
worked as a general practitioner and kidney specialist in Canberra
from 1982, and at the time of his arrest was also practicing in
two states in Australia. He ran a practice in Bega on the south
coast of New South Wales state in eastern Australia between 1985
and 1991.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 814 patients for whom Kibukamusoke allegedly made
false claims with forged signatures were former Bega patients,
some of whom had died.
</P>
<P>
The Health Insurance Commission found that he had lodged 15,443
bulk billing claims, or 55 percent of all his claims in four
years, for patients he did not see or procedures not performed, or
claimed a higher referral rate when there was no referral from a
general practitioner.
</P>
<P>
Kibukamusoke had lost substantial amounts of money from failed
business ventures.
</P>
<P>
Justice John Gallop said Kibukamusoke had a distinguished
career as a specialist doctor and as a diplomat for Uganda, which
he fled in 1973.
</P>
<P>
"To defraud the Commonwealth of almost 1 million Australian
dollars over a period of four years with a multiplicity of claims
is about as serious as one can imagine," he said.
</P>
<P>
He gave Kibukamusoke a jail term of eight years with a
non-parole period of four years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Forex Demand Shoots Up at Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange demand at
Nigeria's official foreign exchange swap market has shored up to
a new high of more than 100 million U.S. Dollars following the
release of this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
Results of transactions at the Autonomous Foreign Exchange
Market (AFEM), where the Central Bank sells foreign exchange to
selected commercial banks, totalled 100.254 million Dollars in
the year's first trading day Wednesday, three days after the
budget was announced.
</P>
<P>
The demand was shared among 62 out of the 80 banks selected to
partake in the market, the Central Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate stood at 75 Naira, the Nigerian currency, to
one Dollar, the same as at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Such a demand, the highest in eight months, was described as
reasonable by analysts who said it was the result of the new
budget which is full of incentive to promote production this year
if well implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Anthony Ani, the Central Bank
made 51 interventions in the weekly trading at AFEM last year and
disbursed a net amount of 2.989 billion Dollars, 733 million
Dollars less than the total supply.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parallel foreign exchange market, the organized
non-official trading place open to individuals, reflected the
current happenings at AFEM.
</P>
<P>
The Dollar now exchanges at about 80 Naira compared with 82
Naira last week at the exchange bureaus.

<HEADLINE> Principal Tasks for China's Rural Development Outlined (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Central Rural Work
Conference was held in Beijing Jan. 7-9.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with conference participants in the Great Hall of
the People today, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that China
would increase the output of farm produce, raise the annual income
of farmers and maintain a steady rural development despite the
difficulties it might encounter this year.
</P>
<P>
As the year 1998 is the first year to implement the principles
and policies made at the 15th National Congress of the CPC, there
are many arduous tasks ahead in reform, economic development and
social stability, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Last year's agricultural production was a good one after two
years of consecutive bumper harvest, paving the way for the
country's economic growth and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attributed the harvests to concerted efforts by farmers
under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all
levels as well as support from other trades. He also extended
cordial greetings to those working in the agricultural industry on
behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to guard against laxity after good harvests and
pay more attention to studying the changing situation and new
problems, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding problems in rural areas now include weak sales in
farm produce, a drop in prices and slower growth in farmers'
income, Jiang said, adding that they will hamper social stability
if China fails to find a timely and effective solution.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Intensify Economic Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will intensify
its economic diplomacy drive and push for the establishment of the
proposed Cambodia-Laos-Philippines-Thailand-Vietnam Growth Polygon
this year, the country's top diplomat said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing for the diplomatic press corps, Foreign Affairs
Secretary Domingo Siazon said the strategy is intended to
"mobilize external resources in support of national development."
</P>
<P>
The envisioned polygon is expected to accelerate the
development of the proposed Northwestern Luzon Growth Area in the
northern Philippines and link the area to continental Southeast
Asia under a regime of more enhanced trade traffic and economic
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Siazon stressed that economic diplomacy will remain a major
pillar of the Philippine foreign policy and will be further
intensified to boost the country's economic relations with its
partners through trade and investments.
</P>
<P>
The prevailing global and regional political and economic
environment, including the currency turmoil sweeping Southeast
Asia, offers both challenges and opportunities for the Philippines
to maximize the benefits from its economic diplomacy initiatives,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic diplomacy, spearheaded by President Fidel Ramos, is
largely credited for the country's economic turnaround since 1993,
according to Siazon.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic upsurge continued through up to the
third quarter of 1997 despite high interest rates, a sustained dip
in the value of the peso and the adverse effects on agriculture of
the El Nino phenomenon, Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
"Business sentiment remains largely unaffected and
multinational companies and other investors remain bullish on the
prospects of the country as an investment destination," he
declared.

BEIRUT, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz is scheduled to visit Moscow next month to discuss with the

He said that "a pullout is always welcome, but we have to know
what Israel wants as guarantees."
</P>

With regard to the Middle East peace talks, Peressypkine

<P>
A key to doing a good job in rural areas is to stabilize all
policies, especially the Party's policies on the land-contract
system, grain purchases and alleviation of farmers' financial
burdens, the Party general secretary said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a breakthrough must be achieved in optimizing the
rural economic structure, raising farmers' incomes and maintaining
a balanced development between rural capital construction and
ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said a welcome trend is the building of the joint stock
cooperative system in collective enterprises at the township
level. The system will be operated in a down-to-earth manner to
make it more popular among the masses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the system should be based on the principle
of seeking truth from facts and be carried out in the light of
conditions of different areas. "There is no need to rush headlong
into mass action," he said. "Collective assets should not be
allowed to become the personal assets of a tiny number of people,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Party general secretary called on leading officials at all
levels to improve their work styles and to go deeper into the
grassroots level to investigate and study new problems.
</P>
<P>
Leaders at the county level were urged to meet the masses of
farmers and help them solve concrete problems, render all kinds of
services and provide them with new ways to get rich.
</P>
<P>
Many management and technical people with varied educational
backgrounds will be trained to meet the needs of rural development
through adjusting the existing educational structure in rural
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The democratic electoral system practiced in rural villages
will continue to improve, he said. Village affairs management and
accounts should be made public, he said, and farmers should
tighten supervision over rural officials.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian VP Calls for Control of Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Juma has urged Dar residents to observe hygiene so as to
curb the spread of cholera which may worsen this year due to
excessive seasonal rains linked to El Nino weather pattern.
</P>
<P>
During a tour Thursday to inspect health centers for cholera
victims in Temeke, Ilala, and Kinodoni districts of the capital,
Juma was informed that more than 200 residents in Dar died of
cholera last year and the death toll is likely to double this
year.
</P>
<P>
District medical officers briefed the vice president that the
worst hit groups were those low-income earners, people who built
their houses in the valleys and those who use stagnant water, The
Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
"It is shameful for the nation to have such a disease because
it implies that we are still living in filth," the vice president
was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic also discourages foreign investors, hurting the
country's economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma appealed to the people living in the valleys to quit the
places for their own safety, saying that heavy rains are around
the corner and they will become victims of floods at any time.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments predicted that heavy rains starting
early last month will continue till April.
</P>
<P>
A major reason why cholera has persisted for a long time in
the city is that residents do not have a clean habit. Ailing
sewerage systems, the scarcity of clean water and haphazard
construction of houses are also to blame, medical officers said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president has called for the establishment of special
committees to help carry out health regulations, which is
imperative to help residents control the spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
No government in the world could clean people's houses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 36,182 people in Tanzania contracted cholera and
2,124 people died of the disease, lastest statistics indicate.

LOS ANGELES, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Wheat, corn, soybean and
lean hog futures retreated sharply Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, according to news reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Wheat for March delivery fell 8 1-2 cents to dlrs 3.20 1-2 a
bushel while corn dropped 5 cents to dlrs 2.58 1-2 a
bushel. Soybeans for January delivery fell 10 cents to dlrs 6.59
3-4 a bushel and February lean hogs fell 1.20 cents to 56.45 cents
a pound.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the sharp fall of prices to the concerns
that the Asian economic crisis will lead to reduced American
exports.
</P>
<P>
They said that the U.S. dollar has been rising against Asian
currencies and making American commodities more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the U.S. Agriculture Department show that
wheat export last week were 69 percent below the previous week,
while corn export fell 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The demand for these commodities remains light though the
Agriculture Department announced late Monday that, in a bid to
keep goods flowing overseas, it had offered export subsidies to
several Asian nations currently hit by a currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Expand Victim Friendly Court System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The victim-friendly court system
has proved successful and the Zimbabwean government is now
seeking donor funding to expand it to other areas, Minister of
Justice Emmerson Mnangagwa said.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking after witnessing a court session in
the victim-friendly court at Harare magistrates' court during a
visit Thursday with his visiting Swedish counterpart, Laila
Freivalds.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish minister, who arrived last Sunday, said she was
impressed on the victim-friendly court system.
</P>
<P>
Mnangagwa said the victim-friendly system, which was
introduced last year, was working perfectly. He noted that rape
victims were now able to give evidence freely.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, a victim would sit in a different room
and give evidence while she is monitored by a Camera. The victim
communicates through an intermediary, who is either a social
worker or interpreter, who then relays the evidence to the main
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Mnangagwa said, with the success of the system, the government
now wanted to expand it. Cameras and television monitors, among
other gadgets, were required for the system.
</P>
<P>
Once a rape victim had completed giving evidence in the
victim-friendly court, the case would then revert to the open
court.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish minister said the victim-friendly court system was
also used in her country.
</P>
<P>
However, it was different from the local system in that, in
her country, the victim was interviewed and filmed before the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
In the previous system, victims sometimes broke down and
failed to give evidence in the presence of the suspected
culprits. "The new system is very good. I know how difficult it
is to deal with such cases, and get evidence to convict," she
said.

factories considered serious polluters from July of 1996 to
September of 1997, according to the statistics released by the
State Environmental Protection Agency.
 The closed factories are mainly among 15 types of small, serious
polluters designated by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Among those closed were small leather tanning factories,
printing and dyeing mills, coking plants using outdated production
processes and paper mills with annual production capacities of
5,000 tons or less.
</P>
<P>
Through this move, China can reduce the emission of nearly two
billion tons of wastewater, 42.3 billion cubic meters of waste gas
and more than 81 million tons of solid waste every year.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three province-level areas -- including Beijing,
Shanghai and Tianjin -- have closed nearly all the 15 types of
small factories. Sources say that all those in the country's key
pollution-control regions such as the Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe
river valleys have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have taken steps to prevent closed
factories from resuming production. More than 1,000 plants had
resumed production after closure, and more than 93 percent of
those were closed again.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces have also closed polluting factories not
included on the State Council's list. East China's Shandong
Province has began to close paper mills with annual production
capacities below 10,000 tons, to further control pollution.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Coffee Output to Increase Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee production is
projected to increase this year to about 74,858 tons, compared
with 68,369 tons last year, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Flavian Mwangi, Chairman of the Mild Coffee
Traders Association, as warning that the quality of the coffee
may be low because of the effect of the heavy rains since last
November caused by the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He noted that last year's production was a 30 percent drop
from the 1995/96 output of 97,575 tons.
</P>
<P>
Coffee prices were firm in the 1996/97 year with the overall
annual average price topping 117.24 U.S. Dollars per 50-kg bag,
thus improving the farmers' return throughout the year despite a
decline in coffee production.
</P>
<P>
Mwangi pointed out at an annual general meeting held recently
that liberalization in the coffee sector gave farmers a bigger
choice following the licensing of more dealers and the
introduction of a multi-auction system.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that as a result of liberalization three
more coffee auctioneers had been licensed by the Coffee Board of
Kenya, bringing the number to four.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the coffee industry was set to benefit this
year from the positive effects of the liberalization policy being
implemented by the sector.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Deficit Narrows in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a trade
deficit of 700 million ringgit (152.17 million U.S. dollars)
between January and November 1997, much lower than the 1.3 billion
ringgit (282.6 million dollars) a year earlier, official figures
show.
</P>
<P>
If trade in "lumpy" items (aircraft and ships/tankers,
including accessories) was excluded from the import and re-export
data, there would have been a surplus of 5 billion ringgit (1.086
billion dollars) in the period, according to the November 1997
trade figures released by the Statistics Department here Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the 11 months, Malaysia's total export earnings grew by
10.4 percent to 198.4 billion ringgit (43.13 billion dollars) from
179.7 billion ringgit (39.06 billion dollars) in the corresponding
period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, total imports increased by 10
percent to 199.1 billion ringgit (43.28 billion dollars) over the
181 billion ringgit (39.34 billion dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and Singapore remained the top three
trading partners, which collectively accounted for 51.5 percent of
Malaysia's total trade during the January-November 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
In the month of November 1997, Malaysia registered a trade
surplus of 600 million ringgit (130.43 million dollars), with
exports expanding 30.9 percent to 21.6 billion ringgit (4.695
billion dollars) and imports by 23.1 percent to 21 billion
ringgit (4.565 billion dollars).

<P>
PERTH, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia pulled a major upset in the
opening day of the men's water polo competition by beating Olympic
silver medalist Croatia 6-4 at the world swimming championships
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Alexandre Evstigneev opened the account for Russia with an
extra-man goal after Ratko Stritof was ejected. Then Croatia hit
an equalizer through a penalty goal by Perica Bukic, the backbone
of the runner-up team in the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Bukic scored his second goal at 2:44 of the second quarter, but
Irek Zinnourov pulled it even nine seconds from half-time on the
extra after Vjekoslav Kobescak was sidelined for 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Kozlov put Russia into lead again when he scored from
long range at 6:00, and 90 seconds later Evstigneev made it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
Croatia closed the gap at 1:10 as Igor Hinic scored a left-hand
catch position goal, and Hrvoje Herceg scored an underarm shot to
level the match at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter went to Russia as Alexandre Erychov and
Dmitri Gorchkov scored one goal apiece to compete the victory.

helped 850,000 farmers provide food and clothing for themselves.
</P>

The gains came after a tough battle with a severe

Some 20,000 government cadres were sent to villages to help

<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will borrow
another 600 million U.S. dollars from overseas to help exporters,
according to the newspaper The Nation Friday.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a 500 million dollar loan from a Japanese
consortium to boost Thailand's exports, on which much hope has
been placed to get the country out of its current economic
recession.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand's central bank has also agreed to increase
its contribution to the credit facility of the Export-Import Bank,
to help alleviate the burden on commercial banks and boost export
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Last year, despite the baht's steep plunge since its float on
July 2, export performance and earnings failed to meet
expectations.
</P>
<P>
Exporters complained that they had difficulty getting loans,
because some commercial banks refused to lend to them as the banks
themselves could not maintain their capital funds at the level
required by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Others were prohibited by the high interest rates introduced
for the defense of the baht.

<HEADLINE> China's County-level Election Of People's Congress Deputies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- In Xiaoshan, a county-level
city in east China's Zhejiang Province, 910,000 people recently
voted to choose some of the 20,147 deputies to the city people's
congress.
</P>
<P>
One man, Lou Boying, said after making his choice, "The
state has given us the right to directly elect county people's
congress deputies, and we must cherish this opportunity and make
our best choice."
</P>
<P>
China started experimenting with the direct election of
deputies to the county-level people's congress in this coastal
province in 1979, when the country began its reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Kong Xiangyou, vice-chairman of the Standing Ccommittee of the
Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress, has this to say, "The many
direct elections of deputies to the county-level people's congress
have improved people's awareness of democracy, and the common
people have a deeper understanding of the people's congress at the
grass-roots level."
</P>
<P>
According to provincial people's congress officials, about 90
percent of the candidates are chosen by a group of ten or more
common people, and government organizations submit the other 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
"This year's direct elections had a high rate of joint choices
by voters," said Zhao Yongqian, chairman of the Xiaoshan City
People's Congress.

According to Chinese laws, candidates whose names are submitted
by ordinary folk have the same rights as those submitted by

</P>
<P>
"Initial candidates from county constituencies enthusiastically
participated in the election campaign," said Wang Jianrong,
vice-chairman of the Tongxiang City People's Congress, "and final
candidates even came from a primary in Wutong Township."
</P>
<P>
In addition to polling stations, there were many mobile ballot
boxes to get ballots from various families. In Tongxiang City,
2,470 mobile ballot boxes collected more than 20 percent of the
ballots.
</P>
<P>
Voters favor elections now more than 18 years ago, and as many
as 80 percent of the people vote, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China is gradually standardizing the election process,
according to Zhong Xuequan of the NPC Standing Committee's General
Office.
</P>
<P>
The election of county-level people's congress deputies is the
first since the revision of the country's election law in 1995.
The deputies serve for five years.
</P>
<P>
By the first half of next year, the national, provincial, city

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Plans to Build Giant Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest power station
will be built on the Sengwa coal fields in Gokwe, north Zimbabwe
at a cost of a staggering 27.75 billion Zimbabwe Dollars or 1.63
billion U.S. Dollars, ''the Herald'' paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project will be the country's single largest investment
since independence in 1980 and is expected to come on stream in
six years.
</P>
<P>
This follows the awarding by the government of exclusive
negotiating rights for the proposed giant power station to three
interested parties: Britain's National Power, Rio Tinto Zimbabwe
and the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport and Energy Enos Chikowore said yesterday
that the multi-billion-Dollar project would see the development
of a coal mine by Rio Tinto at Sengwa in the Zambezi valley near
Lake Kariba to fuel the power station.
</P>
<P>
The station itself would have an installed capacity of 1,400
megawatts, enough to supply 1.4 billion units of energy in an
hour.
</P>
<P>
The new station should be able to supply about a third of the
country's anticipated requirements at the time and just over half
of the current demand.
</P>
<P>
The thermal power station would be built in such a way as to
minimize environmental degradation through pollution and in line
with environmental standards acceptable to the government, World
Bank, and the policies of both Rio Tinto and the British Utility.

The first phase is to cover the lower reaches of the channel
under tenders starting in the first two weeks in December last
year, he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Build More Housing for University Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
announced here today that the country will construct more
apartments for university teachers.
</P>
<P>
Ji Baocheng, director of the commission's Planning Department,
said the housing difficulty for teachers has been eased in rural
schools and urban primary and high schools. University teachers,
especially young and middle-aged professors, are facing severe
problems, however, Ji said.
</P>
<P>
China has a time-honored tradition of respecting teachers and
scholars, which broke down during the "Cultural Revolution"
(1966-76). The government's new strategy of invigorating the
country by means of science and education has given priority to
the development of the educational sector.
</P>
<P>
Building apartments for teachers is a primary consideration,
according to the government policy.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991-96 period, China spent 48 billion yuan (6 billion
U.S. dollars) building 84 million square meters of housing for
teachers. But the floor space shared by a university teacher is
less than eight square meters shared by urban citizens on
average.
</P>
<P>
Ji said that both central and local governments will allocate
more funds this year to build apartments for teachers, and a
market economy will be introduced to push the housing reform in
universities. Old apartment buildings also will be renovated for
use by teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
A high-profile conference will be held soon to discuss detailed
measures, Ji said.
</P>
<P>
Housing has been an age-old problem in China as a result of
indifference toward teachers' jobs. The government has been
pursuing a policy of asking people to respect teachers, Ji said,
and economic development has laid a solid foundation for
constructing more apartment buildings.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Sweden Give S. Africa Arms Deal Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Sweden have
given South Africa a six-month deadline to take a decision on
national arms procurement, or risk losing more than four billion
U.S. Dollars in counter-trade over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to "The Star" newspaper today, the ultimatum, which
expires on July 31, was given Thursday, one day after South
Africa's Defense Department said there would be a delay in
deciding on a 2.04-billion-Dollar arms deal because further
information was needed on particular products being offered.
</P>
<P>
The South African parliament approved a plan to re-equip the
National Defense Force, giving the green light to the purchase of
corvettes, submarines, jet aircraft, helicopters and main battle
tanks.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Sweden are offering 48 Gripen jet fighters and
trainers manufactured by a joint venture between British
Aerospace and Saab Aerospace, while the British have also offered
independently the Hawk New Generation jet trainers.
</P>
<P>
British Aerospace representative in South Africa, Allan
MacDonald, warned that a delay in the decision would not only

losses, changed investment plans and the loss of socio-economic
opportunities.

Saab President Bengt Halse said Swedish interests alone were
prepared to immediately invest 122 million Dollars in various
industrial participation ventures, which would include
socio-economic projects such as education.
</P>
<P>
Reports said six countries including Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy and Spain were short-listed by the South African

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Beat Legacy of Poor Matric Result: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Education
Minister Sibusiso Bengu has expressed disappointment with the
1997 matriculation results, and vowed to take decisive measures
to get national education improved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town Thursday, Bengu said no
single factor could be blamed for poor performances by schools,
teachers, or pupils - but it was important to draw attention to
some of these factors.
</P>
<P>
He said many of the matric candidates were poorly prepared for
the examinations and at some schools no learning or teaching took
place at all last year.
</P>
<P>
As long as this went on, there was little doubt that many
pupils would continue to fail and this could not be allowed to
happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
On school management, Bengu said schools should fire teachers
who failed to show commitment to improving the success rate,
stressing that teachers had to pull up their socks or be fired.
</P>
<P>
South Africa could not afford to pay salaries to teachers not
committed to teaching and who did not achieve what was expected
of them, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Bengu made assurance last year that national matric result
would not worsen from the 54.7 percent past rate of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, last year's national pass rate was 47.1 percent, with
provincial declines ranging from 19.6 percentage points in North
West Province to 1.7 percentage points in Mpumalanga Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Democratic Party
of Kenya (DP) will take up its seats in the Eighth Parliament but
will not cooperate with the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU), the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted DP Secretary General Joseph Munyao as saying
Thursday that his party was prepared to take up its role as the
Official Opposition in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
DP has got 39 elected members of parliament (MPs) and two
nominated MPs, making a total of 41 out of 222 MPs in Parliament
and gaining the status of the Official Opposition in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"As the Official Opposition party in Parliament, we shall
maintain a democratic crusade without being blackmailed by the
'black sheep' among us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Munyao noted that DP was determined to push for comprehensive
legal and administrative reforms to pave way for free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party maintained that its presidential
candidate, Mwai Kibaki, who got 1.9 million votes to President
Daniel arap Moi's 2.4 million votes, won the race but was denied
victory due to rigging by KANU.
</P>
<P>
The party official pointed out that a team of six lawyers was
collecting evidence to challenge President Moi's re-election in
court.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition National Development Party, Ford-Kenya, Safina
and religious groups which observered the elections have accepted
the outcome of the just-concluded General Election.
</P>
<P>
Another main opposition Social Democratic Party whose
presidential candidate is Charity Ngilu yesterday accepted the

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Plans to Set Up 3 More EPZs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to set up three more export processing zones (EPZs) in
the country to meet the increasing demand from domestic and
foreign investors, the national news agency BSS reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new EPZs will be located respectively at Gazipur, 30
kilometers north of here, and Lamonirhat and Sirajganaj, 270 and
113 kilometers northwest of here, BSS quoted Moazzem Hossain Khan,
executive chairman of the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone
Authority, as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the three EPZs will begin after the development
work on the Comilla and Ishurdi EPZs, which are 140 kilometers
northwest and 90 kilometers southeast of here, is completed, the
chairman said. Work on the Comilla and Ishurdi zones is scheduled
to start in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said both local and foreign investors are showing
keen interest in making investment in the three newly planned
zones.
</P>
<P>
The existing two EPZs in Chittagong and Dhaka are unable to
cope with the increasing demand from investors, as 76 and 29
industrial units are already in operation and 56 and 43 others are
under implementation there.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Ask U.S. to Return Money for Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan has said Pakistan will go to court in the United
States in the next few weeks to get back 656 million U.S. dollars
it had paid for 28 undelivered F-16 fighters.
</P>
<P>
All preparations in this regard have been made, the foreign
minister was quoted Friday by the leading English daily The Nation
as saying. "We have got the approval of the competent authority
(prime minister) to go to the American courts."
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan told the paper on Thursday that "we will hire best
lawyers because 656 million dollars are stuck up."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said all papers and legal work for filing
a suit against the U.S. administration have been prepared by
Pakistan's legal experts.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the F-16s was stopped by the U.S.
administration in the early 1990s after the enforcement of the
Pressler Amendment, which restrained the administration from
providing military hardware to Pakistan, alleging that the country
was implementing a nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan said Pakistan was reluctant to go to court as U.S.
President Bill Clinton had been scheduled to visit Pakistan in
February or March and Pakistan was expecting something from
Clinton in this regard. However, Clinton's planned visit has now
been delayed.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan also said that even if the U.S. administration agrees
to return the money, it will have to seek congress appropriation
which is an uphill task.
</P>
<P>
In this situation the only option for Pakistan is to go to
court to get back the money, said the foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Cleaner Drinking Water for Shanghai Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The second phase water
diversion project from the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, the
biggest river flowing across the city, has been completed,
bringing cleaner drinking water to the city's residents.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based "China Environmental News" reported that the
project can supply the city with five million cubic meters of
water each day.
</P>
<P>
All the city's water plants are diverting water from the upper
reaches of the Huangpu River, besides the Yangtze River, after the
completion of the water diversion project, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the municipality's drinking-water improvement
project that began in July 1994, that is expected to cost three
billion yuan, with the help of 110 million US dollars in World
Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The Huangpu River is the city's No.1 water resource.
</P>
<P>
The decline in water quality standard in the lower reaches of
the Huangpu River has been a major scourge for local residents and
industrial and agricultural production. So, in recent years,
Shanghai has adopted a series of measures to improve its
environment, including a number of waste water treatment
projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese central government
is supportive of the policy announcement Thursday by the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government regarding the
termination of Hong Kong as the "port of first asylum." A decision
on the policy will be made through legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang said that the
policy of the HKSAR government on the proposed termination of Hong
Kong as the "port of first asylum" is in the interests of
maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the policy, Shen said, an early and thorough
settlement is expected of the question of the Vietnamese boat
people and refugees remaining in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The policy should be beneficial to preventing an influx of
illegal Vietnamese immigrants into Hong Kong, Shen said, which
serves the interests of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the Chinese central government will always support
the positive efforts made by the HKSAR government in resolving the
question of Vietnamese boat people and refugees remaining in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Shen said, "We also hope that the countries
and international organizations concerned will effectively perform
their duties in resettling and repatriating the Vietnamese boat
people and refugees still remaining in Hong Kong." This would put
an early end to the refugee problem that has plagued Hong Kong for
a long time.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Confident of Moderate Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Friday expressed his confidence that moderate
economic recovery at an acceptable level could be attained within
six to 12 months provided Malaysians show full confidence in the
ringgit and the local stock market.
</P>
<P>
"If we have the confidence and don't resort to, say for
instance, converting ringgit into U.S. dollars or other foreign
currencies, then recovery will be easy because we ourselves don't
contribute to the depreciation of our own currency," he said when
appearing as guest on TV3's morning talk show "Malaysia Today"
which discussed consumers and the economy.
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute program, the prime minister responded to
various questions sent by e-mail or facsimile from viewers who
wanted to know when the current economic turmoil would end.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that it would be impossible to see the economy
revitalized to its former strength as before the ringgit started
weakening last July, Mahathir said he was confident moderate
recovery at an acceptable level could be attained if the people
adopt specific measures.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysians should have confidence in local banks
and save more in local banks and financial institutions to help
shore up national reserves.
</P>
<P>
"If we all do that, I'm confident we'll recover, not to our
original level, but to a moderately sufficient level, perhaps
within six months or a year," he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question whether Malaysia would eventually turn to the IMF
for help, he said if "we receive IMF aid, we would not be able to
control our economy and would throw it open to foreign domination
whereby they would come in and buy our banks and companies at
cheap prices," which would then amount to "economic colonialism".
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia has adequate foreign reserves to finance
its requirements and sustain growth amid the current economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the measures to build up reserves include
increasing exports, cutting imports where necessary and buying the
ringgit.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to have more faith in the country's
economic resilience, saying the fact that Malaysia had not asked
for financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
showed that the economy was stable.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said a further positive indication of the economy was
that Malaysia's debts were not large.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the State Bank Wednesday, the
country's total foreign debt (short, medium-term and long-term)
was 45.2 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 42 percent of
Malaysia's gross domestic product, and out of the total debt, the
short-term debt accounted for only 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Farm Labour Demand Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's need for farm labourers
will increase until the year 2000 due to a lack of modern
agricultural technology, Vietnam's English language daily the
"Vietnam News" quoted officials as saying in its Friday edition.
</P>
<P>
With an annual growth rate of 10 percent estimated for the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during the 1996 to 2000 period, the
demand for an industrialized workforce may rise slightly in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural sector, which currently accounts for 70
percent of the population, will continue to be labour intensive,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Vietnam is expected to have more than 47.7
million people of working age. Of these, 44.6 million will be
employed full-time, with about 3.1 million people jobless.
</P>
<P>
The pool of working age people includes 1.7 million students
and 2.3 million housewives.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese labour authorities have called for more investment
to develop infrastructure in an effort to attract labour intensive
industries that will concentrate on agricultural production in the
slowly developing areas.

the possibility of direct investment in this market," he said.

CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced Friday it

country's official aid agency AusAID's humanitarian relief
program, will provide food, mosquito nets, firewood, blankets and

He said the relief program will be implemented in partnership

<HEADLINE> Ice Storm Forces Ottawa to Declare State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A prolonged ice storm forced
Canada's national capital region of Ottawa to declare a state of
emergency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The freezing rain, coupled with strong wind, has brought havocs to
the region, where falling ice-coated tree branches littered roads and
cut numerous power lines.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of homes have been hit with power failures since Tuesday,
which seriously disrupted people's life in a country that nearly
everything from garage doors to stoves are operated with electricity.
</P>
<P>
The community where Xinhua correspondents live have been coping
without electricity on Tuesday and again on Thursday. Power has
yet to be restored here at press time.
</P>
<P>
Across the region, more than 20 relief centers have opened by
Thursday afternoon, where people can have access to shelter, soup,
food and warm sleep.
</P>
<P>
"The state of emergency is to recognize the seriousness of the
situation," said Regional Chair Bob Chiarelli.
</P>
<P>
All schools are closed today and tomorrow. The government
is asking people to avoid going out as much as possible. Large
companies and government departments encouraged its employees to
stay at home.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents were reported in and outside this city, and
some artery highways have been closed to traffic.
</P>
<P>
East of the Ottawa River, the situation in Quebec province is
even worse. By Thursday evening, two million people in Quebec have
been rendered without electricity.
</P>
<P>
Though Quebec Hydro tried its best to restore power to
customers, the task has proved too tough for thousands of its
workers, who worked 16 hours a day in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Local forecast said there will still be icy rain in eastern
Ontario and Quebec province on Saturday. But things will improve
Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Inspection of Boeing 737s for Missing Units Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Thursday ordered airlines to inspect Boeing
737s to check hinge fasteners that discovered missing from a jet
that crashed in Indonesia last month.
</P>
<P>
The FAA requires a visual inspection of the horizontal
stabilizers on Boeing 737s in the 300-, 400- and 500-series
models. The inspection will involve more than 200 planes.
</P>
<P>
It asked airlines to look for missing fasteners and check that
all bolts connecting hinges are secured properly and report to it
the results within five days.
</P>
<P>
The order was made after a preliminary investigation into the
crash of a Singapore-owned SilkAir Boeing 737 on December 19. The
plane crashed onto the island of Sumatra during a flight from
Jakarta to Singapore, killing all 104 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said 26 fasteners on the plane's horizontal stabilizer
were missing.
</P>
<P>
But it said there was no evidence linking the missing or loose
fasteners to the cause of the accident.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Drop Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis and
the slide of the Australian dollar meant confusion and uncertainty
were the dominant features of this week's resumption of wool
sales, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Confusion and uncertainty, not surprisingly, marked the
resumption of auction sales in Melbourne and Fremantle this week,
and prices were affected accordingly," ACWE said in its weekly
market statement.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator fell 15 Australian cents from its
pre-Christmas level to close the week at 683 Australian cents a
kilogram clean with the western market indicator dropping 11
Australian cents to finish at 633 Australian cents a kilogram
clean.
</P>
<P>
The new AWEX national price indicator ended the week at 717
Australian cents a kilogram clean, reflecting a decrease of 13
Australian cents.
</P>
<P>
Falls of 12 Australian cents and 25 Australian cents occurred
in the southern and western price indicators which ended in levels
of 707 Australian cents and 685 Australian cents a kilogram clean
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The market commenced on a very tentative note with buyers not
knowing how the continuing economic and currency crises in Asia
would affect market confidence and demand overall," ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said the drop in the Australian dollar was positive but
had a downside because there was uncertainty about when stability
would return.
</P>
<P>
"The strengthening of the Australian dollar towards the end of
this week's selling probably contributed to the wool market
stabilizing on Thursday." ACWE said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Reserves Stand at 21.4 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Bank Indonesia
(central bank) Soedradjad Djiwandono said the government currently
has gross foreign assets of 21.4 billion US dollars and it would
continue efforts to stem the rupiah's fall.
</P>
<P>
"The president (Soeharto) is closely watching the latest
developments. The government will continue efforts to overcome the
rupiah's fall. I hope this thing well pass quickly," Djiwandono
said here Thursday night after meeting with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is persuading Indonesian exporters to
convert their dollars into the rupiah in order to ease the current
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah hit a record low of 11,000 against the US dollar in
late trading Thursday. The rupiah has lost about 300 percent of
its value against the greenback since early July last year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said he was convinced the rupiah's
weakness was temporary and it will recover to more realistic
levels speedily.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall in the rupiah was caused more by market
sentiment rather than the country's economic fundamentals, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, local dealers attributed the drop of the rupiah to the
worsening of public confidence in the economy and the
International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) disappointment over the
government's programs in coping with the monetary crisis.

<HEADLINE> Currency Turmoil Too Much for Thai Economy: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's banker of the year
1997 said that the ongoing currency turmoil has inflicted such
rapid deterioration on the Thai economy that he doubts Thailand
alone has the power to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Chulakorn Singhakhowin, 48, who won the honor for transforming
a sick, owner-managed Bank of Asia into a healthy and profitable
professionally-managed financial institution, said no economy
could sustain the extreme currency swings such as those which the
baht is experiencing.
</P>
<P>
The baht has lost more than 100 percent of its value against
the US dollar in six months' time since its float.
</P>
<P>
Chulakorn, who has been president of Bank of Asia for five
years, said in an interview with the Nation published Friday that
with the baht's unabated rapid degeneration, corporate
bankruptcies and financial institutions' non-performing loans will
skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
He believed that if the speed and depth of the current economic
deterioration continue at the same rate throughout Asia and does
not stop, even the now-strong western economies will soon be badly
affected.
</P>
<P>
He said even though the 17.2 billion US dollar bailout program
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been partially
implemented, confidence has not been restored, because no one is
sure whether the IMF's bitter medicine is the right prescription.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that if the baht's depreciation continues at its
current rate, the country will soon be thrust into an unmanageable
situation. "It will ruin most businesses in Thailand, unemployment
will reach unprecedented levels, and it could change society
overnight."
</P>
<P>
He is confident that the Thai economy will return healthy, but
said, "it is an international problem now."

<HEADLINE> U.S. State Considers Limiting Toxin Chemicals in Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 8 (Xinhua) -- While there is virtually no
regulation of fertilizer in the United States, Washington state
may soon be the first state to limit toxin chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The governor of Washington, Gary Locke, has proposed limiting
levels of lead, arsenic, cadmium and six other heavy metals and
requiring they be listed on fertilizer ingredient labels, local
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Locke's proposal, based on Canada's standards, is believed far
more comprehensive than other states that are considering new
rules or laws.
</P>
<P>
No research has proven consuming crops grown with
industrial-waste fertilizers are dangerous or safe to human
health. But a recent analysis of fertilizers made of industrial
waste revealed a high level of dioxin, a colorless and odorless
compound produced in the process such as waste incineration, steel
production, pulp and paper manufacturing and oil refining.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin is a prime suspect in cancers and reproductive
problems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said that
dioxin pollution is a threat to the general public.
</P>
<P>
Locke's bill would increase fertilizer testing, boost penalties
for violations and set aside money for a three-year study of the
pathway of heavy metals from factories to fertilizers to food.
</P>
<P>
It would also require a label on all commercial fertilizers
showing the list of the nine heavy metals and a statement that the
product meets the standards.

<HEADLINE> Croatian President Stresses Cooperation with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Croatia seeks to develop a
partnership and closer economic cooperation with the United
States, said Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman, during the
reception of William Montgomery, the new U.S. ambassador to
Croatia, at the presidential palace Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed that Croatia puts great importance
on developing "very friendly" relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Croatia is very interested in establishing a mutually
beneficial cooperative partnership between the two countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman expressed satisfaction over military cooperation
between Croatia and the U.S., and said it is now time to boost our
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Croatia should also work to improve democracy and economy at
home and to take part in world affairs after the transitional
period of establishing independence and democracy, Tudjman said.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. ambassador stressed the need for Croatia to play a
role in ensuring a stable peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Croatia is critical to the implementation of the 1995 Dayton
agreement and the establishment of long-term peace and stability
in the region, Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expressed the hope that the two countries would
become active partners. He said the U.S. would back Croatia in its
efforts to play a more active part in Europe and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Before Croatia can fully participate in the process of
integrating with Europe, he said, it should give up its autocratic
rule and ensure full democracy. It should also work to establish a
competitive world market economy.
</P>
<P>
Croatia should also fully implement the Dayton Peace Accords
and the 1995 Erdut Peace Accords under which Eastern Slavonia, the
last Serb-held part of Croatia, is to be reintegrated with Croatia
this January, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said he wants to see national
reconciliation and good relationships with neighboring countries
achieved in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Montgomery once served as ambassador to Bulgaria. He was a
presidential advisor on the implementation of the Dayton Peace
Accords before his recent appointment.

<HEADLINE> Political Pact Passed for Combating Crimes in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Five Albanian parties in the
ruling coalition signed a political pact Thursday that empowers
the country's law enforcement agencies to combat organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The pact, signed by the Socialist Party of Albania, the Social
Democratic Party, the Union for Human Rights Party, the Agrarian
Party and the Democratic Alliance Party, also calls for the
surrender of arms by the public and the establishment of a
permanent anti-Mafia committee in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The pact, the most severe warning issued by the new coalition
government since its establishment last July, threatens to charge
persons who disseminate anti-constitution and -stability
statements that incite crime or terrorism that results in crime.
</P>
<P>
The five parties called on all Albanians to take part in the
fight against organized crime and terrorist activities and urged
President Rexhep Meidani to openly support the struggle.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said
Thursday that the Nano government supports the political pact
signed by the five parties and will take all necessary steps to
strengthen the struggle against crime.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey, European Countries to Curb Kurdish Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and seven European Union
countries agreed Thursday to strengthen efforts to curb the inflow
of Kurdish immigrants via Italy's poorly checked borders and
intensify their fights against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Police chiefs and security officials from Italy, Turkey,
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and Greece came
up with the measures with a day-long meeting in Rome in response
to the recent influx of more than 1,200 Kurds into Italy.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by Italy's Interior Ministry after the
talks said the officials "defined common actions plans" with
respect to tightening the controls of immigrants at borders and
conducting incisive investigations into organized crime,
particularly with regard to trafficking suspects.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called by Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
after several European Union countries voiced their concern about
illegal immigrants entering the Schengen border-free area of
Europe via Italy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey refused to sign an eight-point declaration of intent
drawn by the police chiefs, but promised to continue to cooperate
in the fight against organized crime in illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Florence Thursday morning, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said the Italian diplomatic pressure on Turkey to
stem the flow of immigrants from its shores was starting to bear
fruit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police in the southern Italian region of Calabria
reported that 416 of the over 800 refugees arriving there from
Turkey on December 27 had applied for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has criticized Italy's willingness to offer political
asylum to Kurds, saying it will only encourage more to follow. It
also claims that Kurds are economic, rather than political
refugees.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Revenue Keeps Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial and
commercial tax revenue kept its vigorous rising momentum in 1997,
with its growth rate outstripping the increase of the national GDP.
</P>
<P>
The country collected 754.8 billion yuan (90.0 billion US
dollars) in industrial and commercial taxes last year, up 17.2
percent from the previous year, compared with the 8.8 percent GDP
growth last year, according to a report released by the State
Administration of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
This rise was the largest ever, and last year was the fifth
consecutive year that China's industrial and commercial tax
revenue recorded eye-catching growth, said Xiang Huaicheng, deputy
director of the State Administration of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the tax reform and its continuing improvement,
China's taxation has made much progress with the tax revenues of
both the central and local governments growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Taxes collected for the central government grew 19.3 percent to
426.1 billion yuan in 1997. That part of the tax levy accounted
for 56.5 percent of the overall industrial and commercial tax
revenue, rising 0.9 of a percentage point from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The local governments' tax collection last year amounted to
328.7 billion yuan, an increase of 14.6 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
To support the reforms and opening-up policy as well as
economic growth, China will reinforce the taxation management this
year and try to promote the tax collection in tandem with the GDP
growth.
</P>
<P>
China has set its 1998 industrial and commercial tax revenue
target at about 832.5 billion yuan, up 11 percent over 1997's
figure.

<HEADLINE> Thai Diplomats Told to Slash Housing Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Foreign Ministry has
asked Thai diplomats overseas to trim housing budgets by 30
percent or find the cash themselves.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Permanent Secretary Saroj Chavanaviraj quoted
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai as saying that the government could
not afford what was being spent due to economy slowdown, local
press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has 619 diplomats overseas.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram recently circulated to Thai embassies, Saroj made
it clear that the plea for savings applied across the board.
</P>
<P>
It included spending on water, electricity, and other basic
expenses.
</P>
<P>
According to Saroj, the Thai Foreign Ministry was the worst
affected by the flotation of the baht in July, effectively losing
1,200 million baht from its 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
The ministry might this year recall 84 diplomats whose terms
are due to end in 1999 if the economy does not improve, a source
at the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already decided not to replace 73 diplomats
whose terms expire this year.

<HEADLINE> Disputes Between Romanian Coalition Partner Deepen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea said Thursday he would not consider leading a minority
government and did not believe the Democratic Party would quit the
government because one of its ministers was sacked.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea made the remarks at a press conference in his National
Peasants' Party headquarters. Jan Diaconescu, the head of the
National Peasants' Party, said the situation would not get worse.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Petre Roman, the head of the Democratic Party,
accused Ciorbea of violating the agreement between the three-party
coalition and treating his partner unfairly.
</P>
<P>
He said it would depend on them whether the ruling coalition
would continue or not. The Democratic Party must make a choice
between leaving the coalition or being a equal partner, he added.
</P>
<P>
The disputes between the co-ruling National Peasants' Party and
the Democratic Party escalated after former Transport Minister
Traian Basescu was dismissed on December 29 and Prime Minister
Ciorbea Wednesday rejected calls by Roman's party to reinstate
Basescu.
</P>
<P>
Basescu, known for speaking frankly, criticized the government
for not having enough "strength to make important decisions" and
the "useless 18-hour long sessions" of Ciorbea's cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Set Up 2 Fishing Harbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to set up two
fishing harbors at a cost of 263 million Rupees (4.38 million U.S.
dollars) in the coming years, a senior government official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Rajapakse said
the harbor at Hikkaduwa in the deep south will be completed in two
years at a cost of 72 million Rupees (1.2 million dollars) while
another one at Moratuwa-Panadura near Colombo will be completed in
one and a half years with an investment of 191 million Rupees
(3.18 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The projects are expected to boost fish production, increase
fishermen's earnings and strengthen the institutions that support
and provide service to the fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
The minister said feasibility studies are being conducted to
determine locations for more harbors.
</P>
<P>
He said in addition to the construction of harbors, attention
will also be given to the development of infrastructure, such as
electricity, drinking water, roads and health and education
facilities, in the fishing villages and coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bourses Drop Heavily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian stock market
crashed to a heavy drop Thursday following a historic low of the
rupiah (national currency), brokers here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was traded at 11,000 per US dollar here Thursday, a
22 percent decline in a single day. The currency has lost about
300 percent of its value against the greenback since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite price index fell 47.131
points from 394.239 to 347.108 points, a decrease of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The index of all individual sectors also dropped to a low
position. The biggest fall occurred at agricultural sector which
lost to 39 points.
</P>
<P>
Brokers attributed the drop of the stock market to investors'
confidence in the Indonesian economy. Investors were worried that
the steep drop in the rupiah would further worsen the already
ailing performance of most locally listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the fall of the rupiah to the worsening of
public confidence in the economy and the International Monetary
Fund's (IMF's) disappointment over the government's programs in
coping with the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Indonesia agreed on an IMF-led bailout of
over 30 billion dollars and committed to conduct a series of
reforms in the country in a bid to overcome the monetary crisis.

<HEADLINE> Panic Buying Hits Jakarta, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Panic buying hit stores across
Indonesia's capital city of Jakarta Thursday after a dramatic fall
in the value of the national currency and many people were worried
about a possible price hike in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Long queues were seen at most supermarkets with basic
foodstuffs such as rice and instant noodles vanishing from
shelves.
</P>
<P>
"Poorer people were digging into their pockets to buy half a
dozen tins of sardines," local press Friday quoted one shopper who
joined the rush as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Some people were buying ridiculous things like bottle water,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Cars were backed up to the main road and beyond for around 500
meters as people tried to get near the stores," said one shopper.
</P>
<P>
Reports from provinces said similar rushes were experienced in
many parts of the country. Basics such as rice, sugar and cooking
oil disappeared off supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy has been spiraling downward since July last
year, with consumer prices and unemployment rising steadily.
</P>
<P>
But the public reaction to Thursday's free fall by the
Indonesian rupiah was the first sign that people were seriously
worried.
</P>
<P>
Rupiah tumbled in value by more than 22 percent Thursday,
hitting a record low of 11,000 to the US dollar at the end of the
day's trading. The rupiah has lost about 300 percent of its value
against the greenback since last July.
</P>
<P>
Head of National Logistics Agency (Bulog) Beddu Amang issued a
statement last night that there was no need for concern since
stocks were adequate and that there would be no price rises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military authorities called for calm as some shops
closed after selling out.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to prevent riots and looting, the City Police
dispatched thousands of officers, including undercover personnel,
to safeguard supermarkets and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
According to City Police Chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata, the city
was safe. He said all rumors of riots and chaos were untrue.

PANAMA CITY, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States reverted
its Quarry Heights military base to Panama on Thursday, which used
to be the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador William Hughes handed over the keys of the
military complex to Panamanian Foreign Minister Ricardo Alberto
Arias and to the Regional Interoceanic Authority (ARI) General
Administrator Nicolas Ardito Barletta.
</P>
<P>
The 27-hectare U.S. military base, located along the Panama
Canal, was built in 1914 for the operations of the U.S. Southern
Command in Latin America. The U.S. Southern Command was moved to
Miami in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The handover of the Quarry Heights was a result of the
Torrijos-Carter treaty signed in 1977, which stipulated the return
of the Panama Canal and the delivery of the military installations
to the Central American country by December 1999.
</P>
<P>
There are 33 buildings with education installations, a barber
shop, a hotel and a restaurant in the military base which will be

CARACAS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan crude oil prices
registered the lowest quotation of the last two years, posting
13.07 dollars a barrel, said Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA)
authorities.

<P>
The restoration of Iraq's oil exports, middlemen, and the

The drop in the quotation of the Venezuelan basket of crudes

PDVSA is now considering measures to contend with the price

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia must retain the
stability of its macro-economy and carry out economic reforms, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Deputy Prime Minister Danko
Djunich as saying.
</P>
<P>
Djunich made the remark at a workshop on 1998 economic policy
held Thursday. He said the country must keep its macro-economy
stable in order to realize speedy economic growth, to increase
employment and raise the living standard.
</P>
<P>
He also said it was not enough for the country to just continue
to take the same measures on monetary and financial policy as it
did in the past to sustain the economy. The country must take
decisive steps toward reform to sustain macro-economic stability,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Djunich said Yugoslavia must realize economic integration with
Europe and the world. He added that it must do its best to
continue to receive the most-favored-nation treatment it receives
from the European Commission. For that reason, the country's large
enterprises must seek foreign partners as soon as possible, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Federal Court Rejects Montenegro Court Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Federal Court
turned down another 29 decisions by the Montenegro Republic
Constitutional Court Thursday over the disputes that occurred
during presidential elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Yugoslav Federal Court Borivoje Vukichevic told the
press that the Montenegrin court has to review their decisions
again and remove the names of disqualified voters from the
eligibility list, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Court rejected some of the Montenegrin court's
decisions Tuesday. The Montenegrin court has been accused of
illegal activities regarding decisions over voter's qualifications
before the Yugoslav Republic's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, incumbent Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who won the
second round of elections with a marginal majority last October,
opposed the Federal Court's rejection, accusing the court of
misusing its power, a local report said.
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic said the decisions of the Federal Court, which
wanted to influence the situation of the Montenegro Republic after
its presidential elections, were not legally binding, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
President of the Montenegro Republic Momir Bulatovic brought a
lawsuit against the Constitutional Court of Montenegro last
November after the court rejected his allegations that malpractice
existed in the second round of presidential elections last
October.

MADRID, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Spanish police foiled a mass
suicide planned by 32 members of a doomsday sect and arrested the

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Paris Over Blocking Waste Shipments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive body, the European Commission, today accused France of
violating EU laws by blocking imports of plastic waste from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said in a statement that it would seek legal
proceedings against Paris unless it stopped blocking shipments of
plastic waste from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Under an EU regulation passed in 1993, EU member countries are
not allowed to block waste shipments from other members if they
are on the so-called green list of relatively harmless waste,
including solid plastic.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive noted that the reasons for this move made by
Paris were more political than practical since the French
government could not justify convincingly the move.
</P>
<P>
The commission was also sending France a warning letter telling
it about its failure to comply with an EU law obliging it to
provide Brussels with data on ozone levels. Paris is four years
over the deadline.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that by doing so, the Commission showed
the importance it attached to the EU's air quality directive.
</P>
<P>
However, the Commission said that it was ending legal
proceedings against France for failing to give special protection
to the Loire estuary, a key area for many wild birds.
</P>
<P>
Paris promised to take action to protect the area, meaning that
projects for new infrastructure there would be assessed for their
environmental impact.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Travel to Africa in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton might
travel to Africa as early as March, which would be the beginning
of a series of foreign trips this year, U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's advisers would be looking at a range of possible
dates for the African travel and one of them was March, but no
decision had been made, they said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has paid more attention to the continent
since the end of the Cold War. Two secretaries of state -- Warren
Christopher in 1996 and Madeleine Albright in 1997 -- have
traveled there, trying to make closer ties between the United
States and African nations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton originally planned to start his schedule of foreign
travel in February by visiting India and Pakistan, but was forced
to postpone because of political turmoil in the two countries.
Advisers are now looking at next fall for that trip, which might
include a stop in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In April Clinton will go to Chile for a Latin America summit
and in May he will take a trip to Britain for a summit of the
seven industrial countries plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
A trip to Russia is also not ruled out once Russia's Duma
approves an arms reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is also expected to pay an official visit to China as
well.
</P>
<P>
In November he will go to Malaysia to attend the annual APEC
summit.

<HEADLINE> European Bikers to Launch Campaign Against EU Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A European bikers' rights
organization said today that its bikers were planning to launch a
campaign Saturday to fight European Union (EU) plans to make the
scrapping of used vehicles more environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of European Motorcyclists (FEMA), which has a
total of 400,000 members, said that the campaign would be aimed at
getting motorbikes excluded from the EU's green scrapping plans.
</P>
<P>
The plans, which were proposed last July by the EU executive,
the European Commission, will oblige the automobile industry to
re-use or recycle 10 percent more of material from scrapped
vehicles by the year 2005 if adopted. The percentage now is 75.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, a total of 95 percent of the metal, plastic,
glass and other materials used in vehicles will have to be re-used
or recycled by the year of 2015.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers will be obliged to change the design of vehicles
to make the raw materials easier to recover, while final users
will have to obtain a "certificate of destruction" from a
registered dismantler to show that they have disposed of their
vehicle properly.
</P>
<P>
Though most parts of the directive will mainly concern cars,
FEMA said the so-called "certificate of destruction" would likely
end the old practice of rebuilding bikes from used parts. FEMA
called the practice "widespread and environmentally friendly."
</P>
<P>
FEMA explains that motorbikes are different from cars and
should not be treated as the same, adding that motorbikes, unlike
cars, don't reach the end of their life and its parts have to be
sold to other people for rebuilding their bikes or sold as scrap.

<HEADLINE> IMF Okays 670 Mln Dlr Payment to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved the sixth quarterly review of the
economic development and agreed to release an about 670 million
U.S. dollar loan under the Extended Fund Facility for Russia.
</P>
<P>
An IMF press statement noted that Russia's economic growth has
resumed, inflation has remained on a downward trend, and
structural reforms have gained renewed momentum. However, there is
some concern about progress in addressing the fiscal problem, in
particular low revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
The IMF welcomes the Russian government's action plan to
address the fiscal situation, which included measures to improve
tax collection, as well as to strengthen expenditure control and
define realistic spending policies. "Full implementation of this
plan will be crucial," the IMF stressed.
</P>
<P>
The institution also welcomes the fact that, following initial
delays in responding to capital outflows in the fall of 1997, the
Central Bank of Russia's tightening of monetary policy in December
helped to stabilize financial market conditions.
</P>
<P>
Confronting growing criticism of the harsh demands it has
proposed to rescue economies in Asia, the IMF is also prepared for
the next disbursement of 2 billion dollars to South Korea.

<HEADLINE> EU Supports Sending Mission to Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
expressed its support for plans to send a mission to Algeria but
has not decided on the timing, mandate or level of the
fact-finding team, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the Algerian government had not been contacted yet
and therefore it was too early to say whether the North African
country would approve such a mission or not.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government has so far rejected all foreign bids
for investigation or mediation with the Muslim rebels on whom the
recent massacres are mainly blamed, saying that they were
unacceptable interference.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the proposed mission had been discussed
by the 15 EU member countries in Brussels and would be taken up by
the European Council's political committee on January 13.
</P>
<P>
But the sources added that the EU had not decided yet on the
timing, mandate or level of the mission.
</P>
<P>
The mission would be possibly composed by representatives from
Britain, the current EU presidency country, Luxembourg, the
previous president, and Austria, which will take over the
presidency role in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 65,000 people have been killed in Algeria's
six-year-old civil war.

<HEADLINE> Cohen's Asia Trip to Stress Engagement in Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen will send a message to Asian countries during his
visit that the United States will remain engaged in the region
"now and in the future," a senior U.S. defense official said at a
Pentagon press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have profound, deep and abiding interests in Southeast
Asia," the official told reporters ahead of a January 12-22 visit
to China and six other Asian countries by Defense Secretary Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The official, asked not to be identified, said there was a
sense of vulnerability, of uncertainty in Asia because of the
recent economic crisis, and those stricken by the crisis were
hoping that the United States would be involved in helping resolve
the crisis. "That's what this trip is about," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen would emphasize the strategic and economic importance of
both Northeast and Southeast Asia during his visit to Malaysia,
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, China, Japan and South Korea, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to work closely in all avenues of our government
-- the Department of the Treasury, the White House, State and
Defense (Departments) -- on our relationship with Southeast Asian
countries and try to convey to them our commitment to stand with
them during this tie of uncertainly," he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Key US Senators Back Longer Stay of GIs in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Two key U.S. Democratic
senators back from Bosnia said today they support a continued U.S.
military presence in the region and called on Europe to bear the
peacekeeping burden for years to come.
</P>
<P>
"An outside force is going to be needed for a long period of
time, perhaps a decade or more, but we just cannot stay that
long," said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., ranking Democrat on the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
Levin and Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., predicted that Congress would
stop short of cutting off funding for the Bosnia deployment, but
would insist that President Bill Clinton inform allies that U.S.
troops will not be in Bosnia indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Levin and Reed returned today from a four-day trip to Bosnia,
where they met with top U.S. and allied commanders as well as
local officials
</P>
<P>
Last month, Clinton announced that it is a mistake to set a
deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Bosnia and decided
that the U.S. will continue to deploy troops in the country beyond
June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled Congress last year decided to cut off
funding for the U.S. troops deployed in Bosnia after the deadline
and any further funding would require Clinton to explain why to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The administration's new stance is expected to spark a major
foreign policy debate on Capitol Hill in the coming months.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The cost of the U.S. Senate
investigations over alleged abuses has averaged more than 60
million dollars a year since Republicans took control of the
chamber in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of the Senate reported that the cost of
investigations reached 188.7 million dollars through September 30,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The money goes for committee hearings to scrutinize
presidential nominees and examine the performance of federal
agencies, fulfilling the chamber's watchdog role assigned by the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
It also has been spent since 1995 on high-profile
investigations of Clinton administration controversies, most
notably on Whitewater hearings and recently concluded campaign
finance hearings.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats allege the Republicans spent the money on
partisan attacks rather than legitimate examinations.

that Clinton administration and Democratic Party officials have
nobody to blame but themselves.

<HEADLINE> State Department Reaffirms U.S. Long-standing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Thursday welcomed the latest conciliatory remarks by the Iranian
president on cultural exchanges, but again reaffirmed U.S.
long-standing policy toward Iran for any improvement of ties.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the continuation of a new tone in Iranian
statements. President (Mohammad) Khatami's extensive comments with
respect to U.S. civilization and values were interesting," State
Department James Rubin told reporters. "We also noted the
president's comments that the conduct or relations between nations
must be based on mutual respect and dignity."
</P>
<P>
President Khatami told CNN in an interview, broadcast on
Wednesday, that "nothing should prevent dialogue and understanding
between two nations, especially between their scholars and
thinkers."
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I recommend the exchange of professors, scholars,
writers, artists, journalists and tourists," the Iranian president
proposed.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States would look closely and take a
serious look at what President Khatami had said "regarding
people-to-people exchanges and the people-to-people dialogue."
</P>
<P>
But he again stressed the importance of direct talks between
the two governments as the best way to address differences.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the best way to address our bilateral differences
would be to engage in a government-to-government dialogue," he
said. "we should sit down and air differences. We would raise our
concerns; the Iranians would raise their concerns."
</P>
<P>
With regard to any improvement of relations between the two
countries, Rubin said three issues must be tackled before
considering to take steps for political ties, which severed
following the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Let me stress that changes in Iranian policies on support for
terror, the development of weapons of mass destruction, and
support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process
remain key to forging a better relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said President Bill
Clinton's foreign policy advisers will examine U.S. policy on
restricting cultural exchanges with Iran in light of positive
remarks by President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"In the aftermath of President Khatami's interview last night,
that will be examined by the president foreign policy advisers,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it is possible to lift visa restrictions for the
exchanges of scholars and artists, McCurry said it would take time
for the president's advisers to make any decisions.
</P>
<P>
"It's way too soon to speculate on what, if any action, may
result," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry welcomed Khatami's remarks, describing them as
"positive remarks about the United States."
</P>
<P>
"The president (Bill Clinton) appreciates those positive
remarks. We welcome the fact that he wants a dialogue with the
American people and between two great civilization. That can be
useful," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry also stressed the importance of direct contacts between
U.S. and Iranian governments.
</P>
<P>
"It's also important to stress that the best way for issues to
be addressed is for governments to talk directly,"
</P>
<P>
He again made clear that the United States would only look at
deeds not words.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately improvement in relations depend upon not just what
Iran says but what Iran does," he said.

<HEADLINE> Storms Lead to Heavy Damages in Central, East U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Stroms in central and east
United States in the last couple of days brought heavy damages to
houses and roads, leading to six deaths, evacuations and more than
a million people without electricity.
</P>
<P>
The emergency spillway on a small dam in Quitman, Mississippi,
failed this morning, sending a gush of floodwaters downstream and
prompting evacuations of low-lying areas in the communities of
Desoto and Shubuta, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, heavy rains across the western part of the
state forced many residents to evacuate from their homes.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a 5-year-old girl was washed away and killed by
floodwater in south of Birmingham, Alabama, and a 62-year-old
woman in Owingsville, Kentucky, drowned when she fell off a foot
bridge into a rain-swollen creek.
</P>
<P>
In Carter County, Tennessee, four people were confirmed dead
today in flooding. A police helicopter rescued 18 people from a
rooftop in the county.
</P>
<P>
The rain was companied with high wind, fog and ice. In Easley,
South Carolina, four people were treated at hospitals late
Wednesday after a tornado-strong storm destroyed several mobile
homes. In Camden of the state, storms knocked down trees and power
lines.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall in the Northeast turned to ice in many areas. By
Thursday afternoon, 185,000 customers or 35 percent of Central
Maine Power's business, were without electricity after icy buildup
and wind knocked tree limbs onto power lines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 100,000 customers lost power in upstate New York,
20,000 in New Hampshire and 10,000 in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
The storms came in an unseasonal warm weather in the central
and east regions. The warm whether this week drives people to put
off sweaters. In some areas that usually should be frozen at this
time, grass began to grow up.

</P>
<P>
Greek National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou
said in statements today that a stable drachma was "the
cornerstone of our economic policy." The government was determined
to take all the necessary measures to support it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that if necessary, he would increase
interest rates to support the exchange parity of drachma.
</P>
<P>
Greece's central bank, Bank of Greece, today intervened heavily
in the domestic interbank market to defend the drachma by reducing
liquidity and controlling a recent trend of capital outflows.

<P>
The Greek currency rebounded by 0.15 percent against the ecu
and the mark and recovered 0.10 percent against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Britain to Play Constructive Role in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said here today that Britain will play a constructive role in
European construction during its six-month European Union (EU)
presidency starting early this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with the 20
Commissioners of the EU Commission in London, Blair said that the
Labor government would seek a "strong and leading role in shaping
Europe's future."
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt at all that we will show and demonstrate to
the whole of Europe the competence and constructive approach that
should mark any successful presidency," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"In the months in which this new government has taken power in
Britain, there have been good and close relations with the
ministers and European Commissioners across a whole range of
issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, EU Commission President Jacques Santer
also expressed his optimism towards the British presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I am quite clear that Britain will do its utmost to play a
full and constructive role in making the launch of EMU (European
Monetary Union) a success," Santer said.
</P>
<P>
Santer noted that Europe also need "that same spirit of
dynamism, vigour and creativity that is once again the hallmark of
the United Kingdom today".
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say that this new positive approach the
British government is following on European issues is as
refreshing as it is highly appreciated," he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Drug, Alcohol Abuse Contribute to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Eighty percent of the adults
in U.S. prisons are locked up because of criminal activities
linked to drug and alcohol abuse, said a report from a group
urging increased spending on prison drug treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
The report by the National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse urged governments, particularly the states, to spend more
money to help 1.4 million inmates quit their habits before
returning to society.
</P>
<P>
The report said these prisoners also need job training, health
care and religious instruction.
</P>
<P>
"The most troublesome aspect of these grim statistics is that
the country is doing so little about them," James Califano,
president of the Columbia University-based center, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
At the same gathering, Barry McCaffrey, director of the White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said the government
has begun to spend more on treatment as it focused its efforts on
keeping the nation's teens and children from turning to drugs.
</P>
<P>
But McCaffrey said the federal government alone can't be the
solution.
</P>
<P>
The 281-page drugs report said the tripling of America's prison
population, from 500,000 in 1980 to 1.7 million in 1996, was due
mainly to criminal acts influenced by drugs and/or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Most of the inmates, more than 1 million, are housed in state
prisons.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1.7 million total, 1.4 million adult men and women were
incarcerated for behavior influenced by alcohol or narcotics.
Among the 1.4 million are parents of more than 2 million children,
the report said.
